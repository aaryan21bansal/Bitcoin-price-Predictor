Diner grants dying US woman's last wish,"Emily Pomeranz, 50, had happy memories of her time at Tommy's in Cleveland Heights An Ohio restaurant has made a dying woman's bittersweet last wish come true, by shipping a milkshake to her deathbed across the US. Emily Pomeranz, who was in a hospice near Washington DC with pancreatic cancer, had a hankering to taste a mocha shake from her hometown diner. She told her friend, Sam Klein, and he contacted Tommy's in Cleveland Heights to arrange the long-distance order. The drink reached her a month before before she passed away on 28 July. Mr Klein, who also grew up in the Cleveland area before moving to Washington DC, had asked his old friend during a visit to her hospice if she needed anything. ""She said with a smile, 'I wish I could have one more Tommy's mocha milkshake,'"" Mr Klein said. He said he contacted the general information email address for the restaurant. ""A few days later I got a call from Tommy Fello, the owner of Tommy's. 'Yes. We will figure out a way to do this,' is what he said,"" Mr Kleinsaid in a Facebook post.,external Mr Fellotold Cleveland's Fox 8 News,externalthat he had never dealt with an order like this one in the restaurant's 47-year history. ""I wasn't even sure if we'd be able to do it,"" he said, adding that those involved had dubbed it the milkshake mission. Mr Fello put the beverage on dry ice and paid $123 (Â£93) for overnight shipping 370 miles (600km) across the country. Mr Klein said Ms Pomeranz, 50, who died on 28 JuLY, was overjoyed to taste her favourite shake. ""I know Emily would love the fact that she's making people feel good even though she's not here with us any more,"" Mr Klein said.

No 'controlled substance' in man's throat,"Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston A man apprehended by police in an east London shop did not swallow a controlled substance before he died, the police watchdog has said. Rashan Charles wasfollowed by officers in Dalston on 22 Julyand became ill after putting an object in his mouth. His death sparked a number of protests,including one which turned violent. An item removed from his airways was not a controlled substance, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has found. It did not reveal what the item was but said it was awaiting the preliminary results of a post-mortem examination, which was carried out on Monday. Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Mr Charles ""The IPCC has now received results of forensic analysis of an object that was removed from Rashan's airway by paramedics,"" a statement said. ""The object did not contain a controlled substance."" Mr Charles's family has been informed. Officers had followed the 20-year-old on foot after attempting to stop a car on Kingsland Road. CCTV showed Mr Charles entering a shop pursued by a uniformed police officer, after which there was a struggle on the floor. In the footage, he appeared to put his hand to his mouth and became ill shortly after. A force medic provided first aid at the scene but Mr Charles died later in hospital. The IPCC said it was continuing to collect and analyse evidence, including ""police body worn footage"" and other CCTV. The statement added: ""We will independently examine the circumstances of this incident, we will follow the evidence, we will consider whether there is an indication there may have been misconduct or criminality and we will seek to answer the questions that Rashan's family and the community of Hackney understandably have"".

Is the White House really a dump?,"Is the White House really a dump? Donald Trump has hit back at reports alleging he was unhappy with his new accommodation at the White House - home to US presidents in Washington DC. According toGolf.com,external, Mr Trump has explained his frequent appearances at various golf courses across America by saying to fellow players: ""That White House is a real dump."" It led Chelsea Clinton, who is more than a little familiar with the interior of the White House, totweet,external: ""Thank you to all the White House ushers, butlers, maids, chefs, florists, gardeners, plumbers, engineers & curators for all you do every day."" But Mr Trump later tweeted that thereports were ""totally untrue"",externaland blamed ""fake news"". He added: ""I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen."" Well, it certainly doesn't look like a dump in photographs released byArchitectural Digest,externalin July. But seeing as there are 132 rooms in total, are the non-pictured ones in such good nick? On the face of it, the public ones certainly look to be well maintained. The Trump tweets coming back to haunt him The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The Red Room, pictured last November Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle walking down the stairs to the Grand Foyer In his 2008 book To Serve the President, author Bradley H Patterson estimated that the White House budget includes $1.6m (Â£1.2m) for restoration and repairs each year. And it certainly would not be considered a dump to those living in the 30 million households across the US that have hazardous homes, according to a 2016 report by theCenter for American Progress.,external The White House library Those hazards include ""dilapidated structures, poor heating, damaged plumbing, gas leaks, or lead"", said the report. That means, if you take the average size of an American household, there could be almost 76 million of Mr Trump's citizens living in homes that could cause them ""significant harm"". If the current president is displeased by his new residence, it may be due to a clash of personal taste. After all, Architectural Digest described the private rooms at the White House as ""an oasis of civility and, yes, refined taste"". But how about Mr Trump's personal home? His penthouse in New York's Trump Towers certainly has a different aesthetic. Donald Trump offered a glimpse inside his New York home during an interview with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ""At one level, [the decor is] aspirational, meant to project the wealth so many citizens can only dream of,"" author Peter York wrote inPolitico,external. ""But it also has important parallels - not with Italian Renaissance or French baroque, where its flourishes come from, but with something more recent. The best aesthetic descriptor of Trump's look, I'd argue, is dictator style."" According to Mr York, who has written a book called Dictator Style,  the apartment screams, ""I am tremendously rich and unthinkably powerful"" - which is more than a little at odds with Washington's more understated style. After all, its ""neoclassical public buildings"" are supposed to ""evoke stability and trustworthiness through their restraint"", he wrote. However, Mr Trump will almost certainly have put his own mark on the White House by now, as all presidents do. Mr Trump appears to favour gold, at odds with Washington's more understated tastes We know he swapped the red curtains for gold in the Oval Office, but what has happened behind the scenes is less clear. His wife, Melania, called in decorator Tham Kannalikham earlier this year, but what she will do to the Trumps' new apartment is not clear. However, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, senior adviser to the First Lady, assured lifestyle websiteWWD,external: ""Mrs Trump has a deep appreciation for the historical aspects of the White House and with Tham's traditional design and expertise, they are focusing on a seamless integration of elegance and comfort into where the President, the First Lady, and [their son] Barron will be spending their family time and calling their home."" The last time the White House could perhaps more legitimately be called ""a dump"" was back in the late 1940s, following years of depression and the Second World War. According to historians, President Harry Truman walked into the building and found a place that was not only too small for his needs, but also had baths sinking into its floors - which not only creaked but also ""swayed,external"". The picture of the north-east corner of the White House was taken in 1950 The North Portico seen in September 2014 The repairs which began in 1948 cost $5.7m, according to several reports, and included a major extension. If you consider the annual upkeep, it gives you an idea of what a full-scale renovation would cost today. In the UK, Buckingham Palace is about to undergo a 10-year,Â£369m renovation- although it is, of course, slightly larger - with 775 rooms. JK Rowling apologises over Trump disabled boy tweets Five top tips to lose a job in 10 days Drawing by President Trump sells for nearly $30,000 The State Dining Room during the renovation Mr Trump in the same dining room in 2017 The palace's last major renovation was back in the 1950s, so potentially the problems encountered at the Queen's official residence, like ageing cables, lead pipes, wiring and boilers, could be being experienced behind the glitzy public rooms at the White House. However it seems less likely, as the latter has been undergoing updates to make the building more energy efficient since 1993. Over in France,the Palace of Versailles,externalhas been also been undergoing a major, â¬500m (Â£447m; $592m) renovation since 2003 - and there are still another three years left until it is complete. So it seems likely any major renovation would run into the tens of millions - and what with Mr Trump'smulti-billion dollar wallneeding funding, it seems unlikely it will be top of the priority list.

Planetary protection officer wanted,"Earth has natural protection - like the kind that help form aurora - but Nasa is hiring its own Nasa is seeking a new ""planetary protection officer"" tasked with defending the earth from alien life. More specifically, the job's main concern is avoiding ""biological contamination in human and robotic space exploration."" That applies both ways - to spacecraft returning to Earth and to the risk of human contamination of other planets. Along with its inspiring job title, the position comes with a hefty annual salary range of $124,406 - $187,000. Applications have been open to US citizens since July, with a closing date of mid-August. But the job advert went largely unnoticed until now, when it caught the eye and imagination of US media outlets. It is not a new idea - the original United Nations treaty on space exploration, signed in 1967, called for space-faring nations to take care about contaminants. President Nixon shares a joke with the Apollo 11 team in their quarantine pod in 1969 Among the goals of the Office of Planetary Protection are keeping other worlds ""in their natural states"" and to ""take prudent precautions to protect Earth's biosphere in case life does exist elsewhere"". The trope of unwanted alien contamination is a favourite of science fiction writers. And while the current PPO, Dr Catharine Conley, told the New York Times in 2015 that she was presented with someMen in Black-style sunglasses on her first day, she knows that humans are likely to be the bigger threat. ""If we're going to look for life on Mars, it would be really kind of lame to bring Earth life and find that instead,""she told the newspaper,external. The hefty responsibilities may explain the generous salary - but the qualifications are demanding. Aside from requiring ""advanced knowledge of planetary protection"" the right candidate needs to already have experience in ""space programmes of national significance"". That's on top of a degree in physics, engineering, or maths. And the job also requires ""secret"" security level clearance. Nasa later reassured Mr Pence that it was ""OK to touch the surface"" The often-obscure cleanliness of spacecraft has recently been in the spotlight - when US Vice-President Mike Pence decided totouch a component despite the large ""do not touch"" sign attached. But Nasa later said the surface would be cleaned before being assembled into the Orion spacecraft - it's all part of the decontamination procedure. In fact,as Time magazine points out,external, Nasa takes planetary protection so seriously it is preparing to destroy the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn so that it does not crash uncontrollably and contaminate the planet's moons - just as it did with Galileo, orbiting Jupiter, in 2003.

Burqas or bus seats?,"What do you see? A photograph showing an empty bus in Norway has been gaining worldwide attention. The picture which sparked debate was originally posted on a private Norwegian anti-immigration group's Facebook page, but has since been shared elsewhere. Johan Slattavik posted the image onFedrelandet viktigst,externalwhich translates as ""Fatherland First"" with the comment ""What do people think of this?"" The response from within the group included a range of sarcastic posts: ""I also mistook the chairs for women in burqas. Dangerous game for women in their burqas to stand still for a few seconds. They might end up in garbage/bin vans,"" said one poster. ""I thought to myself... Well those are three great kids you've got there... That's when hell broke lose,"" commented another. While a third lamented: ""Poor women. They are slaves."" Mr Slattavik, has not responded to the BBC's request for an interview, but has told theWashington Post,externalhe posted the image as he was bored and wanted to see how people would react to the photo. The image gained even more attention after it wasshared,externalby Sindre Beyer. Mr Beyer, who works for an advertising agency, spotted the photo after gaining access to the closed group: ""I went under cover for a few months and managed to join the Facebook group - it was very easy. ""When I saw this photo I saw it as an opportunity to expose this type of content and reaction,"" Mr Beyer told the BBC. ""At first I think Mr Slattavik posted the photo as a joke, but after it became public, the group was unhappy that they were being ridiculed on social media for mistaking empty bus seats for women wearing burqas."" You might also like: Why Afghan women are campaigning for their names to be heard Azadeh Namdari: Backlash over conservative Iranian television host A man dresses as his dead sister to help his grieving mum Mr Slattavik even commented on Mr Beyer's post, saying he never thought his joke ""would take off"" and claimed it showed the difference between ""legitimate immigration criticism and blind racism"". Speaking about having an insider's view of the group, Mr Beyer said: ""It was kind of disturbing. They also feature a lot of fake news stories."" As the story spread outside of the group, many took to Twitter to share their views. In Germany, one personnoted,external: ""The far-right see a threat to the nation in bus seats,"" and in Italy another saw theirony,external: ""Invasion of women in burqas but they are only bus seats"". Some even tried to lighten the mood. In Canada, a haikureads,external: ""Bloom of a bombshell: Burqas on the busy bus? Bungled brouhaha"".  While in Australia, a ""Howdy to the bus seats"" came from@HowdytotheHijab,external. However, not everyone in the closed group made the mistake and were cynical about why the photo had been posted: ""I think it was Sindre Beyer. He should have been thrown out of the group.

Plane kills two on Portuguese beach,"This video can not be played The light plane landed on the sand A man and a child have been killed after a light aircraft made an emergency landing on a beach in Portugal. Authorities said the incident took place on Sao Joao beach in Caparica, south-west of Lisbon. The National Maritime Authority said a middle-aged man and a young girl died after they were unable to avoid the plane. The plane's only two occupants were unharmed, it added. The Diario de Noticias newspaper quoted an eyewitness who said the plane had been flying at a low altitude over the beach, although he did not realise anything was wrong until other beachgoers began running. One young witness told Reuters news agency: ""I was near the water when I saw the plane. I called my parents, the plane fell on the sand and ran over two people, fatally hurting them and another was injured, I think, but I'm not sure, people were running away. ""The plane is still there, but the ambulances arrived quickly. I think maybe the fuel ran out because I find it weird that it landed on the beach."" Other reports said the victims had been sunbathing when the plane made its emergency landing. The Associated Press news agency said the girl who died had been with her parents, who were unhurt. The agency quoted witnesses from local television broadcasts. Joao Quadros, who was on the beach, tweeted photos of the aftermath, saying the plane had passed by his son by a matter of metres. There had been no noise, he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Human embryos edited to stop disease,"Pictures of the genetically modified embryos Scientists have, for the first time, successfully freed embryos of a piece of faulty DNA that causes deadly heart disease to run in families. It potentially opens the door to preventing 10,000 disorders that are passed down the generations. The US and South Korean team allowed the embryos to develop for five days before stopping the experiment. The study hints at the future of medicine, but also provokes deep questions about what is morally right. Science is going through a golden age in editing DNA thanks to a new technology called Crispr, named breakthrough of the yearin just 2015,external. Its applications in medicine are vast and include the idea of wiping out genetic faults that cause diseases from cystic fibrosis to breast cancer. US teams at Oregon Health and Science University and the Salk Institute along with the Institute for Basic Science in South Korea focused on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The disorder is common, affecting one in every 500 people, and can lead to the heart suddenly stopping beating. It is caused by an error in a single gene (an instruction in the DNA), and anyone carrying it has a 50-50 chance of passing it on to their children. In the study,described in the journal Nature,external, the genetic repair happened during conception. Sperm from a man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was injected into healthy donated eggs alongside Crispr technology to correct the defect. It did not work all the time, but 72% of embryos were free from disease-causing mutations. Dr Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a key figure in the research team, said: ""Every generation on would carry this repair because we've removed the disease-causing gene variant from that family's lineage. ""By using this technique, it's possible to reduce the burden of this heritable disease on the family and eventually the human population."" There have been multiple attempts before, including, in 2015, teams in China using Crispr-technology to correct defects that lead to blood disorders. But they could not correct every cell, so the embryo was a ""mosaic"" of healthy and diseased cells. Their approach also led to other parts of the genetic code becoming mutated. Those technical obstacles have been overcome in the latest research. However, this is not about to become routine practice. The biggest question is one of safety, and that can be answered only by far more extensive research. There are also questions about when it would be worth doing - embryos can already be screened for disease through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. However, there are about 10,000 genetic disorders that are caused by a single mutation and could, in theory, be repaired with the same technology. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute, told the BBC: ""A method of being able to avoid having affected children passing on the affected gene could be really very important for those families. ""In terms of when, definitely not yet. It's going to be quite a while before we know that it's going to be safe."" Nicole Mowbray lives with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has a defibrillator implanted in her chest in case her heart stops. But she is unsure whether she would ever consider gene editing: ""I wouldn't want to pass on something that caused my child to have a limited or painful life. ""That does come to the front of my mind when I think about having children. ""But I wouldn't want to create the 'perfect' child, I feel like my condition makes me, me."" Darren Griffin, a professor of genetics at the University of Kent, said: ""Perhaps the biggest question, and probably the one that will be debated the most, is whether we should be physically altering the genes of an IVF embryo at all. ""This is not a straightforward question... equally, the debate on how morally acceptable it is not to act when we have the technology to prevent these life-threatening diseases must also come into play."" The study has already been condemned by Dr David King, from the campaign group Human Genetics Alert, which described the research as ""irresponsible"" and a ""race for first genetically modified baby"". Dr Yalda Jamshidi, a reader in genomic medicine at St George's University of London, said: ""The study is the first to show successful and efficient correction of a disease-causing mutation in early stage human embryos with gene editing. ""Whilst we are just beginning to understand the complexity of genetic disease, gene-editing will likely become acceptable when its potential benefits, both to individuals and to the broader society, exceeds its risks."" The method does not currently fuel concerns about the extreme end of ""designer babies"" engineered to have new advantageous traits. The way Crispr is designed should lead to a new piece of engineered DNA being inserted into the genetic code. However, in a complete surprise to the researchers, this did not happen. Instead, Crispr damaged the mutated gene in the father's sperm, leading to a healthy version being copied over from the mother's egg. This means the technology, for now, works only when there is a healthy version from one of the parents. Prof Lovell-Badge added: ""The possibility of producing designer babies, which is unjustified in any case, is now even further away."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

Children rescued from Ballycastle beach,"The Coastguard said the children were wearing armbands when they entered the water Three children have been rescued from the water in Ballycastle, County Antrim, after being spotted by a member of the public. The Coastguard said the boy and two girls were paddling in a small river when they lost their footing and got swept out into the sea. The children are believed to be from Ballycastle and aged 10, 11 and 12. This video can not be played Children rescued from Ballycastle beach Nat Hunter, from Ballyvoy, was walking on the beach with his wife when he saw the children in the water. Mr Hunter told BBC News NI: ""We saw the children playing in the mouth of the river where it meets the sea. The Coastguard were called at about 20:30 BST ""But when we came back they had got caught up in the current of the river and been pushed out to sea. ""They had started to panic and get stressed out, so I went to get the buoyancy aid up on the beach and went out to them. ""I threw the ring out to the child who was furthest away, about 50m out. The children, who were playing on inflatables, were swept about 50m out to sea ""It was two little girls and a boy."" Mr Hunter was helped by another man to bring the children to safety. Nat Hunter was walking with his wife on the beach when he spotted the children in the water ""When we left the coastguard was with them and the ambulance had just arrived,"" he said. ""I think they were alright, but they are bound to have been freezing and a bit shook up."" The Coastguard said they were called by a member of the public at about 20:30 BST on Wednesday. The children are said to be cold and shaken ""The current was strong and would have taken them out,"" said a spokesperson. The children were all taken to the Causeway Hospital, but have now been discharged.

UK's first woman jumbo jet pilot retires,"Yvonne Kershaw retired after the flight from Cancun in Mexico The UK's first woman jumbo jet pilot has retired after landing at Gatwick Airport for the last time. Yvonne Kershaw, a 64-year-old grandmother from Petworth in West Sussex, landed the Virgin Atlantic flight from Cancun in Mexico. Mrs Kershaw joined the airline in 1990 and was granted command of the Boeing 747 aircraft three years later. She said it had taken passengers a few years to get used to seeing a woman coming out of the flight deck. ""I suppose normally they would expect to see a silver-haired fox flying the aeroplane in command,"" she added. ""Breaking down those barriers wasn't easy but nobody ever said it would be. ""What you need is passion about your job, determination and skill."" Mrs Kershaw landed at Gatwick Airport with co-pilot Paul Singleton Mrs Kershaw learned to fly at the age of 19 and after flying small aircraft around Europe and north Africa she gained her commercial pilot's licence and flew executive jets. When she joined Virgin Atlantic its fleet included only four 747s. ""It's such an iconic aeroplane and it's what I wanted to fly. For decades it was the largest aircraft in the world and the most loved by everybody,"" she said. Mrs Kershaw joined Virgin Atlantic in 1990 Mrs Kershaw has captained more than 2,000 flights with more than 18,000 flying hours in the jumbos. She said she was ""slightly tearful"" after landing her final flight and would miss the role ""enormously"". ""With long-haul it's not a job, it's a way of life, because you spend so much time away from home with crew. They become part of your extended family.""

'Exceptional' record shark caught,"Tail to head are Barry Took, Darryl Took, Simon Putnam and John Dines The biggest blue shark ever caught in British waters has been reeled in, smashing a 58-year-old record. John Dines, from Essex, caught the 8.8ft (2.7m) creature, which weighed 256.5lb (113kg), on board a charter boat 10 miles off Cornwall in July. Skipper Robin 'Chippy' Chapman called it ""just an insane fish"" and said it was safely released afterwards. The Shark Angling Club of Great Britain (SACGB) has verified it as a new British record. More on record shark and other Cornwall stories In a statement, the SACGB said: ""The first run stripped over 400 yards of line and with around only 50 yards left on the spool John did well to turn it. ""What followed was an hour and a half long battle during which the fish made six more long runs. It was clear from the first run that this was an exceptional fish."" The SACGB promotes catch and release fishing, and earlier this year starting registering measure and release records. To claim a British measured and released record, the shark must be caught, measured and released alive. Mr Chapman, of Bite Adventures in Penzance, said: ""The UK has taken a massive step forwards with catch and release. I take a huge amount of pride in it, in caring for the fish. ""It's about looking after a sport for generations to come."" The female fish was estimated to weigh 256.5lb (113kg) and was 8.8ft (2.7m) from its nose to the fork in its tail. It had a girth of 3.6ft (1.1m). The previous record for a blue shark was 214lb (97kg), caught off Looe, Cornwall, in 1959.

Children rescued in Mournes emergency,"This video can not be played The children had to be stretchered off the mountains after the weather deteriorated Seventeen children had to be stretchered off the Mourne Mountains after an emergency involving a group of Army cadets from England. A group of about 70 people - 10 of them adults - from the Cleveland Army Cadets Force were in the County Down mountains when the weather became treacherous. An emergency operation was launched on Wednesday morning to assist the group, which included children aged 12 to 17. The Northern Ireland Ambulance said 16 people had hypothermia. The rescue effort involved the coastguard, ambulance service, police and mountain rescue Others had minor injuries. In astatement on Facebook,external, the Cleveland Army Cadets Force said that ""all cadets have now been recovered from the mountains and accounted for"". The alarm was raised at 11:13 BST on Wednesday. Coastguard, ambulance and helicopter crews were called to the scene. Medical staff treated several of the children on the mountain. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) declared a major incident at 13:21 BST. Ten accident and emergency crews, a hazardous area response team and Mountain Rescue went to the scene. Conditions on the mountain had been very difficult The emergency team set up a base at Annalong Community Hall to treat those who were hurt. Dr Nigel Ruddell, medical director for the NIAS, said he called a major incident after it became clear that large number of teenagers were involved and several were having difficulty with the cold. ""We have been able to manage thanks to pool working by all the emergency services,"" he said. ""At this stage, there are no reports of anybody with serious or life threatening injuries. The injuries seem to be fairly minor and the young people seem in good spirits."" Dr Ruddell said conditions on the mountain had been very difficult and that the group leaders had done a good job in protecting the teenagers. Ken Johnston, chief press officer with the Ministry of Defence, Northern Ireland, said: ""We had a number of young people from England attending an Army Cadet Force camp in Northern Ireland. ""This morning they were in the Mourne Mountains when that atrocious weather swept in. A decision was taken to withdraw as the weather and rain and wind continued."" Some of those in the group are believed to be suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries He described the rescue operation as ""remarkable"". ""We are exceptionally grateful,"" he said. ""We are assessing the children, but we understand it is fairly minor injuries, ankle injuries and some cold injuries."" One of those injured is taken by stretcher from the scene The coastguard said the PSNI and ambulance service contacted them requesting assistance after receiving ""several reports that a large number of people were in difficulty after being caught out in inclement weather"". Colin McGrath, an SDLP MLA, tweeted: ""Major emergency incident in the Mournes with helicopter, coastguard, medical and ambulance responding. Some of those who were rescued were given foil blankets to keep them warm ""Please God all will be ok."" Police have advised motorists to avoid Head Road in Annalong due to a build-up of traffic.

'Exciting discovery' in cold cure search,"Scientists believe they may have made a breakthrough in the search for a cure for the common cold. Researchers say treatments could be developed based on antimicrobial peptides that occur naturally in the immune systems of humans and animals. The Edinburgh Napier University team observed how they increase the body's natural response to rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus is the main virus responsible for the common cold. The team synthesised antimicrobial peptides found in pigs and sheep, and assessed their impact on lung cells infected with rhinovirus. The peptides successfully attacked the virus, and could provide clues for developing novel treatments based on peptides found in nature. Dr Peter Barlow, associate professor of immunology and infection at the university, said: ""This is an exciting discovery and our next steps will be to modify the peptide to make it even better at killing this virus. ""This research is still in the early stages, but we will ultimately be looking to develop drug treatments that have the potential to cure the common cold."" An effective treatment for the cold could help sufferers of more serious lung conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for whom viral infections can pose a serious health risk. Dr Barlow added: ""There is no cure and no vaccine so the development of effective therapies for human rhinovirus, the main causal agent of the common cold and one of the most common causes of viral respiratory tract infections, is an urgent requirement. ""This study represents a major step towards finding a treatment."" Earlier research by Dr Barlow had underlined the potential of antimicrobial peptides in tackling the influenza A virus.

What can I buy for one Neymar?,"Brazilian footballer Neymar wants to leave his Spanish club Barcelona to move to France's Paris St-Germain - but the move is set to cost a record-breakingâ¬222mfee. At today's prices, one Neymar is worth Â£198m, or $262m, which could buy... Private jet? A bargain at just one-quarter of a Neymar One Neymar could buy three Boeing 737-700 passenger planes, which cost $82.4m each. If you wanted to upgrade to the snazzier 737-800 - the type of plane that makes up a large chunk of Ryanair's European fleet - you'd only be able to afford two, with about $65m left over for bells and whistles. Alternatively, you could exchange your Neymar for a private jet -ranging up to about $100m- and then spend the rest on the (insanely high) running costs every year. Want a luxury jet? This London shop can help Our colleagues over onthe BBC Sport live page were crunching #NeymarMaths all day, with the help of our diligent readers. Some gems from the submissions: The cost of human cloning is around Â£1.29m. Why spend Â£198,000,000 on one Neymar when you could clone 153 Neymars at that price? (Thomas from York) One Neymar could buyenough spaghetti to cover the entire city of Barcelona(Adam Wright) Or792,000,000 Freddo chocolate bars(Davo Long) A brand spanking new F-35: just 0.36 Neymars In the market for a different kind of striker? Take your pick: an F-35 Lightning, the current darling of the US Air Force, would set you back $94m, and the (no longer available) F-22 Raptor was some $150m when it stopped production. And for the more budget-conscious shopper, one Neymar could be traded for about 10 Russian SU-24s - a formidable strike force. Aroldis Chapman - a mere $21m salary Or in the US, skip the soccer, as they say, and switch to the great American pastime: baseball. You could pay for a year's play from the whole New York Yankees main team - a bargain at just $155m for the active squad, according toplayer valuation database Spotrac,external. And with the leftover cash, why not pay for the injured players, retained contracts, and minor squad, too? It will still only total $223m. The entire New England Patriots team - Super Bowl winners, 2017 - has a payroll that iseven cheaper,external, at $171,705,615. Bargain. If you have one Neymar, you would be able to match the entire economic output of one of six of the world's smaller nations. Take your pick from Tuvalu, Montserrat, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru and Palau - all have a GDP output ranging from about $33m to $258m, according to United Nations data from 2015. (or a teeny, tiny fraction of the US debt) If you were feeling philanthropic, Neymar's mammoth fee could wipe out the national debt of a small nation â¦ like Tonga ($28.3m), Fiji ($72.4m) or Vanuatu ($82m) - or, stretching a bit, even Haiti ($234m). Those countries, of course, just have low debt. They don't have the highest debt-to-GDP ratios, arguably a better sign that a nation has a debt problem. So, if you wanted to help, say, the United States with its massive debt problem, a Neymar would knock off just 0.001% of the US national debt (which isalmost $20 trillion,externalat the time of writing). Congratulations! If you save $1,000 a day, every day, you should be able to make your payment for one genuine Neymar inâ¦ 718 years. Get saving.

The man who has focused on one word for 23 years,"It's 26 years since Yugoslavia broke into pieces and the republic of Macedonia came into being. In all that time, the new country has lacked an official, internationally agreed name, because of Greece's objections to the name ""Macedonia"". And for nearly all of that time, explains Alex Marshall, one man has been working to solve the problem. Matthew Nimetz wants to make something clear - he has not spent every waking moment of the past 23 years thinking about one word: ""Macedonia"". ""I have probably thought about it more than anyone else - including in the country,"" says the 78-year-old US diplomat. ""But I have to disappoint anyone that thinks it's my full-time job."" Since 1994, Nimetz has been trying to negotiate an end to arguably the world's strangest international dispute, in which Greece is objecting to Macedonia's name and refusing to let it join either Nato or the EU until it's changed. Greece says the name ""Macedonia"" suggests that the country has territorial ambitions over Greece's own Macedonia - a province in the north of the country - and is a blatant attempt to lay claim to Greece's national heritage. It should be called something like ""Skopje"" instead, Greece argues - Skopje being Macedonia's capital city. Macedonia, by contrast, argues that you can trace its people back to the ancient kingdom of Macedon, once ruled by Alexander the Great - and that the name ""Macedonia"" is therefore the obvious choice. One upshot is that travellers entering northern Greece from the Republic of Macedonia, and those crossing the border in the opposite direction, are both greeted by roadside signs welcoming them to Macedonia. Welcome to Macedonia: The Greek version of the sign When Nimetz began his work on the dispute he was serving as US President Bill Clinton's special envoy, but since the end of 1999 he's been the personal envoy of the UN secretary-general - his task to nudge the two sides slowly towards a resolution, for a token salary of $1 per year. Macedonia got into the UN by agreeing to be called The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) for all official purposes, but this was not intended to be a permanent solution to the problem, and created a new set of difficulties. ""It makes for very awkward sentence construction,"" Nimetz says, with some understatement. Ban Ki-moon, the former UN secretary-general, once got muddled and called the country the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Yugoslavia"" by accident. ""He said to me, 'You've got to solve this problem. It's driving me crazy,'"" Nimetz says. Ban Ki-moon in Macedonia in 2012, with President George Ivanov Despite the glacial pace of negotiations, he has never seriously thought of quitting. ""Some people think it's me just sitting there thinking of adjectives to put in front of the name Macedonia - like New Macedonia, Upper Macedonia - but this issue has historical importanceâ¦ importance in terms of nation-building,"" he says. ""And it is never boring, the cast of characters dealing with it changes all the time. Think of a theatre director who does King Lear or Hamlet, but with different staging and actors. Do they get bored?"" When Nimetz first became Clinton's envoy, back in the 1990s, it looked as though the dispute could spiral out of control. Greece had been objecting to Macedonia's name since 1991, when Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia. The following year, a million Greeks - a 10th of the population - took to the streets of Thessaloniki to protest. Those protests helped bring down the country's prime minister, and his replacement, Andreas Papandreou, barred Macedonia's access to Greek ports. Macedonia was a ""real and present danger to Greece,external"", he claimed. A statue of Philip of Macedonia, Alexander the Great's father, goes up in Skopje in 2012 Nimetz has a surprising amount of understanding for the Greek fear that Macedonians could one day lay claim to Greek territory. ""I have to explain to people this Greek concern about irredentism is not just created out of thin air,"" he says. ""Within the last three generations, these sorts of threats were real to the country. This feeling that 'We're always being encircled.' In the Balkans, each country has a history of being dismembered, or having fought off their neighbours at some point."" He once explained the dispute to US senators by asking how they would feel if Mexico changed its name to The Republic of Mexico and Texas, then started publishing historic maps implying ownership of the whole south-west US. However, he has equal understanding for the Macedonians. ""When the Greeks say to them, 'Oh, you only came here in the 9th, 10th Century - you're not really from this region. You should call yourselves, at the most, New Macedonia,' well, to the people of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, that's a problem. They don't consider themselves 'new'. They consider themselves indigenous as anyone."" Thousands of migrants crossed from Greece into Macedonia in 2016 at a border crossing near Idomeni, north of Thessaloniki Despite this, Nimetz did at first think there would be a quick end to the dispute. So did leading Macedonian politicians. ""I talked about it with them and they said, 'Time is in our favour. Let's just talk a few years, let things calm down, change some people in government.' But it didn't quite work that way,"" he says. A long list of names has been suggested: everything from New Macedonia and Nova Makedonija, to Slavo-Macedonia and the Republic of Skopje. At one point, both the Upper Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Upper Macedonia were on the table. But none has yet been accepted. It may seem as though there are no more adjectives left to try - or any point trying them - but Nimetz insists disputes get solved when the timing is right. Just look at Northern Ireland or the reunification of Germany, he says. Change may occur because events make people look at an issue in a new light, or new leaders may come in with the political authority to take tough decisions. Or people may just get exhausted by never-ending debate. He is optimistic that the timing may be right for this dispute soon. This is partly due to new leadership in Macedonia - the Social Democrat Zoran Zaev became prime minister this year, breaking a long political deadlock in the country. But also because Macedonia needs to find a solution so it can get closer to its goals of joining Nato and the EU. ""Doing that would give them reassurance, legitimacy, economic opportunitiesâ¦ and a sense of permanence,"" Nimetz says. It also might ease tensions in the country between ethnic Macedonians and Albanians, who make up a quarter of the population. In 2001, such tensions brought the country to the brink of civil war. Macedonian security forces attack Albanian rebels in Gajre, north of Skopje, in March 2001 But Nimetz admits convincing voters in both countries will be difficult. Macedonian leaders have promised any agreement will go to a referendum. He thinks part of the way out is to encourage people not to see this as a question of national identity. ""One ordinary citizen in Skopje once said to me: 'When I get up in the morning and I'm shaving, I look in the mirror and say,I'm a Macedonian. Well, tomorrow, when I'm shaving, do you expect me to say,I'm a New MacedonianorI'm an Upper Macedonian?' ""I told him his concern is understandable, but it's the wrong way to look at this. We are only talking about the formulation of the name of this state for diplomatic purposes. It won't impact the average person. ""We're not negotiating identity. If we were, I'd be out of here."" He does recognise that identity is important, though - despite being ""a great believer in globalism"". ""I believe there's a tribal aspect to us as a species,"" he says, ""and it's very hard to feel comfortable in a global world, even for people like me."" In all his time working on the dispute, there has been only one moment when Nimetz united both sides. It was at an unlikely time too, when Macedonia was putting up numerous statues of Alexander the Great in its cities, and had named its main airport after him, causing outrage in Greece. Skopje's airport is named after Alexander the Great, while Thessaloniki's (above) is called ""Macedonia"" ""When that was happening, I said to a reporter from Skopje, 'I can't understand all this, because Alexander the Great was a great military leader, but he destroyed so much and killed so many people.' Well, I got hell for that - from all sides. I almost resigned."" Nimetz has just finished his latest round of meetings on the issue, meeting politicians in Skopje, and Greece's foreign minister. A solution can be achieved, he insists, but for the immediate future he is busy simply planning a holiday ""up above the Arctic Circle to a lodge where the caribou migrate"". A good chance to get away from questions about national identity and self-determination, surely? ""Well, actually,"" he says, ""Maybe not, when you think about the First Nations of Canadaâ¦"" He then starts enthusiastically explaining Canada's debate about indigenous self-government, and it quickly becomes clear that his love of such questions is the real reason he has been able to work on a dispute about just one word for the past 23 years.

Inside the sting that caught four jihadis,"Four men have been convicted of planning a major terror attack in Birmingham after being caught in an elaborate undercover operation. The trial of Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain, Mohibur Rahman and Tahir Aziz at the Old Bailey has been one of the strangest - and most vigorously contested - terrorism cases of the past decade. Friday 26 August 2016 was supposed to be just another day at the office. Vincent was the boss of Hero Couriers in Birmingham. The firm delivered delayed luggage. Its website boasted it was ""working with"" major airlines. Only it wasn't. The entire firm - everything about it - was fake. Its manager was really an undercover officer deployed by West Midlands Police's Special Projects Team. Hero Couriers' real business was catching jihadis. On this particular Friday, Vincent was waiting for his MI5 colleagues to arrive to bug a suspect's car. But the MI5 officers carrying out the banal-sounding ""technical operation"" found weapons inside the car belonging to Naweed Ali: A handgun, pipe bomb and large cleaver carved with the word ""kafir"" - unbeliever. Cleaver found in Naweed Ali's car with ""kafir"" (""unbeliever"") inscribed on the blade At the beginning of 2016, Ali had come on to the radar of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, a combined team of specialist detectives and counterparts from MI5. Ali and Khobaib Hussain were next-door neighbours in the Sparkhill area of the city. But they were already well known to investigators. The pair had previously been jailed for going to an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan and there was intelligence their mindset had not changed. Khobaib Hussain (left) and Naweed Ali had been next-door neighbours They were once more ""subjects of interest"". Behind the large red doors of Hero Couriers' office in the city centre, Vincent and his colleagues were keeping an eye on them. Hero Couriers had been in operation for up to four years. It had all the trappings of a real courier firm - vans, a corporate logo and a supposed headquarters in Hilton Hall, a stately home converted to offices, near Wolverhampton. But it was all bogus. The firm had no customers - it did no real deliveries. It existed only in order to watch suspects. ""Let us rise to be your Hero!"" the website said. ""Recruiting now!"" That was the hook that ensnared the would-be jihadists. Ali was persuaded to leave his car at Hero Couriers, the fake company set up by counter-terrorism officers Khobaib Hussain and Naweed Ali were looking for casual work. If they were duped into working for Hero, the police and MI5 would have access to their vehicles, which could then be bugged. Hussain was the first to take the bait. The 25-year-old was paid Â£100 for each of nine days' work: Four trips to Manchester, three trips to London and two trips to Luton. Ali, the next to be recruited, turned up for his first day on 26 August 2016. Vincent convinced the 29-year-old to leave his car inside the depot while he embarked on a trip to Luton. While he was out, MI5 was to bug the car. Hero Couriers had a website that boasted of its work with major airlines Except, they were running late - and Vincent wasn't happy. ""Leaving in 5 m8... they're fannyin about,"" texted ""Andy"", the undercover officer driving in the MI5 team. ""FFS,"" replied Vincent. ""Tell me about it!!!!"" said Andy. When the MI5 team arrived, the trial heard, it was to insert an audio probe into the car and then search it if there was time. No-one was expecting evidence of a crime at this point, but officers found a multi-coloured shopping bag, from the JD Sports chain, stuffed under the driver's seat. As they opened it, they saw a large meat cleaver, a gun, shotgun cartridges and an improvised explosive device (IED) made out of pipe capped at both ends. A package containing weapons was found inside Naweed Ali's car There was total shock. ""I will admit to being scared and it took some time to pull myself together and fall back on the training I had received,"" one of the anonymous MI5 officers told the trial from behind a curtain. The MI5 team evacuated but Vincent was left on his own with the weapons, waiting for the Army bomb-disposal squad to arrive. Ali eventually returned to the Florence Street lock-up at 11:25. As he parked, a detective arrested him on suspicion of terrorism. Ali said nothing. Within hours Khobaib Hussain was in custody. So were two other men, Mohibur Rahman and Tahir Aziz, both from Stoke. When Aziz was arrested, police found a large samurai-style sword placed down the side of the driver's seat of his car. Mohibur Rahman (left) and Tahir Aziz Meanwhile, the Army bomb-disposal squad was at Florence Street - and despite the scare, it was beginning to look like a job well done. Simon Hussey, the undercover police team's manager, forwarded congratulatory messages to Vincent and his colleagues: ""Absolute top-drawer job from you and the team today. Great stuff. Just left briefing and everyone chuffed. Hope you enjoy a well-deserved beer over the weekendâ¦ Yeeeeees boys class."" When other officers heard how Vincent had stayed with the pipe bomb after MI5 withdrew for their own safety, and how Andy had helped him move the weapons, the ""herograms"" flew around in text messages. All of these were disclosed at the trial. ""You've closed half of the city centre down mate - carnage ! :)"" exclaimed one. ""Haha and not a bead of sweat off u either. Cool as! What a team Vincent seriously :))"" said another. ""This is unbelievable!"" said one MI5 officer. ""Could have saved hundreds of lives. So chuffed. ""I'll be stealing none of the credit mate - imagine what those [expletive] could have done with that stuff. Beers on me when we're back."" ""If my camera worked I would send you a picture of two empty bottles of wine â¦ :)"" said Vincent to Andy. The gun turned out to be a replica - but the pipe bomb was real enough, albeit not primed for detonation. A scan revealed it contained gunpowder and that there was a shotgun cartridge at each end. Had the device been completed, it would have been capable of causing an explosion. All four suspects were charged with preparation of an act of terrorism - punishable by a life sentence. All but one of the men were already familiar with the justice system. Back in 2011, Ali and Hussain had secretly left their Birmingham homes to join an al-Qaeda training camp somewhere in Pakistan's mountains. Their dreams of becoming mujahedeen heroes became an unmitigated disaster. As their mobile batteries and network reception began to fade at the miserable camp in the mountains, they called their mums. Al-Muhajiroun: Was this the most dangerous group in Britain? An extremist in the family How are UK extremists radicalised? Their shocked and furious families found a relative in Pakistan to track down the men and bundle them on to a flight home. When they arrived, they went straight into West Midlands Police's cells. Ali and Hussain were later convicted of preparing for acts of terrorism. But when the pair got out in 2013, they had not changed. While in HMP Belmarsh, in south-east London, one of the most secure prisons in the country, they met Mohibur Rahman. He had been jailed for possessing material useful for terrorism, having been an associate of bungling bomb plotters with an incompetent plan to blow up the London Stock Exchange. Rahman would later introduce his new Birmingham friends to the fourth defendant in the Hero Couriers trial, Tahir Aziz. While he had no previous convictions, Aziz was part of the Stoke end of the banned al-Muhajiroun network - the group run by the hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Ali returned to jail twice for breaching his release licence's ban on him associating with other men deemed to be a security risk. He was finally out for good in March 2015 - and the Security Service was watching. By late spring of 2016, investigators had concluded that Ali, Hussain and Rahman needed to be prioritised. Their behaviour was odd and bore the hallmarks of men trying to avoid surveillance. On 26 May last year, Hussain met Rahman and Ali and all three went to a popular dessert cafe in the heart of Small Heath, one of Birmingham's busy Muslim areas. All three men were seen to turn off their phones and put them away. On another occasion, Hussain was observed putting his phone down under a tree some distance away from where he was sitting and talking. Police surveillance captured images of (l-r) Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain and Mohibur Rahman in Birmingham In early August the three core suspects gathered in Birmingham. Again, as they went out on a boating lake, they put their phones away. Rahman told the trial that since 2015 he had on-off contact with an MI5 officer called ""Rob"" who had made a number of attempts to recruit him as an informant. He said the Security Service was interested in Ali and Hussain and he was handed Â£200 in cash as an inducement to work for them. Ali himself had also been separately approached, without success. Rahman claimed that the repeated putting-away of phones was because he wanted to discuss this ""harassment"" with his friends. The prosecution argued this was nonsense. It was a move to prevent investigators discovering what the men were really talking about - the genesis of an attack plan that, the trial heard, was apparent from their social media. The jury heard how time and again the men had shared content about violence across the Muslim world and hatred towards the West. They praised men who had supposedly laid down their lives for Allah on foreign battlefields. Naweed Ali posted hate messages about Jews and Christians. The day after the July 2016deadly lorry attackon a crowd in the French city of Nice, Hussain urged others to be prepared for ""fully-fledged war with Europe"". Aziz, who had so far not featured in the alleged planning meetings, was posting his own comments about how undercover police should ""burn in hellfire"". The jihadists discussed fully fledged war after the Nice attack At times, the conspirators joked about their inadequate skills. Ali was likened to one of the useless extremist characters from the film Four Lions, a grim satire on jihadist terrorism. Hussain, meanwhile, told Rahman how far he would go for him. ""I will take a bullet for you in the tickle tackle bro lol."" Then on 11 August, Hussain messaged Ali and instructed him to ""Make new groupâ¦ me u n Mohib only"". The encrypted chat on the Telegram app was called The Three Musketeers Group, complete with a cartoon of the characters from the 1993 Disney film. The talk among the Musketeers turned more serious. They spoke about visions of heaven, and also the idea of washing away their guilt at having done little while others made ""sacrifices"". In mid-August last year, the three agreed on an overnight trip to Rahman's home in Stoke. He messaged the two other Musketeers to tell them not to bring their phones, but to use pay-as-you-go handsets bought on eBay. One of the men was linked to al-Muhajiroun, the group led by jailed hate preacher Anjem Choudary Hussain messaged Ali, suggesting they move to ""encryption mode"". Asked at trial why, he said it was to discuss their train tickets. Both men had cars, which were left at home. Once in Stoke, they made a call to Tahir Aziz after 01:00. The defendants said at trial it was to cancel a meeting to view his fridge. The prosecution said it was a late-night decision to include him in the plan - and make arrangements to meet the following day. Shortly afterwards, the evidence showed the Musketeers searching the web for a documentary on the foiled 2006 plot to bring down airliners with liquid bombs. The following day, all four men met in a park - but they were now being closely followed. Ali repeatedly looked around and dropped back, as if trying to spot the surveillance team. A single message from Rahman to the others, three days later - and two days before the arrest - summed up their collective state of mind, prosecutors said. ""I feel so guilty,"" he told his fellow conspirators.  ""I can't even make a sacrifice as little as my PS4 [games console]."" He shared a clip with his friends of an extremist preacher talking about the ""humiliation"" of not waging jihad. ""What are we doing, akhi [brother]? Sitting here, working, and that's it,"" he added. ""Nothing happening - we just talk. We gotta do something."" Nobody other than the defendants knows what happened next. According to the prosecution, at some point in the last days of August 2016, the choice of weapons was finalised, but probably not the target. Aziz put a sword in his car in Stoke, and Ali stashed the bag of weapons in his car in Birmingham. But nobody saw them do it. In fact, no surveillance officer ever saw the multi-coloured JD Sports bag that held the weapons. Detectives found CCTV footage of Hussain going into the sports shop - but not coming out with that particular bag. CCTV footage showed Hussain entering and leaving JD Sports Throughout the trial, Naweed Ali's defence counsel, Stephen Kamlish QC, focused on what he said was a crucial gap in evidence connecting the defendants with the weapons. And he said if there was nothing to link the men to the weapons, it was abundantly clear what had happened - the defendants had been fitted up. Vincent allegedly had ample time to plant the evidence in the car at Hero Couriers - and plenty of time after the arrests to cook his notes. Mr Kamlish repeatedly told the jury the officer's logbook appeared to have been written in a single go from one pen. Andy, who had retired between the end of the operation and the trial, messaged words of support to Vincent. ""You have power over your mind - not outside events,"" he texted. ""Realise this and you will find strength. Marcus Aurelius."" Vincent replied: ""Marcus Aâ¦ would have fed these [expletive] to the lions tho mate."" He spent almost two weeks giving evidence, an astonishing length of time. It was repeatedly interrupted as Mr Kamlish demanded more disclosure of Vincent's background and communications with others. He became increasingly irate at the accusations that he was corrupt. But when it came to the crunch, Naweed Ali declined to go into the witness box and give evidence in his own defence. The defendants in court: L-R) Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain, Mohibur Rahman and Tahir Aziz And there was a crucial piece of evidence. Inside the weapons bag was a roll of tape which had been used to attach a magazine to the replica gun. That tape was sent for a second DNA analysis during the trial and the forensic scientists found a partial match to Khobaib Hussain and another match to his sister. The roll of tape, said the prosecution, must have come from Hussain's home. The evidence was clear, they told the jury, that Hussain had played a key part in assembling the weapons. He had been on a pipe-fitting course and knew how to cap the device found in the car. This plot, known within the police as Operation Pesage, was one of the 18 would-be attacks foiled in the past four years. Like many of the others, it involved a tight-knit group of friends who were egging each other on to pick up some pretty basic weapons and see what they could do. But it took a very sophisticated operation, involving an undercover fake business and advanced DNA matching, for a jury to be convinced that Naweed Ali and his friends were not just men messing about but jihadists capable of causing real harm on the streets of Britain.

Is time up for plain vanilla flavour ice creams?,"Ice cream firms are experimenting with new flavours beyond vanilla We all love Thai curries, Japanese noodles and Indian snacks, so why not Asian-inspired desserts? With the amount of ice cream sold stalling in some markets, manufacturers are starting to experiment with exotic flavours. In late 1944, Major Hunter Reinburg, commanding officer of 122 Squadron of the American Marine Corps, had a hankering for ice cream. Not surprising perhaps, since he was posted to the sweltering, jungle-covered South Pacific island of Peleliu. So Hunter set his resourceful team of aircraft engineers to work on Operation Freeze. After some trial and error, they found that by mounting a large can filled with milk onto the underside of each wing tip of their fighter planes, attaching a stirring shaft to a wind-driven propeller, and then undertaking a training sortie at 30,000 feet, they could supply 100 servicemen with a helping of ice cream every day, whilst simultaneously provoking the Japanese to waste a few shells trying to bring them down. Hunter was, however, missing a trick. If, instead of flavouring his favourite treat with army-issue cocoa powder, he'd cast his eye around him to see what fruits and spices the South Pacific had to offer, then he really would have been ahead of his time. He could have tried lychee, coconut, cardamom, nutmeg or ginger - flavours that ice cream makers are now starting to experiment with. Matcha (green tea), lychee and rose ice cream anyone? In the 70 years since Hunter went to such lengths to satisfy his passion for frozen dairy desserts, global ice cream brands have spread their reach to almost every corner of the planet. Even in Peleliu he could now probably pick up a Cornetto from his corner store. But for many years, flavours from the big international brands remained stubbornly conservative,  dominated by chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Now though, thanks to migration, long-haul travel, and the internet, consumers are becoming more adventurous and manufacturers are taking note. Parlours have sprung up across the US offering Persian-style saffron, orange blossom, and rosewater ice cream, sprinkled with nuts and drizzled with honey; and Indian-inspired flavours such as masala chai and pineapple. Chinatown Ice Cream Factory offers red bean, toasted sesame and taro flavours At Chinatown Ice Cream Factory in New York, where they've been offering exotic ice creams for 40 years, they've noticed an uptick in interest from customers. Owner Christina Seid says there's often a queue of 20 customers waiting to try her Chinese-inspired range, which includes red bean, toasted sesame, and taro (a kind of sweet potato) ice cream. She thinks Americans are ready to embrace these flavours in a way they perhaps weren't when her parents, Chinese immigrants, first set up the shop. ""My father was the pioneer of a lot of these flavours. Back then people didn't even know what a mango or green tea was. ""Now, nothing is really weird."" She thinks red bean flavour, common in China, will eventually become mainstream in the US. In many of the world's biggest ice cream markets appetites have been flagging for traditional take-home tubs. Consumers are worrying about the sugar content and there's a lot of competition. According tomarket research firm Mintel,external, ice cream sales are stalling in some markets. As a result, firms are watching what happens in places like The Chinatown Ice Cream Factory carefully. ""Trends are born in the parlours where they can afford to take a gamble,"" says Alex Beckett, global food and drink analyst at Mintel. ""They become fashionable. Then they travel from Brooklyn to LA and Chicago, then to Sydney, London, Berlin, and eventually they will be picked up by manufacturers who will start to set the market for these more ethnic styles"" Yee Kwan Chan, who is based in the UK city of Sheffield and whose family is also Chinese, travels to far flung parts of the world in search of inspiration for her Yee Kwan line of desserts. ""I just want to create authentic flavours you'd find in Asia,"" she says. Yee Kwan Chan gets ideas for new flavours from her overseas travels Her concoctions include chocolate miso, black sesame seed, and durian - the fruit with the pungent odour often likened to sewage or something rotting - which is surprisingly popular in Asia. At Christmas she travelled to Hong Kong and is now producing egg custard tart ice cream, evoking the afternoon tea treat popular there. ""With the East Asian palate we've got sweet and we've got sour and then we have bitter: we use all our senses,"" says Ms Chan. Yee Kwan Chan believes people are now more willing to try unusual ice cream flavours With foreign travel and Asian food so popular, she's convinced that Asian-inspired flavours will be on the shop shelves in the US and Europe as a matter of course in a few years' time. But for that to happen at any scale, larger manufacturers will also need to get on board. Unilever, the world's largest producer, is open to the idea. They already make a myriad of flavours to suit local palates, including red bean Cornettos in China, a liquorice recipe for Scandinavia, and they've just launched a ""dung dung"" ice cream - based on an ""earthy"" tasting fruit - in Indonesia. Matt Close, Unilever's executive vice president of global ice cream, says they've always got an eye out for new flavours that might ""travel"". Unilever caters to local tastes with matcha (green tea) and red bean Cornettos More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: What makes this Kate Spade bag unusual? Where's hot? This summer's most popular holiday spots The lucrative world of 'the super tutor' Read more global trade series here. This year in India, the world's fastest growing ice cream market, they launched a kulfi ice cream, made with condensed milk and flavoured with rose water so it tastes a little like Turkish Delight. ""I'm absolutely convinced kulfi would work in the UK,"" says Mr Close. ""You'd start where there are big Indian communities, but there is no reason that wouldn't stretch."" While taro and red bean recipes might be harder to export, matcha (green tea) flavours seem likely to be at the forefront of any Asian invasion, he thinks. ""We've just launched a matcha ice cream in the Philippines. We'll take it to other markets. ""I'd put money on the idea that there'd be green tea ice cream or green tea ice lollies in most markets in the not too distant future."" Booza - also known as Dondurma (in Turkey), this is made with ground powdered orchid root and mastic gum. These ice creams melt more slowly and have a thicker, chewier texture. Thai rolled ice cream - the latest Asian ice cream trend involves pouring mixture onto a freezing slab of metal then rolling it up like a piece of paper Durian ice cream - only the very adventurous are usually attracted by the the prickly Asian fruit that smells so bad it's illegal to carry it on the subway in Singapore.

Growing up with lesbian mums,"Twenty years ago my mum came out as a lesbian. I was only four at the time so it wasn't such a big deal for me. I've learnt from my parents that it was a bit more difficult for some of my older siblings, so I wanted to speak to them about what it was like. And I also wanted to find out if it's any easier now for parents to come out. Jillian's story, My Lesbian Mums is available onBBC iPlayer now. You can also watch the full documentary on YouTube.,external My mums [Susan and Gerrie] made history in 2014, becoming the first lesbians to marry in Scotland. It was ""theperfect moment in history"", but it wasn't always easy for them to get down the aisle. For my mum, having such young children [when she came out], it would have been really hard, and I think she was quite scared. Although my grandparents knew, none of their friends knew and they were so worried about what their friends' reaction was going to be. I remember my mum sitting me and brother Jamie down, asking if we were embarrassed by her. We both said ""don't be so stupid"" and that ""of course"" we weren't embarrassed. My brother Jamie, who was eight when our mum came out, and Rupert the dog I feel that Jamie always found the funny side of things. He knew how to make a joke about it, and not get sad or angry. Something I tell all my friends is what was written in Jamie's school yearbook: more mummies than an Egyptian pyramid. I don't remember anybody staring at us when we went out, but I could have been so oblivious to it because I was so young. Elaine is Gerrie's youngest daughter, she was 11 when she found out my mum and her mum were together Elaine definitely struggled through school, I think she's quite emotionally traumatised by what happened to her. She said she didn't tell anyone about her mum and my mum in school because of how people reacted to her sister. [One of Elaine's older sisters came out as a lesbian before Gerrie did]. It was interesting to hear how different it was for the different ages involved. Looking at Elaine, she's struggled so much but she's come out of it so much better. She's an incredibly strong person. I was very fortunate in that I didn't struggle, but I didn't realise how difficult it was [for Elaine] because we were both at different stages of our lives. Anne says it was funny when her mum came out because it was around the time there was a lesbian mum storyline in Friends I feel that Anne has taken the amazing qualities from our mothers' and created a worldwide business that she runs in Majorca. Anne is Gerrie's eldest, but I never lived with her because she was at university when our mums moved in together. She says she sees through them that ""absolutely anything is possible"", and it was ""kind of cool"" to have lesbian parents at university. Both my mums officiate weddings. As humanists, they conduct non-religious ceremonies. Knowing that our mums have helped others come out is a lovely thought, but sometimes they meet couples who face the same challenges they did 20 years ago. Meeting Adam and Conor - Adam has two children [aged eight and six] from a previous heterosexual marriage It sounds like [Adam and Conor] have had a really tough time, but I just think Adam is so brave. It was interesting speaking to them, as it sounds like they still have the same worries my mums did. They worry about their kids going to secondary school, but from what I saw I know that they are going to have the best life and grow up so well. But they still feel that they could have their kids taken off them, and that they'll be bullied because of it. I suppose with Adam and Conor, just like my mums, parents: lesbian, gay or straight, just want to do what's best for their children. Aaaaaand... that's a wrap My parents have taught me to be who I am. It's been the most enlightening experience filming this documentary and the general consensus from all the children is we're very proud of our mums. To hear that my parents had fears [for their children], and to hear Adam and Conor still have these fears goes to show that society today hasn't really changed. I would like to think in the future it will change and nobody will judge you for being lesbian or gay with children. My Lesbian Mums is available now onBBC iPlayer, as well as onYouTube,external.

How Canada became an education superpower,"Canada has climbed into the top tier of education rankings When there are debates about the world's top performing education systems, the names that usually get mentioned are the Asian powerhouses such as Singapore and South Korea or the Nordic know-alls, such as Finland or Norway. But with much less recognition, Canada has climbed into the top tier of international rankings. In the most recent round of international Pisa tests, Canada was one of a handful of countries to appear in the top 10 for maths, science and reading. The tests, run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), are a major study of educational performance and show Canada's teenagers as among the best educated in the world. They are far ahead of geographical neighbours such as the US and European countries with strong cultural ties like the UK and France. At university level, Canada has the world's highest proportion of working-age adults who have been through higher education - 55% compared with an average in OECD countries of 35%. Canada's success in school tests is also very unusual compared with other international trends. The top performers are often cohesive, compact societies and the current highest achiever, Singapore, has been seen as a model of systematic progress, with each part of the education system integrated into an overarching national strategy. Canada has been much more successful in education than its US neighbour Canada does not even really have a national education system, it is based on autonomous provinces and it is hard to think of a bigger contrast between a city state such as Singapore and a sprawling land mass such as Canada. The OECD, trying to understand Canada's success in education, described the role of the federal government as ""limited and sometimes non-existent"". Also not widely recognised is that Canada has a high level of migrants in its school population. More than a third of young adults in Canada are from families where both parents are from another country. But the children of newly-arrived, migrant families seem to integrate rapidly enough to perform at the same high level as their classmates. Swearing-in day ceremony for new Canadian citizens When the most recent Pisa rankings are looked at more closely, at regional rather than national level, the results for Canada are even more remarkable. If Canadian provinces entered Pisa tests as separate countries, three of them, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec, would be in the top five places for science in the world, alongside Singapore and Japan and above the likes of Finland and Hong Kong. So how has Canada overtaken so many other countries in education? Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, says Canada's ""big uniting theme is equity"". Despite the different policies in individual provinces, there is a common commitment to an equal chance in school. He says there is a strong sense of fairness and equal access - and this is seen in the high academic performance of migrant children. Global education Canada 150: Top teacher stands up for indigenous students Canada 150: Canada turns big ideas into global aid Canada 150: Trump's biggest fans? Canadian universities School funding not always linked to results Superstars go to Harvard to plan for post-fame careers How can you train to be a top tennis umpire? Ideas for theGlobal education series? Get in touch. Within three years of arriving, the Pisa tests show the children of new migrants have scores as high as the rest of their schoolmates. It makes Canada one of the few countries where migrant children achieve at a level similar to their non-migrant counterparts. Another distinguishing feature is that Canada's teachers are well paid by international standards - and entry into teaching is highly selective. Prof David Booth, from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, highlights Canada's ""strong base in literacy"". There have been systematic efforts to improve literacy, with well-trained staff, resources such as school libraries and testing and assessment to identify schools or individuals who are struggling. Prof John Jerrim, of the UCL Institute of Education in London, says that Canada's high league table ranking reflects the narrow socio-economic gap in school results. Rather than a country of extremes, Canada's results show a very high average, with relatively little difference between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Canada pays high teacher salaries by international standards In the most recent Pisa results for science, the variation in scores in Canada caused by socio-economic differences was 9%, compared with 20% in France and 17% in Singapore. The equitable outcome goes a long way to explaining why Canada is doing so well in international tests. It does not have a tail of underachievement, often related to poverty. It is a remarkably consistent system. As well as little variation between rich and poor students, there is very little variation in results between schools, compared with the average for developed countries. Rather than high levels of immigration being seen as a potential drag on results, Prof Jerrim says in Canada's case, this is likely to be part of its success story. Migrants coming to Canada, many from countries such as China, India and Pakistan, are often relatively well-educated and ambitious to see their children get into professional careers. Prof Jerrim says these families have an immigrant ""hunger"" to succeed, and their high expectations are likely to boost school results for their children. Prof Booth from the University of Toronto also points to the high expectations of these migrant families. ""Many families new to Canada want their children to excel at school, and the students are motivated to learn,"" he said. This has been a bumper year for education in Canada. The universities are reaping the benefits of the Trump effect, with record levels of applications from overseas students seeingCanada as a North American alternative to the United States. There has also been a Canadian winner of the Global Teacher Prize, withMaggie MacDonnell using the award to campaign for indigenous students. As Canada marks its 150th anniversary, it can claim the status of an education superpower.

Female politicians and the baby question,"Germany's Frauke Petry has five children A new political party leader in New Zealand has reacted angrily to repeated questions about whether she plans to have children. It is ""unacceptable"" to be getting those questions in 2017, the politician,Jacinda Ardern, said. So what added scrutiny are female politicians under, and, conversely, can mothers sometimes use their family lives to their political advantage? Some politicians have faced serious political attacks for not having children.New Zealanders just need to look across the water to Australia for one example: former Prime MinisterJulia Gillard. In an editorial, the Sydney Morning Herald wrote: ""Her media persona does not fit the expectations of some voters: a single woman, childless, whose life is dedicated to her career."" This was one of the kinder comments. While leading Australia, Ms Gillard was called ""deliberately barren,external"" (by a senator from another party) and a ""childless, atheist ex-communist"" (by a rival from her own party). She fought back against personal attacks against her, most notably with asearing tirade against the leader of the opposition, in which she said: ""If he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia ... he needs a mirror."" What Julia Gillard did for Australia and sexism Regarding voters' expectations, the newspaper may have had a point. Political scientist Jessica Smith from Birkbeck College in London researches parenthood, gender and political leaders. She says that despite changing roles in society, the prominent idea of women is that they are mothers. The ""stereotype of women as primary caregivers"" is still ""very much a lens that we like to see women through"", she told the BBC. ""There's also a trope that gets rolled out about career women, that if a woman doesn't have children she's sacrificed that for her career,"" she added. Ms Smith says families have become more important in politics, as we ""become more interested in the personalities or politicians"", but she says ""men seem to have an opt-out clause for discussions of family, which women don't"". The most powerful woman in Europe does not have children - and her country's media don't comment on it It is a slightly different story in Germany. ChancellorAngela Merkelmay affectionately be called ""mutti"" (mum) by many Germans, but she has no biological children. It is not common knowledge why she does not have children, and it is not a topic covered by the press; Germany has strong privacy laws and the media is much more policy-oriented than in other places. Angela Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor But that has not stopped a political opponent trying to weaponise the issue during a tricky time. Back in 2005, Ms Merkel was running against her predecessor, Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, and it was his wife, Doris SchrÃ¶der-KÃ¶pf, who commented she did ""not embody with her biography the experiences of most women"". It was a clear reference to her not being a mother. This will sound like an echo to readers familiar with theAndrea Leadsom/Theresa Maystory from the UK last year. Both women were vying to become the leader of the same party - a leadership that would make them the prime minister. Mother-of-three Mrs Leadsom told a daily newspaper that being a mum meant she had ""a very real stake"" in the country's future. It was interpreted as a dig against Mrs May, who has no children. The comment backfired and, despitean apology, the episode brought down Mrs Leadsom's leadership bid. But it still showed how a woman politician without children may find her childlessness is used against her. Stereotypes often define women as more ""communal and caring"" than men, says Ms Smith, and motherhood can help them ""extend on"" that image. Ms Smith says it is an image that politicians on the right of the political spectrum are best at exploiting, because it fits with traditional family values. She cites ""hockey mom""Sarah Palin, who was governor of Alaska and campaigned for the US vice-presidency in 2008, as someone who did it well. Sarah Palin appeared with her five children, her husband and her daughter's boyfriend at the Republican National Convention in 2008 Despite losing, Ms Palin made huge inroads; she was the first Republican woman to be on the vice-presidential ticket, and she became very well-known. She was a mum of five and called herself a ""mama grizzly"". The 'hockey mom' with political stardust Frauke Petryin Germany is a more recent example of a right-wing mother whose children are central to her image. The AfD leader was heavily pregnant with her fifth child at a party conference earlier this year. Last week she tweeted a picture of herself with her newborn, and the caption: ""What's your reason to fight for Germany?"" And then there is US presidential runner-upHillary Clinton,whohas tried to soften her imageby drawing on her status as a grandmother. For others, motherhood has been an obstacle. In Japan in 2009 even the government minister tasked with raising the birth rate,Yuko Obuchi,said she was worried,externalabout juggling motherhood with her work. Six years earlier, Russian property affairs ministerZumrud Rustamovanoted while attending an important board meeting a week before her son was due that ""people pretended that everything was all right, but would secretly be glancing at my huge belly"". Campaigning with a newborn in the UK general election In the UK, a 2012 study by Dr Rosie Campbell and Prof Sarah Childs found female MPs were more than twice as likely as people in the general population to have no children. They found the average age of female MPs' eldest child when they first entered parliament was 16, compared to 12 for men. And while some things may lift those obstacles - a creche in government buildings, say, or jobshare arrangements for politicians, or allowing women to breastfeed in parliament - the extra scrutiny on women's family lives is often reflected by how voters see female candidates. The Barbara Lee Family Foundation in the USwrote,external: ""Voters recognise a double standard but actively and consciously participate in it. ""They express anxiety about a woman's job in office taking a backseat to her role at home and wonder who is taking care of the children, especially if they are young. ""If a candidate doesn't have children, voters worry that she may not be able to truly understand the concerns of families."" Baby question angers NZ party leader Gillard: Why was she ousted?

Prince Philip carries out last engagement,"This video can not be played Royal Marines cheered the Duke of Edinburgh outside Buckingham Palace The Duke of Edinburgh met Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement before he retires from royal duties. The 96-year-oldannounced his retirementin May, after decades of supporting the Queen as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations. Prince Philip has completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. Prime Minister Theresa May took to Twitter to thank him for ""a remarkable lifetime of service"". She added that she hoped he ""can now enjoy a well-earned retirement"". As Captain General of the Royal Marines, the duke attended a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge - a series of strength and endurance challenges raising funds and awareness for charity. Decades of royal duty Prince Philip's foreign travels in pictures Duke 'won't disappear into background' Prince Philip's gaffes from decades on royal duty While his diary of engagements will come to an end, Buckingham Palace has said the duke may still decide to attend certain events alongside the Queen in the future. The Queen's public schedule will continue as normal. Cpl Jamie Thompson, 31, who attended the event - which was held in the rain outside Buckingham Palace - said it was ""historic"". ""This is the duke's last royal engagement and we're a part of it, the Royal Marines are a part of it - so it's an absolute honour,"" he said. Cpl Thompson ran 1,664 miles over 100 days with Corporal Will Gingell, 33, as part of the challenge. The duke also met Sgt Matt Burley, a physical training instructor, who swam 1,664 lengths underwater over 10 days, and Lt Col Aldeiy Alderson, who ran 100km (62 miles) in 12 hours wearing his Royal Marines uniform After hearing about their exploits, he told the group of marines: ""You all should be locked up."" The duke was also handed the 1664 Global Challenge baton, before raising his hat and waving it to acknowledge three cheers in his honour. Prince Philip braved torrential rain outside Buckingham Palace Earlier, Lady Myra Butter, who has known Prince Philip since the age of eight or nine, told Radio 4's Today programme he was ""very spirited, a young normal boy full of fun... we loved when he came to stay"". Asked about what the duke would do next, she said: ""I'm sure that he won't disappear, he will be greatly missed by everybody.

Two killed in Portugal beach crash,"This video can not be played The light plane landed on the sand A man and a child have been killed after a light aircraft made an emergency landing on a beach in Portugal. Authorities said the incident took place on Sao Joao beach in Caparica, south-west of Lisbon. The National Maritime Authority said a middle-aged man and a young girl died after they were unable to avoid the plane. The plane's only two occupants were unharmed, it added. The Diario de Noticias newspaper quoted an eyewitness who said the plane had been flying at a low altitude over the beach, although he did not realise anything was wrong until other beachgoers began running. One young witness told Reuters news agency: ""I was near the water when I saw the plane. I called my parents, the plane fell on the sand and ran over two people, fatally hurting them and another was injured, I think, but I'm not sure, people were running away. ""The plane is still there, but the ambulances arrived quickly. I think maybe the fuel ran out because I find it weird that it landed on the beach."" Other reports said the victims had been sunbathing when the plane made its emergency landing. The Associated Press news agency said the girl who died had been with her parents, who were unhurt. The agency quoted witnesses from local television broadcasts. Joao Quadros, who was on the beach, tweeted photos of the aftermath, saying the plane had passed by his son by a matter of metres. There had been no noise, he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Hero' fighting IS 'turned gun on self',"Ryan Lock's family described him as a ""caring and loving boy"" A ""heroic young man"" who fought with Kurdish forces in Syria killed himself to avoid falling hostage to Islamic State (IS) militants, an inquest heard. Ryan Lock, 20, from Chichester, died in December with the People's Defence Units (YPG) in Raqqa. When wounded and surrounded by IS fighters he turned his gun on himself to avoid capture and a ""frightening and painful death"", the hearing was told. A former chef without military skills, he told family he was on holiday. After revealing he was not backpacking in Turkey as they had thought, Mr Lock kept in touch with his family via Facebook Messenger, the inquest in Portsmouth heard. He sent them pictures and updates on the military training he was receiving, but never revealed he was involved in combat. But after losing contact with him last December, Mr Lock's father Jon Plater found images online of his son with an IS fighter standing over his body in the northern city of Raqqa - considered to be the terrorist group's de facto capital. Recording a narrative verdict, coroner David Horsley said Mr Lock sustained a leg wound that left him at risk of falling into the hands of a ""cruel and ruthless"" enemy. Kurdish forces are fighting for the city of Raqqa Mr Horsley added: ""He was not prepared to let that happen and used his own weapon to avoid capture. That can only be viewed as a brave action."" The coroner described Mr Lock as a ""heroic young man"", and added: ""He died doing something he quite clearly believed passionately in."" Pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said Mr Lock's cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head. Mr Lock's mother, Catherine, said that before he left home Mr Lock had mentioned how bad the situation in Syria was, but ""it wasn't something he would constantly comment on"". He became secretive, and Mrs Lock said: ""Deep down, there were things setting off alarm bells but I wasn't getting the answers."" When Mr Lock revealed he was en route to Syria, to serve with the YPG as a chef with hopes to train as a medic, Mrs Lock said she ""absolutely panicked"". She tried not to be negative for fear of him severing contact and told him: ""I'm proud of you, but for God's sake come home safely"".

Trump approves 'flawed' Russia sanctions,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation President Donald Trump has signed into a law a bill which imposes new sanctions on Russia for their alleged meddling in the 2016 election. The bill, which was signed in private at the White House, also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea. Mr Trump accused Congress of overreach on the legislation, which ""handcuffs"" him from easing Russia penalties. Moscow said the sanctions ""put paid to hopes that our relations with the new American administration"" would improve. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also said this move meant the US had declared a ""full-scale trade war"" on Russia. Iran said the new sanctions violated the nuclear deal and it would respond in an ""appropriate and proportional"" manner, reports the semi-official Isna news agency. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the US election, and Mr Trump has rejected any allegations that his campaign staff colluded with Russia to help him win. Hours after the US president signed the bill, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""This isn't news. ""The thing is, the bill was approved and was going to automatically become law with or without the president's signature."" Moscow had already retaliated last week to Congress passing the bill, by expelling 755 people from its US embassy and consulates. Several European nations, including Germany, are fearful of the economic consequences and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has warned of ""unintended unilateral effects that impact the EU's energy security interests"". The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? In signing the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Mr Trump attached a statement calling the measure ""deeply flawed"". He accused Congress, which last week overwhelmingly passed the bill and sent it to the White House, of overstepping its constitutional authority. ""As president, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress,"" he said. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump has signed the bill but he's clearly not happy about it. Hardly surprising, as any president would probably object to congressional efforts to curtail executive power included in this legislation. As is becoming routine, however, this administration didn't draw its battle lines in the expected way. There were several ""signing statements"". The first reads like a standard legalistic description of a presidential action with a bevy of ""yes, but..."" reservations. Another statement is decidedly more Trumpian, complete with a shot at Congress for not passing healthcare reform and a closing boast about his business empire and negotiating prowess. Releasing multiple signing statements with somewhat divergent tones is unusual, to say the least, and could be an indication that, despite the efforts of new chief of staff John Kelly, the administration is still not speaking with a unified voice. The sanctions, which are also in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, come months after President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats.

'Three Musketeers' guilty of terror plot,"Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain and Mohibur Rahman were convicted at the Old Bailey Three men who dubbed themselves the Three Musketeers have been found guilty of plotting a terror attack on a police or military target in the UK. Naweed Ali, 29, and Khobaib Hussain, 25, both of Sparkhill, Birmingham, and Mohibur Rahman, 33, of Stoke-on-Trent, were convicted at the Old Bailey. They were arrested last August in an undercover police sting. A fourth man, Tahir Aziz, 38, from Stoke-on-Trent, was found guilty of the same offence. They will be sentenced on Thursday. Police say the men, who had all denied preparing terrorist acts, were inspired by so-called Islamic State, also known as Daesh. They were described as ""dangerous men"" who were committed to carrying out a ""mass casualty attack"". Officers said the case was ""one of the most complex counter terrorism investigations in a number of years"". Inside the sting that caught four jihadis The court heard how the members of the gang called themselves the Three Musketeers when exchanging encrypted messages on the Telegram app. Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain, Mohibur Rahman and Tahir Aziz had denied preparing terrorist acts Evidence found on the men's phones and other devices showed they had shared ""radical and extremist beliefs"" in messages. They were caught after counter-terrorism officers set up a fake courier firm, called Hero Couriers, where Hussain and Ali were offered driving shifts. Ali arrived for his first shift at the fake firm in August last year, leaving his Seat Leon car at the Birmingham depot, where MI5 officers searched the vehicle with a view to bugging it. However, inside they found a JD Sports bag containing a partially-constructed pipe bomb and meat cleaver with the word ""kafir"" - meaning non-believer - scratched on it. An imitation gun, cartridges, a 9mm bullet, latex gloves and industrial tape were also recovered. The trial was told when police searched Aziz's car they found a samurai-style sword next to the driver's seat. All four men were arrested on 26 August. The men claimed the incriminating evidence was planted by an undercover officer, known as ""Vincent"", who posed as the boss of the fake courier firm. The officer, who gave evidence anonymously, was cross-examined for 12 days and repeatedly rejected the allegations. Mohibur Rahman (left) and Khobaib Hussain were photographed as part of the operation The jury heard how the defendants had been looking at violent material online, joined extremist social media groups and bought new mobile phones to help them further their plans. Neighbours Ali and Hussain have previously been jailed for terrorism offences. They had attempted to join an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan in 2011. However, when they arrived back in the UK they were arrested and the following year both pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. The trial heard the pair first met Rahman - who had been convicted of possessing an al-Qaeda magazine - while in prison. Responding to the verdicts, Chief Superintendent Matt Ward, head of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said: ""Back in 2010 and 2011, they were inspired by al Qaeda. ""Since they've come out of prison, they've been inspired by the Daesh ideology. ""They shared lots of material regarding that ideology, lots of very violent material, they were trying to encourage others to join them on that journey."" He said the men had ""carefully planned and took steps to avoid drawing attention to themselves"", including leaving their mobile phones at home when they travelled to meet in Stoke. Police found a meat cleaver with the word Kafir scratched on it Mr Ward also defended his officers, including one who was accused in court of planting evidence. ""Throughout the trial the defence made a number of accusations,"" Mr Ward said. ""Many of those accusations were groundless, they went against the integrity of the undercover operatives, they went against the integrity of the wider investigation. ""What I would say is just because a defence lawyer says something in court, doesn't make it true."" The four-month trial was held partly in secret in the interests of national security and two anonymous witnesses gave evidence behind closed doors. Sue Hemming, from the CPS, said the men ""shared the same radical belief in violent jihad"". ""Recent attacks have demonstrated the kind of horror these defendants could have caused had they not been stopped,"" she added.

Safety fears over sharp fidget spinners,"One of the fidget spinners tested by the BBC's Watchdog programme Fidget spinners that can puncture the skin have been discovered for sale in the UK by a BBC Watchdog investigation. Safety fears have been raised about the spinners - a craze that has fascinated children and frustrated parents - with others found to fail safety tests. Some in the shape of a ""shuriken"", an offensive weapon in the UK, were found to be on sale on eBay. Tests found they could damage eyes and puncture skin. The auction site said they would be removed from sale. Customs impound 200,000 fidget spinners Fidget spinners: What's the deal Other toy crazes banned from schools The spinners, originally designed to help children with conditions such as autism deal with stress, have become a playground craze. The Watchdog team bought three fidget spinners - marketed as toys for children - from eBay. They had the appearance of a ""death star"" or ""shuriken"". The items were put through testing by blades expert Professor Sarah Hainsworth. She tested the spinners by stabbing into a tomato, used as a substitute for an eye, and pork skin, used as a substitute for human skin. All three spinners had the ability to puncture the tomato, and two out of three were able to puncture the pork skin. A spokesman for eBay said: ""These items are absolutely not permitted and will be immediately removed. We'd like to thank the programme for bringing these items to our attention."" BBC Watchdog also bought five fidget spinners from local shops. A toy safety expert concluded that none of them should have been sold as they did not pass essential toy safety tests. Concerned parents have also recounted evidence of poor quality spinners, including one who found a large shard of metal protruding from the toy. Advice from Trading Standards for anyone buying spinners and other toys includes: Always look for the CE mark on packaging, showing it meets European safety standards, according to the manufacturer. If you can't see one - don't buy it Always buy from a reputable seller, and do not buy these toys for children aged under three as they have small parts that could present a choke hazard to children You can watch the full story on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Wednesday 2 August, and later on the BBC iPlayer Customs impound 200,000 fidget spinners The other toy crazes banned from schools Fidget spinners: What's the deal?

Trump approves new Russia sanctions,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation President Donald Trump has signed into a law a bill which imposes new sanctions on Russia for their alleged meddling in the 2016 election. The bill, which was signed in private at the White House, also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea. Mr Trump accused Congress of overreach on the legislation, which ""handcuffs"" him from easing Russia penalties. Moscow said the sanctions ""put paid to hopes that our relations with the new American administration"" would improve. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also said this move meant the US had declared a ""full-scale trade war"" on Russia. Iran said the new sanctions violated the nuclear deal and it would respond in an ""appropriate and proportional"" manner, reports the semi-official Isna news agency. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the US election, and Mr Trump has rejected any allegations that his campaign staff colluded with Russia to help him win. Hours after the US president signed the bill, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""This isn't news. ""The thing is, the bill was approved and was going to automatically become law with or without the president's signature."" Moscow had already retaliated last week to Congress passing the bill, by expelling 755 people from its US embassy and consulates. Several European nations, including Germany, are fearful of the economic consequences and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has warned of ""unintended unilateral effects that impact the EU's energy security interests"". The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia?

Venezuela 'fixed' vote turnout,"Violent clashes erupted during the disputed vote Turnout numbers for Sunday's controversial vote in Venezuela have been ""tampered with"", the company that provided the voting system alleges. Venezuela's electoral authorities said more than eight million people, or 41.5% of the electorate, had voted for a new constituent assembly. But the CEO of Smartmatic, Antonio Mugica, said the actual turnout was inflated by at least one million. Venezuela's electoral council dismissed the allegations as ""baseless"". Threatening to open legal action against Mr Mugica, the council's boss Tibisay Lucena called it an ""irresponsible accusation, based on estimates"". ""It is with the deepest regret that we have to report that the turnout numbers on Sunday 30th July for the Constituent Assembly in Venezuela were tampered with,"" Mr Mugica told a media conference in London. He added that although the company's system had recorded the true number of voters, a full audit would have to take place before he could give the precise figure. Asked why he had not contacted the Venezuelan authorities, Mr Mugica said he thought they ""would not be sympathetic to what we'd say"". Smartmatic provided about 24,000 machines for Venezuelans to cast their votes electronically. According to the company, their system supplied correct voting statistics but altered results were announced in their place. Separately, the Reuters news agency reported it had seen an internal memo from Venezuela's electoral authorities saying fewer than four million votes had been cast just two hours before polls closed. During the vote, Venezuelans were asked to select more than 500 representatives to make up a constituent assembly. The new body has the power to rewrite the constitution, sidelining the opposition-led National Assembly. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro argued the constituent assembly would promote ""reconciliation and peace"" after months of crisis. But the opposition, which boycotted the vote, saw it as a power grab by the president. Turnout is seen as crucial in the vote. Given that the opposition refused to field candidates, the figure gives an indication of support for the government. The National Assembly has approved a request to open a criminal investigation into Smartmatic's claims. Venezuela's controversial vote explained Venezuela remains in political and economic turmoil. Tumbling oil prices have hit social programmes hard and scores of people have died protesting against the government. Despite the unrest the government retains the crucial support of the armed forces. This video can not be played Your video guide to the crisis gripping Venezuela Amid pressure at homeand strong condemnation abroad, Mr Maduro is pressing on with the swearing in of the new assembly, with its first sitting likely to take place on Thursday. The electoral authorities have already issued credentials for the new deputies, among them Mr Maduro's wife. The opposition is calling for fresh demonstrations with a march planned to coincide with the expected installation of the assembly.

'Hero' biker overwhelmed by donations,"Chris Toon said he is grateful that he can move his arms A man who crashed into a ditch after steering away from a group of cyclists, said he has been ""overwhelmed"" by funds for his rehabilitation. Chris Toon, 32, from Derbyshire, broke his back and will never walk again after the crash on his motorbike near Melton Mowbray on 11 June. Mr Toon said it had given him a ""boost"" after about Â£17,000 was raised to help pay for a special wheelchair. A friend, Rachel Richardson, said he was a ""hero"" for avoiding the cyclists. Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands TheNottingham Post,externalreported on Sunday, that Mr Toon, a music teacher at Nottingham High School, was riding on the B5324, when his back wheel started to skid, throwing him to the other side of the road. He then saw the group of about 12 cyclists coming the other way and in a split second made the decision to crash into the ditch to avoid a collision with them. ""I'd be in a different place if I had hit them,"" he told the BBC. ""I could have killed 2 or 3 of them, I could have ploughed through them all. I'm pleased no one did get hurt."" Chris Toon teaches music at Nottingham High School Mr Toon said the cyclists all thanked him for what he did and even remembers making sure he could move his arms so he could play his saxophone again. The 32-year-old, who does not have any immediate family, has been supported by his girlfriend Sarah Knight. Rachel Richardson, who met Mr Toon through Derby Music Centre, started raising money to help him for when he eventually leaves hospital in Sheffield. Chris Toon said he was pleased that he will still be able to play the flute She said: ""I never expected that we would raise that much, but we need to raise much more as he will need his house adapting. ""The donations have been overwhelming, one man has donated Â£255 out of his whisky jar."" Mr Toon said although he has a ""long way to go"" in terms of rehabilitation, he plans to return to teaching.

Briton fighting IS 'turned gun on self',"Ryan Lock's family described him as a ""caring and loving boy"" A ""heroic young man"" who fought with Kurdish forces in Syria killed himself to avoid falling hostage to Islamic State (IS) militants, an inquest heard. Ryan Lock, 20, from Chichester, died in December with the People's Defence Units (YPG) in Raqqa. When wounded and surrounded by IS fighters he turned his gun on himself to avoid capture and a ""frightening and painful death"", the hearing was told. A former chef without military skills, he told family he was on holiday. After revealing he was not backpacking in Turkey as they had thought, Mr Lock kept in touch with his family via Facebook Messenger, the inquest in Portsmouth heard. He sent them pictures and updates on the military training he was receiving, but never revealed he was involved in combat. But after losing contact with him last December, Mr Lock's father Jon Plater found images online of his son with an IS fighter standing over his body in the northern city of Raqqa - considered to be the terrorist group's de facto capital. Recording a narrative verdict, coroner David Horsley said Mr Lock sustained a leg wound that left him at risk of falling into the hands of a ""cruel and ruthless"" enemy. Kurdish forces are fighting for the city of Raqqa Mr Horsley added: ""He was not prepared to let that happen and used his own weapon to avoid capture. That can only be viewed as a brave action."" The coroner described Mr Lock as a ""heroic young man"", and added: ""He died doing something he quite clearly believed passionately in."" Pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said Mr Lock's cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head. Mr Lock's mother, Catherine, said that before he left home Mr Lock had mentioned how bad the situation in Syria was, but ""it wasn't something he would constantly comment on"". He became secretive, and Mrs Lock said: ""Deep down, there were things setting off alarm bells but I wasn't getting the answers."" When Mr Lock revealed he was en route to Syria, to serve with the YPG as a chef with hopes to train as a medic, Mrs Lock said she ""absolutely panicked"". She tried not to be negative for fear of him severing contact and told him: ""I'm proud of you, but for God's sake come home safely"".

Bitcoin splits as new currency takes off,"There are now two types of Bitcoin A new version of Bitcoin has been mined for the first time in the crypto-currency's history. Bitcoin Cash is the result of months of debate and development over how the currency would continue to evolve. Fears of large swings in the valueof Bitcoin have so far not been realised - but some exchanges are still adapting to the new currency. One expert said the process had gone smoothly so far and pointed out that trade in Bitcoin Cash seemed ""robust"". Bitcoin Cash was developed as a measure to increase the capacity of Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain - a digital ledger that records every single transaction. Because the old blockchain could only have one megabyte (MB) of data added to it every 10 minutes, transactions have come to be processed at slower rates. Bitcoin Cash blocks can be as large as 8MB, which its proponents hope will help to solve this problem. Yesterday, Bitcoin Cash was officially born whenblock number 478559 - at just under 2MB in size - was mined,external. No major issues have so far been detected following the split although a few exchanges and wallets have had minor technical issues with supporting Bitcoin Cash initially, said Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Bitcoin swings as civil war looms Bitcoin rebels risk 'trading chaos' ""A market seems to be emerging for Bitcoin Cash that looks to be relatively robust,"" he told the BBC. The fresh-faced crypto-currency was trading comfortably above $400 (Â£300) about 12 hours after it was created. Bitcoin itself saw a modest fall in price on Tuesday, but was still above $2,700 (Â£2,000) at 10:00 BST on Wednesday. Some Bitcoin mining operations are industrial in scale - large numbers computers authorise transactions and the owners receive bitcoins as a reward Thanks to its larger block size, Bitcoin Cash requires more computer storage space from parties wishing to take part in the process of mining. Mining involves computers being tasked with solving difficult mathematical problems in order to authorise transactions on the blockchain. Miners receive new bitcoins as a reward for this work - making it lucrative - and it has also been something open to individuals in the past, because the cost of small scale mining equipment has been relatively low. That could change thanks to Bitcoin Cash. ""Bigger players with access to server farms and big budgets will have no problem running bigger nodes, but smaller operators could be squeezed out,"" said Dr Hileman. ""Will companies dominate Bitcoin Cash more than Bitcoin? We're going to see this in the flesh now, how this will play out."" And there are other issues to ponder - not least the decision by one of the biggest crypto-currency exchanges, Coinbase, not to support Bitcoin Cash. ""Seriously look at Bitcoin Cash going up. If you kept your [Bitcoin] at @coinbase and are not getting any you must be pretty fed up right now,""tweeted one trader,externalwho watched the split unfold. The split might also make it harder to establish Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash as currencies useful for commerce, suggested Vili Lehdonvirta at the Oxford Internet Institute. This is because a greater number of currencies each with a smaller number of users are less likely to be accepted in lots of different places, he explained. But Bitcoin traders may simply be interested in speculation - buying and selling coins in the hope they rise in value. ""In which case actual usefulness doesn't matter,"" he said.

Prisoners escape using peanut butter,"Brady Andrew Kilpatrick, 24, managed to evade authorities for two days Twelve inmates escaped from a prison in Alabama after using peanut butter to trick a guard into unlocking a door that led outside, police say. The men fled the facility after confusing a new member of staff by smearing the peanut butter over a number on an exit door. The inmates then used their orange prison uniforms and blankets to overcome a razor wire fence. All 12 of the fugitives who escaped on Sunday have since been recaptured. Eleven of the men were tracked down and returned to custody within 12 hours of the prison break, but the final escapee managed to evade authorities until Tuesday evening. Brady Andrew Kilpatrick, 24, was the only prisoner to make it out of the county, according to the local sheriff'sFacebook page,external. He was later captured by police in Tequesta, Florida.

""When the inmates called for the guard to open the door and let them in a cell, the guard inadvertently opened the exit door,"" the statement said. The new guard said that he thought he was opening a cell door for one of the prisoners and later described the escapees as ""crazy like a fox"", local sheriff James Underwood told Fox News.

Governors 'devastated' by prison service,"This video can not be played Footage shows riot-trained staff at The Mount in Hertfordshire The president of the Prison Governors Association has attacked the government's management of prisons in England and Wales. Andrea Albutt wrote an open letter after recent violence at prisons inHertfordshire and Wiltshire. She said the unrest was causing ""grave concern"" - adding that governors faced ""unacceptable stress and anxiety"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said action had been taken to increase prison officer numbers. But Ms Albutt said her members had seen ""nothing tangible"" from the MoJ to ease population pressures in prison, and the burden on staff. She said recruitment remained in a ""critical"" condition, with a net increase of just 75 officers in the year 2016/17. Training was ""poor"" and ""unsuitable people"" were being selected, she added. Jamie Turner, a former inmate at Hertfordshire's The Mount, said he predicted riots there long ago because staff shortages had led to squalid conditions. ""You'll get five trainees come round the prison maybe the week before they're due to start on the Monday - they'll see the conditions and one will turn up for work,"" he told BBC 5 live. Prisons boss received 'scandalous' Â£20,000 bonus Prisons violence is 'out of control', report warns What is going wrong with the prison system? Special Report: Prisons under pressure,external Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, Ms Albutt said the government had not been receptive to talking to governors. Justice Secretary David Lidington's silence had been ""deafening"", she said, and prisons minister Sam Gyimah could not meet them until October. Without sufficient staffing, prisons could only ""hold and control"" prisoners, not deliver quality rehabilitative regimes, she added. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the Prison Governors Association had ""traditionally been a voice of moderation"". ""The criticisms are unlikely to be brushed aside,"" he said. Data,externalreleased last week from the MoJ showed a rise in violence in prisons, with 26,643 assaults in the year to March 2017 - 20% more than the previous year. Of these, a record 7,159 were attacks on staff - equivalent to 20 every day. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Anyone who's worked in a prison or served a sentence there will tell you that what they need above all is a stable environment. Without that there's little chance of successful rehabilitation. But with staff cuts, an upsurge in the use of drugs and changes to prison regimes, jails have been anything but stable. It's been little better in Whitehall, where the post of justice secretary has been filled by five Conservative ministers in seven years since Labour's Jack Straw was replaced in 2010. Each has had their own ideas about prison reform, with Liz Truss, who held the role for 11 months until June, responsible for the most recent change - separating the operational management of prisons from policy decisions. Andrea Albutt doesn't believe the split makes any sense and suggests it's undermining efforts to bring about the stability that jails need. She is not someone known for courting controversy, so her views demand to be taken seriously. Ms Albutt described the government's decision earlier this year, to separate operational control of the prison system from responsibility for policy, as ""madness"". Conservative MP Bob Neill, chairman of the Commons Justice Select Committee, said he did not share Ms Albutt's concerns over reforms, saying the split between policy and operations happened successfully across other areas of the public sector. He told BBC Radio 4's today programme that the bigger problem was a ""serious disconnection"" and growing lack of confidence between ""the top brass"" of the Prison Service and the ""operational people on the ground"", including governors. Mr Neill said other issues were low staffing and a failure to hold on to more experienced employees. An MoJ spokesman said Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) - which replaced the National Offender Management Service - would ""help to create a distinct, professionalised frontline service"". ""We know that our prisons have faced a number of long-standing challenges, which is why we have taken immediate action to boost prison officer numbers and have created HMPPS,"" the spokesman added. ""We need to create calm and ordered environments to help ensure effective rehabilitation, and we continue to work closely with the unions and all staff to help achieve these vital reforms and make prisons places of safety and reform."" Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said officer numbers had been slashed while overcrowding had risen. ""Prisoners are not being rehabilitated and this is putting the public at risk,"" he said, adding that only a Labour government would provide the investment, staff and attention needed to end the crisis. John Podmore, a former governor of Brixton, Belmarsh and Swaleside prisons, said he had never known rioting to be so frequent and long-lasting, and called for an independent public inquiry. The prison system was ""in a mess"" and there had been a ""fundamental breakdown"" in relations between staff and prisoners, he said. He pointed to ariot this week at The Mount,where many of the prisoners were preparing to be released. ""That's very very worrying. They should be out in the community [on licence], not locked up 24 hours a day,"" he told the Today programme. This video can not be played Undercover footage shows prisoners incapacitated by drugs Sir Edward Garnier, a former Conservative solicitor-general, now Prison Reform Trust trustee, said that until government reduced prisoner numbers, disturbances and dissatisfaction among governors, officers and prisoners would continue. In July, the union representing prison workerscalled for the resignationof prisons' boss Michael Spurr. The general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, Steve Gillan, said his members had ""lost patience"" and accused the management of HMPPS of trying to ""paper over the cracks"".

She added that she hoped he ""can now enjoy a well-earned retirement"". As Captain General of the Royal Marines, the duke attended a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge - a series of strength and endurance challenges raising funds and awareness for charity. Decades of royal duty Prince Philip's foreign travels in pictures Duke 'won't disappear into background' Prince Philip's gaffes from decades on royal duty While his diary of engagements will come to an end, Buckingham Palace has said the duke may still decide to attend certain events alongside the Queen in the future.

Older women 'poorer' after pension change,"More than a million women in their early 60s have become poorer as a result of delays to their state pensions, according to a new study. Researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that, on average, household income of women aged between 60 and 62 was now Â£32 a week lower. As a result poverty rates among that group have risen sharply, it said. But the IFS also said the savings, and extra tax from working women, meant the state was Â£5.1bn a year better off. Since 2010, women's state pension age (SPA) has been steadily raised by the government from age 60, in order to match men's SPA of 65 by 2018, with a further increase to 66 for both sexes by 2020. Public sector debtis Â£1.75tnand the government borrowed Â£46.2bn in the past financial year. The government said its pensions policy was ""fair and sustainable"" and matched continuing rises in life expectancy. However, the campaign group Waspi (Women Against State Pension Age Inequality) said the research was shocking. ""Once again, this shows that the government has implemented state pension age reforms without adequately considering the full impact of these changes on the women affected,"" said Waspi director, Jane Cowley. The IFS study showed that many women in the age group already affected by the pension change have continued working. But the effect of waiting longer for their state pension has, on average, outweighed the gains made by those who have continued to earn a salary. Thus the female 60 to 62 age group as a whole was earning an extra Â£2.5bn a year, an average of Â£44 per week. But the same group has also lost Â£4.2bn in pension and other benefits per year, or Â£74 per week. Jonathan Cribb, of the IFS, said the new policy was clearly putting pressure on the budgets of some households. ""The increased state pension age is boosting employment - and therefore earnings - of affected women but this is only partially offsetting reduced incomes from state pensions and other benefits,"" he said. ""Since both rich and poor women are losing out by, on average, roughly similar amounts the reform increases income poverty rates among households containing a woman who has reached age 60 but has not yet reached her state pension age."" Shirley McLachlan says she needed to rely on family for financial help Among those affected is Shirley McLachlan, from Aberdeen. The 61-year-old is not working owing to ill health and will not receive her state pension until she reaches the age of 66. ""I can't afford holidays. I had to give up my car and basically my life,"" she said. She said she had been helped out my the kindness of family and friends, but she was buying ""the cheapest, not the healthiest"" items in the supermarket. ""I've got a bus pass - whoopie! - but it is the only thing I've got really, [as I'm] not getting my pension."" Looking at the worst affected individuals, the IFS calculated that absolute poverty rates - measured after housing costs - had increased from 15% of women aged between 60 and 62 to 21% of them. It said there was no evidence of an increase in women experiencing ""material deprivation"" - that is, people saying the could not afford a range of important items. Such families may have ""smoothed"" their spending over time, the researchers suggested. Caroline Abrahams, at the charity Age UK, said the IFS figures were ""extremely worrying"". But the changes have boosted the government finances. The IFS said that the savings to the public purse had been boosted by the extra income tax and national insurance payments from those women continuing to work, which meant the government's total saving was now running at Â£5.1bn per year. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""The decision to equalise and increase the state pension age is both fair and sustainable for future generations and in line with continuing rises in life expectancy. ""Women retiring today can still expect to receive the state pension for over 24.5 years on average - which is more than any generation before them and several years longer than men."" The long-standing policy of equalising women's state pension age with that of men, and then raising it for both groups, has become increasingly controversial. The decision toequalise the SPA,externalwas first made back in 1995. Many women who are being affected say they were never made aware of the changes, which have now come as a shock to them.

Shetland has sunnier July than Cornwall,"Sun on St Ninian's Isle, Shetland, while intense rain caused flash flooding in Coverack, Cornwall The Shetland Islands had more sunshine than Cornwall in July - only the eighth time this has happened since records began in 1929. Met Office statistics showed the Shetland area had 192.9 hours of sunshine from 1-29 July, while Cornwall had 153.5 hours. Shetland lies about 700 miles (1,130 km) to the north east of Cornwall. It was a wet month for the UK as a whole, with 22% more than the average rainfall for July. Properties were damaged and people had to be rescued afterheavy rain and stormshit the Cornish village of Coverack. Climate scientist Mike Kendon said while it hadn't been a remarkable weather month, there were some ""significant events"". ""It is uncommon for Shetland to experience more sunshine hours than Cornwall at this time of year,"" he said. ""There is also a notable gradient between a cooler, sunnier and slightly drier than average north-west and a wetter, dull and warmer than average south-east."" One of the wettest places in July was Hampshire - which received 118% more than its average rainfall for the month. Northern Ireland was the wettest region of the UK, with 39% more rain the average.

Is time up for the 99 ice cream cone?,"Ice cream firms are experimenting with new flavours beyond vanilla We all love Thai curries, Japanese noodles and Indian snacks, so why not Asian-inspired desserts? With the amount of ice cream sold stalling in some markets, manufacturers are starting to experiment with exotic flavours. In late 1944, Major Hunter Reinburg, commanding officer of 122 Squadron of the American Marine Corps, had a hankering for ice cream. Not surprising perhaps, since he was posted to the sweltering, jungle-covered South Pacific island of Peleliu. So Hunter set his resourceful team of aircraft engineers to work on Operation Freeze. After some trial and error, they found that by mounting a large can filled with milk onto the underside of each wing tip of their fighter planes, attaching a stirring shaft to a wind-driven propeller, and then undertaking a training sortie at 30,000 feet, they could supply 100 servicemen with a helping of ice cream every day, whilst simultaneously provoking the Japanese to waste a few shells trying to bring them down. Hunter was, however, missing a trick. If, instead of flavouring his favourite treat with army-issue cocoa powder, he'd cast his eye around him to see what fruits and spices the South Pacific had to offer, then he really would have been ahead of his time. He could have tried lychee, coconut, cardamom, nutmeg or ginger - flavours that ice cream makers are now starting to experiment with. Matcha (green tea), lychee and rose ice cream anyone? In the 70 years since Hunter went to such lengths to satisfy his passion for frozen dairy desserts, global ice cream brands have spread their reach to almost every corner of the planet. Even in Peleliu he could now probably pick up a Cornetto from his corner store. But for many years, flavours from the big international brands remained stubbornly conservative,  dominated by chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Now though, thanks to migration, long-haul travel, and the internet, consumers are becoming more adventurous and manufacturers are taking note. Parlours have sprung up across the US offering Persian-style saffron, orange blossom, and rosewater ice cream, sprinkled with nuts and drizzled with honey; and Indian-inspired flavours such as masala chai and pineapple. Chinatown Ice Cream Factory offers red bean, toasted sesame and taro flavours At Chinatown Ice Cream Factory in New York, where they've been offering exotic ice creams for 40 years, they've noticed an uptick in interest from customers. Owner Christina Seid says there's often a queue of 20 customers waiting to try her Chinese-inspired range, which includes red bean, toasted sesame, and taro (a kind of sweet potato) ice cream. She thinks Americans are ready to embrace these flavours in a way they perhaps weren't when her parents, Chinese immigrants, first set up the shop. ""My father was the pioneer of a lot of these flavours. Back then people didn't even know what a mango or green tea was. ""Now, nothing is really weird."" She thinks red bean flavour, common in China, will eventually become mainstream in the US. In many of the world's biggest ice cream markets appetites have been flagging for traditional take-home tubs. Consumers are worrying about the sugar content and there's a lot of competition. According tomarket research firm Mintel,external, ice cream sales are stalling in some markets. As a result, firms are watching what happens in places like The Chinatown Ice Cream Factory carefully. ""Trends are born in the parlours where they can afford to take a gamble,"" says Alex Beckett, global food and drink analyst at Mintel. ""They become fashionable. Then they travel from Brooklyn to LA and Chicago, then to Sydney, London, Berlin, and eventually they will be picked up by manufacturers who will start to set the market for these more ethnic styles"" Yee Kwan Chan, who is based in the UK city of Sheffield and whose family is also Chinese, travels to far flung parts of the world in search of inspiration for her Yee Kwan line of desserts. ""I just want to create authentic flavours you'd find in Asia,"" she says. Yee Kwan Chan gets ideas for new flavours from her overseas travels Her concoctions include chocolate miso, black sesame seed, and durian - the fruit with the pungent odour often likened to sewage or something rotting - which is surprisingly popular in Asia. At Christmas she travelled to Hong Kong and is now producing egg custard tart ice cream, evoking the afternoon tea treat popular there. ""With the East Asian palate we've got sweet and we've got sour and then we have bitter: we use all our senses,"" says Ms Chan. Yee Kwan Chan believes people are now more willing to try unusual ice cream flavours With foreign travel and Asian food so popular, she's convinced that Asian-inspired flavours will be on the shop shelves in the US and Europe as a matter of course in a few years' time. But for that to happen at any scale, larger manufacturers will also need to get on board. Unilever, the world's largest producer, is open to the idea. They already make a myriad of flavours to suit local palates, including red bean Cornettos in China, a liquorice recipe for Scandinavia, and they've just launched a ""dung dung"" ice cream - based on an ""earthy"" tasting fruit - in Indonesia. Matt Close, Unilever's executive vice president of global ice cream, says they've always got an eye out for new flavours that might ""travel"". Unilever caters to local tastes with matcha (green tea) and red bean Cornettos More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: What makes this Kate Spade bag unusual? Where's hot? This summer's most popular holiday spots The lucrative world of 'the super tutor' Read more global trade series here. This year in India, the world's fastest growing ice cream market, they launched a kulfi ice cream, made with condensed milk and flavoured with rose water so it tastes a little like Turkish Delight. ""I'm absolutely convinced kulfi would work in the UK,"" says Mr Close. ""You'd start where there are big Indian communities, but there is no reason that wouldn't stretch."" While taro and red bean recipes might be harder to export, matcha (green tea) flavours seem likely to be at the forefront of any Asian invasion, he thinks. ""We've just launched a matcha ice cream in the Philippines. We'll take it to other markets. ""I'd put money on the idea that there'd be green tea ice cream or green tea ice lollies in most markets in the not too distant future."" Booza - also known as Dondurma (in Turkey), this is made with ground powdered orchid root and mastic gum. These ice creams melt more slowly and have a thicker, chewier texture.

Prince Philip to make final engagement,"This video can not be played Royal Marines cheered the Duke of Edinburgh outside Buckingham Palace The Duke of Edinburgh met Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement before he retires from royal duties. The 96-year-oldannounced his retirementin May, after decades of supporting the Queen as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations. Prince Philip has completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. Prime Minister Theresa May took to Twitter to thank him for ""a remarkable lifetime of service"". She added that she hoped he ""can now enjoy a well-earned retirement"". As Captain General of the Royal Marines, the duke attended a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge - a series of strength and endurance challenges raising funds and awareness for charity. Decades of royal duty Prince Philip's foreign travels in pictures Duke 'won't disappear into background' Prince Philip's gaffes from decades on royal duty While his diary of engagements will come to an end, Buckingham Palace has said the duke may still decide to attend certain events alongside the Queen in the future. The Queen's public schedule will continue as normal. Cpl Jamie Thompson, 31, who attended the event - which was held in the rain outside Buckingham Palace - said it was ""historic"". ""This is the duke's last royal engagement and we're a part of it, the Royal Marines are a part of it - so it's an absolute honour,"" he said. Cpl Thompson ran 1,664 miles over 100 days with Corporal Will Gingell, 33, as part of the challenge. The duke also met Sgt Matt Burley, a physical training instructor, who swam 1,664 lengths underwater over 10 days, and Lt Col Aldeiy Alderson, who ran 100km (62 miles) in 12 hours wearing his Royal Marines uniform After hearing about their exploits, he told the group of marines: ""You all should be locked up."" The duke was also handed the 1664 Global Challenge baton, before raising his hat and waving it to acknowledge three cheers in his honour. Prince Philip braved torrential rain outside Buckingham Palace Earlier, Lady Myra Butter, who has known Prince Philip since the age of eight or nine, told Radio 4's Today programme he was ""very spirited, a young normal boy full of fun... we loved when he came to stay"". Asked about what the duke would do next, she said: ""I'm sure that he won't disappear, he will be greatly missed by everybody. This video can not be played Prince Philip: Plaque unveiler extraordinaire ""He's been such a stable character in all our lives - he's always there and he's always been there for the Queen and I think we're very, very lucky to have him.""

Axing speed bumps to cut pollution 'is daft',"Seven road safety organisations have written to Environment Secretary Michael Gove about the plans Ripping up speed humps to combat air pollution is ""daft and irresponsible"", road safety campaigners have said. They are writing to ministers to warn that removing speed bumps will actually increase danger to children. The government said it would fund councils in England to tear out humps because they elevated pollution as drivers surged between them. Campaigners say the risk of accidents from speeding drivers almost certainly outweighs the long-term pollution risk. A government spokeswoman promised that road safety wouldn't be compromised by any changes. Safety organisations think the government's policy is motivated by the desire to appear pro-motorist at a time when drivers are aggrieved by possible restrictions on diesel cars. Diesel and petrol car ban 'not enough' Questions about the petrol and diesel car ban Living Streets, which campaigns for children to walk safely to school, says if councils remove road humps without installing other measures such as chicanes or speed cameras, it will deter children from walking and cycling. Instead, the group say, they will be taken to school in cars, which in turn will increase pollution while reducing exercise for children. Its spokeswoman Rachel Maycock, who has a three-year-old daughter, told BBC News: ""This idea is completely daft and irresponsible. ""Of course we all worry about the air our children breathe - but we also worry about reckless drivers going far too fast."" The group has written to protest to Environment Secretary Michael Gove, along with the Campaign for Better Transport and the cycle organisation Cycling UK. The campaigners say the government has misinterpreted guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The guidance says that ""where physical speed reduction measures are used to reduce road danger and injuries, consider using them to encourage drivers to maintain a reduced, steady pace along the whole stretch of road, rather than road humps that may increase acceleration and braking-related emissions"". Removing speed bumps will make it less likely children will walk to school, campaigners say A spokeswoman for NICE told BBC News: ""We don't say anything about ripping up road humps and getting rid of them - we just want to promote smoother driving. ""Whenever we make a recommendation about considering any measures other than speed humps, the media reports it as us recommending getting rid of speed humps - which we are not."" She said if councils were considering measures to slow traffic, average speed cameras might be more effective in some cases than humps. Seven safety groups contacted by BBC News all said the humps policy was a distraction from the real issue in the environment department's nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reduction strategy. They complained that the government had ignored advice from its own technical experts that the fastest way to lower pollution was by charging drivers of dirty vehicles to enter cities. Roger Geffen, from Cycling UK, said: ""While drawing up plans to tackle lethal air pollution, ministers received evidence that road user charging would be the most effective way. ""However, they said they'd rather councils removed speed humps instead. ""Far from reducing the annual death toll due to pollution, that would merely increase the numbers of people killed by speeding instead. ""Do we really need yet another court case before ministers heed the advice of their experts?"" NICE said its guidance was being misinterpreted Dr Adrian Davis, visiting professor of health and transport at the University of the West of England, told BBC News: ""The fact is, numerous studies had shown that unless drivers are forced to slow down by physical obstacles like road humps they will continue to drive too fast in residential areas. ""Scrapping humps without replacing them with some other form of physical measures would be both ridiculous and dangerous."" But Hugh Bladon, from the Alliance of British Drivers, welcomed the decision to fund the removal of humps, saying that they would inevitably increase pollution and reduce fuel efficiency because many drivers would accelerate away from them. ""It needs better education for drivers to drive smoothly and safely, rather than road humps,"" he told BBC News. ""I admit I don't know how you would achieve that."" A government spokeswoman promised that road safety wouldn't be compromised by any changes and said councils were being asked to tackle pollution ""in a way that meets the needs of their communities"". ""Reducing roadside pollution is a priority for this government - which is why we have committed Â£3bn to help towns and cities take action against harmful emissions caused by dirty diesels,"" she added. ""Local authorities have access to a wide range of options as they develop plans to address roadside pollution in a way that meets the needs of their communities - both pedestrians and road users.""

Why are there so many TV shows about TV shows?,"The first proper trailer for The Morning Show was released on Monday One of the most popular subjects for TV shows in recent years has been TV shows themselves. Whether it's 30 Rock, The Newsroom or Episodes, audience appetite for series which go behind the scenes of the media industry seems higher than ever. But are they genuinely popular with the public, or does the media just love a story about itself? Thefirst full-length trailer for The Morning Show,external, the latest programme about a programme, was released on Monday ahead of its broadcast launch this autumn. The Apple TV series tells the story of a breakfast show host (played by Jennifer Aniston), whose co-presenter (Steve Carell) is fired after sexual misconduct allegations. As bosses scramble to find her a new co-host, a rivalry emerges between Aniston's character and a newer presenter (played by Reese Witherspoon) - all while the show itself struggles to stay relevant in an era of immediate and 24-hour news. Apple have poured a lot of money into the series ahead of the launch of their streaming service later this year.According to The Financial Times,external, the company committed more than $6bn (Â£4.96bn) in total for original films and TV shows, including several hundred million for The Morning Show. Emma Thompson played a chat show host in Late Night The Aniston series is the latest in a whole host of TV shows to take an audience behind the camera - which raises the question of why viewers find them so fascinating. (Several films have also recently tackled the subject, like 2011's Morning Glory with Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton, and Late Night starring Emma Thompson, released earlier this year.) ""We all consume TV news, but it's quite hard to actually see behind it because it has to look so professional,"" says BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty. ""But the characters you find behind the scenes are so interesting."" One criticism that has been levelled at dramas and sitcoms set behind the camera is that they are just navel-gazing - the media obsessed with itself yet again. ""There's always that risk,"" Munchetty says, ""But I think if you're really into politics you'll watch The Thick of It and The West Wing, and similarly if you love TV or news, you'd enjoy something like this as well. ""Look how many medical programmes there are, or shows about lawyers or the police - we're fascinated by certain industries whether we work in them or not."" Munchetty has presented BBC Breakfast since 2014 Critics have often praised these shows - albeit more so for their scripts and characterisation than their settings. ""Studio 60, like 30 Rock, is better when it's not about network television, but about the people who happen to work inside it,""wrote Alessandra Stanley in The New York Times,externalin 2006, the year both shows hit the airwaves. ""And at their best, the two shows are unequalled by anything else on network television."" Looking ahead to Aniston's new show, Munchetty is confident the writers won't be short of material. ""Lots of stuff happens behind the scenes that is amusing,"" she says. ""Guests and presenters sneaking in, slurps of tea being hurriedly swallowed when it's supposed to be be our turn to talk. ""Correspondents trying to tell the story when members of the public are interfering with their job - making noise, pulling funny faces and so on."" The BBC Breakfast presenters themselves even have a tough time holding things together - regularly falling intofits of giggles, much to the delight of viewers. Vanessa Williams (pictured with Jillian Hervey of Lion Babe) stars in Daytime Divas Daytime Divas- VH1 series which sees Vanessa Williams play the creator and executive producer of a lunchtime talk show The Newsroom- HBO series written by Aaron Sorkin set in, well, a newsroom, starring Jeff Daniels and Dev Patel 30 Rock- Tina Fey's NBC comedy series set behind the scenes of a fictional live sketch comedy show The Hour- A BBC Two drama set in the 1950s, written by Abi Morgan and starring Dominic West Episodes- BBC comedy starring Matt LeBlanc about two British TV writers who take their sitcom to the US Studio 60 on the Sunset StripandSports Night- Two more TV shows written by Sorkin, set on a Saturday night comedy sketch show and a cable sports programme respectively The Larry Sanders Show, which aired in the 1990s, is seen by many as a classic of the genre. Going slightly further back -The Mary Tyler Moore Showwas so popular in the 1970s it led tothree spin-offs ""Sometimes the audience catches our slip-ups and likes to get a bit of insight - the ability to roll with the mistakes makes the job easier,"" Munchetty says. ""In fact, one of the things I learned was if you make a mistake, you laugh it off, because we're all human, and it can often seem like people reading the news are one step removed from everyone else."" The questions presenters get asked every day by members of the public are perhaps proof of how interested viewers are in the process of putting TV shows together. ""'What time do you wake up? Who's your favourite person to work with? What time do you go to bed?' People love to know the most difficult guests and things like that,"" Munchetty laughs. Dev Patel and Alison Pill starred in The Newsroom But presenting a TV news programme is a lot harder than it looks, she adds. ""This new series would need to show that it understands how much work is needed to be able to appear breezy and relaxed first thing in the morning,"" says Munchetty. ""If you know your stuff you can be very relaxed. You're never allowed to moan about being tired - everyone there is so there's no point talking about it."" Munchetty jokes there would be a fair few storylines to be written about ""guests who turn it on for the camera but off camera are as cold as ice"". Piers Morgan: Breaking the breakfast TV rules One trap that shows based in newsrooms can easily fall into is presenting a sanitised version of a job that isn't as glamorous as it looks. The Guardian's Brian Moylan,externalwas among the critics who felt HBO's The Newsroom was a little preachy and idealistic. ""The problem with Sorkin's fatally flawed mission is that it could never exist in the real world,"" he wrote. Munchetty herself points out that one of the many pitfalls a show like this could fall into would be for it to ""become farcical"". 30 Rock ran for 138 episodes before the series ended in 2013 ""Don't forget we are journalists and have to cover serious stories every day,"" she says. ""We are one of the first sources of news for families and must make sure we are accurate, accessible and timely. We have to finely balance the need to be serious and fun - not always easy as we are led by the news of the day. ""As breakfast presenters, we're part of people's lives. We are there while the audience is getting on with their day, while they have their routine, and so you have to be really aware that people feel they know you."" Asked whether she might watch Aniston's new show, she jokes: ""Yes - as long as is not on too late in the evening!""
