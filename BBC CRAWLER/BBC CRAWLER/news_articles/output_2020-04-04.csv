Queen to urge 'self-discipline and resolve',"The Queen will reflect on the ""enormous changes"" to daily life The Queen is to stress the value of self-discipline and resolve during the coronavirus pandemic in a special address to the nation on Sunday. In a rare speech, she will acknowledge the grief, pain and financial difficulties Britons are facing during this ""time of disruption"". She will also thank NHS staff and key workers, and emphasise the important role individuals can play. Her address will be broadcast on TV, radio and social media at 20:00 BST. The Queen is expected to say: ""I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. ""A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all."" LIVE UPDATES:US braced for surge in deaths A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health She will add: ""I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. ""And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. ""That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country."" Why the Queen's message will be about unity Four times the Queen has addressed the nation The message was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment, with all the other technical staff in another room. It will be intended to reassure and rally people, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. The decision to deliver the address has been made ""in close consultation with Downing Street"", he added. The number of deaths in the UK reached 4,313 on Saturday - up by 708 on Friday's figure. The Queen's address will come less than a week after the Prince of Walescame out of self-isolation, following his diagnosis of coronavirus.

Spain 'close to passing peak' as deaths fall again,"This video can not be played Inside the ICU in one of Spain's biggest hospitals Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez says the country is ""close to passing the peak of infections"" as the number of coronavirus deaths fell for the second day in a row. Mr SÃ¡nchez also extended lockdown measures until 25 April, saying the restrictions were ""saving lives"". The toll of 809 deaths in one day is the lowest in Spain for a week. Meanwhile, officials are trying to get masks for all citizens as part of plans to eventually ease restrictions. Face masks are currently almost impossible to get hold of in Spain. The government had previously said they served little purpose outside hospitals. However, views on wearing masks appear to be shifting in Western countries, with US health authorities on Friday recommending their use in public. Austria, the Czech Republic, Israel and Turkey have also mandated the use of masks in various public places. Live virus updates from around the world Globally, more than 60,000 people have died in the pandemic and more than 1.1 million have been infected, Johns Hopkins University in the US says. Officials say 7,026 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in Spain in the past 24 hours - down from Friday's figure of 7,472. A total of 11,744 people have died, while the total number of cases - 124,736 - is now higher than in Italy. Addressing the nation, Mr SÃ¡nchez said extending the lockdown for two weeks was necessary to give the health service time to recover. ""These are the most difficult days of our lives,"" he said. Once the number of new infections was under control a ""progressive return to a new normal"" would get under way to rebuild the economy, he said. New hygiene, detection and tracing measures would be in place. Lockdown measures will be in force until 25 April He also called for European unity to tackle the economic consequences of the pandemic. ""Europe must not fail this time,"" he said. ""It is clear that the Spanish economy will have to go into debt and we will have to take resources from future generations to tackle the pandemic,"" he added. So far the EU has been unable to agree on a plan to share out coronavirus-incurred debt in the form of special bonds - dubbed coronabonds - despite pleas from Spain, Italy, France and others. Coronavirus outbreak eats into EU unity The Madrid region has been Spain's worst affected area. Care homes have seen large-scale outbreaks leading to a collapse in staffing. In two facilities alone there are reports of almost 90 deaths linked to the crisis. Last month the military was called in to help at retirement homes and found elderly patients abandoned and, in some cases, dead in their beds.

The total number of people who have died in hospitals is now 4,313. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pregnant fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds said she had spent several days in bed with symptoms of the virus. She said she was ""on the mend"" after seven days of rest. Mr Johnson tested positive for the virus last week and has been conducting cabinet meetings via video link. Italy has seen its first drop in the number of patients in intensive care during the outbreak. The number of new deaths - 681 - has taken the country's death toll to 15,362 but is smaller than in previous days. China observed a three-minute silence in remembrance of more than 3,000 people who died of coronavirus in the country. In Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, all traffic lights turned red temporarily. New York has recorded 630 more virus deaths, another daily record that takes its overall toll to 3,565. Most deaths have been in New York City. The state now has almost as many cases - over 113,000 - as the whole of Italy. Governor Andrew Cuomo said infections could peak in between four and 14 days.

Five bus workers die after contracting coronavirus,"Five London bus workers have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus Five London bus workers have died after contracting coronavirus. Unite said their members had been doing ""a heroic job in getting NHS and care workers to their places of work"" and described the loss as a ""tragedy"". Regional secretary Peter Kavanagh said the union would be assisting families ""in every possible way"". Transport for London (TfL) said it was ""extremely saddened"" by the deaths, while mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""absolutely devastated"". It is understood three were drivers and two were controllers. Unite said it had contacted Mr Khan, who shared its view ""that bus drivers must be fully protected"". ""We are absolutely committed to doing everything in our power to make the driving of buses safe during this unprecedented crisis,"" said Mr Kavanagh. Vehicles are being deep-cleaned and safety measures are in place Current safety measures include deep-cleaning vehicles, erecting screens around the driver, providing hand sanitiser and blocking off the seats closest to the driver. Mr Khan said he will continue to make enhancements across public transport in London to ensure there are even higher levels of protection. ""My thoughts are with their friends and families at this awful time,"" he said. ""I have been clear that our incredible public transport staff, on the buses, tubes, trams and trains, are critical workers, making a heroic effort to allow our NHS staff to save more lives. ""But we all need to play our part too and that means fewer Londoners using the public transport network. Please follow the rules. Stay at home and do not use public transport unless it is absolutely unavoidable."" Sadiq Khan is asking people to only travel on public transport if absolutely necessary Gareth Powell, TfL's managing director for surface transport, said they had been offering the bus companies for whom the drivers worked ""every support possible"". ""The safety of our staff and customers is our absolute priority and we have been working closely with the bus companies, the mayor and Unite to implement a range of changes and improvements to keep the bus network and garages safe for those operating and using it, in accordance with Public Health England advice.""

"Coronavirus: Up to 4,000 inmates to be freed","Up to 4,000 prisoners in England and Wales are to be released in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus, the Ministry of Justice has said. Inmates with two months or less still to serve will be released on temporary licence in stages. The selected low-risk offenders will be electronically tagged and can be recalled at the first sign of concern. It is seen as a way to avoid thousands of prisoners - many of whom share cells - becoming infected. Across 29 jails, 88 prisoners have tested positive for the virus with a further 1,200 believed to be self-isolating. Sex offenders and those convicted of violent or sexual offences, as well as anyone who is a national security concern or a danger to children, will not be considered for release, the Prison Service said. No inmate convicted of Covid-19-related offences - including coughing at emergency workers or stealing personal protective equipment - will be eligible either, said the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). N. Ireland: 100 prisoners to be released Almost a quarter of Scottish prison staff absent from work Second HMP Littlehey inmate dies Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland QC said: ""This government is committed to ensuring that justice is served to those who break the law. ""But this is an unprecedented situation because if coronavirus takes hold in our prisons, the NHS could be overwhelmed and more lives put at risk."" The MoJ also said no prisoners with symptoms of coronavirus would be released, nor would those who do not have housing and health support in place. Mr Buckland previously announced that pregnant inmates could be granted temporary release to protect them and their unborn children from coronavirus. Mothers behind bars with their children who pass the same checks could also be released, he said. The legislation for the measures is expected to be put in place on Monday. This is the last thing Boris Johnson's government ever wanted to do. In their general election manifesto, the Conservatives promised criminals would be ""kept off our streets"". Since then, a series of measures have been announced to ensure those convicted of the most serious crimes - including terrorism - stay behind bars for longer. So an emergency early release scheme, which means that almost 5% of the prison population of England and Wales will be let out before they've even reached the halfway point of their sentence, was not an easy decision for Number 10 to make. More politically palatable options were considered, such as transferring prisoners to army bases and immigration removal centres, but they are fraught with practical difficulties. The danger for the government of this scheme - the largest since 80,000 offenders were let out early as part of Labour's End of Custody Licence programme between 2007 and 2010 - is that some of those released will commit further, possibly horrendous, crimes. Ultimately, ministers decided the alternative - infected prisoners overwhelming hospitals - was even worse. The prisons union welcomed the news but raised concerns over staff pressure. About 8,000 prison staff have been absent due to issues related to Covid-19, around a quarter of the total workforce. Ian Lawrence, general secretary of trade union Napo, said its members working in the National Probation Service and in community rehabilitation companies were ""already over-stretched"". ""Probation providers must work to ensure this new cohort can be supervised safely and not cause additional operational pressure and stress to the workforce,"" he added.

Masts set on fire over false 5G coronavirus claims,"Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside Mobile phone mast fires are being investigated amid conspiracy theories claiming a link between 5G and coronavirus. There have been fires at masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling in Merseyside. A video, allegedly of the blaze in Aigburth, was shared on YouTube and Facebook, claiming a link between the mobile technology and Covid-19. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said it was ""dangerous nonsense"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said on Twitter ""there is absolutely no credible evidence"" of a link, while trade body Mobile UK said such rumours and conspiracy theories were ""concerning"".

Merseyside Police said an investigation is under way after the telecommunications box in Aigburth caught fire on Friday. A video of what appears to be the incident, which happened shortly after 22:00 BST, was shared on YouTube. Verification from the BBC's disinformation team suggests the video is authentic, however, it is unclear whether the box has anything to do with 5G technology. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said it is also investigating a blaze it extinguished at a 5G mast in the village of Melling, north of Liverpool, on Friday night. West Midlands Fire Service said the fire in Birmingham involved a 70ft tower on a telecommunications site. However, it said the cause was yet to be identified and it could not confirm the mast was 5G. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ""We're aware of a fire involving a phone mast, but are awaiting further details on its cause."" Does 5G pose health risks? Coronavirus: Fake news is spreading fast Live updates: Coronavirus in England At the government's daily coronavirus briefing earlier, Mr Gove said conspiracy theories linking 5G with Covid-19 were ""just nonsense, dangerous nonsense as well."" NHS Director Stephen Powis told the press conference 5G infrastructure is critical both to the general population who are being asked to stay at home and to the healthcare response to the virus. ""I'm absolutely outraged and disgusted that people would be taking action against the infrastructure we need to tackle this emergency,"" he said. Mobile UK said key workers had suffered abuse and threats from people about damaging infrastructure under the pretence of claims about 5G. ""This is not acceptable and only impacts on our ability as an industry to maintain the resilience and operational capacity of the networks to support mass home working and critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals."" By Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. One suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Can the UK do 100,000 coronavirus tests a day?","The UK government has promised it will dramatically increase coronavirus testing to 100,000 a day by the end of the month. It has been criticised for not testing more people already, as countries like Germany have managed to reach 50,000 tests a day. Daily coronavirus testing passed 10,000 people a day across the UK on Thursday 2 April - so how can capacity be increased tenfold in just four weeks? There are lots of different pieces to the puzzle when it comes to making large-scale testing work. You need the laboratory space as well as enough, and the right kind of, machines. You need the right reagents - highly specific substances used to extract the virus's genetic material and to make it easier to study. How does testing compare across the UK? Why does testing matter? You need staff to take the swabs from patients' noses or throats, and staff in labs to process the tests. And you need the logistics in place to get samples from patients to labs. We're talking about diagnostic tests to find out if you have the virus here - ones that involve a nose or throat swab that has to be sent off to a lab. Antibody tests use blood to look for evidence you've already had the virus - but these are unlikely to be available on a large enough scale in time to be part of the 100,000 target. A drive-through testing centre for NHS staff has been set up in the car park of a branch of Ikea At first, only a small number of public health laboratories were being used to do coronavirus tests. In the past fortnight, this was extended to a further 40 NHS labs around the UK. Now the government is saying it will start to use the lab capacity of private companies to carry out coronavirus tests. The UK has a large pharmaceutical and biomedical industry whose capacity could ""easily"" allow the country to do many more tests than it is now, according to Dr Rupert Beale, who has been involved in developing a diagnostic test for coronavirus at the Francis Crick Institute, which will be made available to NHS staff in the area. But so far, this industry hasn't been tapped into, he said. As well as labs, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government would now call on UK-based ""pharmaceutical giants"" GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca to make the reagents necessary to carry out the tests. The UK has faced problems getting hold of the relevant reagents, which have been in high global demand. This has been a global problem, but some countries were in a better position than others. The decision was made to centralise the UK's testing effort to a small number of public health labs, and this position only began to shift in the last couple of weeks. Part of being able to scale up means ""being willing to cede a little control over where, how and by whom the tests are conducted in order to increase capacity and decrease turnaround times"", according to Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh. The two countries seen as the biggest testing success stories, Germany and South Korea, made many more labs available from an earlier stage - three times as many in Germany and two-thirds more in South Korea when adjusted for population size. In South Korea, walk-in testing centres were quickly set up There has also been a question of the availability of testing kits, including the reagents needed to study the virus once on a swab. While some components have been in short supply worldwide, South Korea acted faster than the UK in developing a test, and was able to stockpile materials. Germany benefited from home-grown diagnostics and manufacturing companies which gave it first access to raw materials and new technology. Some of the disparities now are down to structural differences in countries' testing capacity that pre-date the pandemic, according to Prof John Newton at Public Health England, who will oversee the government's testing plan. Massive virology labs were set up in South Korea in the wake of the 2003 Sars outbreak, he said, while Germany was already a large global testing base. At first, 10,000 tests were promised by the end of March, rising to 25,000 by the end of April. Now the government has quadrupled its pledge to 100,000. It didn't quite meet its first pledge, breaking the 10,000 mark two days late on 2 April. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:How to self-isolate and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Monday 30 March, as its deadline approached, Public Health England tweeted that it had reached the capacity to do 10,000 tests - although that number hadn't yet been carried out. And the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) began to talk about the number of tests as opposed to the number of people tested - higher since some people need more than one swab to check their results. Previously it had only published figures referring to the (lower) number of people tested. A DHSC spokesperson said the 100,000 promise referred to tests, not people.

Sir Keir Starmer has just become Labour leader - but what is likely to be at the top of his in-tray? Even before the coronavirus emergency, Jeremy Corbyn's successor was facing a formidable set of challenges. Read here aboutfive challenges facing Labour's new leader. Labour's new deputy leader, Angela Rayner, thanks everyone ""from the bottom of [her] heart"" for their support. On Twitter, she promises to do ""everything to repay your trust"". She adds: ""I know we face a long and difficult road ahead, but itâs our responsibility to offer the better future that the citizens of our country deserve."" The National Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement calls for the election of the new leadership team to ""mark a turning point"" for the Labour Party when it comes to the row over anti-Semitism. Mike Katz says ""nobody should be under any illusion"", as restoring trust with the community will ""take effort, time and political will"". He adds: ""We need to see strong, moral leadership on the vital task of ridding the Labour Party of anti-Semitism from the outset and changing a toxic culture that tolerates racism."" Mr Katz says his organisation will ""work constructively with the new leadership team"" and they were ""encouraged"" by pledges from both Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner. But he adds: âThe past five years have without doubt been one of the darkest times for Jewish Labour members and supporters. ""We will dare to be optimistic that the party can once again be a safe place for Jews, but we are equally clear that this is just the beginning of that process.â It is not just Jeremy Corbyn who has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer on his election.

Sir Keir Starmer may have been in the job for less than two hours, but he has already been onto the phone to the prime minister to talk about the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesman for the new Labour leader says he accepted an earlier offer from Boris Johnson to meet next week to discuss the outbreak, as well as agreeing arrangements on the Privy Council - a formal body of advisers to the Queen, which the leader of the opposition is entitled to join. The spokesman adds: ""Keir offered to work constructively with the government on how best to respond to the coronavirus outbreak."" Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner on their election victories. Writing on Twitter,external, he says: ""Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility. ""I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country."" Angela Rayner has been elected Labourâs new deputy leader. She has been a long-standing member of Jeremy Corbynâs cabinet, but will now hold one of the key jobs in the party. So how did she get to this point? You can read our full profile here. Ian Blackford and Sir Ed Davey have both congratulated the new Labour leader The other opposition parties in Westminster have offered their congratulations to Sir Keir Starmer on his election as Labour leader. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, says it is ""vital opposition parties work together effectively to hold the UK government to account - and ensure people get the support they need in the coronavirus crisis"". He appeals to Sir Keir to support SNP pledges on financial support during the outbreak and its calls to pause trade negotiations with the EU. And he adds a warning: ""Support for Labour has collapsed in Scotland. If they are ever to regain trust, they must stop ignoring Scotland's wishes and respect our democratic right to choose our own future."" The Liberal Democrats' acting leader, Sir Ed Davey, also pledges to work with Sir Keir to hold the government to account over its response to coronavirus. He says his party will always work with others when it comes to ""pursuing our liberal values"". He adds: ""As the chapter closes on one Labour leader, we hope the new one can see the Labour party play a constructive role in building an effective multi-party opposition. That will be the litmus test of Keir Starmerâs leadership."" As we reported earlier, Sir Keir Starmer won the Labour leadership contest on first preference votes - but who voted for him? The electorate was made up of party members, supporters of affiliated organisations and registered supporters who paid Â£25 to take part. Sir Keir's support was strongest among the registered supporters, where he hoovered up a massive 78% of the vote. His next best result came among party members themselves, where he got 56% of the votes. His weakest base of support came among members of affiliated groups - where he won a more slender majority of 53% of votes cast. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Whatever your own politics, this is a really big moment. Labour could now be an opposition that gets things done and carries out effective scrutiny - Labour under Corbyn struggled ever to do that. Keir Starmer has a massive task to get the party to start working in that way again, and make it function in a way that's anything like normal. He's said he has a ""mountain to climb,"" but you could argue it's like crossing the Himalayas without oxygen. But the party is huge, and Jeremy Corbyn created a massive membership base. At December's election, many expressed no particular affection for the Conservatives but were unimpressed with Labour on Brexit, and simply couldn't imagine Mr Corbyn on the steps of Downing Street. Nothing is inevitable about the 2024 election. But Keir Starmer's first steps in these first few weeks will matter enormously. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Masts set on fire over false 5G coronavirus claimsMobile networks say theories linking coronavirus to 5G are ""baseless"".England","Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside Mobile phone mast fires are being investigated amid conspiracy theories claiming a link between 5G and coronavirus. There have been fires at masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling in Merseyside. A video, allegedly of the blaze in Aigburth, was shared on YouTube and Facebook, claiming a link between the mobile technology and Covid-19. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said it was ""dangerous nonsense"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said on Twitter ""there is absolutely no credible evidence"" of a link, while trade body Mobile UK said such rumours and conspiracy theories were ""concerning"".

Merseyside Police said an investigation is under way after the telecommunications box in Aigburth caught fire on Friday. A video of what appears to be the incident, which happened shortly after 22:00 BST, was shared on YouTube. Verification from the BBC's disinformation team suggests the video is authentic, however, it is unclear whether the box has anything to do with 5G technology. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said it is also investigating a blaze it extinguished at a 5G mast in the village of Melling, north of Liverpool, on Friday night. West Midlands Fire Service said the fire in Birmingham involved a 70ft tower on a telecommunications site. However, it said the cause was yet to be identified and it could not confirm the mast was 5G. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ""We're aware of a fire involving a phone mast, but are awaiting further details on its cause."" Does 5G pose health risks? Coronavirus: Fake news is spreading fast Live updates: Coronavirus in England At the government's daily coronavirus briefing earlier, Mr Gove said conspiracy theories linking 5G with Covid-19 were ""just nonsense, dangerous nonsense as well."" NHS Director Stephen Powis told the press conference 5G infrastructure is critical both to the general population who are being asked to stay at home and to the healthcare response to the virus. ""I'm absolutely outraged and disgusted that people would be taking action against the infrastructure we need to tackle this emergency,"" he said. Mobile UK said key workers had suffered abuse and threats from people about damaging infrastructure under the pretence of claims about 5G. ""This is not acceptable and only impacts on our ability as an industry to maintain the resilience and operational capacity of the networks to support mass home working and critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals."" By Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. One suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Whisky production to resume despite virus fearsFirms which suspended work in the wake of the outbreak ask staff to come back, unions claim.","A number of whisky bottling plants which suspended work due to coronavirus are set to reopen. The GMB Scotland union says facilities owned by Edrington, Inver House and North British have approached staff about coming back to work. Other firms in the whisky and spirits industry, such as Diageo and Grants, have kept open plants with scaled-back operations. Trade unions argue that all production should be halted due to Covid-19. Edrington said a ""controlled restart"" with a significantly reduced number of staff would allow it to sustain the business and help safeguard employment. While its bottling facilities in Glasgow and Speyside will re-open on Monday the company's distilleries will remain closed for at least three months. The development comes as a survey of GMB Scotland members in the sector found just 18% believed that adequate social distancing measures were being followed in their workplace. Keir Greenaway, GMB Scotland organiser for the whisky and spirits sector, said some his members had also reported getting abuse from members of the public for going to work. He said: ""The ones that were shut are now looking to reopen because they look around and see that others have not followed them in taking the sensible approach in suspending operations. Workers are anxious and scared. ""They don't have confidence their health and wellbeing can be protected by their employers. ""The public health guidelines exist for good reasons; to stop the spread of this deadly virus and to save lives. Yet whisky and spirits giants think its business as usual in the midst of a killer pandemic."" About 700 members responded to the GMB Scotland survey issued last weekend over email, with only 7% of respondents stating they should continue producing whisky during the coronavirus lockdown. A further 89% of workers said their families had expressed concern that they were still working during the lockdown. The trade union wants the Scottish government to force the suspension of production. Edrington's portfolio includes The Macallan and The Famous Grouse Edrington said it has worked closely with union representatives on its plans to reopen and highlighted the fact it is also producing hand sanitiser at its Glasgow site. A spokesman said: ""Our start-up teams will be made up of those with no underlying health issues individually or within their household, and don't rely on public transport. ""Although we already go beyond government guidelines, we have introduced new enhanced social distancing and hygiene measures as part of our restart plan to ensure the health and safety of our people.â¯"" The company suspended its operations on 25 March to allow it to get clarity onâ¯advice from both the UK and Scottish governments. No one from North Bridge or Inver House was available for comment. The Scotch Whisky Association said those companies continuing to operate were doing so with ""significantly scaled-back operations"" and in ""rigorous compliance"" with social distancing guidelines. A spokesman said: ""The UK government has also made clear that food and drink production, including alcohol, are essential services and that manufacturing should continue where appropriate safety and social distancing protocols can be put in place in order to re-stock supermarkets and off-licences that remain open during the crisis."" The SWA said about 12 million litres of ethanol would be produced for about 50 million bottles of hand sanitiser in the next two months. The spokesman added: ""This is not business as usual.

"US accused of âpiracyâ over mask âconfiscationâBerlin officials say 200,000 masks have been diverted to the US under a law invoked by Donald Trump.World","President Trump has invoked a Korean War-era law to demand that US firms provide more masks The US has been accused of redirecting 200,000 Germany-bound masks for its own use, in a move condemned as ""modern piracy"". The local government in Berlin said the shipment of US-made masks was ""confiscated"" in Bangkok. The FFP2 masks, which were ordered by Berlin's police force, did not reach their destination, it said. Andreas Geisel, Berlin's interior minister, said the masks were presumably diverted to the US. The US company that makes the masks, 3M, has been prohibited from exporting its medical products to other countries under a Korean-War-era law invoked by President Donald Trump. Should more of us wear face masks? Why some countries wear face masks and others don't Coronavirus: Are homemade face masks safe? On Friday, Mr Trump said he was using the Defence Production Act to demand that US firms provide more medical supplies to meet domestic demand. ""We need these items immediately for domestic use. We have to have them,"" Mr Trump said at the daily Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House. President Trump said medical supplies being diverted from abroad were needed urgently in the US He said US authorities had taken custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks and 600,000 gloves. He did not say where they were taken into US hands. Mr Geisel saidthe diversion of masks from Berlin amounted to an ""act of modern piracy"",external, urging the Trump administration to adhere to international trading rules. ""This is not how you deal with transatlantic partners,"" the minister said. ""Even in times of global crisis, there should be no wild-west methods."" Mr Geisel's comments echo the sentiments of other European officials, who have complained about the buying and diversion practices of the US. In France, for example, regional leaders say they are struggling to secure medical supplies as American buyers outbid them. The president of the Ãle-de-France region, ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, compared the scramble for masks to a ""treasure hunt"". 3M has been ordered to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks ""I found a stock of masks that was available and Americans - I'm not talking about the American government - but Americans, outbid us,"" Ms PÃ©cresse said. ""They offered three times the price and they proposed to pay up-front."" As the coronavirus pandemic worsens, demand for crucial medical supplies, such as masks and respirators, has surged worldwide. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

At present, the WHO advises that masks do not provide sufficient protection from infection to justify mass usage. But some countries have taken a different view, including the US. On Friday, Mr Trump announced that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) will now recommend that Americans use non-medical, cloth face coverings to help prevent the spread of the virus. New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio has urged residents to cover their faces when outside The US has 273,880 recorded cases of Covid-19, the highest number in the world by a large margin. Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, has affected more than one million people and killed almost 60,000 globally, the latest figures show. In a separate development, 3M said the Trump administration had asked it to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks to Canada and Latin America. READ MORE:US 'wants 3M to end mask exports to Canada and Latin America' The request had ""significant humanitarian implications"", the company warned, and could prompt other countries to act in kind. The company says it manufactures about 100 million N95 masks per month - about a third are made in the US, and the rest produced overseas. President Trump said he had used the Defence Production Act to ""hit 3M hard"", without providing additional details. The law dates back to 1950 and allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence.

Labour prepares to announce new leader,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn's Labour leadership in two minutes The winner of the three-month contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader will be announced on Saturday. Sir Keir Starmer is the favourite to be elected in a ballot of party members, trade unionists and other supporters. The ex-director of public prosecutions, who became an MP in 2015, is up against fellow shadow cabinet member Rebecca Long-Bailey and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy. The party will also choose a new deputy leader, with education spokeswoman Angela Rayner seen as the frontrunner. The results of both elections are due to be announced at 10.45 BST. Live updates: New Labour leader announcement Corbyn was 'vilified' as Labour leader, says wife Jackie Baillie elected Scottish Labour deputy Members will learn the outcome via e-mail and the media after a plannedspecial conference to unveil the winner was cancelled due the coronavirus pandemic. The candidates for leader have each been asked to record victory speeches, one of which will be released alongside details of how many votes each candidate received. The process of choosing a new leader began in December after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row. All three candidates have said the party must put the divisions of recent years behind it Mr Corbyn said he would stand down after the party secured its lowest number of seats since 1935. Six candidates initially entered the contest but Clive Lewis, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry either dropped out or were eliminated before the final ballot got underway on 24 February. Sir Keir, who served in Mr Corbyn's top team for more than three years as shadow Brexit secretary, emerged early on as the frontrunner after securing the most backing from MPs and local Labour branches. The lawyer, who led the Crown Prosecution Service before entering politics, argued that he was best equipped to unite different wings of the party after years of internal infighting. LIVE: Labour leadership announcement Who will be Labour's next leader? 100 years of Labour in charts All the candidates have said rooting out anti-Semitism in the party and reconnecting with ""left-behind"" voters in traditional heartlands, who backed Brexit, must be a priority if Labour is to rebuild trust and map a path back to power. Among those eligible to cast their votes in the leadership and deputy leadership ballots were 114,000 new members who joined since the election. Members of affiliated trades unions and other affiliated groups were also able to take part, as well as about 14,700 ""registered supporters"" who paid Â£25 to take part on a one-off basis. Both ballots used a preferential system, with members ranking the candidates in order of preference. If one candidate fails to get more than half the first preference votes, the second preference votes of the lowest-ranked candidate will be redistributed until the contest produced a winner. The other candidates vying to become deputy leader are shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon.

He claims Sir Keir has ""yet to show that he is an inspirational leader"" and that his ""ambiguity has served him well"". Our political editor says that during the campaign, Sir Keir Starmer promised jobs for the others in the leadership race in his shadow cabinet. She adds: ""It sounds like he will favour the rising generation for big jobs, rather than bringing back people who have already had ministerial experience into big roles, but let's see. ""The  rumour mill is turning already."" Now Sir Keir Starmer is in charge of the Labour Party, the next step is to appoint his new top team.

Even before the coronavirus emergency, Jeremy Corbyn's successor was facing a formidable set of challenges. Read here aboutfive challenges facing Labour's new leader. Labour's new deputy leader, Angela Rayner, thanks everyone ""from the bottom of [her] heart"" for their support. On Twitter, she promises to do ""everything to repay your trust"". She adds: ""I know we face a long and difficult road ahead, but itâs our responsibility to offer the better future that the citizens of our country deserve."" The National Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement calls for the election of the new leadership team to ""mark a turning point"" for the Labour Party when it comes to the row over anti-Semitism. Mike Katz says ""nobody should be under any illusion"", as restoring trust with the community will ""take effort, time and political will"". He adds: ""We need to see strong, moral leadership on the vital task of ridding the Labour Party of anti-Semitism from the outset and changing a toxic culture that tolerates racism."" Mr Katz says his organisation will ""work constructively with the new leadership team"" and they were ""encouraged"" by pledges from both Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner. But he adds: âThe past five years have without doubt been one of the darkest times for Jewish Labour members and supporters. ""We will dare to be optimistic that the party can once again be a safe place for Jews, but we are equally clear that this is just the beginning of that process.â It is not just Jeremy Corbyn who has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer on his election.

Sir Keir Starmer may have been in the job for less than two hours, but he has already been onto the phone to the prime minister to talk about the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesman for the new Labour leader says he accepted an earlier offer from Boris Johnson to meet next week to discuss the outbreak, as well as agreeing arrangements on the Privy Council - a formal body of advisers to the Queen, which the leader of the opposition is entitled to join. The spokesman adds: ""Keir offered to work constructively with the government on how best to respond to the coronavirus outbreak."" Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner on their election victories. Writing on Twitter,external, he says: ""Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility. ""I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country."" Angela Rayner has been elected Labourâs new deputy leader. She has been a long-standing member of Jeremy Corbynâs cabinet, but will now hold one of the key jobs in the party. So how did she get to this point? You can read our full profile here. Ian Blackford and Sir Ed Davey have both congratulated the new Labour leader The other opposition parties in Westminster have offered their congratulations to Sir Keir Starmer on his election as Labour leader. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, says it is ""vital opposition parties work together effectively to hold the UK government to account - and ensure people get the support they need in the coronavirus crisis"". He appeals to Sir Keir to support SNP pledges on financial support during the outbreak and its calls to pause trade negotiations with the EU. And he adds a warning: ""Support for Labour has collapsed in Scotland. If they are ever to regain trust, they must stop ignoring Scotland's wishes and respect our democratic right to choose our own future."" The Liberal Democrats' acting leader, Sir Ed Davey, also pledges to work with Sir Keir to hold the government to account over its response to coronavirus. He says his party will always work with others when it comes to ""pursuing our liberal values"". He adds: ""As the chapter closes on one Labour leader, we hope the new one can see the Labour party play a constructive role in building an effective multi-party opposition. That will be the litmus test of Keir Starmerâs leadership."" As we reported earlier, Sir Keir Starmer won the Labour leadership contest on first preference votes - but who voted for him? The electorate was made up of party members, supporters of affiliated organisations and registered supporters who paid Â£25 to take part. Sir Keir's support was strongest among the registered supporters, where he hoovered up a massive 78% of the vote. His next best result came among party members themselves, where he got 56% of the votes. His weakest base of support came among members of affiliated groups - where he won a more slender majority of 53% of votes cast. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Whatever your own politics, this is a really big moment. Labour could now be an opposition that gets things done and carries out effective scrutiny - Labour under Corbyn struggled ever to do that. Keir Starmer has a massive task to get the party to start working in that way again, and make it function in a way that's anything like normal. He's said he has a ""mountain to climb,"" but you could argue it's like crossing the Himalayas without oxygen. But the party is huge, and Jeremy Corbyn created a massive membership base. At December's election, many expressed no particular affection for the Conservatives but were unimpressed with Labour on Brexit, and simply couldn't imagine Mr Corbyn on the steps of Downing Street. Nothing is inevitable about the 2024 election. But Keir Starmer's first steps in these first few weeks will matter enormously. Â© 2025 BBC.

Mr Katz says his organisation will ""work constructively with the new leadership team"" and they were ""encouraged"" by pledges from both Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner. But he adds: âThe past five years have without doubt been one of the darkest times for Jewish Labour members and supporters. ""We will dare to be optimistic that the party can once again be a safe place for Jews, but we are equally clear that this is just the beginning of that process.â It is not just Jeremy Corbyn who has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer on his election. Labour's previous three leaders have taken to Twitter to welcome him to the club. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Keir Starmer may have been in the job for less than two hours, but he has already been onto the phone to the prime minister to talk about the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesman for the new Labour leader says he accepted an earlier offer from Boris Johnson to meet next week to discuss the outbreak, as well as agreeing arrangements on the Privy Council - a formal body of advisers to the Queen, which the leader of the opposition is entitled to join. The spokesman adds: ""Keir offered to work constructively with the government on how best to respond to the coronavirus outbreak."" Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner on their election victories. Writing on Twitter,external, he says: ""Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility. ""I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country."" Angela Rayner has been elected Labourâs new deputy leader. She has been a long-standing member of Jeremy Corbynâs cabinet, but will now hold one of the key jobs in the party. So how did she get to this point? You can read our full profile here. Ian Blackford and Sir Ed Davey have both congratulated the new Labour leader The other opposition parties in Westminster have offered their congratulations to Sir Keir Starmer on his election as Labour leader. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, says it is ""vital opposition parties work together effectively to hold the UK government to account - and ensure people get the support they need in the coronavirus crisis"". He appeals to Sir Keir to support SNP pledges on financial support during the outbreak and its calls to pause trade negotiations with the EU. And he adds a warning: ""Support for Labour has collapsed in Scotland. If they are ever to regain trust, they must stop ignoring Scotland's wishes and respect our democratic right to choose our own future."" The Liberal Democrats' acting leader, Sir Ed Davey, also pledges to work with Sir Keir to hold the government to account over its response to coronavirus. He says his party will always work with others when it comes to ""pursuing our liberal values"". He adds: ""As the chapter closes on one Labour leader, we hope the new one can see the Labour party play a constructive role in building an effective multi-party opposition. That will be the litmus test of Keir Starmerâs leadership."" As we reported earlier, Sir Keir Starmer won the Labour leadership contest on first preference votes - but who voted for him? The electorate was made up of party members, supporters of affiliated organisations and registered supporters who paid Â£25 to take part. Sir Keir's support was strongest among the registered supporters, where he hoovered up a massive 78% of the vote. His next best result came among party members themselves, where he got 56% of the votes. His weakest base of support came among members of affiliated groups - where he won a more slender majority of 53% of votes cast. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Whatever your own politics, this is a really big moment. Labour could now be an opposition that gets things done and carries out effective scrutiny - Labour under Corbyn struggled ever to do that. Keir Starmer has a massive task to get the party to start working in that way again, and make it function in a way that's anything like normal. He's said he has a ""mountain to climb,"" but you could argue it's like crossing the Himalayas without oxygen. But the party is huge, and Jeremy Corbyn created a massive membership base. At December's election, many expressed no particular affection for the Conservatives but were unimpressed with Labour on Brexit, and simply couldn't imagine Mr Corbyn on the steps of Downing Street. Nothing is inevitable about the 2024 election. But Keir Starmer's first steps in these first few weeks will matter enormously. Â© 2025 BBC.

""We will dare to be optimistic that the party can once again be a safe place for Jews, but we are equally clear that this is just the beginning of that process.â It is not just Jeremy Corbyn who has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer on his election. Labour's previous three leaders have taken to Twitter to welcome him to the club. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Keir Starmer may have been in the job for less than two hours, but he has already been onto the phone to the prime minister to talk about the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesman for the new Labour leader says he accepted an earlier offer from Boris Johnson to meet next week to discuss the outbreak, as well as agreeing arrangements on the Privy Council - a formal body of advisers to the Queen, which the leader of the opposition is entitled to join. The spokesman adds: ""Keir offered to work constructively with the government on how best to respond to the coronavirus outbreak."" Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has congratulated Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner on their election victories. Writing on Twitter,external, he says: ""Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility. ""I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country."" Angela Rayner has been elected Labourâs new deputy leader. She has been a long-standing member of Jeremy Corbynâs cabinet, but will now hold one of the key jobs in the party. So how did she get to this point? You can read our full profile here. Ian Blackford and Sir Ed Davey have both congratulated the new Labour leader The other opposition parties in Westminster have offered their congratulations to Sir Keir Starmer on his election as Labour leader. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, says it is ""vital opposition parties work together effectively to hold the UK government to account - and ensure people get the support they need in the coronavirus crisis"". He appeals to Sir Keir to support SNP pledges on financial support during the outbreak and its calls to pause trade negotiations with the EU. And he adds a warning: ""Support for Labour has collapsed in Scotland. If they are ever to regain trust, they must stop ignoring Scotland's wishes and respect our democratic right to choose our own future."" The Liberal Democrats' acting leader, Sir Ed Davey, also pledges to work with Sir Keir to hold the government to account over its response to coronavirus. He says his party will always work with others when it comes to ""pursuing our liberal values"". He adds: ""As the chapter closes on one Labour leader, we hope the new one can see the Labour party play a constructive role in building an effective multi-party opposition. That will be the litmus test of Keir Starmerâs leadership."" As we reported earlier, Sir Keir Starmer won the Labour leadership contest on first preference votes - but who voted for him? The electorate was made up of party members, supporters of affiliated organisations and registered supporters who paid Â£25 to take part. Sir Keir's support was strongest among the registered supporters, where he hoovered up a massive 78% of the vote. His next best result came among party members themselves, where he got 56% of the votes. His weakest base of support came among members of affiliated groups - where he won a more slender majority of 53% of votes cast. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Whatever your own politics, this is a really big moment. Labour could now be an opposition that gets things done and carries out effective scrutiny - Labour under Corbyn struggled ever to do that. Keir Starmer has a massive task to get the party to start working in that way again, and make it function in a way that's anything like normal. He's said he has a ""mountain to climb,"" but you could argue it's like crossing the Himalayas without oxygen. But the party is huge, and Jeremy Corbyn created a massive membership base. At December's election, many expressed no particular affection for the Conservatives but were unimpressed with Labour on Brexit, and simply couldn't imagine Mr Corbyn on the steps of Downing Street. Nothing is inevitable about the 2024 election. But Keir Starmer's first steps in these first few weeks will matter enormously. Â© 2025 BBC.

A day of remembrance was declared in China on Saturday to honour the more than 3,300 people who died of Covid-19. At 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT), people stood still nationwide for three minutes in tribute to the dead.

China's government said the commemoration was held to pay respects to ""martyrs"" Just two days later, as millions of people prepared to travel for the lunar new year, the number of cases more than tripled to more than 200 and the virus was detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. From that point, the virus began to spread rapidly in Asia and then Europe, eventually reaching every corner of the globe.

US accused of âpiracyâ over mask âconfiscationâ,"President Trump has invoked a Korean War-era law to demand that US firms provide more masks The US has been accused of redirecting 200,000 Germany-bound masks for its own use, in a move condemned as ""modern piracy"". The local government in Berlin said the shipment of US-made masks was ""confiscated"" in Bangkok. The FFP2 masks, which were ordered by Berlin's police force, did not reach their destination, it said. Andreas Geisel, Berlin's interior minister, said the masks were presumably diverted to the US. The US company that makes the masks, 3M, has been prohibited from exporting its medical products to other countries under a Korean-War-era law invoked by President Donald Trump. Should more of us wear face masks? Why some countries wear face masks and others don't Coronavirus: Are homemade face masks safe? On Friday, Mr Trump said he was using the Defence Production Act to demand that US firms provide more medical supplies to meet domestic demand. ""We need these items immediately for domestic use. We have to have them,"" Mr Trump said at the daily Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House. President Trump said medical supplies being diverted from abroad were needed urgently in the US He said US authorities had taken custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks and 600,000 gloves. He did not say where they were taken into US hands. Mr Geisel saidthe diversion of masks from Berlin amounted to an ""act of modern piracy"",external, urging the Trump administration to adhere to international trading rules. ""This is not how you deal with transatlantic partners,"" the minister said. ""Even in times of global crisis, there should be no wild-west methods."" Mr Geisel's comments echo the sentiments of other European officials, who have complained about the buying and diversion practices of the US. In France, for example, regional leaders say they are struggling to secure medical supplies as American buyers outbid them. The president of the Ãle-de-France region, ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, compared the scramble for masks to a ""treasure hunt"". 3M has been ordered to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks ""I found a stock of masks that was available and Americans - I'm not talking about the American government - but Americans, outbid us,"" Ms PÃ©cresse said. ""They offered three times the price and they proposed to pay up-front."" As the coronavirus pandemic worsens, demand for crucial medical supplies, such as masks and respirators, has surged worldwide. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was considering changing its guidance on whether people should wear face masks in public. At present, the WHO advises that masks do not provide sufficient protection from infection to justify mass usage. But some countries have taken a different view, including the US. On Friday, Mr Trump announced that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) will now recommend that Americans use non-medical, cloth face coverings to help prevent the spread of the virus. New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio has urged residents to cover their faces when outside The US has 273,880 recorded cases of Covid-19, the highest number in the world by a large margin. Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, has affected more than one million people and killed almost 60,000 globally, the latest figures show. In a separate development, 3M said the Trump administration had asked it to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks to Canada and Latin America. READ MORE:US 'wants 3M to end mask exports to Canada and Latin America' The request had ""significant humanitarian implications"", the company warned, and could prompt other countries to act in kind. The company says it manufactures about 100 million N95 masks per month - about a third are made in the US, and the rest produced overseas. President Trump said he had used the Defence Production Act to ""hit 3M hard"", without providing additional details. The law dates back to 1950 and allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence.

Whisky production to resume despite virus fears,"A number of whisky bottling plants which suspended work due to coronavirus are set to reopen. The GMB Scotland union says facilities owned by Edrington, Inver House and North British have approached staff about coming back to work. Other firms in the whisky and spirits industry, such as Diageo and Grants, have kept open plants with scaled-back operations. Trade unions argue that all production should be halted due to Covid-19. Edrington said a ""controlled restart"" with a significantly reduced number of staff would allow it to sustain the business and help safeguard employment. While its bottling facilities in Glasgow and Speyside will re-open on Monday the company's distilleries will remain closed for at least three months. The development comes as a survey of GMB Scotland members in the sector found just 18% believed that adequate social distancing measures were being followed in their workplace. Keir Greenaway, GMB Scotland organiser for the whisky and spirits sector, said some his members had also reported getting abuse from members of the public for going to work. He said: ""The ones that were shut are now looking to reopen because they look around and see that others have not followed them in taking the sensible approach in suspending operations. Workers are anxious and scared. ""They don't have confidence their health and wellbeing can be protected by their employers. ""The public health guidelines exist for good reasons; to stop the spread of this deadly virus and to save lives. Yet whisky and spirits giants think its business as usual in the midst of a killer pandemic."" About 700 members responded to the GMB Scotland survey issued last weekend over email, with only 7% of respondents stating they should continue producing whisky during the coronavirus lockdown. A further 89% of workers said their families had expressed concern that they were still working during the lockdown. The trade union wants the Scottish government to force the suspension of production. Edrington's portfolio includes The Macallan and The Famous Grouse Edrington said it has worked closely with union representatives on its plans to reopen and highlighted the fact it is also producing hand sanitiser at its Glasgow site. A spokesman said: ""Our start-up teams will be made up of those with no underlying health issues individually or within their household, and don't rely on public transport. ""Although we already go beyond government guidelines, we have introduced new enhanced social distancing and hygiene measures as part of our restart plan to ensure the health and safety of our people.â¯"" The company suspended its operations on 25 March to allow it to get clarity onâ¯advice from both the UK and Scottish governments. No one from North Bridge or Inver House was available for comment. The Scotch Whisky Association said those companies continuing to operate were doing so with ""significantly scaled-back operations"" and in ""rigorous compliance"" with social distancing guidelines. A spokesman said: ""The UK government has also made clear that food and drink production, including alcohol, are essential services and that manufacturing should continue where appropriate safety and social distancing protocols can be put in place in order to re-stock supermarkets and off-licences that remain open during the crisis."" The SWA said about 12 million litres of ethanol would be produced for about 50 million bottles of hand sanitiser in the next two months. The spokesman added: ""This is not business as usual. For companies, large and small, which continue to operate, this is not about profit but about ensuring businesses can be in a position to contribute to Scotland's economic recovery."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""In this public health crisis it is vital that all businesses align fully with the social distancing measures introduced to protect the nation's heath, wellbeing and economic future. ""As such we would advise all business premises, sites and attractions to close now unless their activity is essential to the health and welfare of the country. ""We have published guidance which makes clear that businesses can only continue to operate if they can, by working together with staff and unions, establish ways to keep their employees safe, both in travelling to work and at work.""

Premier League to ask players to take 30% wage cutIt was also announced the season would not resume at the beginning of May.,"Some clubs have furloughed non-playing staff before any reduction to players' wages Premier League clubs will ask players to take a 30% pay cut in order to protect jobs as it was announced the season will not resume until ""it is safe and appropriate to do so"". All clubs have agreed to put the proposed ""combination of conditional reductions and deferrals"" to players. The Premier League will advance Â£125m to the EFL and National League, and give Â£20m towards the NHS. Clubs still intend on completing all league and cup fixtures. The EFL, Women's Super League and Women's Championship have all suspended play without setting a target return date, meaning the entirety of English football is on hold indefinitely. ""It was acknowledged that the Premier League will not resume at the beginning of May - and that the 2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so,"" a Premier League statement said. ""Any return to play will only be with the full support of government and when medical guidance allows."" What are Premier League and English football's options amid coronavirus? Hearts: No player asked to take more than 30% cut - Ann Budge Players had faced scrutiny, notably from health secretary Matt Hancock, to take a cut in wages and""play their part""in offering support during the coronavirus pandemic. Some clubs had furloughed non-playing staff as a result of the shutdown of the sport. Before the Premier League statement was released, club captains - led by Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson -held discussionsover the creation of a charitable fund which could benefit the NHS. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) has previously written to its members urging them not to agree any reduction or deferral in wages until they have spoken to the union. After a meeting of clubs on Friday, the Premier League proposed a cut in wages in order to ""protect employment throughout the professional game"". ""This guidance will be kept under constant review as circumstances change,"" the Premier League said. ""The league will be in regular contact with the PFA and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow (Saturday) between the league, players and club representatives."" Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend had spoken of his frustration with Hancock ""deflecting blame on to footballers"", stating players were an ""easy target"" and often supported charities. The Premier League said it was aware of ""severe difficulties"" throughout the football pyramid and with clubs unable to play fixtures, moved to help ""immediately deal with the impact of falling cash flow"" at EFL and National League clubs. Julian Knight, chair of the government's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, welcomed the financial help for smaller clubs but said as the wage cut had not yet been agreed by players, the situation was ""not much further along"". Knight had previously said clubs that furlough non-playing staff without imposing cuts on player wages should be subjected to a windfall tax if they do not change their approach by Tuesday. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""It is absolutely right that a reduction of players' wages is on the table when there are lower-paid staff at some clubs being furloughed. ""The football authorities must all be aware of the strength of public feeling on this and I expect them to show leadership on the matter. ""It is important that the Premier League helps the national effort in response to the coronavirus pandemic and I will continue to work closely with the football authorities."" The league's statement also expressed ""huge appreciation for the heroic efforts of NHS staff and all other key workers who are carrying out critical jobs in such difficult circumstances"" with Â£20m immediately committed ""to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 pandemic"". BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone England's football bodies decided they had little option other than to extend the current suspension. It means the FA Cup will be stuck at the quarter-final stage for a bit longer, promotion and relegation issues are unresolved and Liverpool nervously await the chance to complete their first league title triumph since 1990. But while nothing seems to be happening, plenty of conversations are occurring and scenarios for concluding the historic 2019-20 season are being discussed. Fundamentally though, these are the five options on the table: 1.  Null and void the season 2.  End the season now 3.  Set a deadline for completion 4.  Play behind closed doors 5.  Wait to complete the season Read more from Simonhere.

LiveLiveChina mourns coronavirus 'martyrs'8 minutes ago8 minutes ago China honours ancestors over livestreamChina honours ancestors over livestream13 minutes ago Welcome to our live coverageWelcome to our live coverageLive China mourns coronavirus 'martyrs'  8 minutes ago,"Worldwide cases have passed 1.1 million, and at least 60,000 people have died President Trump tells Americans: ""This will probably be the toughest week, between this week and next week. And there will be a lot of death unfortunately."" New York state sees a record 630 virus deaths in a single day UK sees 708 deaths in a day, with public urged to stay at home as weather turns warmer A five-year-old child with underlying health conditions is believed to be the youngest UK victim NHS England Medical director Stephen Powis says UK's high death rate is likely to continue for next week or two Spain reports another 809 deaths, but there are signs its infection rate is slowing Hopeful news in Italy as the country sees its first drop in patients receiving intensive care for the coronavirus A day of remembrance is held in China to honour those who died of Covid-19 The IMF says the pandemic has stalled the global economy, causing a recession worse than 2008 Mal Siret, Georgina Rannard, Victoria Bisset, Alex Bysouth, Tom Spender and Tom Gerken We're pausing our live coverage for now, but we'll be back later on Sunday. A lot happened on Saturday, as cases of Covid-19 across the globe surpassed 1.1 million and deaths rose above 62,000, here is a round-up of Saturday's key news: Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence both praised the contributions of healthcare workers during the pandemic. ""I have seen such support,"" Mr Trump said, adding that ""people clapping for the fire department, clapping for police, they're like warriors. They're the rock stars"". Mr Pence agreed, saying: ""The stories are incredibly moving about what healthcare workers are doing every day. ""To hear the stories of healthcare workers who are holding up a phone while someone who is critically ill with coronavirus is saying their last goodbyes to family, and to be with them in those last moments, our healthcare workers are not just doctors or nurses today, they're supplementing for family."" More from Mr Trump on the situation with mask manufacturer 3M, after he said he would use the Defence Production Act to ensure masks manufactured by the company were supplied to the US. ""We're very disappointed in 3M,"" he says. ""They can sell to others, but they should be taking care of our country."" Responding to a question about accusations that the US had committed an act of ""modern piracy"" by redirecting 200,000 Germany-bound masks for its own use, the president said: ""There has been no act of piracy, it's the opposite. ""3M has not treated our country well, and if they do, great. If they don't, they're going to have a hell of a price to pay."" The president says he agrees ""100%"" with the decision of the US Navy torelieve Capt Brett Crozier from his commandof the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Capt Crozier had said in a letter that the Navy was not doing enough to halt a coronavirus outbreak on board his ship. Mr Trump said he did not ""know much about"" the background. ""I can only tell you this. Here we have one of the greatest ships in the world with thousands and thousands of people, and you had about 120 who were infected. ""The captain wrote a letter, a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place. That's not appropriate."" He added that he thought the incident ""looked terrible"" and that the decision to relieve Capt Crozier of his command was the right thing to do. ""They made their decision, the secretary of defence was involved... he shouldnât be talking that way in a letter. He stopped in Vietnam, a lot of people got off the boat, they came back and they had infection, and I thought it was inappropriate."" President Trump says he had a conference call with sports commissioners across the US on Saturday, naming several people including those in charge of the MLB, NFL and NBA. But the president denied reports that he wants stadiums to reopen in August. ""We need to open our country,"" he said. ""I had an expression, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. We've got to get our country open. I want fans back in the arenas whenever we're ready, as soon as we can."" The president said he was unable to put a date on when this might be achieved, only that he thought it would be ""sooner rather than later"". ""Weâre not going to have to have separation for the rest of our time on this planet, but eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats in arenas. ""Iâm not committing to [packing the stadiums in August] but it would be great if we were. People are staying in their homes, they're doing what they know is the right thing to do. It's not very complicated."" He added that he believed it would be possible to go ahead with the Republican National Convention scheduled to begin on 24 August. Dr Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has taken to the podium during the task force briefing to once again urge the American public to engage in social distancing. ""You will be seeing, and we should not be surprised, there are going to be deaths that are going to continue to go up,"" he said. ""But as I mentioned to this group and to the general public multiple times, there really is a cascading of events where you have new cases, hospitalisations, intensive care and deaths."" Dr Fauci said it was important to remain focused on limiting the number of new cases. ""Hopefully the kinds of mitigations that we're talking about are going to have an impact. Is the mitigation working? Clearly, in the countries that have implemented very strict kinds of programmes of mitigation, clearly it works. ""I want to plead to the American public, as sobering and as difficult as it is, what we are doing is making a difference, so we really need to continue to do it."" Mr Trump says that 40,000 Americans have been repatriated to the United States after being ""literally stuck"" abroad. The president said the US state department had successfully co-ordinated the return of citizens involving ""400 flights in 75 countries"". ""Many of those countries were terrific in helping us, and I appreciate that very much. ""Some of them I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know, and once I did they snapped like you wouldn't believe. They really helped us,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump says ""we're going to be adding a tremendous amount of military, thousands of soldiers, medical workers, professionals,"" to help deal with the pandemic. The military personnel will ""soon"" be advised of their assignments, he said, adding that ""1,000 military personnel"" were being deployed to New York City. Mr Trump also said that he was employing the Defence Production Act, a federal law instituted in response to the Korean War in 1950, which allows it to requisition materials and facilities - seemingly confirming mask manufacturer 3M's claim that it had been told by the US government not to send masks to Canada or Latin America. ""Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] has ordered 180 million N95 masks and we're working now with 3M to see if that works out,"" he said. ""But we want them to help our country. We need the masks, we donât want other people getting it... you could call it retaliation."" President Trump says federal assistance will now be focused on areas that need it most. ""In some cases we are telling governors we cannot go there as we don't think they need it, or someone else needs it,"" he said. ""There will be a lot of death, unfortunately. There will be death. We are looking for an obvious focus on the hardest hit regions. ""Some spring up, they hit you like you got hit by a club."" US President Donald Trump has begun the daily coronavirus task force briefing by expressing ""support, solidarity and love for the people of our great country"". ""We're fighting for you and we are enduring all of this together,"" he says. The daily US coronavirus task force briefing, which was scheduled to start at 20:30 BST, has not yet begun. No reason has been given for the delay on official government channels. Ahead of the White House briefing, President Trump has been tweeting well-wishes to the youths whose Little League baseball season has also been delayed. Allow Twitter content?

European countries with the highest numbers of cases Since the coronavirus pandemic began, our data and visualisation team has been tracking its spread. The map above shows which European countries currently have the most coronavirus cases - Italy, Spain and Germany are the top three. But remember, Germany has fewer deaths, with 1,275 compared to more than 10,000 in Spain and 15,000 in Italy, as shown in the chart below. The third group of charts shows the trajectory of the outbreak in four countries - comparing how rapidly the death toll is growing over time. The death toll in Italy reached 15,362 on Saturday These charts show the trajectory of death tolls over time since the 10th death in each country Rachel SchraerHealth Reporter There were plenty of concerns and conspiracies around 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak. But these seem to have escalated â with much-shared posts online suggesting a link between the illness and the new mobile phone technology. Sars-CoV-2 is a virus that causes the illness Covid-19. Viruses are bits of genetic material coated in protein which infiltrate the cells of living things in order to reproduce. They often originate in animals. The genome of this coronavirus has been sequenced so we can see that it looks a lot like viruses that circulate in the bat and pangolin population, suggesting that, like many other viruses, it jumped from animals to humans â and then began to pass from human to human. There is no biological mechanism by which 5G - which uses radio waves - could have any bearing on this illness. They are just completely different things. Dr Brendan Wren at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine described it as ""both a physical and biological impossibility"".  Rikers Island prison has recorded several cases of coronavirus Staff at Rikers Island prison in New York City must be provided with protective equipment, have their temperatures regularly checked for signs of Covid-19 and work in conditions with increased sanitation, a judge has ruled. The judgment follows a lawsuit by the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association - a union representing about 9,000 officers - which demanded better protections from the virus. In her ruling, state judge Pamela Brown said officers assigned to work in sections housing inmates who are infected with coronavirus, where there are prisoners showing symptoms, or who transport such inmates, must be given N95 level masks. Former Hollywood producer and convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein is an inmate at Rikers Island. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced at his daily press briefing that Canada is due to receive ""millions"" of masks from China in the next 48 hours. ""We are working around the clock to get Canada the resources it needs,"" he said. Mr Trudeau added that ""items ordered for Quebec"", the territory worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Canada, will be included in the shipment. ""I want to take a moment to thank everyone, whether you're working in a warehouse, flying the plane, or part of the ground crew, for your dedication,"" he said. His comments come a day after major US mask manufacturer3M said the Trump administration had asked it to stop exporting N95 respirator masksto Canada and Latin America. US President Donald Trump is due to present the daily coronavirus task force briefing at 2030 BST. It comes with news that: Hospitals on the frontline of fighting the coronavirus pandemic are facing a large increase in attempted cyber-attacks, the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) has warned. Theagency said that criminals are using software,externalto hold medical centres digitally hostage and prevent them accessing files and systems until a ransom is paid. Interpol added that emails are primarily being used to spread the ransomware, and that it is collecting a list of suspicious Internet domains. Residents in the northern Italian region of Lombardy will now be required to wear protective masks or cover their faces when they go outside. The new measure comes into effect on Sunday and will last until 13 April. The ordinance from the region's President Attilio Fontana follows similar guidelines in other northern regions, Veneto and Alto Adige, where residents must wear masks when shopping in stores and at markets. The whole of Italy is in lockdown, but Lombardy - the epicentre of the virus in Europe - has passed particularly tight restrictions on movement and business. Palestinian couple Ammar and Baraa show off their rings before getting married near Hebron, West Bank The global pandemic has brought us many remarkable images - from photos of the world's busiest spots abandoned to ordinary events turned upside-down by measures to control the virus. Here are some of the most eye-catching pictures from Saturday: A day of remembrance was held in China to honour victims of Covid-19 on the annual Tomb Sweeping Day that remembers the dead A new field hospital is under construction near Golokhvastovo, Moscow in Russia Medics clap to show gratitude to health workers in Spain on a day when the country recorded its lowest death toll for a week The normally crowded Chinatown in London is quiet on a weekend when the government instructed people to stay home Images of crowds are surprising now when we are used to seeing empty city streets - this picture is from Sweden, which has not introduced a lockdown Stephen McGrath, Romania A soldier stands in the centre of Bucharest (file pic) Special forces have been deployed to enforce a strict lockdown of Romaniaâs notorious town of Tandarei, known for its links to human-trafficking gangs and organised crime. Reports have emerged of parties and large gatherings taking place as many ignored restrictions on movement in the south-eastern town. In recent weeks, around 800 overseas workers are reported to have returned to Tandarei, from countries hit hard by the virus - such as Italy, Spain, and Germany - raising fears of the town becoming another coronavirus hotspot. The first hotspot outside the capital, Bucharest, was Suceava in the north-east, which saw the closure of its largest hospital after scores of medical staff tested positive for coronavirus. So far seven people who tested positive in Tandarei have died, including a 39-year-old man who reportedly had no underlying health conditions. In Romania, 3,613 people are confirmed infected and 146 people in total have died. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Labour prepares to announce new leaderSir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy await result of vote to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.UK Politics","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn's Labour leadership in two minutes The winner of the three-month contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader will be announced on Saturday. Sir Keir Starmer is the favourite to be elected in a ballot of party members, trade unionists and other supporters. The ex-director of public prosecutions, who became an MP in 2015, is up against fellow shadow cabinet member Rebecca Long-Bailey and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy. The party will also choose a new deputy leader, with education spokeswoman Angela Rayner seen as the frontrunner. The results of both elections are due to be announced at 10.45 BST. Live updates: New Labour leader announcement Corbyn was 'vilified' as Labour leader, says wife Jackie Baillie elected Scottish Labour deputy Members will learn the outcome via e-mail and the media after a plannedspecial conference to unveil the winner was cancelled due the coronavirus pandemic. The candidates for leader have each been asked to record victory speeches, one of which will be released alongside details of how many votes each candidate received. The process of choosing a new leader began in December after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row. All three candidates have said the party must put the divisions of recent years behind it Mr Corbyn said he would stand down after the party secured its lowest number of seats since 1935. Six candidates initially entered the contest but Clive Lewis, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry either dropped out or were eliminated before the final ballot got underway on 24 February. Sir Keir, who served in Mr Corbyn's top team for more than three years as shadow Brexit secretary, emerged early on as the frontrunner after securing the most backing from MPs and local Labour branches. The lawyer, who led the Crown Prosecution Service before entering politics, argued that he was best equipped to unite different wings of the party after years of internal infighting. LIVE: Labour leadership announcement Who will be Labour's next leader? 100 years of Labour in charts All the candidates have said rooting out anti-Semitism in the party and reconnecting with ""left-behind"" voters in traditional heartlands, who backed Brexit, must be a priority if Labour is to rebuild trust and map a path back to power. Among those eligible to cast their votes in the leadership and deputy leadership ballots were 114,000 new members who joined since the election. Members of affiliated trades unions and other affiliated groups were also able to take part, as well as about 14,700 ""registered supporters"" who paid Â£25 to take part on a one-off basis. Both ballots used a preferential system, with members ranking the candidates in order of preference. If one candidate fails to get more than half the first preference votes, the second preference votes of the lowest-ranked candidate will be redistributed until the contest produced a winner. The other candidates vying to become deputy leader are shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon.

Debenhams is set to appoint administratorsThe department store chain says it is 'making contingency plans' amid the Covid-19 outbreak.BusinessComments,"Debenhams, the department store chain, is facing administration for a second time. The retailer is set to appoint administrators as early next week to protect the company against claims from creditors as it tries to restructure its business. Debenhams has already closed 22 stores this year and plans to shut a further 28 in 2021. However, the coronavirus outbreak has ramped up pressure on the firm. Like much of the rest of the High Street, Debenhams 142 stores are closed. Although the business is still trading online, it has a large amount of stock which it cannot sell. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Coronavirus: Four ways the economy has been affected It is understood that Debenhams is concerned about potential legal claims from suppliers who have yet to be paid. A Debenhams spokesperson said: ""Like all retailers, Debenhams is making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances. ""Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation."" This video can not be played Declaring insolvency: What it means It is expected that the most likely outcome is a pre-pack administration, where a company arranges to sell its business to a pre-determined buyer before administrators are appointed. Last April, Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders, comprising a group of banks and hedge funds led by US firm Silver Point Capital, after struggling for years to keep up with competition from rivals. It has also faced rising costs in running its big stores as well as grappling with a huge amount of debt. A source familiar with the company's current thinking told the BBC that if a pre-pack was to happen, the current owners intend to take the business out of administration once stores are allowed to re-open and were in talks to inject funding as part of its existing turnaround plan. Landlords have already been told that a number of restructuring scenarios are being explored, which have ""varying outcomes"" for the business, landlords and Debenhams' 20,000 workers.
