France beat England to win Grand Slam,"This video can not be played Six Nations 2022: France beat England to complete Grand Slam - highlights Guinness Six Nations: France v England France (18) 25 Tries:Fickou, Cros, DupontCon:Jaminet 2Pens:Jaminet 2 England (6) 13 Tries:StewardCon:SmithPen:Smith 2 France strutted to a first Grand Slam in 12 years as they ran in three tries to comfortably see off England in front of a jubilant Stade de France. Tries from Gael Fickou and Francois Cros gave the hosts a healthy half-time lead and left England playing catch-up in the Six Nations finale. England's Freddie Steward, deployed on the wing, stepped and swooped to score after Joe Marchant's break after the interval. But it was a rare moment of danger from England, who were kept at arm's length. France captain Antoine Dupont darted under the sticks soon after and the hosts played out the final 10 minutes in comfort as their fans started the party. La Marseillaise reverberated round the stands and tricolores fluttered from every seat as the final scrum was set with the clock in the red. Gregory Alldritt's kick to the stands moments later was the signal for his team to drop to their knees and savour a clean sweep that has been brewing for the last couple of campaigns. England finish third in the Six Nations, but this contest revealed the chasm that separates them from the champions. France were superior in every area. Stronger up front, more accurate in the backs, tighter in defence, more clinical in attack. For England, defeat is a sobering reality check. There are still 18 months until the start of the Rugby World Cup, but to close the gap on France in that timeframe requires swift, steep improvement. There was little sign of it at the Stade de France. A campaign that started with Eddie Jones' side stifled by Scotland, ended with them overwhelmed in Paris, and there have been precious few positives in between. I haven't done a good enough job - Jones Rugby Union Daily: Vive Les Bleus! 'An amazing feeling' - relive France's win over England Marcus Smith's first Six Nations ends with a losing record England had creaked long before the opening score. Fickou knocked on as an intricate pre-planned move prised open a hole for him before Jonathan Danty's offload went to ground on a dangerous broken-field counter. The visitors' luck could not hold. France duly got a grip of the ball and the match. Gabin Villiere's dart down the left dragged England's defence out of shape and Romain Ntamack's looping mispass found an unguarded Fickou, who dived over on the opposite wing. England's kick-heavy tactics worked on occasion. Twice in the first half, Freddie Steward chased Marcus Smith's hoofs and managed to win the aerial battle. But on both occasions, France were quicker into the breakdown to turn over possession and stem the momentum. The rest of the bombardment was eagerly gobbled up by full-back Melvyn Jaminet and his two wings. France's threat was never far from the surface, but England dredged in vain for a way through the defence. The visitors rarely looked like stringing together a series of profitable phases to build pressure and only clung within range thanks to a pair of Smith penalties as half-time loomed. Cros ensured the difference between the sides was better represented on the scoreboard by the break though as he stretched over to make it 18-6 after a sky-hooked one-hand pass from Fickou had sent Villiere scampering clear. England's toil suddenly, unexpectedly bore fruit early in the second half. Marchant barrelled through a hole, Smith and Henry Slade combined to get the ball wide and Steward stepped inside the covering Ntamack to score. Smith converted from the touchline. The lead was trimmed to five points. It could have been where the Stade de France got twitchy. It could have been there the pressure of ending a Grand Slam drought bore down on the players. This generation is different though. Just as when Ireland threatened a comeback in round two, they found another gear. Number eight Alldritt picked and went round the fringe and slipped the ball inside to Dupont, with whom he has played on and off since the pair were boys at the small-town southern club of Auch. World Player of the Year Dupont did the rest, shrugging off two tacklers on his way in. They are both stars on the biggest stage now. Few would bet against them or their team for the biggest prize either when France hosts the Rugby World Cup next year. Fickou oozed class on both sides of the ball, orchestrating France's defence, scoring one try and helping create another Former England wing Ugo Monye on Radio 5 Live:""Third place is a fair reflection of where England are. Will the fans be frustrated? Absolutely. ""This England team have been in a cycle of boom or bust. Last year was a clear bust but to back it up with the same number of wins, for the level of players we have, for the player pool we have, the financial backing we have and the coach we have, it's just not good enough. ""It's simply not acceptable. ""France are streets ahead of every other team in this competition. They have a brilliant style. They have flair with work rate and physicality, but they're also devoid of those big moments that have cost them down the years."" Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson on BBC Radio 5 Live:""Dupont is not even halfway in his career and goodness me, he's just going to get better and better. ""He's one of those, it doesn't matter what sport it is, the best players make it seem like they are playing in slow motion."" France scrum-half and captainAntoine Dupontsaid: ""This is our third tournament together as a team. We were very close twice so we know how difficult it is to win. ""We wanted to write our place in history. ""Of course we have next year's World Cup in mind, we discuss it between us, but for now we'll enjoy the Grand Slam and we'll start thinking about the World Cup later."" France team managerRaphael Ibanez, speaking to ITV: ""Twelve years is a very, very long time and this was an intense final game but we have a fantastic group of players. ""We were thinking we needed to hold on and fair play to England, they tried to break us down."" The Stade de France lights went out as a fireworks display marked the home side's triumph France's scrum-half and captain Antoine Dupont, right, poses for a selfie with fans.

Russia claims first use of hypersonic missile,"Kinzhal missiles have been fitted to Russian MiG-31K fighter jets, as shown in this defence ministry handout Russia's military has fired a hypersonic ballistic missile and destroyed a big underground arms depot in western Ukraine, the defence ministry in Moscow has said. If confirmed it would be Russia's first use in this war of the Kinzhal, or Dagger, ballistic missile launched from the air, most likely by a MiG-31 warplane. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly highlighted Russia's investment in hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. The statistics are impressive: according to Russian officials the Kinzhal can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h. But does that make them any more dangerous than other missiles or even artillery which can cause just as much death and destruction? ""I don't view it as that significant,"" says James Acton, nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""I don't know how much of an advantage Russia is getting from using hypersonic missiles."" President Putin boasted last December that Russia was leading the world in hypersonic missiles, which are hard to track because they can change direction while mid-flight. Russia posted a video of what it said was its missile strike on the arms depot in Deliatyn, a village in south-western Ukraine only 100km from the border with Romania. Allow Twitter content?

FT: France 25-13 England Matt DawsonFormer England scrum-half on BBC Radio 5 Live There's just a comfort around rugby players that I find a little bit annoying. I want to see an edge. When do you ever see England players arguing on the pitch? Never. Just because you're arguing with someone or poking them in the chest to say 'don't do that again', it doesn't mean you don't like them, or that you're bullying them. It just means you're under extreme pressure and you're trying to rectify a problem. It's a big issue for me and has been for a number of years. We don't seem to have that edge on the field that is needed to win at the highest level.

Well, it is for the men at least - don't forget the women's competition starts next weekend. Congratulations to France, Grand Slam champions and richly deserving winners tonight. This is an outstanding French side, who beat New Zealand last autumn and now have a first Six Nations clean sweep in 12 years.

Relive their victory over England by reading thematch reportfrom our man at the Stade de France, Mike Henson. FT: France 25-13 England Matt DawsonFormer England scrum-half on BBC Radio 5 Live There's just a comfort around rugby players that I find a little bit annoying. I want to see an edge. When do you ever see England players arguing on the pitch? Never. Just because you're arguing with someone or poking them in the chest to say 'don't do that again', it doesn't mean you don't like them, or that you're bullying them. It just means you're under extreme pressure and you're trying to rectify a problem. It's a big issue for me and has been for a number of years. We don't seem to have that edge on the field that is needed to win at the highest level. FT: France 25-13 England France team manager Raphael Ibanez tells ITV:""Twelve years is a very, very long time and this was an intense final game but we have a fantastic group of players. ""We were thinking we needed to hold on and fair play to England, they tried to break us down."" FT: France 25-13 England Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live Third place is a fair reflection of where England are. Will the fans be frustrated? Absolutely. This England team have been in a cycle of boom or bust. Last year was a clear bust but to back it up with the same number of wins, for the level of players we have, for the player pool we have, the financial backing we have and the coach we have, it's just not good enough. It's simply not acceptable. FT: France 25-13 England Paul GraysonFormer England fly-half on BBC Radio 5 Live They're in no hurry to get this over with. Nobody can take this away from them. They've done it. FT: France 25-13 England Chris JonesBBC rugby union correspondent on BBC Radio 5 Live The France fans have started the thunderclap now. The French players are on the running track around the pitch, right next to the fans. They are being greeted as heroes. FT: France 25-13 England England captain Courtney Lawes tells ITV:""We're certainly disappointed. We've got a lot to learn but I'm proud of the boys' effort. ""We'd have loved to have come here and got the win, and I really thought we were going to do it at different stages in the game. ""I know we've got the team for it. We just need to be more clinical."" FT: France 25-13 England Ugo MonyeFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live Not only can France play, but they can party too.

Chelsea reach FA Cup semi-finals,"This video can not be played FA Cup: Chelsea win at Middlesbrough to reach semi-finals Romelu Lukaku scored his 12th goal of the season as Chelsea beat Championship side Middlesbrough to reach the FA Cup semi-finals. Middlesbrough had knocked out Manchester United and Tottenham on their way to the quarter-finals but their hopes of claiming another Premier League victim were dealt an early blow when Lukaku tapped in from Mason Mount's cross after a quick Chelsea counter. Hakim Ziyech made it 2-0 midway through the first half with a superb dipping effort from the edge of the box before Lukaku was denied a second when Anfernee Dijksteel cleared off the line. Middlesbrough showed plenty of endeavour in the second half as they looked to mount an unlikely comeback, with Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun shooting wide after a promising counter, while Duncan Watmore also sent an effort over the bar from a good position. However, Chelsea could have grabbed a late third when substitute Timo Werner met a free-kick but Middlesbrough goalkeeper Joe Lumley did well to palm away. Chelsea will find out who they will play in the semi-finals, which will be played at Wembley on 16 and 17 April, when the draw is made before Sunday's quarter-final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool (18:00 GMT). Chelsea cannot show self pity - Tuchel There had been a bit of needle before this game with Chelsea having had to make an awkward U-turn over their request for the game to beplayed behind closed doors for ""sporting integrity"". The club were unable to sell their entire 4,500 ticket allocation for the fixture because of sanctions that have been imposed by the government on Russian owner Roman Abramovich because of his connection to Russian President Vladimir Putin. It meant they were backed by around 700 supporters who had got their tickets before the sanctions were brought in, while Middlesbrough were cheered on by a sell-out crowd at the 34,000 capacity Riverside Stadium. Chelsea players have responded well amid the uncertainty surrounding the club off the pitch. They had been unsure if they would have a 10-hour round trip by coach to get to Middlesbrough just hours after returning from a Champions League tie in Lille because of financial constraints. Since Abramovich had his assets frozen on 10 March as part of sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chelsea have won all three games they have played and this was an ultimately routine victory against a side who have performed well against Premier League opponents in this year's FA Cup. Lukaku has endured a difficult campaign in which he has not looked completely happy at Chelsea but he was handed a start in this game. And he made a key contribution, opening the scoring for a third FA Cup goal in four games, making an important clearance from a Marcus Tavernier free-kick with the score 1-0, and was denied a second only by a goalline clearance. The Belgian's celebration of his goal was muted, doing little to quash speculation about his long-term future, but he did what he was asked to do as Chelsea kept alive their hopes of a ninth FA Cup title. It has been an excellent run in the FA Cup by Middlesbrough, who have been rejuvenated since Chris Wilder took charge on 7 November. They started this game well and were not afraid to press high against a side who had won seven of their last eight games. Ultimately, that bold start proved costly as they were caught on the counter for the opener but their run in the competition and their performances against Premier League opposition will give them confidence as they now switch focus to joining their recent FA Cup opposition in the top flight next season. Middlesbrough are eighth in the Championship, two points off sixth but with two games in hand over most of those above them.

UK holds plane with possible Russian ties,"Aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. A private jet has been grounded while ""possible Russian links"" are probed, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shappssaid,externalministers were taking decisive action against Vladimir Putin and his ""illegal war"" in Ukraine. All aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. The jet has been held at London Biggin Hill airport while officials investigate if it falls foul of UK sanctions. The official notice grounding the flight on Saturday morning relates to a Cessna plane owned by a company named as Brooker Holdings. The Department for Transport said it would not comment on any links to individuals while it investigated the issue further. The latest plane seizure comes 10 days after it emerged that theUK had impounded a private jet linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch. The Luxembourg-registered aircraft had flown from the US into Farnborough airport, Hampshire, on 3 March.  UK officials believe the oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler was on board when it arrived. The plane had been due to fly from the UK to Dubai, but UK authorities prevented this while they investigated whether it was permanently leased to Mr Shvidler and fell under UK sanctions. Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Why have there been delays to UK Russia sanctions? Mr Shvidler himself has not been personally sanctioned by the UK at any stage. The UK and other western nations opposed to the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine haveintroduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economyand hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. New trade sanctions have also been introduced banning UK exports of aviation or space-related technology to Russia. Other measures introduced by the UK include: Excluding major Russian banks from the UK financial system and freezing the assets of all Russian banks Putting a 35% tax on certain imports from Russia, including vodka Imposing sanctions - including travel bans and asset freezes - against oligarchs considered close to the Kremlin Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

How crowdsourcing is rescuing people from Ukraine,"Finding a safe route out of Ukraine is not easy. One challenge facing those looking to escape is to find one that is not under heavy bombardment from Russian forces. The UN saysmore than three million people have have now fled Ukraine,externalsince Russia launched its invasion just over three weeks ago. So how do people actually find safe passage out of the country? One way is via transport arranged by dozens of volunteers based thousands of miles away, who liaise with fellow volunteers in Ukraine. They, in turn, send information in real-time about safe roads to drivers who can rescue busloads of people. But even using this method, travelling is not without considerable danger. In other words, they are crowdsourcing safe passage out of a war zone. Artur Kiulian, a Ukrainian software developer living in the US, was one of many who answered the call for assistance fromthe country's digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov.,external Artur used his skills gained in the tech industry to form UkraineNow, which uses volunteers and messaging apps to evacuate people from Ukraine. ""I've been building tech start-ups for the last decade,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer myself, I have a degree in systems of artificial intelligence. ""There is limited capacity [from] the UN and the Red Cross. There is no-one else to help. It's all civilians evacuating civilians."" When he spoke to the BBC, Artur was organising the evacuation of children with cancer from Ukraine to Poland. From there, they planned to travel to a hospital in Germany. He and his team organised the bus, the driver, and the place for them to stay across the border. But crucially, they crowdsourced the safe route too. Firstly, civilians in Ukraine make requests for help online. The team in the US receives the requests and allocates them to buses which have been purchased or rented with the money UkraineNow raises. Drivers are then put in contact with the civilians, and the evacuation is arranged. The exact process and methods used are more detailed than this, but the information is not being shared here in order to protect the organisation from cyber and real-world attacks. The BBC spoke to one of the people helping on the ground. Salam, a former refugee himself, organised a bus filled with people out of a city being shelled by the Russian army and across the border into Moldova. ""We have a [group] of women and children that is going to travel to a safe place,"" he said. ""And then they can travel from there to wherever they want."" He says he thinks he has made the journey from Ukraine to Moldova about 16 or 17 times already in the war. ""It's a dangerous journey,"" he said. ""Everybody's nervousâ¦ anything can happen. ""The road is completely empty right now. We're just driving ourselves and we're far away from the border - so we are in no man's land here. ""If they stay in their city they will be bombed. They're running for their lives. ""We have an amazing team doing everything they can. There's so many good people on our team that are trying to help so many people."" Salam explained the desperate situation for the people on his bus. ""There's a lot of sadness here,"" he said. ""A lot of women and children have left their husbands and their fathers, and they don't know if they're going to see each other again. ""They just said goodbye, cried, and they left them. You cannot imagine how difficult it is for them."" One of the people who managed to get aboard Salam's bus is Maryia - not her real name - who says she found out about the escape plan through a messaging app. ""I took this phone number from some group [on the app],"" she said. ""I don't remember exactly."" She said it was recommended to her by other people in her city, which has been shelled by Russia. For Maryia, she felt she had no choice but to leave. ""We are going to be without food,"" she said. ""We are going to be bombed in our building. ""I had some work projects, and now they're frozen, and I cannot work. Of course, I cannot get money. So I need to think about my future life. ""I need to survive."" These are the stakes for the evacuees - who in this case were able to escape.

WATCH:Drone footage shows Mariupol devastation,external IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the war,external Salam was able to guide the bus to the Moldovan border and safety. But there is no guarantee that future journeys will be equally successful. This is because the margins for the evacuation are incredibly tight. A previous route used to evacuate civilians was devastated by bombings only 10 hours after the bus left Ukraine. But Salam will continue driving regardless. ""We're not going to stop before this war's going to stop, and people can go back to their homes and be safe,"" he said. ""Until that, we need to show our solidarity and do everything we can to save people.""

What have been Russia's military mistakes?,"Russia has one of the largest and most powerful armed forces in the world, but that has not been apparent in its initial invasion of Ukraine. Many military analysts in the West have been surprised by its performance on the battlefield so far, with one describing it as ""dismal"". Its military advances appear to have largely stalled and some now question whether it can recover from the losses it has suffered. This week, a senior Nato military official told the BBC, ""the Russians clearly have not achieved their goals and probably will not at the end of the day"". So what has gone wrong? I have spoken to senior Western military officers and intelligence officials, about the mistakes Russia has made. Russia's first mistake was to underestimate the strength of resistance and the capabilities of Ukraine's own smaller armed forces. Russia has an annual defence budget of more than $60bn, compared with Ukraine's spending of just over $4bn. At the same time, Russia, and many others, appear to have overestimated its own military strengths. President Putin had embarked on an ambitious modernisation programme for his military and he too may have believed his own hype. A senior British military official said much of Russia's investment had been spent on its vast nuclear arsenal and experimentation, that included developing new weapons such as hypersonic missiles. Russia is supposed to have built the world's most advanced tank - the T-14 Armata. But while it has been seen on Moscow's Victory Day Parade on Red Square, it has been missing in battle. Most of what Russia has fielded are older T-72 tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and rocket launchers. At the start of the invasion Russia had a clear advantage in the air, with the combat aircraft it had moved near the border outnumbering Ukraine's air force by more than three to one. Most military analysts assumed the invading force would quickly gain superiority in the air, but it has not. Ukraine's air defences are still proving effective, limiting Russia's ability to manoeuvre. Moscow may have also assumed its special forces would play an important role, helping deliver a quick, decisive blow. A senior Western intelligence official told the BBC that Russia thought it could deploy lighter, spearhead units like the Spetsnatz and VDV paratroopers, ""to eliminate a small number of defenders and that would be it"". But in the first few days their helicopter assault on Hostomel Airport, just outside Kyiv, was repelled, denying Russia an airbridge to bring in troops, equipment and supplies. On the parade ground but not the battleground - Russia's T-14 Armata tank Instead, Russia has had to transport its supplies mostly by road. This has created traffic jams and choke points which are easy targets for Ukrainian forces to ambush. Some heavy armour has gone off road, only to get stuck in mud, reinforcing an image of an army that has become ""bogged down"". Meanwhile, Russia's long armoured column from the north that was captured by satellites has still failed to encircle Kyiv. The most significant advances have come from the south, where it has been able to use rail lines to resupply its forces. The UK Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, told the BBC that President Putin's forces ""have lost the momentum"". ""They're stuck and they are slowly but surely taking significant casualties."" Russia had amassed a force of around 190,000 troops for this invasion and most of those have already been committed to the battle. But they have already lost about 10% of that force. There are no reliable figures for the scale of either Russian or Ukrainian losses. Ukraine claims to have killed 14,000 Russian troops, though the US estimates it is probably half that number. Western officials say there is also evidence of dwindling morale among Russian fighters, with one saying it was ""very, very, low"". Another said the troops were ""cold, tired and hungry"" as they had already been waiting in the snow for weeks in Belarus and Russia before they were given the order to invade. Russia has already been forced to look for more troops to make up for its losses, including moving in reserve units from as far afield as the east of the country and Armenia. Western officials believe it is also ""highly likely"" that foreign troops from Syria will soon join the fight, along withmercenaries from its secretive Wagner group. A senior Nato military official said this was a sign it was ""scratching the bottom of the barrel"". Russia has struggled with the basics. There is an old military saying that amateurs talk tactics while professionals study logistics. There is evidence that Russia has not given it enough consideration. Armoured columns have run out of fuel, food and ammunition. Vehicles have broken down and been left abandoned, then towed away by Ukrainian tractors. Western officials also believe Russia may be running low on some munitions. It has already fired between 850 and 900 long-range precision munitions, including cruise missiles, which are harder to replace than unguided weapons. US officials have warned Russia has approached China to help address some of its shortages. Defence support announced by the US is expected to include the Switchblade ""kamikaze"" drone In contrast, there has been a steady flow of Western-supplied weapons going into Ukraine, which has been a boost for its morale. The US has just announced it will be providing an additional $800m in defence support. As well as more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, it is expected to include Switchblade, which is a small, US-developed, ""kamikaze"" drone that can be carried in a backpack before being launched to deliver a small explosive at targets on the ground. Western officials still warn that President Putin could ""double down with greater brutality"". They say he still has enough firepower to bombard Ukrainian cities for a ""considerable period of time"". Despite the setbacks, one intelligence official said President Putin was, ""unlikely to be deterred and may instead escalate. He likely remains confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine"". And while the Ukrainian forces have shown fierce resistance, that same official warned that without significant resupplies they too could ""eventually be spent in terms of ammunition and numbers"". The odds may be better than when the war first started, but they still seem stacked against Ukraine.

How Kremlin accounts manipulate Twitter,"The Kremlin (left) and St Basil's Cathedral, Moscow Olena Kurilo became the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Bloodied and bandaged, the 53-year-old teacher said she couldn't believe what had happened to her and her town of Chuhuiv. Her picture was on the front pages of newspapers across the world. Over the next few days, Russia's government social media accounts began to post a video claiming that Olena hadn't been injured at all. Olena Kurilo ""Great photos by the way, they were all over the news,"" the Russian narrator says. The video then claims Olena was photographed two days later, uninjured. ""A couple of days later, good for her, not a scratch."" This claim is baseless, the BBC hasverified the photoas genuine, as hasReuters,external. Wild conspiracy theories like these are not uncommon on social media. But what makes this conspiracy theory so odd is that it was shared by an official Russian government Twitter account - the Russian Mission in Geneva. Two weeks on, the tweet is still live. The Russian government has a huge network of official Twitter accounts - the BBC found more than 100 of them. They range from accounts that represent foreign missions or embassies, with a few thousand followers, to those with more than a million followers. President Putin has his own account. Many of the accounts are labelled as Russian government organisations by Twitter. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs account, with Twitter's label Yet, while many of these accounts have spread disinformation, Twitter deals with them differently to Russian state media - like RT or Sputnik. On 28 February, Twitter announced it would prevent tweets from Russian state-affiliated media outlets from being eligible for ""amplification"" - meaning they wouldn't be recommended in the home timeline, notifications, and other places on Twitter. But Twitter has confirmed to the BBC that this policy does not include Russian government accounts. Tim Graham, a social media analyst at QUT Digital Media Research Centre in Australia, describes this as a ""loophole"" in Twitter's moderation policies, which lets the Russian government pump out misinformation. ""It's certainly a blind spot in Twitter's defences against disinformation,"" he says. Intrigued by this spider web of Russian government accounts, Mr Graham - who specialises in analysing co-ordinated activity on social media - decided to investigate further. He analysed 75 Russian government Twitter profiles which, in total, have more than 7 million followers. The accounts have received 30 million likes, been retweeted 36 million times and been replied to 4 million times. He looked at how many times each Twitter account retweeted one of the other 74 profiles within an hour. He discovered that the Kremlin's network of Twitter accounts work together to retweet and drive up traffic. This practice is sometimes called ""astroturfing"" - when the owner of several accounts uses the profiles they control to retweet content and amplify reach. A visualisation of Tim Graham's data - showing Russian Government accounts retweeting each other within 60 minutes ""It's a coordinated retweet network,"" Mr Graham says. ""If these accounts weren't retweeting stuff at the same time, the network would just be a bunch of disconnected dots. So what the network shows, very clearly, is that there's a very dense amount of connections to the way these accounts are retweeting. ""They are using this as an engine to drive their preferred narrative onto Twitter, and they're getting away with it,"" he says. Coordinated activity, using multiple accounts, is against Twitter's rules. ""You can't artificially amplify conversations through the use of multiple accounts,"" Twitter's rules state. But Twitter doesn't treat all accounts equally.  Tweets from government and elected officials can be given more leeway when it comes to moderation. The companysays on its website,externalthat there may be a public interest in seeing tweets that would otherwise violate its rules. However, the company doesn't treat official accounts differently when it comes to coordinated behaviour - there is no exemption. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby,external ANALYSIS:Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wanted BATTLEFIELD:What have been Russia's military mistakes? WATCH:Drone footage shows Mariupol devastation,external IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the war,external The BBC put Mr Graham's research to Twitter, however the company did not respond directly to his findings. The BBC also asked the Russian Embassy in the UK about the suggestion that official Russian Twitter accounts behave in a coordinated way - and that many share misinformation. The BBC has not received a response. On 10 March, the embassy itself tweeted that the bombing of a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol had been faked. The account claimed that women pictured at the scene were actors. A photo was posted of a woman being carried on a stretcher, with the words ""FAKE"" plastered over the image. The claim was false. A few days later it was reported thatboth she and her baby had died. Screengrab from the account of the Russian Embassy in the UK - the fake claim was removed by Twitter Twitter deleted several tweets making the ""FAKE"" claim, after the BBC flagged them. Yet there are many other examples of Russian disinformation still up on the Russian government's Twitter accounts. The unfounded claim that Olena Kurilo wasn't really injured is still live - it has been retweeted by more than 20 separate Russian government accounts. Unfounded claims that Ukraine has bioweapons have been shared by the Russian network and are still up - as are claims of an imminent chemical attack being allegedly prepared by Ukrainians. The problem Twitter has is that proving content is false can be messy and complex in a time of war. Savvas Zannettou, who analyses social media moderation at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says war makes policing social media even harder. ""To effectively moderate is impossibleâ¦ the information comes at a very rapid pace, and it's coming from all over the place,"" he says. It appears two things are happening here. Muddled and incomplete information on the ground means only examples of misinformation which are easy to prove are taken down on platforms such as Twitter. Added to that, Twitter's own public interest exceptions means tweets from government officials can be treated differently from other accounts. The BBC asked Twitter whether tweets from Russian ministries and embassies were included in its public interest exceptions, however the social media company did not respond to this specific question. Twitter said: ""We've taken numerous enforcement actions on Russian embassy accounts, including requiring the removal of Tweets."" Twitter also said it would also be doing more in the coming days to flag accounts linked to the Kremlin. ""We'll be expanding our government account labels to additional Russian embassies to add context for people interacting with these accounts on Twitter."" The Kremlin's social media accounts also exist on Facebook and other platforms - this isn't a headache consigned just to Twitter. In January 2021, after the Capitol Hill riots, Twitter banned Donald Trump for his role in repeating allegations of voter fraud. Twitter argued that repeated disinformation, posted from a position of power, had caused real world violence. As official Russian accounts continue to post wild misinformation during a time of war, it is perfectly possible that the Kremlin will end up facing another sanction - being frozen out of Twitter.

Chelsea reach FA Cup semi-finalsRomelu Lukaku scores his 12th goal of the season as Chelsea beat Championship side Middlesbrough to reach the FA Cup semi-finals.,"This video can not be played FA Cup: Chelsea win at Middlesbrough to reach semi-finals Romelu Lukaku scored his 12th goal of the season as Chelsea beat Championship side Middlesbrough to reach the FA Cup semi-finals. Middlesbrough had knocked out Manchester United and Tottenham on their way to the quarter-finals but their hopes of claiming another Premier League victim were dealt an early blow when Lukaku tapped in from Mason Mount's cross after a quick Chelsea counter. Hakim Ziyech made it 2-0 midway through the first half with a superb dipping effort from the edge of the box before Lukaku was denied a second when Anfernee Dijksteel cleared off the line. Middlesbrough showed plenty of endeavour in the second half as they looked to mount an unlikely comeback, with Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun shooting wide after a promising counter, while Duncan Watmore also sent an effort over the bar from a good position. However, Chelsea could have grabbed a late third when substitute Timo Werner met a free-kick but Middlesbrough goalkeeper Joe Lumley did well to palm away. Chelsea will find out who they will play in the semi-finals, which will be played at Wembley on 16 and 17 April, when the draw is made before Sunday's quarter-final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool (18:00 GMT). Chelsea cannot show self pity - Tuchel There had been a bit of needle before this game with Chelsea having had to make an awkward U-turn over their request for the game to beplayed behind closed doors for ""sporting integrity"". The club were unable to sell their entire 4,500 ticket allocation for the fixture because of sanctions that have been imposed by the government on Russian owner Roman Abramovich because of his connection to Russian President Vladimir Putin. It meant they were backed by around 700 supporters who had got their tickets before the sanctions were brought in, while Middlesbrough were cheered on by a sell-out crowd at the 34,000 capacity Riverside Stadium. Chelsea players have responded well amid the uncertainty surrounding the club off the pitch. They had been unsure if they would have a 10-hour round trip by coach to get to Middlesbrough just hours after returning from a Champions League tie in Lille because of financial constraints. Since Abramovich had his assets frozen on 10 March as part of sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chelsea have won all three games they have played and this was an ultimately routine victory against a side who have performed well against Premier League opponents in this year's FA Cup. Lukaku has endured a difficult campaign in which he has not looked completely happy at Chelsea but he was handed a start in this game. And he made a key contribution, opening the scoring for a third FA Cup goal in four games, making an important clearance from a Marcus Tavernier free-kick with the score 1-0, and was denied a second only by a goalline clearance. The Belgian's celebration of his goal was muted, doing little to quash speculation about his long-term future, but he did what he was asked to do as Chelsea kept alive their hopes of a ninth FA Cup title. It has been an excellent run in the FA Cup by Middlesbrough, who have been rejuvenated since Chris Wilder took charge on 7 November. They started this game well and were not afraid to press high against a side who had won seven of their last eight games. Ultimately, that bold start proved costly as they were caught on the counter for the opener but their run in the competition and their performances against Premier League opposition will give them confidence as they now switch focus to joining their recent FA Cup opposition in the top flight next season. Middlesbrough are eighth in the Championship, two points off sixth but with two games in hand over most of those above them.

Plane with possible Russian ties grounded - Shapps,"Aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. A private jet has been grounded while ""possible Russian links"" are probed, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shappssaid,externalministers were taking decisive action against Vladimir Putin and his ""illegal war"" in Ukraine. All aircraft owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. The jet has been held at London Biggin Hill airport while officials investigate if it falls foul of UK sanctions. The official notice grounding the flight on Saturday morning relates to a Cessna plane owned by a company named as Brooker Holdings. The Department for Transport said it would not comment on any links to individuals while it investigated the issue further. The latest plane seizure comes 10 days after it emerged that theUK had impounded a private jet linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch. The Luxembourg-registered aircraft had flown from the US into Farnborough airport, Hampshire, on 3 March.  UK officials believe the oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler was on board when it arrived. The plane had been due to fly from the UK to Dubai, but UK authorities prevented this while they investigated whether it was permanently leased to Mr Shvidler and fell under UK sanctions. Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Why have there been delays to UK Russia sanctions? Mr Shvidler himself has not been personally sanctioned by the UK at any stage. The UK and other western nations opposed to the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine haveintroduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economyand hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. New trade sanctions have also been introduced banning UK exports of aviation or space-related technology to Russia. Other measures introduced by the UK include: Excluding major Russian banks from the UK financial system and freezing the assets of all Russian banks Putting a 35% tax on certain imports from Russia, including vodka Imposing sanctions - including travel bans and asset freezes - against oligarchs considered close to the Kremlin Private jet linked to oligarch is impounded in UK What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

UK's safe level for tap water too high - scientists,"Scientists are concerned that the allowable levels of toxic PFAS - known as ""forever chemicals"" - in drinking water are too high. A BBC study found PFAS levels exceeded European safety levels in almost half of the samples taken. However, none exceeded the current safety level in England and Wales. Linked to cancer and other diseases, PFAs are in many products such as non-stick pans, food packaging, carpets, furniture, firefighting foam. Guidelines from theDrinking Water Inspectorate,,externalwhich covers England and Wales, state drinking water must contain PFAS chemicals at no more than 100 nanograms per litre (ng/l). Above that, action must be taken to reduce levels. Scotland is committed to enforcing European guidelines next year. Working with the University of Greenwich and Manchester Metropolitan University, the BBC took 45 tap water samples from sites in England. Laboratory analysis found that none exceeded the 100ng/l level. But 25 samples did contain PFASs, and four had levels that exceeded 10ng/l, which, under the current guidelines, means local healthcare professionals must be consulted, and levels monitored. And almost half of the samples exceeded the European Food Standards Agency tolerable limit of 2.2ng/l. Race to replace persistent chemicals in our homes Toxic 'forever chemicals' found in British otters Professor Roger Klein, a chemist and PFAS expert, said: ""The significance of your results, even though they're small, is that it underlines that this stuff is everywhere and that it's in drinking water. ""It's ridiculous that the Drinking Water Inspectorate has a level of 100ng/l before action is taken."" Rita Lock-Caruso, Professor of toxicology at the University of Michigan, also said the results raised a potential health concern: ""We're finding health effects at lower and lower concentrations - in the single digits."" Research has found the most common PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, have probable links to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. There is particular concern about the effect on children. Professor Philippe Grandjean, of Harvard University, said: ""A woman may build this up in her body and when she gets pregnant, she shares that with her foetus. She eliminates part of her body burden into her milk. So, the next generation will get a huge dose, and the baby may end up having up to 10 times as much PFAS in the blood as her mother has."" The US is considering reducing its regulatory level, from 70ng/l. ""We are beginning to think that there's no such thing as a safe level and we want them to be as low as possible, because water is not the only source of exposure,"" said former head of the National Institute of Environmental Sciences, Linda Birnbaum. However, there is little public data about its presence or impacts in the UK. Some residents on the Channel Island of Jersey believe they are suffering adverse health impacts from drinking water contaminated with PFAS. In the 1990s the government of Jersey discovered PFAS had polluted St Ouen's Bay aquifer, which was used by locals for drinking water. After years of local lobbying, the government of Jersey has recently agreed to offer free blood tests for people with health issues in the area. Sarah Simon is convinced PFASs have damaged the health of local people ""I have an autoimmune disease, my father has kidney disease, and my mother has thyroid disease,"" says Sarah Simon, a lifelong Jersey resident turned citizen scientist. ""When I started talking to our neighbours, I found that many of the men had kidney stones and the women had thyroid disease. This can't be a coincidence."" PFOS and PFOA has been restricted and neither are manufactured in the UK now. However, there are still a raft of other PFASs which are still being used and aren't regulated. The BBC study found 18 different types of PFAS chemicals in the tap water samples. In a statement, the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs said: ""We have robust systems in place to identify the impact of a range of chemicals on the environment and human health and are working closely with regulators to better assess the presence of PFAS in our natural environment and their sources."" Correction 5 April 2022: We mistakenly referred to the UK Drinking Water Inspectorate in our original article. This has been amended to make clear the DWI covers England and Wales and that the water samples were only taken in England.

"Russia claims first use of hypersonic missileRussia fires a Kinzhal missile at a big arms depot in Ukraine, in an apparent change of strategy.Europe","Kinzhal missiles have been fitted to Russian MiG-31K fighter jets, as shown in this defence ministry handout Russia's military has fired a hypersonic ballistic missile and destroyed a big underground arms depot in western Ukraine, the defence ministry in Moscow has said. If confirmed it would be Russia's first use in this war of the Kinzhal, or Dagger, ballistic missile launched from the air, most likely by a MiG-31 warplane. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly highlighted Russia's investment in hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. The statistics are impressive: according to Russian officials the Kinzhal can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h. But does that make them any more dangerous than other missiles or even artillery which can cause just as much death and destruction? ""I don't view it as that significant,"" says James Acton, nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""I don't know how much of an advantage Russia is getting from using hypersonic missiles."" President Putin boasted last December that Russia was leading the world in hypersonic missiles, which are hard to track because they can change direction while mid-flight. Russia posted a video of what it said was its missile strike on the arms depot in Deliatyn, a village in south-western Ukraine only 100km from the border with Romania. Allow Twitter content?

Even if it's used we should consider it as an isolated moment because Russia doesn't have a large number of these missiles,"" said Dominika Kunertova of the Center for Security Studies in Zurich. The Russian leader unveiled the Kinzhal four years ago as one of a series of ""invincible"" weapons that he said would evade enemy defences. The other hypersonic missiles are the Zirkon and the Avangard, which is both faster and has a far greater range. The Kinzhal can carry a nuclear warhead as well as a conventional one and recent reports said MiG-31 fighters had been sent to Kaliningrad, bringing numerous European capitals within reach. There is no indication from where the attack on the arms depot was launched. ""It's a signal to the West, because Putin is annoyed that the West is daring to shift all these weapons [to Ukraine],"" Ms Kunertova told the BBC. ""It's questionable that it's so accurate, so it's not a game changer.""

WATCH:Drone footage shows Mariupol devastation,external LISTEN:What are hypersonic missiles? James Acton said the Kinzhal was thought to be an Iskander missile that had been modified for fighter jets, and Iskander-M missiles have already been fired by Russian ground launchers since the start of the war. Although the Iskander-M has a far shorter range than the air-launched missile, Ukraine's defence ministry claimed this week thatRussia had fired almost all its Iskander missiles,externalduring the first 20 days of the war. A US defence official was quoted as saying on Friday that Russian forces had fired more than 1,080 missiles since 24 February. ""[That] is an astonishing number and a very significant fraction of Russia's pre-war inventory,"" Mr Acton told the BBC, pointing to the increasing use of unguided bombs in Russian aerial attacks.

Syria's president makes historic visit to UAEIt marks Bashar al-Assad's first visit to an Arab country since the Syrian civil war began in 2011.,"The Syrian leader met with Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Syria's president has made his first trip to an Arab country since the Syrian civil war began 11 years ago. Bashar al-Assad arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Friday, and met several influential and controversial rulers who signalled a willingness to strengthen ties with Syria again. It marks a potential warming in Syria's relations with its Arab neighbours, which had previously isolated Mr Assad. But the US criticised the trip, saying it was ""profoundly disappointed"". Among the Emiratis Mr Assad met was the billionaire ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, who has been embroiled in a number of controversies recently. One of his 25 children, Latifa, has previously said she was being held hostage and feared for her life after trying to escape Dubai in 2018. And late last year, he settled a Â£500m ($660m) divorce case with one of his six wives, Princess Haya Bint Al-Hussain, who fled to Britain in 2019 and spent huge sums on personal security after receiving threatening messages and having her phone hacked, according to court documents. Princess Latifa: The Dubai ruler's daughter who vanished The princess, the sheikh and the Â£550m divorce settlement Mr Assad also travelled to the UAE's capital city, Abu Dhabi, to meet with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. According to Emirati state media, he ""stressed that Syria is a fundamental pillar of Arab security, and that the UAE is keen to strengthen cooperation with it"". The leaders reportedly discussed how the UAE could provide political and humanitarian support for Syria, as well as how to promote economic trade between the nations. President Assad was also photographed with the owner of Manchester City Football Club, Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Syrian leader met the UAE's Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who owns Manchester City Football Club Syria's president has made few international trips since his country's long and bloody civil war began in March 2011, which the United Nations says has so far killed 350,000 people. Until now Mr Assad had only left the war-torn country to visit Russia and Iran, both military backers of his regime. The US said it was ""profoundly disappointed and troubled"" by the UAE's decision to welcome Mr Assad. The US is against efforts to normalise relations with the Syrian leader until progress is made resolving the civil war. United Arab Emirates profile Syria country profile Bashar al-Assad: Facing down rebellion ""We urge states considering engagement with the Assad regime to weigh carefully the horrific atrocities visited by the regime on the Syrians over the last decade,"" said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price. Along with the majority of Arab states, the UAE broke ties with Syria soon after the civil war erupted - and once backed rebel fighters in its attempts to overthrow Mr Assad's regime. But in recent years relations between the two countries have gradually improved, with the UAE spearheading efforts to bring Syria back into the Arab fold despite protests from Washington. In 2018 the UAE reopened its embassy in Syria's capital, Damascus, and in November last year, diplomats were sent there to there to meet President Assad. Even if gradual, any improvement of ties with a wealthy Gulf neighbour would be a boost to Mr Assad's government, which has been crippled by Western sanctions and international isolation.

"Murder probe as woman, 19, dies at student hallsA woman has died after being found with serious injuries at a student halls in central London.","Flowers were laid at the police cordon at Arbour House in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell A 19-year-old woman has been killed at student accommodation in central London. She was found with serious injuries when police and medics were called to Arbour House in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell, at about 05:10 GMT. The teenager, who is believed to have been a student, was later pronounced dead at the scene, the Met Police said. A murder investigation has been launched and detectives are trying to identify the woman's next of kin. No arrests have been made and a police presence remains at the scene. Ch Insp Adam Instone, of the Met Police, said he understood the student community would be concerned. ""I share their sadness and concerns, and I can assure them that a thorough homicide investigation is under way, led by skilled and experienced detectives who will work tirelessly to identify and arrest whoever is responsible."" Ch Insp Adam Instone said officers would work tirelessly on the case Student William Fereyre Guerra, who lives at the halls, said they were told to stay in their rooms in the early hours of the morning. ""There's been a helicopter during the night as well,"" he said. ""We were told to stay in the room because they didn't know if the suspect was still there hiding."" William Fereyre Guerra said people in his halls were told to stay in their room A spokesman for Unite Students, which runs Arbour House, said: ""As this remains an ongoing police incident, we are unable to comment on their investigation.

Putin has redrawn the world - but not the way he wanted,"""Russia does not start wars, it ends them"" reads a poster of Vladimir Putin in Simferopol, Crimea, 10 March Vladimir's Putin's invasion of Ukraine has changed the world. We are living in new and more dangerous times - the post-Cold War era that began with the fall of the Berlin Wall is over. It is a rare thing to live through a moment of huge historical consequence and understand in real time that is what it is. In November 1989, I stood on a snow-flecked Wenceslas Square in Prague, the capital of what was then Czechoslovakia, and watched a new world being born. The peoples of Communist Eastern Europe had risen in defiance of their dictatorships. The Berlin Wall had been torn down. A divided Europe was being made whole again. In Prague, the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel addressed a crowd of 400,000 from a second-floor balcony. It was an exhilarating moment, dizzying in its pace. That evening, the Communist regime collapsed and within weeks Havel was president of a new democratic state. I sensed, even at the time, that I had watched the world pivot - that it was one of those rare moments when you know the world is remaking itself before your eyes. Vaclav Havel in Wenceslas Square, Prague, 24 November 1989 How many such moments had there been in the history of Europe since the French Revolution? Probably, I thought then, about five. This, 1989, was the sixth. But that world - born in those dramatic popular revolutions - came to an end when Putin ordered Russian forces into Ukraine. The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called this moment a zeitenwende - a turning point - while UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""paradigm shift"". The age of complacency, she said, was over. Storming of the Bastille,14 July 1789 1789:French Revolution. Monarchy overthrown, republic founded 1815:Congress of Vienna redraws map of Europe, restores balance of power and ushers in decades of peace after the upheaval of the Napoleonic wars 1848:A wave of liberal and democratic revolutions across Europe 1919:Treaty of Versailles. New independent sovereign nation states replace old multi-national empires 1945:Yalta - great powers agree to partition Europe into Western and Soviet ""spheres of influence"". Iron Curtain falls across the continent 1989:Democratic revolutions in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe tear down the Iron Curtain. The Soviet Union collapses two years later. Vladimir Putin calls this the ""greatest catastrophe of the 20th Century"" Quentin Sommerville, one of the BBC's most experienced war reporters walked through the wreckage in Kharkiv recently and said of the Russian bombardment: ""If these tactics are unfamiliar to you, then you haven't been paying attention."" He should know, he spent enough time under Russian rockets in Syria to be paying very close attention. But the governments of the democratic world - how much attention have they been paying to the nature of the Putin regime? The evidence has been building for years. Two decades have passed since he sent troops into Georgia claiming he was supporting breakaway regions. Later, he sent spies into British cities armed with nerve agents to murder exiled Russians. In 2014, he invaded Eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Ukraine war: Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway 'If these tactics are unfamiliar to you, then you haven't been paying attention' 'Suburban gardens have become battlefields from Europe's past' Despite all this, Germany, and much of the EU, were locking themselves into an unhealthy dependence on Russian gas. A year after the annexation of Crimea, they approved the building of a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, to boost supplies. The ""complacency"" Liz Truss refers to also indicts her own country. London has been a safe haven for Russian money since John Major was prime minister. Russian oligarchs have parked billions here, laundered their money, bought up the most prestigious private homes in the capital, socialised with politicians and donated to their campaign funds. Few questions were asked about where their vast wealth, acquired so suddenly, had come from. So, no. The Western democracies have not been ""paying attention"" to the nature of the menace that has been incubating on their eastern frontier. But Putin, too, has seemed complacent. Receiving station for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, near Lubmin, Germany First, he believed the West was in chronic decline, weakened by internal division and ideological rancour. The election of Donald Trump and Brexit he saw as proof of this. The rise of right-wing authoritarian governments in Poland and Hungary was further evidence of the disintegration of liberal values and institutions. The US's humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan was proof of a waning power withdrawing from the world stage. Second, he misread what was happening on his borders. He refused to believe that a series of democratic uprisings in former Soviet Republics - Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004-5) and Kyrgyzstan (2005) - could possibly be authentic expressions of the popular will. Because each was aimed at removing corrupt and unpopular pro-Moscow governments, it seemed self-evident to the Kremlin that these were the work of foreign intelligence agencies, the Americans and the British in particular - Western imperialism's forward march into territory that was rightfully and historically Russia's. Third, he has failed to understand his own armed forces. It is clear now that he expected this ""special military operation"" to be over in a few days. Russia's military incompetence has astonished many Western security experts. It brings echoes for me of a smaller, more containable, but nonetheless devastating war, in former Yugoslavia. In 1992, Serb nationalists launched a war to strangle the newly independent state of Bosnia at birth. They argued that Bosnian identity was bogus, that Bosnian statehood had no historical legitimacy, that it was really part of Serbia. It is exactly Putin's view of Ukraine. A Bosnian special forces soldier and civilians come under fire from Serbian snipers, Sarajevo, 6 April 1992 Like Russia today, Serb forces enjoyed overwhelming firepower superiority. But they often stalled wherever local non-Serbs put up resistance. They seemed unable to seize towns or cities - unwilling to fight street-by-street on foot. The Bosnian defenders were initially very poorly equipped - I remember boys in tennis shoes in the trenches of Sarajevo with one AK-47 between three of them. But they defended their capital for nearly four years. There is a similar resolve in the young men volunteering to defend Kyiv. So instead of taking the cities and towns, the Serbs laid siege to them - surrounding them, bombarding them, cutting off water, gas and electricity. It is already happening in Mariupol. Besiege a city and cut off its water supply, and within 24 hours, every toilet is a public health hazard. Citizens have to go out into the streets to find water standpipes and fill up receptacles just to flush their loos. Cut off the electricity and you freeze in your own home. Soon the food runs out. Is that what the Russians intend for Mariupol, for Kharkiv, for Kyiv? To starve them into submission? But nearly four years of this cruelty gave Bosnian nationhood a founding narrative of resistance, suffering and heroic struggle. Ukraine's identity, too, will be strengthened further by the way Ukrainians have fought. Ukraine's Russian speakers have not felt ""liberated"" by the invasion. The evidence is that they, too, believe in Ukraine as a sovereign state. Putin's war, aimed at reunifying what he sees as two parts of the Russian nation, is already having the opposite effect - strengthening the will of most Ukrainians to seek a destiny free from Russian domination. Scrambling for rationed food during the siege of Sarajevo, 1992 In 1994, while the war in the Balkans was still raging, the rest of Eastern Europe was looking to the future - each nation eager to take what it saw as its natural place in a Europe of independent sovereign states at peace with each other. But it was still far from certain that any of them would be allowed to join Nato. There was a debate, back then, about whether a third security block should be formed by the newly-liberated East European nations, to act as a buffer between Nato and Russia. Russia was weak in the 1990s, and the nations that had endured Soviet occupation for 40 years did not trust it to stay weak for long. In the end, they wanted nothing short of Nato membership. Under President Bill Clinton, the US pressed ahead with Nato expansion. The Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who saw himself as a loyal ally of Clinton's, was said to be furious when he found out - at a press conference - that Nato was planning to admit new members without consulting Moscow. And the tearing down of the Iron Curtain had raised a new question in geopolitics - how far east does the Western world extend? I was commissioned by the BBC to take a road trip through Poland, Belarus and Ukraine to address the question, ""Where is the eastern edge of the Western world now?"" I went to the hunting lodge in Belarus where, in late 1991, the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, had met his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus. Here, they agreed to recognise each other's Soviet Republics as independent nation-states. They then rang the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and informed him that the country of which he was head of state - the Soviet Union - no longer existed. It was a moment fraught with both danger and opportunity. For Belarus and Ukraine, it was the chance to liberate themselves from Moscow rule - domination by Russian imperialism in both its Tsarist and Soviet forms. For Yeltsin, it represented the chance to liberate Russia too - from its historic role as an imperial power. The UK and France had both ceased to be imperial powers after World War Two - as Austria had done after WW1. In Turkey, Kemal Ataturk had built a modern European secular republic - a Turkish nation-state - after the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire had been defeated and dismembered in 1918. US President George HW Bush with Boris Yeltsin in Maryland, 1992 Could Boris Yeltsin do the same thing - build a modern Russian nation-state, at peace with its sovereign neighbours, on the ruins of the Soviet Empire? In the early 1990s, he began his Westernising experiment, to try to turn an imperial power into a democratic state. But the rush - encouraged by the Western democracies eager for investment opportunities - to turn a sclerotic, state-owned command economy into a free-market system was disastrous. It created gangster capitalism. A tiny elite became fabulously rich by plundering the assets of the major industries - especially oil and gas. The wheels finally came off the experiment in 1998. The economy collapsed, the rouble lost two-thirds of its value in a month and inflation hit 80%. I stood with a middle-aged couple in a queue at a Moscow bank. They wanted to take their money out in dollars or pounds - anything other than roubles. The queue was long and slow-moving and, every few minutes, a bank employee changed the displayed exchange rate, as the rouble plunged further. People could see their life savings dropping in value by the minute. The couple got close to the head of the queue when suddenly the shutters came down - there was no cash left. Queue at a Russian bank, Moscow, September 1998 I went to a former coal-mining region near the Ukraine border, where the mines were barely functioning. I met a graduate mining engineer who had lost his job - a man in his 30s with a young family. He took me to his dacha outside the city, which had about an acre of land. ""About 80% of what my family eat in the year,"" he said. ""I grow on this patch of land. The rest, like coffee and sugar, I barter for. I haven't used or even seen cash in about 18 months."" Nothing spoke more powerfully about Yeltsin's failure to transform Russia than the sight of this highly educated man digging for his own dinner. ""Stalin turned a nation of peasants into an industrial superpower in a generation. Yeltsin is doing the same thing in reverse,"" he told me. Ordinary Russians felt robbed. The great westernising experiment had been a con trick that had enriched a criminalised elite and impoverished everyone else. Many of the reports we filed from Russia at that time boiled down to a single question: ""What are the political consequences of the profound disenchantment that Russians now feel?"" The answer was that Russia, eventually, would revert to type - a retreat from democracy and a return to authoritarian rule. A retreat from nation-statehood and return to a more assertive imperial attitude to its ""near abroad"" - the countries that had previously been part of the Soviet Union. The former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski famously said that Russia could be a democracy or an empire, but it could not be both. The Russian emblem, the double-headed eagle, looks both east and west. History has pulled Russia in opposing directions - democratic nation statehood in one direction, domineering imperial power in the other. Go to St Petersburg and you will see another aspect of this dual character. It is the country's beautiful bay window on the Gulf of Finland. It is an 18th Century city, facing west. It is the European Enlightenment in architectural form. Under the Tsars it was the imperial capital. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks moved the capital back to Moscow and power retreated behind the high, crenellated walls of the Kremlin. It is the architecture of defensiveness, of suspicion, even fear. When Russian leaders look west from here, they see flat open countryside rolling away to the south and west for hundreds of miles. There are no natural frontiers. Palace Square at dusk, St Petersburg, Russia The crenellated red walls of the Kremlin in Moscow When I was the BBC's Moscow correspondent in the late 1990s, there was a driver who could remember, as a boy, seeing German troops on the outskirts of Moscow in the 1940s. Every time he took us to Sheremetyevo Airport, we would pass a monument designed to look like metal anti-tank defences - so-called Czech hedgehogs - and he would say: ""This is how close they came, the Germans."" Napoleon's army had gone further the previous century. That experience - that chronic sense of an insecure western frontier - informs the way Russian leaders have thought about their ""near abroad"". In another conversation about the ""near abroad"", a friend recited a rhyming couplet to me. In Russian it rhymes nicely, but in English it goes: ""A chicken's not really a bird; and Poland's not really abroad."" Russia's sense of what it is entitled to in the lands to its west penetrates popular consciousness, too. I will borrow an anecdote from another friend in Moscow at the time. The same driver picked her up from the airport and asked her where she had been. ""I've been for a weekend in Prague,"" she said. ""Oh Prague,"" came the reply. ""That's good. That's ours."" But it wasn't. The Berlin Wall had come down nine years earlier and the nations of Eastern Europe had ceased being ""ours"". Except Ukraine. Putin regards it not as a neighbouring country, but as the frontier land of Russia itself - and he wants it brought back into the Russian fold. What would it take to do that? How can a nation that has put up so unified a resistance be subdued? Almost certainly he has overreached himself. Several factors must now be alarming him. The first is the state of his own armed forces. Smoke rises from a destroyed Russian tank in Ukraine, 26 February The second is the resilience of the Ukrainian defence. Did Putin really expect the Russian-speaking people of Ukraine to welcome his troops as liberators? Did he really believe that the uprising of 2014 - which replaced the pro-Moscow government with one oriented to the West - was all a Western plot? If he did, then it reveals how little the Kremlin understands about its ""near abroad"". But his biggest miscalculation has been to underestimate the resolve of the West. And this is what makes 2022 one of those pivotal years - the zeitenwende, in the words of Chancellor Scholz. Almost overnight, Germany has transformed its attitude to its role in the world. Traditionally reluctant - for sound historical reasons - to throw its weight around, it had preferred the exercise of soft power to hard. Not now. It has announced a doubling of defence spending, and is sending lethal weapons to Ukraine. Gone, too, is the ostpolitik - the decades-old German policy of seeking peace through engagement, especially trade. Germany, along with the rest of the democratic world, will now move to end its dependence on Russian gas. The Nord Stream 2 project is suspended - though not yet scrapped. We are seeing a root-and-branch redrawing of the map of global energy distribution, aimed at cutting Russia out of it. Russia is highly integrated into the global economy. But now it has been expelled from the system the world uses to exchange payment for goods and services. Its industries, including oil and gas, depend on imported goods and components. Soon production will grind to a halt. Employers will have to lay off their workers. Unemployment will rise. No-one expected the West to sanction the Russian Central Bank. Already, the rouble has collapsed and interest rates have doubled. No other major economy has ever been subjected to a package of sanctions this punitive. It amounts to the expulsion of Russia from the global economy. More workers will be laid off. Major industries will find it hard to carry on. Unemployment will rise further. Soaring inflation will erode life savings. We will all be affected. Potentially, this is the rolling back of the globalised economy that emerged after the end of the Cold War. The US and the EU have, in effect, divided the world up. Those states and companies that continue to trade with Russia will find themselves punished - also frozen out of trade with the rich world. It amounts to a new economic iron curtain separating Russia from the West. Much will depend on how China negotiates this new landscape. China and Russia are bonded by their shared antipathy to American power, and their conviction that the greatest threat is from a resurgent, more unified democratic world. China does not want Putin weakened, or the West strengthened. Yet that is exactly what the effect the war in Ukraine has had. Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping meet in Beijing, February 2022 Some China watchers believe Beijing will try to challenge the dominance of the dollar as a reserve currency by carving out a distinct yuan zone as an alternative space in the global economy that can be protected from any future attempt by the US to sanction China. Putin's war, therefore, could redraw the international financial map. But above all, this is a war that pits the world's democracies against the world's authoritarian regimes. It is also a war between two conflicting conceptions of the rules by which international relations should function. The Oxford scholar Timothy Garton Ash says these two world views can be expressed in short form by two words - Helsinki versus Yalta. At Yalta in 1945, Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill carved post-war Europe into ""spheres of influence"" - most of Eastern Europe to Russia, the West to the trans-Atlantic alliance that would set about rebuilding Europe's democracies. ""Helsinki"", by contrast, describes a Europe of independent sovereign states, each of which is free to choose its own alliances. This grew out of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 and gradually evolved into the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Ukraine's defenders are fighting for Helsinki. Putin has sent his troops in to impose a modern version of Yalta - which would kill off Ukraine's independence and leave it under Russian domination. Garton Ash argues that the West has been too half-hearted in defending the values of Helsinki - that it has formally acknowledged Ukraine's right to join Nato at some unspecified date in the future without ever intending to make it happen. But Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has signalled a readiness to compromise on Helsinki principles, by agreeing to abandon Ukraine's ambition to become a Nato member. With all the risks that entails, it may yet be the price Ukraine pays for the survival of its statehood. My generation grew up with the existential terror of the threat of nuclear annihilation. The conflict has brought that fear back to public consciousness. Putin has threatened to use Russia's nuclear arsenal. That makes this the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Then, the Soviet Union shipped nuclear missiles to its ally Cuba. The US assembled a fleet to blockade (or ""quarantine"") Cuba and was considering an attack on the island by air and/or sea. What the Americans did not know is that the Soviets didn't only have long-range strategic missiles. They also had smaller, tactical nuclear missiles - so-called battlefield nuclear weapons. And that Soviet military doctrine delegated first-use decision making to commanders on the ground. Had the threatened invasion gone ahead, it would have triggered a nuclear exchange. The then American Defence Secretary Robert McNamara only found out about this when the Soviet archives opened in 1991. Only then, did he understand how close the world had come to catastrophe. In a remarkable film called Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert McNamara, he explained how the world had avoided destroying itself. Was it skilled diplomacy? Wise leadership? No. ""Luck,"" he said. ""We lucked out."" That experience, now fading from memory, should focus minds.

Syria's president makes historic visit to UAE,"The Syrian leader met with Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Syria's president has made his first trip to an Arab country since the Syrian civil war began 11 years ago. Bashar al-Assad arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Friday, and met several influential and controversial rulers who signalled a willingness to strengthen ties with Syria again. It marks a potential warming in Syria's relations with its Arab neighbours, which had previously isolated Mr Assad. But the US criticised the trip, saying it was ""profoundly disappointed"". Among the Emiratis Mr Assad met was the billionaire ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, who has been embroiled in a number of controversies recently. One of his 25 children, Latifa, has previously said she was being held hostage and feared for her life after trying to escape Dubai in 2018. And late last year, he settled a Â£500m ($660m) divorce case with one of his six wives, Princess Haya Bint Al-Hussain, who fled to Britain in 2019 and spent huge sums on personal security after receiving threatening messages and having her phone hacked, according to court documents. Princess Latifa: The Dubai ruler's daughter who vanished The princess, the sheikh and the Â£550m divorce settlement Mr Assad also travelled to the UAE's capital city, Abu Dhabi, to meet with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. According to Emirati state media, he ""stressed that Syria is a fundamental pillar of Arab security, and that the UAE is keen to strengthen cooperation with it"". The leaders reportedly discussed how the UAE could provide political and humanitarian support for Syria, as well as how to promote economic trade between the nations. President Assad was also photographed with the owner of Manchester City Football Club, Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Syrian leader met the UAE's Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who owns Manchester City Football Club Syria's president has made few international trips since his country's long and bloody civil war began in March 2011, which the United Nations says has so far killed 350,000 people. Until now Mr Assad had only left the war-torn country to visit Russia and Iran, both military backers of his regime. The US said it was ""profoundly disappointed and troubled"" by the UAE's decision to welcome Mr Assad. The US is against efforts to normalise relations with the Syrian leader until progress is made resolving the civil war. United Arab Emirates profile Syria country profile Bashar al-Assad: Facing down rebellion ""We urge states considering engagement with the Assad regime to weigh carefully the horrific atrocities visited by the regime on the Syrians over the last decade,"" said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price. Along with the majority of Arab states, the UAE broke ties with Syria soon after the civil war erupted - and once backed rebel fighters in its attempts to overthrow Mr Assad's regime. But in recent years relations between the two countries have gradually improved, with the UAE spearheading efforts to bring Syria back into the Arab fold despite protests from Washington. In 2018 the UAE reopened its embassy in Syria's capital, Damascus, and in November last year, diplomats were sent there to there to meet President Assad. Even if gradual, any improvement of ties with a wealthy Gulf neighbour would be a boost to Mr Assad's government, which has been crippled by Western sanctions and international isolation.

"Murder probe as woman, 19, dies in central London","Flowers were laid at the police cordon at Arbour House in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell A 19-year-old woman has been killed at student accommodation in central London. She was found with serious injuries when police and medics were called to Arbour House in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell, at about 05:10 GMT. The teenager, who is believed to have been a student, was later pronounced dead at the scene, the Met Police said. A murder investigation has been launched and detectives are trying to identify the woman's next of kin. No arrests have been made and a police presence remains at the scene. Ch Insp Adam Instone, of the Met Police, said he understood the student community would be concerned. ""I share their sadness and concerns, and I can assure them that a thorough homicide investigation is under way, led by skilled and experienced detectives who will work tirelessly to identify and arrest whoever is responsible."" Ch Insp Adam Instone said officers would work tirelessly on the case Student William Fereyre Guerra, who lives at the halls, said they were told to stay in their rooms in the early hours of the morning. ""There's been a helicopter during the night as well,"" he said. ""We were told to stay in the room because they didn't know if the suspect was still there hiding."" William Fereyre Guerra said people in his halls were told to stay in their room A spokesman for Unite Students, which runs Arbour House, said: ""As this remains an ongoing police incident, we are unable to comment on their investigation. ""Our priority at this time is the safety and wellbeing of students at Arbour House. We are working closely with the police and City, University of London."" A spokeswoman for the university said it was supporting the police's investigation and working with Unite Students.

Multiple bids submitted for Chelsea,"Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 for Â£140m The Ricketts family, who own Major League Baseball team the Chicago Cubs, a consortium featuring Lord Coe and another group led by British property investor Nick Candy have all submitted offers to buy Chelsea. A deadline for bids was set for 21:00 GMT on Friday after the Premier League club had been put up for sale by Russian owner Roman Abramovich. Chelsea fan Candy said that he had secured additional investment from South Korea and that his bid is ""over Â£2bn"". Also among the confirmed bidders is a group consisting of Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, US businessman and Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly, American PR executive Barbara Charone, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein and British journalist Daniel Finkelstein. The consortium is working with America-based investment firm Clearlake Capital, which has about$60bn (Â£45.6bn),externalof assets under management. Is this a moment of reckoning for ownership in English football? Abramovich's attempt to sell the club was halted after he wassanctioned by the UK governmentand his assets, including Chelsea, were frozen. That move came in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Abramovich understood to have strong ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin. American investment firm Raine Group has been tasked with selling Chelsea and the UK government is expected to issue a new licence, allowing the club to be sold, once a preferred buyer had been highlighted. Although theofficial deadline to purchasethe west London Premier League club was 21:00 GMT on Friday, some final bids are likely to be submitted into the weekend. There are still more than 20 interested parties, but the number of confirmed bids is likely to be 10 to 15. Chelsea and Raine Group will make a shortlist next week, with the preferred bidder then requiring government approval, which will involve proving the source of funds and where the money goes next. Any sale will also need to be signed off by the Premier League's owners' and directors' test - known as the 'fit and proper person's test'. One of the bids was submitted by a consortium led by ex-Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Coe. ""I remain the only person [in the bidding process] to have effected a change of ownership at a major football club in a similar situation, which I did at Liverpool 12 years ago,"" Broughton, who is also a former British Airways chairman, said. ""As a lifelong fan, I am committed to ensuring Chelsea maintains its preeminent position at the top of European football and making sure we put fans first."" The consortium said fans would be ""at the heart of decision making"" if the bid was successful and it would ""guarantee the club is never beholden to a single individual or sovereign wealth fund"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Broughton said the consortium were ""fully on board"" with the recommendations made by a fan-led review into the sport last year. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch chaired the review, which statedsupporters should be consultedon all key off-field decisions through a 'shadow board'. ""All the ideas Tracey Crouch put forward are on the table,"" Broughton said. ""We don't want to tell the fans which elements of the report we want to introduce, we want to sit down with them. ""We absolutely think that the winning bid needs to be fan friendly and it needs to take on board the philosophy of the Tracey Crouch report."" A spokesperson for Candy's Blue Football Consortium said: ""I can confirm that the two South Korean firms Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group are a significant part of Mr Candy's global consortium of investors. ""Their involvement is representative of Chelsea's global brand and huge loyal fanbase in Asia."" Candy added: ""Football clubs are vitally important community and cultural assets, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give football back to the fans and put them at the heart of the operations and strategy of a leading global football club."" The bid from the Ricketts family is backed by billionaire hedge fund entrepreneur Ken Griffin. Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, who had previously expressed an interest in the club, said late on Friday that his company AB Group Holding had not filed a bid. Bayrak attributed AB Group's failure to meet the deadline to a misunderstanding with his lawyers over the auction procedure, telling news agency Reuters that he was ""very upset"" by the situation. A consortium led by ex-Liverpool chairmanSir Martin Broughton,and joined by London 2012 chiefLord Coe. The Ricketts family, who own Major League Baseball team the Chicago Cubs, are leading a bid from a group of investors. Swiss billionaireHansjorg Wyssand US businessmanTodd Boehlyhave formed part of a consortium to try to take over Chelsea. Now joined by American PR executiveBarbara Charone, British businessmanJonathan Goldsteinand British journalistDaniel Finkelstein. London-based investment firmAethel Partners, headed by Portuguese entrepreneur Ricardo Silva. British multi-millionaire businessmanNick Candy,supported by former Chelsea strikerGianluca Vialli, who co-owns Tifosy, a mergers and acquisitions company for the football sector, and joined by Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group. Other parties reported to be interested include US billionaire and Philadelphia 76ers ownerJosh Harris,who has a stake in Crystal Palace,New York Jets owner Woody Johnson,externaland aSaudi Arabia-based consortium.,external Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 for Â£140m but in hisstatementannouncing his intention to sell he said his ownership had ""never been about business nor money, but about pure passion for the game and club"". He values the club at Â£3bn and has loaned the club Â£1.5bn - but said he will not ask for any loans to be repaid. Abramovich has also said proceeds of the sale would be donated to war victims. The funds from the sale could go to a charitable organisation or into a frozen account. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire has said the Â£3bn price tag ""does seem excessive"" given the size of Stamford Bridge. ""Most commentators take the view that it's not big enough to generate the money that somebody would want going forward,"" Maguire said. ""There is no capacity to increase Stamford Bridge given where it's located in London so therefore moving elsewhere in London would be very expensive indeed."" The Sports Desk podcast: Exit Abramovich as sport turns its back on Russia How Abramovich rewrote the rules on how to run a successful club Chelsea: Aethel Partners become latest group to submit bid to buy club Chicago Cubs owners and consortium featuring Lord Coe intend to bid for club British businessman Nick Candy says he is planning takeover bid Football finance expert Kieran Maguire: Chelsea have lost more than Â£900,000 a week since Roman Abramovich acquired the club, with a wage bill of Â£28m a month. Most of the organisations that have come forward are linked to American investors, who have franchise investments in the NFL, NBA and so on. What they will be looking to do there is change the model so there is better cost control at Chelsea, or trying to generate additional money. We're now reaching close to a critical mass of American investment in the Premier League, so they could be looking to change the culture in the Premier League, perhaps with the aim of cutting back levels of expenditure to make it more profitable from a day-to-day basis. Taking a look at Aethel's own accounts it is unusual how a company with relatively few assets could make a bid as large as we're talking about, in the Â£2-3bn arena. Abramovich has owned Chelsea since 2003, with the club winning 21 trophies during his tenure. He had his British assets, which include Chelsea, frozen by the UK government and was disqualified as a director of the club by the Premier League. The Blues are allowed to continue operating aftera special licence was issued by the UK government, This also ensures Chelsea's 800 staff - plus hundreds more on matchdays - are paid and allows existing season ticket holders to attend matches, but a new licence will need to be issued for the club to be sold. Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said earlier this month: ""The quickest one [sale of a club] we've done is 10 days, but that's not to say it can't be beaten. ""Normally it's a matter of weeks but it depends on the complexities and the number of potential owners.""

"UK's safe level for tap water too high - scientistsExperts say the UK should reduce the amount of toxic ""forever chemicals"" allowed in drinking water.Science & Environment","Scientists are concerned that the allowable levels of toxic PFAS - known as ""forever chemicals"" - in drinking water are too high. A BBC study found PFAS levels exceeded European safety levels in almost half of the samples taken. However, none exceeded the current safety level in England and Wales. Linked to cancer and other diseases, PFAs are in many products such as non-stick pans, food packaging, carpets, furniture, firefighting foam. Guidelines from theDrinking Water Inspectorate,,externalwhich covers England and Wales, state drinking water must contain PFAS chemicals at no more than 100 nanograms per litre (ng/l). Above that, action must be taken to reduce levels. Scotland is committed to enforcing European guidelines next year. Working with the University of Greenwich and Manchester Metropolitan University, the BBC took 45 tap water samples from sites in England. Laboratory analysis found that none exceeded the 100ng/l level. But 25 samples did contain PFASs, and four had levels that exceeded 10ng/l, which, under the current guidelines, means local healthcare professionals must be consulted, and levels monitored. And almost half of the samples exceeded the European Food Standards Agency tolerable limit of 2.2ng/l. Race to replace persistent chemicals in our homes Toxic 'forever chemicals' found in British otters Professor Roger Klein, a chemist and PFAS expert, said: ""The significance of your results, even though they're small, is that it underlines that this stuff is everywhere and that it's in drinking water. ""It's ridiculous that the Drinking Water Inspectorate has a level of 100ng/l before action is taken."" Rita Lock-Caruso, Professor of toxicology at the University of Michigan, also said the results raised a potential health concern: ""We're finding health effects at lower and lower concentrations - in the single digits."" Research has found the most common PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, have probable links to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. There is particular concern about the effect on children. Professor Philippe Grandjean, of Harvard University, said: ""A woman may build this up in her body and when she gets pregnant, she shares that with her foetus. She eliminates part of her body burden into her milk. So, the next generation will get a huge dose, and the baby may end up having up to 10 times as much PFAS in the blood as her mother has."" The US is considering reducing its regulatory level, from 70ng/l. ""We are beginning to think that there's no such thing as a safe level and we want them to be as low as possible, because water is not the only source of exposure,"" said former head of the National Institute of Environmental Sciences, Linda Birnbaum. However, there is little public data about its presence or impacts in the UK. Some residents on the Channel Island of Jersey believe they are suffering adverse health impacts from drinking water contaminated with PFAS. In the 1990s the government of Jersey discovered PFAS had polluted St Ouen's Bay aquifer, which was used by locals for drinking water. After years of local lobbying, the government of Jersey has recently agreed to offer free blood tests for people with health issues in the area. Sarah Simon is convinced PFASs have damaged the health of local people ""I have an autoimmune disease, my father has kidney disease, and my mother has thyroid disease,"" says Sarah Simon, a lifelong Jersey resident turned citizen scientist. ""When I started talking to our neighbours, I found that many of the men had kidney stones and the women had thyroid disease. This can't be a coincidence."" PFOS and PFOA has been restricted and neither are manufactured in the UK now. However, there are still a raft of other PFASs which are still being used and aren't regulated. The BBC study found 18 different types of PFAS chemicals in the tap water samples. In a statement, the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs said: ""We have robust systems in place to identify the impact of a range of chemicals on the environment and human health and are working closely with regulators to better assess the presence of PFAS in our natural environment and their sources.""

Please join us for thelatest updates here. Russia's alleged use of its hypersonic missile is probably intended to ""detract from a lack of progress"" in its ground campaign, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in a tweet. Over the last several days, Russia has claimed to have fired hypersonic missiles - for the first time ever in combat - at targets in western Ukraine. Russian officials claim the missile - known as the Kinzhal - can hit targets up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away at speeds over 6,000 km/h. The UK's MoD, however, assesses the missiles are unlikely to ""materially affect the outcome"" of Russia's campaign in Ukraine. Read more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Jessica ParkerBBC News, Brussels âWe donât want to create a European army,â the EUâs foreign
affairs chief has said. Josep Borrell was speaking after foreign and defence
ministers approved a document known as theStrategic Compass,external. It includes plans to develop âEU Rapid Deployment Capacityâ
that could allow the bloc to âswiftly deploy up to 5,000 troopsâ for different
types of crises. âWeâll conduct live exercises together,â he said, which has never happened before. Borrell emphasised member states have, and will still
have, their own armies but said countries must work more closely together. He added Nato was still ""the cornerstone of the territorial
defence of Europeâ.  White House warns of possible Russian cyber-attacks Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The White House has issued a fresh warning to US businesses of possible
cyber-attacks from Russia. In a statement, President Biden said his administration was reiterating
previous warnings ""based on evolving intelligence that the Russian
Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks"". The White House said it was a ""critical"" moment to boost defences. This is the latest in a series of warnings about possible fall-out in
cyberspace from the conflict. In particular, there have been concerns that Russia might retaliate for
sanctions by hitting back at the US and Western economies through cyber-attacks. So far these attacks have not materialised. But this latest warning does suggest US intelligence has seen some
indications of Russian activity on computer networks that could be the prelude
for some kind of attack â however, they acknowledge that this does not mean that
such an attack will definitely take place. The public warning may be designed to act as a deterrent. US and UK cyber officials have both been briefing executives of major
organisations over a period of months, especially those within critical
infrastructure, to warn them of the risks and encourage them to ensure they
have the best possible defences in place. The UK branch of Russian gas giant Gazprom could be placed under
administration soon, according to reports. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the UK's government is preparing to
step in and run Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail Ltd. The firm's clients include McDonald's and Siemens, as well as councils
and hospitals around the country. It does not, however, sell gas from its
parent company in Russia. The BBC understands that the UK government is looking at a number of
options and monitoring the situation closely. The government, however, has not commented on the possible
administration procedure, with a spokesperson noting only that the UK us in
""no way"" dependent on Russian gas. Earlier in March, several councils in England told the BBC they were
seeking to end their contracts with Gazprom. Both McDonald's and Siemens have

contracts. Gazprom has yet to comment. Read more here Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The most bombarded city in Ukraineâs war with Russia is key to Moscowâs military campaign. But why? Securing a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas:Mariupol stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula. They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Strangling Ukraine's economy:In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond. Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Propaganda opportunity:Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, which contains far-right extremists including neo-Nazis. Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has given Moscow a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis. Major morale boost:A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow.

visited today in Dnipro will stay here in central Ukraine, perhaps hoping one
day to return to Mariupol. But with much of the city destroyed and as many as 40% of those damaged
structures said to be irreparable, returning any time soon will not be an
option for many. Among those is Olga, who we met while she was picking up food, some
clothes, and bedding. For the time being her immediate family is staying in a
small flat here in the city after a harrowing journey out of Mariupol. ""We were driving out under fire,"" Olga tells me. ""Shells
were exploding. They were bombing us and there were dead bodies everywhere, but
we managed to join the larger convoy and eventually get out."" Olga says sheâd like to return to the broken city she calls home,
especially as she has extended family members still trapped there, unable to
escape. But, Olga told me, she received an ominous warning from a Russian
soldier at one of the last checkpoints out of Mariupol. ""Donât bother
staying in Dnipro,"" the soldier said to her, ""because we'll soon be
attacking that city as well."" This video can not be played Footage has emerged of Russian forces using gunfire to disperse demonstrators in the occupied southern city of Kherson. The footage - which was shared on social media and verified by the BBC - also shows explosions, which were reported to be from stun grenades. Demonstrators were reportedly injured during the incident. Protests have taken place in the city of Kherson since the city fell to Russian forces on 3 March. Read more about the protestshere. We told you earlier about the bombastic warning Russia issued that its relations with the US were near breaking point. It comes days after President Joe Biden called his Russian counterpart ""a war criminal"". Since Biden made the statement on 16 March, the label has been heard more often in connection with Vladimir Putin. Former UK prime ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major have called for the creation of a new international tribunal to investigate Putin and those who helped plan his invasion of Ukraine. And the Pentagon has indicated the US is actively engaged in the investigation of the Russian leader. ""We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are
committing war crimes and we are helping with the collecting of
evidence of that,"" spokesman John Kirby told a news
briefing. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is spearheading the legal process - after 39 nations called for an inquiry to be opened. Read more about war crimes and whether Putin may be prosecuted Hundreds were sheltering at the Mariupol theatre when missiles destroyed it S-300 anti-aircraft weapons on parade in Kyiv last year Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby says the US is in ""ongoing discussions"" with other countries to provide long-range air defence systems to Ukraine. To date, the US has provided Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. These systems, however, are primarily effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, rather than higher altitude combat aircraft. It has been reported a number of countries - including Slovakia - have expressed a willingness to give Ukraine S-300 anti-aircraft systems, provided they receive something to replace them. Ukraine already uses the S-300 and has personnel trained in its use. While Kirby does not comment directly on Slovakia or the S-300, he says the US is in ""active consultations"" about âthe
kinds of defence capabilities to include long-range air defences, that we know
that theyâre [Ukraine] comfortable using."" Wyre DaviesBBC News, Dnipro Children playing at a makeshift refugee reception centre in Dnipro At what is usually a middle school in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, a makeshift reception centre for refuges of fighting from the east has been set up. Many of the people queueing patiently in the schoolyard are from the besieged city of Mariupol â others have come here from Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. They all have another thing in common â theyâre without possessions. Families crammed into cars, they fled through mined roads and numerous Russian checkpoints to safety and need all the basics to survive; food, clothes, and medicine. All of the things being collected here are donations from residents of Dnipro and local charities. So, while children get hand-me-down toys, their mothers line up for the basics. In the school canteen, volunteers package together food parcels that will feed a family for a couple of days. Among those working here is Vadym, normally a teacher at the school but
now doing his ""civic duty to help other Ukrainians"". The UN says there
are six and a half million displaced people inside Ukraine alone. This city and
this community are doing their part to make that transition less traumatic. Women putting together food parcels for refugees If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's a short summary of
what's been happening in the war in Ukraine: Russia's foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador John Sullivan in to protest about recent statements by President Biden, who labelled President Putin a ""war criminal"" over the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement, the ministry said the comments were unworthy of a statesman of such a high rank and pushed Russian-American relations to breaking point. Hostile actions taken against Russia would receive a ""decisive and firm response,"" it warned. The State Department confirmed that the meeting between Sullivan and Russian officials took place, adding that Sullivan demanded that US citizens in custody be given access to consular services. The department says that one US citizen, basketball player Brittany Griner, has still not been given access to consular services after being detained for possession of vape cartridges last month. Speaking to reporters on Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said it is ""awfully rich"" for Russia to ""speak about 'inappropriate comments' when that same country is engaged in mass slaughter"". Jessica ParkerBBC News, Brussels The EUâs foreign affairs chief has suggested there wonât be a further package of EU sanctions against Russia adopted this week. Josep Borrell was speaking at a press conference, following meetings of the blocâs foreign and defence ministers in Brussels. âFormal adoption of sanctions requires procedure and I donât think during this week it will be formal adoption of sanctions, according with our procedures.â But he said when EU leaders meet later this week, for a summit in Brussels, theyâll likely consider âwhat else can be done"". He said the issue of energy had been raised by some ministers - but today wasnât a day for such decisions, rather one for âanalysingâ possible future actions. Borrell said there needs to be an âeffective response which wonât lead to an unbearable cost for member states"". Five cases of Russian forces detaining local officials have been recorded in the northern city of Chernihiv, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency is reporting. Quoting the Ukrainian parliament website, it says Russian forces have detained the heads of two villages and a local councillor, while two local government officials have also been abducted. Meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine, Russians have abducted the head of a village in Kharkiv, according to UNIAN news agency. The Russian newspaper KP said the lines appeared as a result of a hack We reported earlier that our colleagues at BBC Russian had compiled a list of 557 confirmed Russian military deaths in the Ukraine invasion, mentioning that Russia's defence ministry has so far only once provided fatality figures - 498 deaths as of 2 March. All that suddenly changed in the last few hours, or so it seemed... The staunchly pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP) published an article quoting the ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen had died, a figure which exceeds even US intelligence estimates of Russian fatalities. It gave the number of wounded as 16,153. Minutes later, this part of the article disappeared from the page, but we were able to take screen grabs of the relevant paragraphs. KP editor Vladimir Sungorkin subsequently told the BBC the information had been the result of a hack, and said the paper will post an explanation later.  Joe Biden at the White House on Sunday US President Joe Biden has held a phone call with European leaders to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, the White House has announced. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on the call, as was Italian PM Mario Draghi, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron. In a statement, the White House said that the leaders ""discussed their serious concerns about Russiaâs
brutal tactics in Ukraine, including its attacks on civilians"". ""They underscored
their continued support for Ukraine, including by providing
security assistance to the brave Ukrainians who are defending their country
from Russian aggression, and humanitarian assistance to the millions of
Ukrainians who have fled the violence,"" the statement added. Biden is scheduled to travel to Europe later this week for meetings with Nato, EU, and G7 allies in Brussels, followed by a bilateral meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Friday. Pavel has been taking pictures in bomb shelters Pavel Gomzyakov usually photographs the happiest days of peopleâs lives. He is an award-winning wedding photographer from Mariupol, southern Ukraine. But, recently, he has been documenting life in the city as it has come under heavy Russian attack. âBefore the start of the war, Mariupol was a peaceful Ukrainian city, a city in which 95% of people were Russian speaking, like me. My daughter used to study at a Russian school,â he tells BBC Panorama. At the end of last week, he escaped, along with his wife and nine-year-old son. His elderly parents stayed behind and he hasnât been able to contact them for days, as electricity has been cut. He is now trying work out how he can unite with his eldest daughter, 17, who is alone in Germany. She was in the north-eastern Ukrainian city Kharkiv at ballet school when the war started. Pavel says it is if they have all woken up to a new, terrible reality. More on PanoramaUkraine's Resistance: Standing Up to Putinon BBC One at 20:00 GMT A satellite photo shows the disputed Kuril islands (Hokkaido is bottom left) Russia says it is abandoning talks with Japan aimed at signing a formal peace treaty, because Japan has joined in sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. They did not formally end World War Two hostilities because of a dispute over small islands known in Russia as the Southern Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories. They lie just off Japan's northern island of Hokkaido and were occupied by Soviet forces in 1945. Russia's foreign ministry says its move freezes discussions on joint economic projects for the islands and halts visa-free visits to them by Japanese citizens. ""All responsibility for the harm to bilateral co-operation and to the interests of Japan itself lies with official Tokyo, which deliberately chose to pursue an anti-Russian course,"" the ministry said. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak has told the BBC his country's resilience has made Russia ""more adequately assess the reality"" of how its invasion is progressing - leading, he says, to a change in the talks between the two countries. Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, several rounds of negotiations have taken place between delegates from Kyiv and Moscow but it's been hard to gauge the progress so far.
