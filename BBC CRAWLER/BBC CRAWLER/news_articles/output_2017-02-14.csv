Man City's Jesus has broken metatarsal,"Gabriel Jesus scored in his first two league starts for Manchester City Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus broke a metatarsal in Monday's 2-0 Premier Leaguewin at Bournemouth. The 19-year-old was taken off in the 15th minute at Vitality Stadium after appearing to pick up the foot injury. City said in a statement: ""He will undergo further examinations in the coming days to establish the extent of his layoff."" The Brazil international, who completeda Â£27m from Palmeirasin January, has played five times for City. Jesus was hoping to become the third City player to find the net on each of his first three Premier League starts, having scored at West Ham and two against Swansea. The other two players to have achieved that feat are former striker Emmanuel Adebayor and and current midfielder Kevin de Bruyne. Metatarsal injuries - and recovery times Kasper Schmeichel (2014): predicted six weeks; returned after 14 weeks Michael Owen (2006): Fifth metatarsal - predicted six to eight weeks; returned after 17 weeks Wayne Rooney (2004): Fifth metatarsal - predicted eight weeks; returned after 14 weeks David Beckham (2002): Second metatarsal - predicted six weeks; returned after seven weeks Jesus completed his move to Manchester City from Palmeiras in January Metatarsals are the five long bones in the forefoot which connect the ankle bones to those of the toes. The first is linked to the big toe and the fifth, on the outer foot, links to the little toe. Together, the five metatarsals act as a unit to help share the load of the body, and they move position to cope with uneven ground. Injuries usually occur as a result of a direct blow to the foot, a twisting injury or over-use. Medical experts recommend rest with no exercise and sport for four to eight weeks. The patient might be asked to wear walking boots or stiff-soled shoes to protect the injury while it heals. If the cause is over-use, then treatment can vary hugely. Training habits, equipment used and athletic technique should all be investigated. It all depends on the damage and which metatarsal bone is involved. It is impossible to put a timescale on recovery from a stress injury. With an impact fracture, after the plaster and protective boot is not needed (usually after four to six weeks), it will be a case of exercise and increasing weight-bearing activities. Ice packs, strapping and even the use of oxygen tents can be used to assist recovery. Full return to action can be anything from another four weeks and upwards - depending on the extent of initial damage. Young bones heal quicker.

The Royals trailed Brentford 2-1 going into the final 15 minutes but goals from Danny Williams and Roy Beerans gave them a precious win.

Sheffield Wednesday also strengthened their own play-off hopes with a 2-1 victory over Blackburn, while Jake Buxton's late header earned Wigan a vital win at Wolves.

Aston Villa's woes continued with a 3-1 defeat at home to Barnsley. Brighton 1-1 Ipswich A great game at Brighton ends level. The visitors took an early lead through skipper Luke Chambers' header before Tomer Hemed equalised from the spot before the break. The result keeps the Seagulls second in the table. Brighton 1-1 Ipswich Glenn Murray smashes a shot against the post for Brighton. That would have sent them top of the table!

Jamaal Lascelles gave the leaders a deserved point with a fine finish late on. Roy Beerens Two minutes after they equalised, Reading are ahead. It's a shocking clearance by Brentford keeper Dan Bentley, who sends the ball straight to Yann Kermorgant. Kermorgant sennds the ball back towards goal, andRoy Beerensfinishes into an empty net. Aston Villa 1-3 Barnsley Barnsley heap more misery on listless Aston Villa. A double from Tom Bradshaw and Adam Armstrong's penalty give the Tykes all three points at Villa Park. Villa have taken just one point from seven games in 2017. Danny Williams If everyone could stop scoring for a minute, we could use a breather. Reading are back on level terms with Brentford,Danny Williamsturning in from Garath McCleary's cross. There's plenty of time for a winner in this one, having kicked off at 20:00. Norwich 2-2 Newcastle Ayoze Perez, who scored in the first minute, nearly scores in the last. Norwich keeper John Ruddy keeps out the Spaniard's effort. Brighton 1-1 Ipswich It's still really open at Brighton. This time Emy Huws bursts through for Ipswich but he's denied by a combination of goalkeeper David Stockdale and defender Shane Duffy. Tommy Smith Huddersfield just cannot be stopped this season and it looks like they're heading for a fifth straight league win. Tommy Smithcollects the ball on the right and powers a low shot into the corner from all of 25 yards. Stunning strike and as things stand the Terriers will be four points behind an automatic promotion spot. Joe Ralls Surely the winner for Cardiff!

Martin Bashir: Fireworks and faith at general synod,"The Archbishop of Canterbury was certainly the highlight of the opening day at general synod. Less an address, more a sermon,external, he appealed to Christians to turn away from self-indulgence and toward self-sacrifice in order to contribute positively at a time of uncertainty and fearâ¦ a climate that he said had been brought about by populist movements across Europe and the election of Donald Trump. ""It is a moment of challenge, but challenge that as a nation can be overcome with the right practices, values, culture and spirit,"" explained the archbishop. ""Which is where we come in. Let's not be too self-important. I don't mean we, the Church of England, are the answer. ""But we can be part of the answer, we have a voice and a contribution and a capacity and a reach and above all a Lord who is faithful when we fail and faithful when we flourish."" But while these comments were made in the context of post-Brexit uncertainty, it was obvious to everyone gathered in the assembly hall of Church House in Westminster that the archbishop was also thinking of Wednesday, whensynod,externalwill debate the bishops' report on same-sex marriage. This video can not be played The Archbishop of Canterbury addresses General Synod GS2055, as it is known, was published last month,externaland provoked an immediate outcry. Members of the LGBTI community expressed anger that, after engaging in three years of so-called ""shared conversations"", the bishops decided not to recommend any change to church practice. Marriage in church would remain the lifelong union of a man and a woman; there would be no facility to bless same-sex marriages. Wednesday has therefore become the focal point for both traditionalists and those who want the church to mirror a change in the law of the land, which has allowed same-sex marriage since March 2014. As members arrive on Wednesday morning, they'll be greeted by a vigil organised by theLesbian and Gay Christian Movement,externalandChanging Attitude,externalwith the support of thePeter Tatchell Foundation,externalandOut and Proud African LGBTI,external. Mr Tatchell, anticipating the protest, said: ""The bishops' report defends heterosexual superiority and opposes same-sex blessings and marriages. The church blesses dogs and cats but it refuses to bless loving, committed same-sex couples. It treats LGBTI clergy and laity as second class, both within the church and the wider society."" The bishops' report says marriage in church will remain the lifelong union of a man and a woman The debate inside, which begins at 17:30 GMT and is scheduled to last for 90 minutes, will be no less accusatory. It is likely to expose the fractures and fissures that exist within the heart of Christian unity. Evangelical christians, like Ed Shaw, a member of synod and a trustee ofLiving Out,external, a charity that exists to support same-sex-attracted Christians who have chosen to remain celibate, are relieved that the bishops have upheld what they say is the biblical position on marriage. ""I think the Church of England has carefully listened,"" he said. ""I think the Church has also come to the settled view of what Christians have always believed down the centuries and what most Christians believe around the world."" For the moment, this remains the official position of the Church of England. As the Archbishop of Canterbury drew his opening address to a close, he did make one explicit reference to same-sex marriage.  He described ""the painful discussions"" that will take place on Wednesday. That phrase may yet prove to be the understatement of the year.

Russia looms large behind Flynn affair,"As with any resignation there are a thousand small, but nevertheless important questions. Most are of the who-knew-what-and-when variety. But with this astonishing fall from grace there is one big overarching question. I'll save that best bit for last. The small questions concern whether Donald Trump knew about the calls Mike Flynn was making to the Russian ambassador, and what the substance of their conversations were. What happened to the advice given by the acting attorney general to the White House counsel cautioning that Gen Flynn had not been entirely honest. Was the president aware of this? Were there different factions operating within the White House yesterday with different agendas on the embattled national security adviser's future? Then we can go a sub-section of those questions which revolve around management at the White House. The seemingly dull-sounding process questions: What are the lines of communication? Who reports to whom? Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer had very different public reactions to stories about Flynn on Monday If that all sounds rather trivial, ask this - how was it possible that within a single hour yesterday afternoon Kellyanne Conway, counsel to the president, said Mr Flynn enjoyed the full support of Mr Trump, and then shortly afterwards, Communications Director Sean Spicer said the president was evaluating Mr Flynn's position? Those just aren't reconcilable statements. Who was speaking on whose authority? This is not good communications strategy; this is what shambles looks like. Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake How Michael Flynn's resignation unfolded Where Trump stands on key issues Is US heading for constitutional crisis? And let's deal with one bit of smoke that has been thrown up since the resignation. Kellyanne Conway was across the US networks this morning with a simple and tempting argument - what sealed Flynn's fate was his misleading of the vice president over the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador. That resulted in Mike Pence going on TV in the middle of January and saying: ""It was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation. They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia."" Of course, you can't lie/mislead/deceive/inadvertently misreport to (delete as appropriate) the vice president. But, if you draw yourself a little timeline of what happened then, what is striking is this - it is not the lie/misleading/deception/inadvertent misreporting that cost General Flynn his job, it is the lie/misleading/deception/inadvertent misreporting being made public by the Washington Post that cost him his job. We now know the acting attorney generalwent to the White House weeks before,externalto say voice intercepts of Gen Flynn's call proved that lifting of sanctions was discussed. But no action was taken then. Only when it blew up did this become an issue. This conforms to the little discussed 11th Commandment that Moses handed down on his tablets of stone: Thou Shall Not Get Found Out. But let us move on to the really big question. What does this say about President Trump's relationship with Russia? For a man who at the drop of a hat will freely spray insults on Twitter to anyone and anything, the one person he stubbornly refuses to say a bad word about is Vladimir Putin. Not ever. White House staff in the Oval Office as Donald Trump speaks by phone to Vladimir Putin in late January In one recent interview he seemed to suggest that America as a state had no greater moral authority than Russia. It was the doctrine of American Unexceptionalism, if you like. Michael Flynn had sat with the Russian president not that long ago at a dinner honouring the pro-Moscow TV network Russia Today. Extraordinary that a former three star US general would be there. A dossier drawn up by a former MI6 officer - that was flatly denied - alleged all manner of Russian involvement in President Trump's businesses and presidential campaign. Make no mistake, the Trump base love what they've heard about the migrant ban, the eviction of illegal immigrants, the jobs pledges and a lot more besides. But what causes a lot of people to scratch their heads is why the love-in with Putin? What is driving this? Even if the most lurid things in the dossier were untrue, are there other things that are? Does Putin have some kind of leverage over the new American president? The smaller questions, like they often do, will fade away with the next news cycle. These huge ones won't.

"Rolls Royce â The good, the bad and the ugly","On the face of it, today's results couldn't be more ugly. A reported loss of Â£4.6bn is the biggest in the company's 133 year history and one of the biggest UK corporate losses of all time. However, while these results are certainly not good, they are not as ugly as they look. The results are massively distorted by a whopping hit of Â£4.4bn thanks to an accounting charge which if you bear with me I can explain. In simple terms, Rolls Royce sells engines and long term service contracts in dollars. Those contracts can last 20 years. The biggest risk for Rolls Royce is that the value of the dollar falls against the pound meaning those long term service revenues are worth less in sterling terms. The company insures itself against that by entering into long term foreign exchange deals to guarantee the revenues don't dwindle. If the dollar falls, it doesn't matter, because the value of your foreign exchange contract - or hedge - goes up as the dollar goes down. When the opposite happens and the pound falls sharply (as in the 20% fall since the referendum) the paper value of the contract - or hedge - goes down. The Â£4.4bn loss is a reflection of many years' worth of contracts being worth less than when they were taken out. Once a year you have to tot all these contracts up and this year the result was a whopping accounting charge. It's worth emphasising that the company has not had to fork out this Â£4.4bn in real money. Taking that charge out, these results are not so much ugly as bad. Underlying profits, meaning profits that strip out these confusing accounting charges have fallen by a half. That is a fair assessment of the business. Many of Rolls Royce's older engines are being taken out of service faster than its new engines are being taken up by newer planes. Not only that, but the newer engines will take longer to make a profit as the costs of development, testing and launch overshadow the early years of an engines life. The real gravy is the money to service them which comes rolling in for many years at little additional cost. With several new engines launched recently those days are some way off. The good is that orders for these new engines look pretty healthy which bodes well for future profits. The new management team has simplified a sprawling business and costs are lower which will increase future profit margins. Cash flow remains pretty strong which means that the many pension funds that own Rolls Royce shares should continue to receive their dividends. There is something else distorting these results which really muddies the good bad and ugly waters as it pits ethical, pragmatic and political concerns against each other. Selling civil aviation, nuclear and military hardware to companies and governments around the world can be a murky business. For decades, palms have been greased, strings pulled and backhanders given. Rolls Royce was no exception and this year agreed to pay Â£671m to settle corruption charges which included falsifying accounts, attempting to thwart investigations, and paying tens of millions in bribes to win engine and other deals in Indonesia, Thailand, China and Russia. The charges relate to a 24 year period from 1989 to 2013. The settlement is in place of a criminal conviction. A conviction could have meant Rolls Royce being banned from bidding on lucrative government contracts in the US, the UK and Brazil. According to the judge who allowed this special settlement, Sir Brian Leveson, these were serious breaches of the law, and knowledge of them went right to the top. He said: ""The proceedings reveal the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption (some of which implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company)."" Those controlling minds have mostly left the company and may yet have their individual collars felt by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). When asked whether former executives would have bonuses from that period clawed back, current chief executive, Warren East, said the board had looked ""very hard at that"" but the answer was no. In other words, if we could legally have clawed it back years later - we would have done. The judge's decision to allow a financial settlement, as opposed to criminal charges, was based on the co-operation of the current management, the reforms it has made to practices, and the significant damage a successful prosecution would do not only to a world-leading company, and ""employees, others innocent of misconduct or what might otherwise be described as the consequences of a conviction"". The judge said that the national interest was ""irrelevant"" in fending off prosecution but it seems obvious that some of his concerns for the company and its workers overlap with what most would consider in the national interest. No one is suggesting that Â£671m is a mere slap on the wrist. In fact, the Â£497m bit of the fine levied by the SFO is the biggest it has ever imposed and will be considered a feather in its cap. Others will observe that when it comes to ethics versus jobs and money, jobs and money usually come out on top. Depending on your own view of the world that is either good, bad or ugly.

Heartbreak and devotion,"Tales of heartbreak, elation, rejection and redemption - to mark Valentine's Day, here are four love letters, each telling a unique story. This video can not be played Davy Moakes, 86, reads a letter to his long-lost love Helen Andre My Dearest Helen, Here we are in each other's arms at long last, settling into our home, we can't stop talking about our lives and especially those three very precious years we spent together over 65 years ago in the 1950s. We cuddled together when my three-wheeler spluttered to a stop on our way home from Chesterfield College of Art and I would ring my Dad to tow us home. What a good excuse that made to have a lingering kiss, although at times it could be a cold wait! We got engaged and planned to get married when you were 19 but your parents objected to me, forbidding you to ever see me again. I don't think we knew then how our love would live on. Three years passed before we met again by chance. For your 21st birthday your grandfather bought you a new car and we made a date to meet for a drive the following day. But you never turned up. I was heartbroken but later found out you had discovered I was engaged to someone else, which had broken your heart. As I seemed unavailable, you had no option but to look elsewhere. A dashing corporal in the Canadian Air Force swept you off your feet and you married him. A long period of 35 years with the wrong partners ensued but fate still wasn't on our side because at almost the same time, our spouses died and we both married again. Davy and Helen around 1951 Decades later, quite by chance, you came across a man with my second name, who turned out to be my son. With the help of your daughter you were able to make contact with me, after a wait of 65 years! My second wife Margaret had recently suffered a fatal stroke and my grief was understood by you when we met some months later. Gradually we both realised we felt the same love we had retained in our hearts for all those years and went ahead with plans to have a quiet wedding last November. Our home is full of photographs featuring our separate lives and I can't help feeling pangs of envy when I see you as a beautiful lady, happy in another's arms. But you are finally all mine now and you make me very happy. You are still the elegant lady I have always loved. There's a lot of work needed on our small bungalow and quite soon when finished, it will become the love nest of our dreams. We will spend our limited future together very much in love and although we will always regret the circumstances that kept us apart in 1956, we are happy together for ever. Dear Granddad, It's been nearly eight years since I wrote. I still have your response, telling me my marriage was offensive. Daily I forgive you for the hurt when you rejected my Mark, the day you found out he was black. No-one but Mark and my best friend fully understand how painful it was and still is. I choose not to see you to protect myself and my family. But I recently lost someone. A reminder that time is short and there are things I have to say. This video can not be played Sarah hasnât spoken to her granddad since her marriage to Mark, who is black Mark says the thing he loves most about me is that I always see the good in people. I always seek the other perspective. What's made you so angry Granddad? What's made you so hateful of black, Asian or anyone who doesn't conform to your standards that you were prepared to sacrifice me? Did I not matter more than your racism? I like to think you were brought up in a time when men weren't allowed to show their emotions. That the hard and angry exterior hides a deeply sensitive soul. I glimpsed yours the day you told me about meeting Grandma. This beautiful woman with sparkling blue eyes walking down the street. You fell in love. I don't believe, as others do, in a Hollywood ending. I don't believe that if I turned up at your door with my darling family you'd welcome us as if nothing had happened. Let me tell you about my tan-skinned children you were so afraid of. These stories are taken fromBBC Radio 5 Live'sLove Season, which runs from 14-28 February There are many times I've watched my beautiful, sensitive Daniel playing with his trains, fascinated by engines or taking comfort in the rolling of a toy car and thought of you. My extraordinary boy who could have shared your passion for model trains and methodical construction. And little Anna who is all emotion and love and - apparently - so like me. I tell my son people come into our lives for a reason. Sometimes briefly but always for a reason. I think of the times you were my Granddad. The smell of your bungalow when we visited. How you were always waiting at the door as we arrived. You loved birds (and therefore hated cats) and those rescue dogs no-one else loved. I love you for those memories. I can't be angry with you because you are in those memories. There are days I find it hard to believe it's not my fault. I simply fell in love with this amazing man - just as you fell in love with Grandma. I believe your anger hides a hurting soul. So I'll take your anger and send you love. The wedding Dear Joe, I'm sitting here with my Mum talking about wedding stuff like a fairy tale story and looking at the photo album. In this one, it makes me feel a bit scared, my eyes, my face and my hands... I really was scared. Excited and scared to begin with.  Oh my goodness Dad, I'm going to get married! Joe, you were already there in the marquee waiting for me. When I was waiting to come down the red carpet, I felt a bit tearful listening to my favourite song... When You Wish Upon a Star. This video can not be played Polly Gibson retells the story of her wedding day to husband Joe Minogue I walked down the aisle with my Dad, he brought me to you Joe.  I never felt this way before our wedding day. Everyone stood up and clapped, it made me happy. Joe, you came up to me from the unicorn throne, you gave me a little kiss on the cheek and put your hands around my waist, it felt really ticklish. You looked like a dream husband looking all grown up in your lovely blue suit. I loved touching the pink rose on your jacket because I love the colour pink. The unicorn throne was like a fairytale fantasy film. It was fun to sit on it especially when we did our legs kicks to I do, I do, I do. Now we're looking at the photo of us dancing to Come What May.  Joe, did you like my lovely dress?  Colourful, big giant pattern like a leaf and a spinny swishy shape.  Oh my gosh, my garter slipped down and I kicked if off away and Dad picked it up and put it in his top pocket... It made me laugh! When Vivienne said: ""You're husband and wife, you may kiss now,"" we both threw our arms around each other and we kissed on the lips.  It felt like love's dream. The best thing in the whole wide world. Once we were married, we're wife and husband with our rings on, everyone's throwing confetti - I'm surrounded in confetti and it's down my top... too much confetti! We look too happy. Holding my bouquet with everyone smiling and cheering. I like the photos just of us that Leela took in the garden. I like the way you held my hand. I like the way you've put your arms all round my back. You feel like a really strong person and I want to spend my life being with you. All times. I just love the kissing photo. Joe, it was so much fun at the party.  I love the way I spun round with the singing waiters.  I liked the pink and blue balloons and the bunting.  Our friends and family found it really good fun. We are going to be happy ever after. Lots and lots of love from your Polly This video can not be played Hina overcame her views on arranged marriage after meeting her (now) husband Kam (Picture: Khawer Riaz) My Dear Kam, Before I met you, love hadn't been all it was cracked up to be. Life had knocked me down, then just as I picked myself up, it tripped me at a bend. It was a phone call that revealed all. I discovered my ex was involved with someone else. So that perfect wedding hadn't turned into the marriage I'd expected to have. And I became lonely. So lonely that loneliness became a thing. It sat with me at work and followed me home at the end of each day. I'd speak to the birds when no one could see, and stare at the bark of twisted old trees. And all the friends in the world couldn't fill the void it formed in me. Each day I'd walk about, waiting for that lightning strike. An electric shock. Love at first sight. Hoping it would happen to me, perhaps even while shopping at the local Sainsbury's. But nothing. I realised then that stars aren't obliged to align to make our dreams come true. And so, on holiday with mum to see my gran in Pakistan, I caved. Mustering all my courage, I challenged my views on arranged marriage and agreed to marry you. This man I hardly knew. It wasn't love at first sight, but your kind eyes and that smile really drew me in. I ditched my search for lightning bolts and now I can see it was the best decision I would ever make. One year in we were told we couldn't have a baby. Had we considered a pet instead, asked that grey-faced doctor in London? You took me in your arms and, with heartbroken eyes, said it would be ok. That it didn't matter if it wasn't meant to be. When I was hurt by those closest to me, it was you that made me see straight. You showed me that I already had all the love I could ever need. We've had joy-filled times when we've danced the jive right in the middle of our living room: the news I was pregnant, the birth of our sons and an amazing book deal with my publishers. Then last year, I faced the toughest test of all. My dear mum passed with me at her side after weeks in the intensive care unit. Each day and night, you held me tight, tears from your eyes mingling with mine. So what I'm trying to say to you, is that it may not be a flash of lightning, a six-pack or stubble that makes for perfect chemistry. Love can grow another way. Stars are not obliged to align to make our dreams come true. Except sometimes they do. And if anyone tells me I'm wrong, I'll tell them they really ought to meet my Kam.

Love it or loathe it,"Valentine's Day is sweet for some, but not everyone sees it through rose-tinted spectacles For the cynics among us, Valentine's Day is an annual nightmare: everything turns pink and heart-shaped, restaurants slap a premium price on a sub-par ""special menu"", and Hallmark shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank. But beyond the cuddly toys and red roses, the tradition draws mixed reactions around the world. From the hardline to the downright bizarre, here are just some of the ways Valentine's Day is embraced - or spurned like an unwanted lover... Authorities in some parts of Indonesia have banned students from celebrating Valentine's Day, saying it encourages casual sex. In the city of Makassar, police raided shops and dismantled condom displays. The mayor told the BBC that condoms were removed from sight after customers complained, but would still be sold discreetly. Valentine's Day has its roots in a Roman fertility celebration, but later evolved into a Christian feast day - a fact that worries conservatives in some Muslim-majority countries. In Indonesia's second-largest city, Surabaya, pupils were told to reject the festival as it runs against cultural norms. Muslim students protest against Valentine's Day in Surabaya, Indonesia Next door to Indonesia, Malaysia has also seen a Valentine's backlash. A group called the National Muslim Youth Association has urged women and girls to avoid using emoticons or overdoing the perfume, in a pre-Valentine's Day message. The group's guidance included advice on how to combat the celebration of romance by making anti-Valentine posters and shunning Valentine-themed outfits. The group made its anti-Cupid views clear through its Facebook picture Robben Island will forever be associated with the infamous prison that held Nelson Mandela - but since 2000, it has hosted a mass celebration of love on 14 February. The tradition was started by South Africa's Department of Home Affairs and the Robben Island Museum, and now attracts couples from across the globe. This year, 20 pairs are planning to say ""I do"" in the island's little white chapel. The service is offered for a small fee, and includes a tour of the island. Organisers say 2017's couples were ""chosen by the department based on their diversity and interesting romantic stories"". A bride and groom laugh during their Robben Island ceremony Thailand's civil servants are handing out free pre-natal pills on the streets of Bangkok on Valentine's Day, hoping to boost the country's falling birth rate. Around 1 million baht ($28,600; Â£22,900) has been spent on the pills, for prospective mothers aged 20 to 34. The ""very magical vitamins"" (to use the government's words) contain folic acid and iron. In 1970, Thai couples had an average of six children, but the figure now stands at 1.6. A Bangkok flower market on Valentine's Day The High Court in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, hasbanned public celebrations of Valentine's Day, saying it is not part of Muslim culture. The festival has gained a foothold in recent years, but local critics say it is a decadent Western invention. The court order bans the media from covering Valentine's events, and bans festivities in public places and government offices. This video can not be played A court in Pakistan has banned public celebrations of Valentine's Day in Islamabad What is Valentine's Day and how did it start? Reunited after 65 years, and more remarkable love letters The town with the world's most romantic postmark Saudi Arabia's religious police are on alert at this time of year for love-themed merchandise, including flowers, cards and suspicious ""red items"". Florists have been known to deliver bouquets in the middle of the night to avoid detection, as determined lovers flout the countrywide ban. A black market in roses and wrapping paper helps some broadcast their feelings. But for others, it's the perfect time of year for a romantic break - to nearby Bahrain or the UAE, where celebrations are more tolerated. Holidays to Dubai are one way for Saudi couples to dodge the crackdown As Japan geared up for the 14th, a group of Marxist protesters unfurled a giant ""Smash Valentine's Day"" banner in Tokyo. The ""Kakuhido"", or Revolutionary Alliance of Men that Women find Unattractive, want an end to public displays of love that ""hurt their feelings"". Members have been known to chant slogans including ""public smooching is terrorism"". ""Our aim is to crush this love capitalism,"" said Takayuki Akimoto, the group's PR chief. ""People like us who don't seek value in love are being oppressed by society,"" he added. ""It's a conspiracy by people who think unattractive guys are inferior, or losers - like cuddling in public, it makes us feel bad. It's unforgivable!"" The protests came as Japan's family planning association revealed that ""sexless marriages"" in the country are at a record high. Nearly 50% of married Japanese couples had not had sex for more than a month and did not expect that to change in the near future, it said.

Is the UK spending 2% of GDP on defence?,"The claim:The UK's spending on defence fell below 2% of GDP in 2016. Reality Check verdict:Nato has confirmed that its figures for 2016 show the UK is still meeting the 2% target, but won't release the full details until next month. The amount that the IISS claims that defence spending is below 2% of GDP is tiny by the standards of government spending, and may easily be erased by using different exchange rates or definitions of defence spending. Defence think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) claimed on Tuesday that the UK had dropped below its pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence, made in the Strategic Defence Review in 2015. GDP is what you get when you add up all the goods and services produced in an economy. In the UK in 2016 it was about Â£1.87 trillion. The IISS said that as a result of UK GDP being higher than expected, the UK had actually only spent 1.98% of GDP on defence in 2016. The Ministry of Defence says that the IISS figures are wrong. It pointed to Nato figures saying that the UK spent 2.21% of GDP on defence last year. That figure is based onanalysis from Nato,external, which was published last July, meaning they were based on forecasts for both GDP and spending. ButNato later said,externalthat it had looked at the final numbers for 2016 and could confirm that the UK was still meeting the 2% target, but it would not be releasing the full figures until next month. The alliance said that the UK, US, Poland, Greece and Estonia met the target last year. As this is a Nato target, it is Nato's methodology that is important. Before making the calculation, Nato converts both defence spending and GDP into US dollars at 2010 exchange rates and prices. There are disagreements about what should and what should not count as military spending - whether pensions paid to soldiers' widows count, for example. IISS hascalculated the figure slightly differently,external. It gets to a figure of Â£38.3bn for UK defence spending in 2016 . If you divide that by the ONS figure for GDP you get 2.05%, but that's not what the IISS has done. Because it is trying to make comparisons between different countries, it has converted all the figures into US dollars, using International Monetary Fund exchange rates and also used IMF GDP figures. When you do that, you get to 1.98%.

Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake,"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin Throughout the confusion of Donald Trump's campaign and the chaotic events of his early days in the White House, one controversy has clung to the Trump team like glue: Russia. US intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the campaign of his rival Hillary Clinton and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released to undermine her. Congressional committees were set up to investigate the matter and, in March, then-FBI director James Comey confirmed the bureau had its own inquiry. President Trump sacked Mr Comey on 9 May, citing his reason as ""this Russia thing"", in a move that shocked Washington andfuelled claims of a cover-up. However, it did not halt the investigation. On 18 May, the department of justice appointed ex-FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the matter. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn resigned in February after failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. In December, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his meetings with Mr Kislyak. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"". It was back in May 2016 that the first reports emerged of hackers targeting the Democratic Party. Over the next two months, the reports suggested US intelligence agencies had traced the breaches back to Russian hackers. In July, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Wikileaks published 20,000 internal emails stolen by the hackers. US intelligence officials said they believed with ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind the operation, but the Trump campaign publicly refused to accept the findings. Instead, at a press conference, Mr Trump caused outrage by inviting Russian hackers to target Hillary Clinton's controversial personal email server, saying: ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"". About the same time the hacking scandal was beginning to unfold, Mr Trump's then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was accused of accepting millions of dollars in cash for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and US, including dealings with an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. Subsequently, further allegations were made in Ukraine about secret funds said to have been paid to Mr Manafort, and it has also been claimed that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political ends. Mr Manafort has denied both allegations. He was found guilty in August 2018 of eight counts of financial fraud and tax evasion crimes. In September 2018, he pleaded guilty to two remaining charges - and agreed to co-operate with the special counsel's investigation in exchange for a reduced jail sentence. This video can not be played Trump praises Putin's leadership In October, the US intelligence community released a unanimous statement formally accusing Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Mr Trump continued to argue against the finding, claiming in a presidential debate that it ""could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds"". The same day that the intelligence agencies released their findings, the explosive ""Access Hollywood"" recording emerged of Mr Trump's obscene remarks about women in 2005. An hour later, Wikileaks began dumping thousands more leaked Clinton emails. Mr Trump continued to refuse to acknowledge the consensus that Russia was behind the hack. In December, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security published a report of the US intelligence findings linking Russia to the hack. In response, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and levied new sanctions on Russia. The world awaited Mr Putin's response but he chose not retaliate. Mr Trump, by then the president-elect, sided with the Russian president, tweeting: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" Mr Putin's decision not to respond in kind struck many as a canny PR move, but reportedly set off suspicions among US intelligence officials that Russia was confident the sanctions would not last. The same month, Mr Trump picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state, arguably the most important job in the cabinet. The biggest hurdle for Mr Tillerson's confirmation? Close ties to Mr Putin. As CEO of the ExxonMobil oil company, Mr Tillerson cultivated a close personal relationship with the Russian leader, leading many to speculate on whether he was fit to serve as America's most senior diplomat. Mr Tillerson wassworn in as secretary of state on 2 February. In January, Buzzfeed published a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, which alleged that Moscow had compromising material on the then-president-elect, making him liable to blackmail. Among the various memos in the dossier was an allegation that Mr Trump had been recorded by Russian security services consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel. Mr Trump dismissed the claims as fake news. CNN revealed that President Obama and President-elect Trump had been briefed on the existence of the dossier by intelligence officials, and Buzzfeed went one further, publishing the entire thing. In February, the most concrete and damaging Russia scandal finally surfaced, months after suspicions were raised among intelligence officials. Michael Flynn quit as national security adviser after 23 days US media reported that Mr Flynn had discussed the potential lifting of Mr Obama's Russia sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, before Mr Trump took the reins of government. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy. He resigned as Mr Trump's national security adviser after 23 days on the job, saying he had ""inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador"" late last year. Since leaving the White House, the Pentagon has launched an investigation into whether he failed to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work. Who is Michael Flynn? Attorney General Jeff Sessions was being accused of lying at his confirmation hearing when he said he had had ""no communications with the Russians"" during the election campaign. It later emerged that he too had met Mr Kislyak - at a private meeting in September and as part of a group of ambassadors in July last year. The Alabama senator was one of the most prominent players in Mr Trump's bid to take the White House. But he says his meetings with Mr Kislyak were related to his role as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and had nothing to do with the election campaign. But Mr Sessions recused himself from the FBI investigation into the Russian hacking claims, an investigation he is overseeing. Two months into the Trump presidency, Mr Comey confirmed at a rare open hearing of the House Intelligence Committee that the agency was investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is an ""ongoing"" investigation that began in July 2016, he said. Mr Trump's controversial meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Mr Kislyak But on 9 May, Mr Comey was fired. The White House initially said it was over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails. But Mr Trump later said ""this Russia thing"" was a factor. On 10 May, Mr Trump met the Russian ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office. He told them firing Mr Comey had eased ""great pressure"",the New York Times reported,external. He also reportedlyshared with them highly-sensitive ""codeword"" materialrelating to terrorism and airline safety, sending more shockwaves through Washington. Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel a week later. In his much anticipated testimony before a Senate panel, Mr Comey said that Mr Trump had asked him to pledge his loyalty, confirming previous media reports about a January meeting between the pair. ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,"" Mr Trump said, according to Mr Comey's testimony. James Comey was ""terminated and removed from office"" by President Trump Mr Comey said: ""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."" Mr Comey also said Mr Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn. ""[Trump] said: 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replied only that 'he is a good guy.'"" But Mr Comey did confirm the president's account that he had told Mr Trump the FBI was not investigating him personally. He said he had kept written memos on his meetings and phone calls with the president, fearing Mr Trump might lie. He denied asking for Mr Comey's loyalty, although he added: ""I don't think it would be a bad question to ask."" The White House also denied that Mr Trump had asked for the Flynn inquiry to be dropped. Mr Trump has alsoquestioned the neutrality of Robert Mueller, saying the special counsel's friendship with Mr Comey is ""bothersome"". He has criticised the FBI on numerous occasions and, in one tweet, said the organisation's reputation was ""in tatters"". On9 July came newsof what was thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of President Trump's inner circle. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, admitted meeting Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower after being told that she had damaging material on Hillary Clinton. But he insisted the lawyer had provided ""no meaningful information"" in a meeting that also included the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Mr Manafort. Mr Trump Jr told the House Intelligence committee he discussed the Trump Tower meeting with his father once it became public in a New York Times report earlier this year, but he refused to provide details of their conversation, citing attorney-client privilege. September saw Facebook reveal it had discovered that politically charged advertising had been targeted at American voters during the 2016 campaign. The social network said it believed this had been paid for by Russians with links to the Kremlin. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said his company would share 3,000 Russia-linked political adverts with US investigators. The adverts did not support a specific candidate, Facebook said, but instead posted inflammatory information on hot topics such as immigration. Rival network Twitter said it had shut down about 200 accounts linked to a Russian misinformation campaign. President Trump responded to Facebook's revelations by saying the site had always been against him. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected his comments, saying his company did not take sides. In October 2017, Mr Manafort,who quit as Mr Trump's campaign chairman last August, was charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. The good news for Mr Trump was that these charges - of which he was later convicted - were not directly linked to the Russia investigation. But the bad news is that Mr Manafort later agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. Paul Manafort ended up falling prey to the controversy his appointment was intended to stifle Another of his advisers, George Papadopoulos, admitted making false statements to FBI agents about his dealings with an unnamed overseas academic who allegedly informed him that the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The charges against Mr Papadopoulos were the first to be brought by Robert Mueller as part of the Russia investigation. Paul Manafort: The man who helped Trump win In December, Michael Flynn admitted making false statements to the FBI about meetings with the Russian ambassador, making him the most senior member of the administration to be indicted. He also revealed he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. A statement made by Mr Flynn to prosecutors appeared to implicate a more senior, though unnamed, Trump team official - indicating the direction in which Mr Mueller's investigation may be heading. Numerous US media outlets said the senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. Soon after Mr Flynn was charged, the president appeared to suggest that he had known Mr Flynn had lied about meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his own account from the time - and prompting accusations that he obstructed justice. A White House lawyer later said he had written the tweet and that the controversial line had actually been an error.

Recognising toxic shock syndrome,"Phoebee Bambury survived toxic shock syndrome (TSS) by spotting the symptoms early - and she wants others to learn from her experience. The rare condition, which can be fatal, is caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins. It's usually associated with using a tampon for too long. The 19-year-old now wants more young people to be taught about the dangers of TSS in school. Phoebee explains that she began with a headache and a fever, both symptoms that sound like the common cold. It was the beginning of two weeks spent in hospital. ""The first symptom I had was the headache one evening while I was at university,"" she tells Newsbeat. But later that night Phoebee's condition got worse, she developed muscle pains and started vomiting. Phoebee had been spending the night at her boyfriend's house when her symptoms got worse ""Just like anyone would normally think, I thought maybe I'm ill and I'm just going to have a few bad days. ""You don't want to think 'oh no toxic shock', but in my head I thought those are the symptoms - I need to check this out."" Althoughthere are many ways,externalyou can get toxic shock syndrome, it is often associated with the use oftampons. The symptoms of TSS can be found on tampon packets. ""I thought [the symptoms] all matched so I phoned 111 and they said I was spot on and needed to get to a hospital ASAP,"" she said. Phoebee's condition deteriorated and within 10 minutes of being in A&E she was hooked up to a drip, with an industrial-sized fan by her side to try and bring down her body temperature. She also tells Newsbeat how the infection caused her body to swell. Doctors confirmed that Phoebee's toxic shock syndrome was caused by her use of tampons but she insists that she followed the guidelines. ""I've never left a tampon in for longer than eight hours and at the time I started to feel very ill I didn't even have one in,"" she explains. She adds that her degree in pharmacy and personal experiences had made her more aware of the infection. ""My friend's mum died of toxic shock so I'd always been aware of it,"" she said. But cases like this are extremely rare. There are no exact figures on how many women get TSS from using tampons but of the 40 people estimated to be diagnosed in the UK every year - on average only two people will die from the infection. ""To raise awareness in more young people, I genuinely believe toxic shock needs to be a part of sex education,"" Phoebee said. ""You get talks about tampons, periods and condoms at school and TSS should be a part of that. ""It's an associated risk with tampons and I know it's rare but it is serious,"" she added. Phoebee has now been out of hospital for two weeks, and during her recovery she's been encouraging her university to do more to raise awareness about the infection. ""If you know the symptoms and take all the precautions then your chances of getting TSS are so slim. ""I know the best advice for women would be to just not use tampons but that's not possible for everyone, we just need to educate more people to take precautions."" ""High-quality education on sex and relationships is a vital part of preparing young people for success in adult life,"" a Department for Education spokesman said. ""It is compulsory in all maintained secondary schools and, as the education secretary said recently, we are looking at options to ensure all children have access to high-quality teaching in these subjects.""

Northern Lights distract Iceland drivers,"Want to gape at the Northern Lights? Pull over first The Northern Lights are a spectacle many people travel to Iceland to see, but police are having to warn tourists not to try to view them while driving. Officers in southern Iceland say that twice last week they had to pull over cars driving erratically, initially on suspicion that the drivers had been drinking. But on both occasions the entirely sober visitors were simply mesmerised by the appearance of the Aurora Borealis in the sky above them,Iceland Magazine reports,external. The site has dubbed it ""driving under the influence of the Aurora"". The first incident was on the road to the airport, with the car swerving between lanes. ""The driver told the police he saw the Northern Lights and couldn't bring himself to stop looking at them,""a police statement said,external. ""The police asked him to park the vehicle if he wanted to keep on gazing at the sky."" Tourists don't always make life easy for Icelanders, especially behind the wheel. In 2015, a roads officialcomplained,externalthat visitors were causing collisions by stopping their cars abruptly in the middle of the road in order to photograph sheep, horses ""or anything else which captures their attention"". He suggested that creating designated photo stops could ease the problem.

London premiere for Iran's Oscar film,"Shahab Hosseini and Taraneh Alidoosti play a couple at odds in The Salesman An Iranian Oscar contender affected by President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban is to have an open-air London premiere just hours before the ceremony. The Salesman, up for the best foreign language film award, will be screened in Trafalgar Square on 26 February. Its director has said he will not go to the Oscars due to President Trump's attempts to bar people from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. It is not yet known if Asghar Farhadi will attend the event in London. The director - whose earlier work A Separation won the foreign film Oscar in 2012 - said the free screening had ""a great symbolic value"". Farhadi won a prize for his screenplay at last year's Cannes Film Festival ""The gathering of the audience around The Salesman in this famous London square is a symbol of unity against the division and separation of people,"" he said. The afternoon event will include a programme of readings and speeches from actors and directors, including Mike Leigh. The Salesman, which opens in the UK on 17 March, tells of a couple whose relationship suffers as they rehearse an amateur production Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. Last month the organisers of the Oscars said they found it ""extremely troubling"" that Farhadi could be barred from entering the US.

Kevin Connolly: EU split over pace of reform as crisis bites,"European Parliament: Brexit is fuelling pressure to reform EU institutions There is a theory in politics that times of upheaval and uncertainty present opportunities as well as problems. It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill. It is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit. The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity. British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy. It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate. But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK. In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who willrepresent that body in Brexit negotiations. Guy Verhofstadt rejects claims that European voters have turned against the EU In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results."" Mr Verhofstadt has along list of suggested fixes,externalfor this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: theEuropean Banking Authority,externaland theEuropean Medicines Agency,external. UKIP's Nigel Farage - an anti-EU MEP in the vanguard of Brexit But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch. The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular."" There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries. Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroads Brexit: All you need to know But for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years. That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste. There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later.

Gordon Corera: Cyber centre to make UK 'hardest target',"The Queen was shown how hackers could target the UK's electricity supply as she opened a centre to protect the nation from cyber attacks. The National Cyber Security Centre - part of intelligence agency GCHQ - started work in October as part of a Â£1.9bn five-year strategy. Staff in Victoria, central London, will be joined by experts from the private sector to help identify threats. NCSC chief Ciaran Martin said: ""We want to make the UK the hardest target"". The secondments to the centre by 100 private sector employees will be funded by their own companies. Announcing the initiative, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the ""best and the brightest in industry"" will help ""test and to challenge the government's thinking"" in cyber security. He added: ""Government cannot protect business and the general public from the risks of cyber-attack on its own. It has to be a team effort. It is only in this way that we can stay one step ahead of the scale and pace of the threat that we face."" There were 188 cyber attacks classed by the NCSC as Category Two or Three during the last three months. And even though the UK has not experienced a Category One attack - the highest level, an example of which would have beenthe theft of confidential detailsof millions of Americans from the Office of Personnel Management - there is no air of complacency at the NCSC's new headquarters. Ciaran Martin, the centre's chief executive, told the BBC: ""We have had significant losses of personal data, significant intrusions by hostile state actors, significant reconnaissance against critical national infrastructure - and our job is to make sure we deal with it in the most effective way possible."" As well as protecting against and responding to high-end attacks on government and business, the NCSC also aims to protect the economy and wider society. The UK is one of the most digitally dependent economies, with the digital sector estimated to be worth over Â£118bn per year - which means the country has much to lose. It is not just a crippling cyber-attack on infrastructure that could turn out the lights which worries officials, but also a loss of confidence in the digital economy from consumers and businesses, as a result of criminals exploiting online vulnerabilities. A sustained effort was required by government and private sector working together to make the UK the hardest possible target, officials say. Russia has been the focus of recent concern, following claims it used cyber-attacks to interfere with the recent US presidential election. ""I think there has been a significant change in the Russian approach to cyber-attacks and the willingness to carry it out, and clearly that's something we need to be prepared to deal with,"" Mr Martin said. French and German officials have warned of the possibility of interference in their upcoming elections, but the NCSC's head said there was no evidence that a significant attack or compromise had yet taken place against the UK democratic process. ""There has been an identifiable trend in Russian attacks in the West, in terms of focusing on critical national industries and political and democratic processes,"" Mr Martin added. ""And so it follows from that that we will look to be sure we are protecting those sectors in the UK as well as we possibly can."" MPs are being advised by the new centre as to how to keep their data safe The centre will be working on a voluntary basis with political parties and giving advice to high-profile individuals - including MPs - on how to protect their sensitive data. The UK is already targeting computers in other countries being used for cyber-attack, particularly if there is no possibility of prosecution or for co-operation with authorities where the hackers are based. ""In the most serious cases, we have lawful powers where we can go after the infrastructure of adversaries - the infrastructure that people use to attack us - and we would do that in some of the most serious cases several dozen times a year,"" Mr Martin said. In the past, UK cyber protection was largely situated within GCHQ in Cheltenham, which was criticised by businesses and others as overly secretive. The NCSC aims to be more public facing and accessible. It will also protect a far wider range of sectors, rather than just government and national security-related industries, like defence. GCHQ will still be the parent body for the NCSC, meaning it can draw on the intelligence agency's skills and capabilities. Sometimes, the intelligence arm of GCHQ spots compromised networks as it watches adversaries move across the internet. GCHQ can detect the work of hackers around the globe It was through this type of work that GCHQ spotted the compromise of the US Democratic Party's information by Russian hackers, which it then informed US authorities about. The NCSC is working on trial services to pro-actively discover vulnerabilities in public sector websites, help government departments better manage spoofing of their email, and take down tens of thousands of phishing sites affecting the UK. ""We're actively working to reduce the harm caused by cyber-attacks against the UK and will use the government as a guinea pig for all the measures we want to see done by industry at national scale,"" says the NCSC technical director, Dr Ian Levy. He says results would be published openly to enhance collaboration. The centre will be publishing some of its code as open source, so that others can use the techniques.

How Michael Flynn's resignation unfolded,"The news that the president's son, Donald Trump Jr, has admitted meeting a Russian lawyer who promised to reveal damaging material on Hillary Clinton is just the latest twist in a row over the president's potential ties to Russia.

Brexit fears for British expats - and Bake Off judge,"The ups and downs of Brexit are covered in some of the day's papers, as fears arise about Brits abroad while the forecast for the nation's economy improves. According to the Guardian,,externala document leaked from the European parliament is warning that British expats living in European countries could face ""a backlash"" because of the UK government's stance on foreigners since the vote to leave the EU. The document says that while member states will decide whether British citizens can carry on living in those countries, ""the fact that it appears to be particularly difficult for foreign nationals... to acquire permanent residence status or British nationality may colour member states' approach to this matter"". The Daily Express proclaims good news on its front page,,externalsaying EU officials ""have admitted"" that UK's economy is ""thriving since the Brexit vote"". It also says predictions that the ""gloomy"" forecast that the UK's economy would grow by 1%, made by Brussels last autumn, has been revised up to 1.5%. The Times has alarming news for commuters.,externalThe paper reports a study by the University of Surrey, which says travelling to work by public transport exposes people to up to eight times as much air pollution as those who drive there. According to the authors, there's little ""environmental justice"" - because those who contribute most to air pollution are also the least likely to suffer from it. Researchers found that bus passengers, for example, experience higher levels of pollution, and their journeys last longer. Diesel cars do the most harm to the wellbeing of other travellers - but motorists tend to keep their windows closed, and are protected from harmful particles by filters. THE ""I"" devotes eight pages to an investigation which, it says,reveals that 19 NHS hospitals in England face closure,external.  The paper has analysed 44 ""sustainability and transformation plans"" - which it describes as regional blueprints to remodel the health service - as bosses seeks to plug a Â£22bn ""black hole"" in funding. The ""I"" concludes there is to be a massive shift towards ""out-of-hospital"" care, with patients encouraged to manage their own health needs. Other far-reaching changes are proposed, including the loss of almost 3,000 jobs. The Department of Health tells the paper the plans are designed to ensure best standards of care, with doctors, hospitals and councils working in partnership with local communities for the first time. Reaction is mixed.  A GP in Lancashire says the proposals merely move ""the deckchairs around on the Titanic"", as social care is collapsing, general practice is ""on its knees"", and the hospital service is in ""meltdown"". But Harry Quilter-Pinner, from the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank, tells the paper the NHS cannot stand still in the face of new technology and an ageing population. He says that while the health service is under-funded, there are many instances where treatment could be moved out of hospital and into the community - saving money and improving outcomes for patients. The Daily Telegraph carries a warning,externalthat half a million women are being left at a higher risk of breast cancer because GPs are unaware they should be prescribing a preventative drug. The figures come from a study produced by researchers at University College London, Queen Mary London, and Cancer Research UK. The paper says three in four family doctors are unaware they should be offering Tamoxifen, which can reduce the risk of the disease by a third while costing only six pence a day. Prue Leith spent 11 years on the judging panel of the BBC Two cooking contest The Great British Menu. The Sun leads with news,externalthat cookery queen Prue Leith will replace Mary Berry as a judge when the Great British Bake Off moves to Channel Four.

Police job candidate 'turned up drunk',"A police job candidate was arrested for drinking and driving after he turned up for a interview smelling of alcohol. A Greater Manchester Police employee noticed an ""overpowering smell"" on the man's breath during an interview for an IT management role. Andrew Jackson, 48, then disclosed he had had trouble parking, was breathalysed and arrested. In court, he admitted drinking and driving and was banned for a year, police said. The IT worker appeared at Bury and Rochdale Magistrates' Court on Friday, was fined Â£120 with a Â£30 victim surcharge and ordered to pay Â£85 costs. Mr Jackson, of Barlow Moor Road, Didsbury, Manchester was told his ban would be reduced to seven months on completion of a drink-driving awareness course. His hour-long interview took place on 25 January at a training centre in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, but he fell foul of the law when he revealed his travel arrangements. The interviewer, a civilian worker, said: ""I asked if he had any trouble in finding us. As soon as he began to speak I could smell something on his breath which I thought was stale alcohol. ""He mentioned that he did have a little trouble in finding somewhere to park, which immediately raised concerns. ""Shortly after he arrived in the small office, the smell of alcohol became overpowering."" The job hopeful was arrested and taken to Bury police station The interviewer then made his excuses at the end of the interview and left the room to ask a police officer's advice. A traffic officer quizzed the man over whether he had been drinking but he was adamant that not a drop had touched his lips that morning. However Mr Jackson did admit to sharing a bottle of wine with his wife the night before during a meal out. The traffic officer then marched him out of the building to a nearby patrol car and gave him a breathalyser test, which he duly failed.

Jessica Murphy: Trudeau's balancing act at White House,"This video can not be played Justin Trudeau was asked to comment on Donald Trump's migrant ban. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a fine line to walk on Monday and came through with his best diplomatic balancing act. Mr Trudeau headed to Washington hoping to secure reassurances that President Donald Trump valued the Canada-US relationship, especially its economic ties. The prime minister can travel back to Ottawa with Mr Trump on the record as calling the trade relationship between the two nations ""outstanding"" and only in need of a ""tweaking"". What those tweaks might entail is still to be revealed, but you could almost hear anxious Canadian businesspeople breathing a sigh of relief. Trade relations with the US are crucial for Canada. More than 75% of its exports head south of the border, while 18% of US exports are sent north. But Mr Trudeau and his ministers have repeatedly hammered home other statistics over the past few weeks that underscore the importance of Canada to American commerce. Nearly nine million US jobs depend on trade and investment from Canada, while Canada is the top customer for 35 US states. US President Donald Trump (L) holds a news conference Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Mr Trump also made it clear he views economic relations with Mexico in a very different light than those with Canada. Mexico is the third partner with Canada and the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement. ""It's a much less severe situation than what's taking place on the southern border,"" the president said in reference to Canada-US trade during the joint news conference with Mr Trudeau at the White House. This first face-to-face meeting also offered a clue at how far Mr Trudeau was willing to go preserve those vital trade ties. He refused to bite when the press repeatedly baited him to criticise his host on thorny issues like immigration, though many of his own policies stand as a reproach to those of the new US president's. Mr Trudeau is a self-described feminist who calls himself ""extremely free trade"" and has made Canada's openness to immigration, diversity, and refugees part of the country's - and his own - brand. This video can not be played A brief look at the long friendship between the United States and Canada But on Monday his message was that ""the last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they chose to govern themselves"". In fact, Mr Trudeau and Liberal MPs have been disciplined in their refusal to criticise Mr Trump over the past few months. The most pointed they got was when the prime minister tweeted out a welcome to refugees just as the US was implementing the temporary ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Opposition Conservative leader Rona Ambrose said that discipline is a smart move given how paramount relations with the US are to Canada. ""This is a delicate situation here. I don't think it would help anyone in this country if the prime minister went to the US and started a fight,"" she told reporters in Ottawa. Another clue as to just how much significance Ottawa has placed on this first face-to-face meeting with the new American administration was the prime minister's entourage. Mr Trudeau brought five ministers with him to Washington, a who's who of Canada's top Cabinet members, as well as his most trusted senior aides. The two world leaders worked hard to play up the similarities in their first meeting and beyond that key trade assurance, the Canadian delegation will leave Washington having secured a few other commitments from the US. Those include commitments to collaborate on improving clean energy and enhancing efficiency at border crossings, to tackle opioid trafficking, and the creation of a Canada-US council geared towards promoting women-owned enterprises.

Breast cancer survivors hit the catwalk,"This video can not be played Breast cancer survivors claim the catwalk in lingerie Women who survived breast cancer took over the catwalk at New York Fashion Week in an alternative lingerie show to raise funds for charity. The AnaOno Intimates show was devised by US designer, and breast cancer survivor, Dana Donofree, and introduced by Oscar-winning actress Mira Sorvino. Models with different shapes and stories proudly bared signs of surgery. Nearly half of the models had metastatic, or advanced, breast cancer, according to Ms Donofree. All proceeds went to Cancerland, an outreach and advocacy charity in the US. Warning: This article contains images of partial nudity ""I felt sexy, I felt beautiful, and I was proud,"" Paige Moore, 24, said after taking part in the show. Five weeks ago, she had preventative double mastectomy after genetic testing. ""I was like these scars are sexy and awesome, and I am here, I am alive and I feel good. That is all that matters,"" she said. In the US and the UK, cancer researchers say one in eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Actress Mira Sorvino, Cancerland founder Champagne Joy and designer Dana Donofree on stage Almost half the models in the New York fashion show had battled advanced breast cancer ""It is a very important moment for them [the models] to get out there and experience something like this because breast cancer has taken over their bodies,"" Ms Donofree told Reuters. Ms Donofree also had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with the disease, aged 27. She started designing underwear for others who have undergone breast surgery after realising that traditional garments no longer fitted. Model Ericka Hart had a double mastectomy The show took place in lower Manhattan, New York City Women wore all sorts of underwear Ms Donofree wrote about her story and the inspiration for the show on her website. ""As I slowly rebuilt my own self-esteem and confidence, first by getting a mastectomy tattoo, then by talking to other women about life after acute treatment, and finally trying on my first bra prototype, I wondered why none of this was part of some greater 'What to Expect When You're Expecting a Mastectomy' pamphlet they handed out at your surgeon's office.""

Swipe Mr Right,"Stefan spends up to half an hour a day on Tinder It's Valentine's Day - and for many single people it may be difficult to find a date. But not for Stefan - the most coveted man on dating app Tinder. He receives more ""swipe-rights"" than any other man on the app, as he explains to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Name:Stefan-Pierre Tomlin Job:Fashion model. Previously worked as a toy demonstrator in Hamleys and Harrods. Height:6'2"" Age:26 Claim to fame:The most swiped-right man on Tinder. Popularity:I get around 40 matches a day. The number's doubled in the last month alone - I've had to turn my notifications off. Relationship status:I've been single for around seven months now. I was seeing someone, but it didn't really work out. Do you enjoy being single?When I find the right girl, I'm more than happy to settle down - I want someone who will be my best friend as well as a partner. But as I get older, there is a bit more added pressure to find someone. My mum drops little hints here and there that she wants to be a grandma. Stefan has a piloting licence, having been in the RAF Air Cadets Time spent on Tinder:Quite often half an hour a day, sometimes just 10 minutes. Tips for success:Have a bit of character on your bio, definitely. There's no point in just being good looking in photos if you're bland to talk to. I always look for personality - someone who can have a laugh. One of my own previous bios was simply ""Model. Too stupid to write a bio,"" playing on the idea that models aren't supposed to be clever. And when it comes to starting the conversation:I'm looking for someone who has a good opening line, something funny or that makes them stand out. One match recently started with ""so what gives you the privilege of me swiping right?"". That's been one of the best. Stefan's current Tinder bio What are your interests?I'm really into aviation. I used to be in the RAF air cadets, so I have a pilot's licence to fly the Cessna 152, a fixed-wing plane. How often do you date?I don't get a lot of time because of my job. I've probably only been on five or six while on Tinder, but I have also met people at events with my work - so it's not just dating apps. What are you like on a date?I'd say I'm shy to start off with, and then I warm up and become more confident. I like to think I'm good at getting the conversation flowing, but I think everyone finds first dates can become a bit like an interview with all the questions!

Distracted to death,"Our phones can be distracting when driving, but can some apps make us safer? Tudor Cobalas nearly crashed his car while driving and texting on his phone. It was this near-death experience that inspired him to turn the smartphone from a weapon of mass distraction into a tool for safer driving. Mr Cobalas, 30, from Romania, developed SafeDrive, an app that rewards drivers for ignoring their phones while driving. Once a driver exceeds 6mph (10kmh), the app launches a ""Release"" button on the screen, effectively locking the phone. Driving without checking the phone generates points that can be converted into shopping discounts in the SafeDrive Marketplace. Pressing the Release button while driving wipes out the points earned during that journey. It's a simple idea that has attracted nearly 100,000 users globally and 30 commercial partners, from insurance companies to retailers. Mr Cobalas has also developed an app, Milez, aimed at teenage drivers. Distracted drivers are far more likely to have a fatal accident ""It was a response to questions from parents in the US who wanted to educate their children, young drivers,"" he says. Again, the idea is simple - teenage drivers are financially rewarded by relatives and friends through the Milez app if they drive safely. Mr Cobalas's native Romania has a particularly poor record when it comes to road fatalities. In the European Union as a whole, the average number of road deaths per million inhabitants is 51.5. In Romania, it is nearly double that figure at 95. Worldwide, about 1.25 million people die each year as a result of road traffic accidents, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). ""Smartphone distraction"" is blamed for an increasing number of accidents. Drivers using a mobile phone are four times more likely to be involved in a crash, the WHO says. DriveWell founders Hari Balakrishnan (left) and Sam Madden want to make us better drivers That is why a growing number of technology entrepreneurs are trying to tackle the problem. ""Although smartphones are rightly blamed for an increase in distracted driving, we wanted to show that smartphones could be used to make drivers better,"" says Hari Balakrishnan, chief technology officer of Cambridge Mobile Telematics, a US company that has developed an app called DriveWell. The app measures all aspects of driving such as hard braking, abrupt acceleration, sharp cornering and speeding. But it also monitors how often drivers are distracted by their phones and generates a ""safety score"" at the end of each trip. The company emerged from a project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology run by Mr Balakrishnan and co-founder Sam Madden. The free app features competition leader boards that enable drivers to compete with their friends, family and colleagues, as well as personalised safer driving tips. About 1.25 million people are killed on the world's roads every year Good safety scores can earn drivers discounts on their car insurance with some insurers, Mr Balakrishnan says. Last year the company launched a competition to find Boston's safest driver. Nearly 5,000 people have signed up, and 98 have been awarded more than $3,400 in prizes. Data from 40,000 DriveWell app users around the world demonstrate its effectiveness, says Mr Madden. ""By day 30, we see a 35% reduction in phone use and a 20% reduction in the number of hard braking events,"" he says. Nick Lloyd, road safety manager at the UK's Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), agrees that apps designed to reduce driver distraction show promise. But he points out that as use of these apps is voluntary, ""we do not know what kinds of drivers are likely to choose to use these apps"". In other words, dangerous drivers are precisely the ones who do not think they drive dangerously and thus don't think they need any help. Are hands-free apps that read out messages just as distracting? The problem with smartphones is that they constantly buzz and ping with notifications - they are designed to distract us. So Rob Joseph, 27, an app developer based in London, developed ReadItToMe, an Android-only app that turns written messages into the spoken word, and vice versa. ""The idea initially came up when I was receiving text messages while on the London Overground but was too squished in among people to be able to pull out my phone to check them,"" he says. The app can read any text notifications your phone receives, including emails and those from social messaging apps such as WhatsApp. At present it can read in any language but reply in only a few. ""I feel that receiving messages you can't check because you're driving is just as much a distraction as texting while driving,"" says Mr Joseph. ""You're constantly thinking: 'who could it be?' and you don't want to wait until you next pull over."" ""While some newer cars offer the option to read SMS messages, they don't offer the option to reply, so something like ReadItToMe bridges that gap,"" he says. The app, which has 22,000 active users, is free to use for reading SMS messages, or Â£1.49 if you want to use voice reply or other apps. But does hands-free really make you accident-free? ""There are some safety concerns about safe driving applications, such as those which read text messages out loud to the driver, as this could be distracting,"" says Rospa's Nick Lloyd. And the National Safety Council suggests that the use of hands-free devices still requires you to multi-task mentally, affecting a driver's ability to respond quickly to hazards. Perhaps the answer is switching off phone notifications altogether before every journey.

Nesbitt: Hair transplant helped my career,"Nesbitt had notably thicker hair in 2016 (r) than 2005 (l) Hair transplants gave actor James Nesbitt a new lease of confidence, the Cold Feet star has revealed. Speaking to the Radio Times, Nesbitt said the highly publicised transplants had benefited his career. The 52-year-old underwent several procedures over a number of years. ""I was very happy to be open about it,"" he said. ""I just thought, 'Come on, somebody is going to say it before I say it'."" ""It was something I struggled with,"" he went on. ""And that was probably the vanity in me. ""But also career-wise it had an impact; in terms of the range of leading roles I've had since then, it's probably helped."" Despite his own cosmetic changes, Nesbitt - whose TV roles also include Murphy's Law and The Missing - said he thought it was a shame when young men considered plastic surgery. ""There always used to be the sense that age adds character,"" he said. ""You look at Samuel Beckett when he was older, Richard Harris, but I think with younger men it seems to be a big pressure."" Nesbitt also spoke about his recent split from wife Sonia Forbes-Adam, with whom he has two grown-up children, after 22 years of marriage. He said he regretted the amount of time he had put into work. ""I certainly regret things, but I'm also aware that I can't change them. You can try to learn from it. I regret any pain that was caused. ""I think separating has an impact because you look at why it happened and you see mistakes that were made,"" he added. ""I'm lucky enough to be able to look back at stuff and say, 'Oh well that was then, I've had a good lash at that, and this is now'.""

Why this N Korea missile test is different,"The use of solid fuel reduces the time needed to launch the missile On the morning of 12 February, North Korea conducted a ballistic missile test launch from Banghyon air base near the west coast of the country. Like all such launches, the test took place in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Pyongyang's press release, issued a day later, indicated that the missile - the Pukguksong-2 - was of the same type as one test-fired from a submarine off the east coast in August 2016. Unlike North Korea's other long-range land-based missiles, the system tested on 12 February used solid fuel. Until now, the country's comparable land-based missile systems have been liquid-fuelled. Pyongyang also announced that the launch vehicle carrying the new missile is indigenously made and uses a continuous or ""caterpillar"" track, rather than wheels with tyres. Previously North Korea has imported and modified foreign-made trucks to transport and launch its missiles. A domestic manufacturing capability will negate the need to convince or fool foreign suppliers into selling these vehicles. Continuous track also suggests that North Korea's intention may be to take the missiles off-road, making it more difficult to detect imminent launches. Missiles using liquid fuel require greater preparation time than those using solid fuel. They also require a larger constellation of support vehicles to accompany each launch vehicle. Both of these considerations make it more likely that an enemy might detect the missile in time to conduct a pre-emptive strike. Solid fuel substantially reduces this vulnerability. North Korea will be able to roll these systems out of concealed storage and launch them with minimal preparation, drastically shrinking the time that an adversary would have to find and kill the missile. The capability thus represents a major step forward for North Korea. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korea's missile programme Stephen Evans: What will Trump do about North Korea? US warns N Korea against nuclear attack There are two ways to launch missiles from their supporting vehicle's canister. In ""hot"" launches, the missile's engines propel it upward out of the canister, while in ""cold"" launches, the missile is ejected from the canister using compressed gas before its engines ignite. A cold eject approach spares the launch vehicle from damage from the missile's ignition, making it possible to reload it and reuse. Kim Jong-un has hit the gas pedal on North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. In the past 13 months he has conducted two nuclear tests and launched over 20 ballistic missiles, including from a submarine. The demonstration of a long-range, solid-fuelled, land-based system is a continuation of this disturbing trend and one of the first significant foreign policy challenges that US President Donald Trump will be forced to grapple with.

Monte Carlo 1967 rally car being sold,"The car took part in several races including a televised rally cross event in 1967 A car that took part in the 1967 Monte Carlo Rally could fetch up to Â£50,000 at auction next month. The specially modified Hillman Imp was built in 1966 by the Rootes Group, which had bought the Hillman name. Auctioneer Richard Edmonds, said: ""We're thrilled to be able to offer this historic and much-loved vehicle."" The car, with the registration plate JDU46E will be sold at Richard Edmonds Auctions in Chippenham on 4 March. Its racing history also includes competing in the Tulip Rally in the Netherlands. It was also driven in the 1967 Coupe des Alpines, but did not complete the race because a gasket failed.  It was also driven in the UK's first-ever televised rally cross event in the same year. The Imp was manufactured in Linwood, Renfrewshire, as a rival to the Mini, but never gained as much popularity. Just under 500,000 were sold before the final model rolled off the production line in 1976. The Imp is being sold by private collector Mark Tudge who has kept it at his home near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Mr Tudge, who has owned the car since 2013, said he was selling it for personal reasons. ""I was incredibly lucky to buy the car. I was on holiday in North Wales in 2013 when I saw a classified advert in a local paper selling the car. ""As it was in Cheshire not too far away, I went to see it and met the then owner, a retired banker and rally fan. ""He wouldn't sell the car to me for about a month - not until he was sure I was going to look after it. Mr Tudge said the car's scratched paintwork was a reminder of its racing days, so it had not been refurbished. Richard Edmonds AuctionsHow to invest in classic cars.

"Frozen fingers, dashed hopes","This video can not be played 'I lost all my fingers': Asylum seekers make dangerous border crossing Asylum seekers are illegally crossing from the US into Canada in growing numbers hoping to receive refugee status. One small prairie town in southern Manitoba has become the nexus point for migrants who have lost hope in the US. It was a cold Seidu Mohammed and Razak Iyal could barely comprehend. On Christmas Eve, they found themselves struggling through a waist-deep field of snow in a rash night-time bid to sneak across the Canada-US border. The two men had met just few hours before at a Minneapolis bus station and both faced deportation back to Ghana after being denied refugee status in the US. They had heard through a network of other refugees and African expats that if they could get into Canada, they had a second shot at asylum in the north. The view towards the US from Emerson, Manitoba The path was straightforward: find a ride to the border from Minneapolis, MN  or Grand Forks, ND, avoid patrols until you reach Canadian soil, and then turn yourself into Canadian authorities as an asylum seeker. Canada town feels burden of refugees crossing US border Iyal and Mohammed decided to make the trek together, and paid US$200 each to a cab driver who dropped them near the international boundary. They kept to the road until they neared the border. ""That's where we saw the big farm with the snow. Snow everywhere. We were seeing the light of the border far from us, but we are seeing the light,"" Iyal recalls. Soon they had lost their gloves in the snow. The wind stole Mohammed's baseball cap. ""There is wind and cold,"" he says ""And the wind is blowing the snow into our face. So I can't see nothing."" Emerson, Manitoba By the time they reached Highway 75 in Manitoba, their hands had frozen into claws. They could not reach the phones in their pockets to dial 9-1-1 as planned. Mohammed's eyes had frozen shut. The only vehicles on the road before dawn on Christmas were transport trucks ferrying cargo between the US and Canada. Many passed, flashing their high beams at the two before blowing by, until one stopped to give them assistance. They have been receiving treatment at a specialised burn unit in a Winnipeg hospital since that 10-hour journey. Both had most of their fingers amputated due to the severe frostbite. Iyal says nurses had to chip away at the snow and ice between Mohammed's fingers. Their story has brought attention to a phenomenon that is not new but has been growing steadily in recent years. And it has not deterred others from making the cross-border trip. Record numbers of people have crossed near Emerson in the past few weeks. It is not just Manitoba. Quebec and British Columbia are also seeing more and more people illegally crossing the border to make refugee claims. In the prairie province, the influx is centred on Emerson, a municipality of about 700 people that borders Minnesota. The rural town, surrounded by farm fields, is about 625km (390 miles) up the Interstate from Minneapolis, which has the largest Somali population in North America.  Word about the Emerson crossing has spread within the expat community, as far as down to Brazil. Janzen and other officials held an emergency meeting ""We've always had people jumping the borders, for, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 years. Back then, it was people running away from something - usually the law,"" says town official Greg Janzen. But in recent years it has been mostly asylum seekers, hailing mainly from Somalia but also Ghana, Djibouti, and Ethiopia, who are finding their way across. Community workers say most have been denied refugee status in the US. Many have been met with generosity. Yahya Samatar, a former human rights worker in Somalia, fled threats from Islamist al-Shabab militants and sought refugee status in the US, where he spent seven months in an immigration detention centre. This video can not be played 'I lost all my fingers': Asylum seekers make dangerous border crossing The US denied his status but said it was too dangerous to deport him back to war-torn Somalia, and released him with a warning that he could be sent back anytime. Like Iyal and Mohammed, he heard about the backdoor into Canada, and found himself in August 2015 on the banks of the Red River, which runs through Manitoba and between North Dakota and Minnesota. He stripped to his underwear and swam across. Shivering and covered in mud, he then walked into Emerson, where a resident gave him a sweater and called border services. ""I was given clothes, I was given food, everything"" by border agents, says Samatar, who has since received refugee status and lives in Winnipeg. But now in Emerson, a wariness is emerging. The municipality that has opened its doors to those seeking refuge is wondering how far town resources will be stretched and what happens if someone who comes across poses a danger. There are also concerns that someone will die trying to make the trek across frozen fields in temperatures that can easily fall to -20C (-4F). Many also expect the number of attempts to cross will increase with warmer weather. For now, they do not see what other option there is except to do what they can to help. ""If we don't they'll freeze and starve, and it would be on our conscience wouldn't it?"" says resident Walter Kihn, who lives on the eastern edge of Emerson. Mr Janzen says ""most people in town are more concerned than scared"" about the strangers wandering into town. In the last three weeks, almost 60 people made the trek, including 21 who crossed in the hours before dawn on Saturday morning. A group of 16 people, including women and children, rang doorbells in town seeking help. ""They went to the neighbours and got everybody riled up there,"" said resident Ernie Neufeld. One house took in the women and children, while ""the RCMP tried to decide what to do with"" the men. The Manitoba-US border runs 500km (310 miles) along Minnesota and North Dakota. Authorities from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which oversees the official border points, and the Mounties, which polices the rest, say they are confident in the border's integrity. And they say those coming are quickly spotted or turn themselves so they can submit refugee claims. Once apprehended, they are identified, searched and screened. If they are eligible to make an asylum claim, they are allowed entry and referred to the  Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. Refugee claimants arrive at the Welcome Place in Winnipeg A refugee claimant arrives at Welcome Place settlement agency in Winnipeg Settlement workers assisting with the newest claims are pointing to the political rhetoric south of the border for the recent spike. Rita Chahal, executive director of the Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, has opened over 300 files since April 2016 for refugee claimants crossing near Emerson. ""Anecdotally, many people do express that they are concerned about what they saw at the airports, what they are seeing in the US,"" she says. In fact, in a November speech in Minnesota, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump singled out the state's Somali community. ""Here in Minnesota, you've seen first hand the problems caused with faulty refugee-vetting, with very large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, your support or approval,"" he said. Mohammed says he once viewed the US as a beacon for human rights and a place that welcomed newcomers but  ""when we came, we didn't see that"". He and Iyal have hearings in March to determine whether they can stay in Canada. Their lawyer has told them not to divulge too many details about the specifics of their refugee claims but Iyal says he left Ghana for personal and political reasons. Mohammed left because of his sexuality - being gay is illegal in the African country. They say in the meantime they will continue to heal from their injuries and learn how to live with their disability. ""We just wait, impatiently, for what is coming next,"" Iyal says.

Extreme viewing,"Haaruun says he would visit the violent websites at the weekend when everyone was outside playing What leads a young child to stand up in front of his class and tell his school friends that he agrees with the aims and objectives of the so-called Islamic State? Matthew Price met one of the youngsters identified through the government's controversial Prevent programme as being at risk from radicalisation. The boy is now 10 years old. He is small, with a round face and engaged eyes. You can tell he is intelligent because he asks questions - lots of them. It is that curiosity that got him into trouble in the first place. These days he will not repeat the exact words he used just over a year ago in his primary school classroom in west London. What we are told, however, is that he stood up in front of his class and declared his support for the so-called Islamic State. It was a declaration that set in motion a series of interventions from his teachers, children's services and the government'sPrevent,externalteam which has been set up to de-radicalise at-risk individuals. Haaruun started researching IS after the Paris attacks For obvious reasons we are not revealing the identity of this boy, but let's call him Haaruun. He lives in London, with his mother and several brothers and sisters, and was nine years old when his journey began. ""I saw on the news the Paris attacks,"" he says. ""As soon as that happened I was on the computer. ""I searched up ISIS on Google and it came up to BBC News. I saw that. Then I went down and it went to Channel 4 'Children of the Caliphate' and I was shocked. Then I watched other sites."" It was those other sites that really exposed Haaruun to the brutality of IS and left him - his case worker believes - vulnerable to radicalisation. ""It led me to this one that had brutal executions and them burning people. It just showed them lighting them on fire. The people chained up, lighting them on fire and then they burned them."" There is no emotion as Haaruun describes another video. ""The men were walking with their hands behind their back,"" he recalls. ""Then they were hit and told to sit down."" He doesn't pause as he delivers the next sentence: ""Then they cut their heads off."" Prevent 'fundamental' to terrorism fight Under-10s sent for 'deradicalisation' Girl's 'Syria death' prompts review call There is no typical case that lands on the desks of Prevent teams across the country. They work with children - some as young as Haaruun, others are teenagers - and they work with adults. Since 2012, Prevent has dealt with more than 1,000 cases. Many involve Islamist radicalisation and in the last year, around a quarter of referrals were because of concerns about far-right extremism. It was a far-right website seeking to denigrate Islam which Haaruun had come across and where he was looking at the brutal IS videos. ""It would be on a weekend, like 'cos everyone was going outside and playing. So when they were all gone and the house was empty, I would go and sit freely in the living room and search up."" Siddhartha Dhar, also known as Abu Rumaysah, was suspected of being the man behind some of the IS videos of which Haaruun became aware He was not the only one at school who was interested. ""They'll be kids fighting - like some kids are saying 'Ah, Hezbollah are stronger than ISIS'."" Haaruun says a lot of children in his school know about IS because so many have family backgrounds in the Middle East. ""There was a group of eight children which were always speaking about it. They were searching it up - even in the classroom. ""When we were doing some research, a boy searched up ISIS and he went on the video. I said 'close the tab' and the teacher came and he heard something and he said 'What was that' - and they all said 'Nothing'. ""I knew what I was looking at was bad, but then it wasn't only me that was doing it. It was unfair. Other people got away with it."" Behind the scenes, unknown to the school, and discovered only by the woman from Prevent who ended up working his case, Haaruun was being bullied. He does not talk about it much now. Yet some of the children, he says - both Muslim and non-Muslim - labelled him a ""terrorist"". The bullying seems to have played a significant factor in isolating Haaruun and in fuelling his interest in IS. Gradually he became an expert in the group and could name its leadership structure. It was all information that led to that day when he stood up in class and declared his sympathy for IS. And that led a woman called Mariam to his home. ""My mum just said to me one day, 'There's someone coming to the house'. I heard Mariam come in. I was scared and Mariam said the reason she was here and I thought I was going to go to prison."" Mariam - she prefers we do not use her surname because of her continuing work for Prevent's Kensington and Chelsea team - says it took time to gain Haaruun's trust. ""It took quite a few meetings before he was opening up and talking about all the things he watched,"" she says. There followed almost a year of work between the two. Haaruun would take Mariam to the websites he accessed and they would discuss the videos. Mariam warns that vulnerable people could become radicalised through chatrooms She used a social work tool in which Haaruun was asked to list things that made him happy, others that he was interested in and things that were scary. Under happy he put ""peace"" and ""family"" and ""Islam"" and under interesting went ""war"". ""ISIS"" went under scary. So too did ""school"" - and that is what alerted Mariam to the bullying. Haaruun's mother had tried to deal with the problem, but he had found a way of seeing the material he wanted to see. ""She couldn't keep up with the questions,"" Mariam says. Today, she does not have to. Prevent have ended their work with Haaruun and if he has learned one thing, he says, it's ""not to go on bad things - bad sites"". ""Mariam told me the repercussions of it and the impact of how it's not good. Like if you keep on watching it you'll be brainwashed and then you or someone will join ISIS and they will be in trouble and you'll go to prison,"" he says, still matter-of-fact. But could that genuinely have happened to Haaruun? ""We're not suggesting he would become a terrorist,"" says Mariam. ""What we are saying is he was vulnerable. ""(He could have gone) on to a chatroom and spoken to someone who's there to radicalise him. Could he have said something out on the street and then someone's walking by who's got an interest and attempts to radicalise him? ""He is a vulnerable young man who's seeing things, forming opinions. How that would have developed without Prevent, we can't predict that. ""We're not saying he's going to take a bomb and blow anyone up. But it's about minimising those risks."" Haaruun is still the engaged, interested little boy he always was. Mariam and the team have given him access to what they call ""safe spaces"" in which to learn. People from his community, the school and other activities all help him explore the wider world, but now in a safe way. He says he wants to be a lawyer or an accountant. There is a pause and he adds, with a shy smile, ""or a journalist"". Hear Matthew Price's report onBBC Radio 4's Today programmeon Tuesday morning or on iPlayer afterwards.

Priceless skills,"This video can not be played Theresa Nguyen says she's learnt how to build closer relationships with her clients One of the pieces that silversmith Theresa Nguyen is most proud of is called A Fair Wind. The work, made from silver and driftwood, is currently on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. ""I created it in honour of my family's escape from Vietnam,"" she explains. A Fair Wind is on display at the V&A Museum in London One night in April 1984, her family, together with dozens of others, crammed into her grandfather's fishing boat, and set sail across the South China Sea. After many adventures, including a dramatic rescue by the captain and crew of a British oil tanker, the family eventually ended up in Wales, where Ms Nguyen was born. Her own life may have been rather less exciting than that of her family, but nevertheless she has faced challenges. She studied jewellery making and silversmithing at Birmingham Jewellery School, and then went about setting herself up as a silversmith. She was lucky enough to find a workshop in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter where she could share a space with established craftsmen. But she soon realised that having the right craft skills on its own was not enough; the business side of her work would also need attention. ""Creativity is something that I'm really passionate about, but you do need to have both sides of the equation to survive,"" she says. Skills shortages could hamper the future of bespoke crafted watches such as these In recent years, the luxury industry across Europe has become concerned about skills shortages in certain disciplines. It has taken steps to improve matters, with companies like LVMH and Mulberry backing apprenticeship schemes. Reviving a century-old leather brand A peek inside a luxury nuclear bunker Is hotel art a waste of time? But acquiring the know-how to make luxurious items is only one part of the story. What about learning to sell them? ""The problem is the emphasis has all been on how good one could get at one's chosen craft,"" explains Guy Salter, the founder and chairman of Crafted, a mentorship scheme backed by British luxury association Walpole, which pairs promising artisans with industry experts. ""The idea of how do you run it as a business, how do you pay the mortgage, how do you even pay the rent on your workshop, has been neglected almost entirely,"" he adds. Part of the answer, Mr Salter believes, lies in more training - but this time, looking at the business aspects of artisanship. Being a ""fluffy maker creative-type person"" isn't enough to succeed, says Rebecca Struthers Husband and wife team Craig and Rebecca Struthers make high-end watches and jewellery. Like Theresa Nguyen, whose workshop is near theirs in Birmingham, they are participants in the Walpole Crafted initiative. ""We knew absolutely nothing about business when we started out. ""When you're this fluffy maker creative-type person you think that everyone's your friend and going to help you out and it's not quite that way in the real world, so you have to toughen up quite quickly,"" says Mrs Struthers. The couple say they have found great value in the scheme. ""Getting advice from other business people is priceless,"" says Mrs Struthers. Robert Ettinger (centre) mentors husband and wife team Craig and Rebecca Struthers The duo's mentor is Robert Ettinger, who runs a family business making leather goods. He says one issue he frequently encounters with mentees is low sales volumes. He says this is a particular challenge for the Struthers. ""They're selling very high-end price products so the number of customers that they can sell to is very small."" For Mr Ettinger, success depends on the artisans putting real time and effort into marketing. ""It's always about bringing in business, finding the customers,"" he says. Other experts agree that encouraging crafts workers to adopt a more business-like approach is sensible - but advice should be carefully thought out. While learning about business is important, crafts workers shouldn't neglect their art, says Peter York ""It's a tricky balancing act,"" says Peter York, who has advised many large luxury enterprises. He says that crafts workers who lack basic commercial knowledge will ""fail very quickly"" unless they have the right help or can teach themselves the necessary skills. But he warns that any advice should not go too far. ""If you teach them all the [business school] stuff they'll want to be brands."" The danger then, Mr York continues, is that artisans may be tempted to concentrate too much on building a business, and hire others to carry out the actual making of products. ""Don't turn their heads so that they stop practising their craft,"" Mr York advises. Things don't always go according to plan for artisans who are starting out. ""Sometimes it's better if they don't always know the path ahead,"" says Jo Newton, head of buying for fashion, beauty and home at Fortnum & Mason, and also Theresa Nguyen's mentor. Ms Newton says it is important for mentors to strike a balance between offering realistic advice, and encouragement. But, she adds, even if things do end up going awry ""sometimes a failure isn't a bad thing"", since it can offer an opportunity for learning. She has found that those who can pick themselves up and start again often end up doing very well in the long run. Theresa Nguyen says she has had to develop her business skills as well as her craft ones in order to succeed So what lessons have the Walpole Crafted mentees learnt from their mentors? For Craig and Rebecca Struthers, one valuable insight has been about pricing, particularly with high-end products, where there can sometimes be a temptation to set prices too low. ""You don't think about what your individual skills are and your time, and why you're different,"" says Mr Struthers. Another valuable lesson, says Mrs Struthers, has been learning to focus on work that will produce at least some sort of return. ""Being creative and being a business person are not things that gel very easily. It's easy to get carried away doing things that you want to do. But at the same time it's completely economically unviable,"" she says. For Theresa Nguyen, a key lesson has been to build closer relationships with customers. ""It's absolutely essential to the survival of your business because in getting to know the clients, that absolutely feeds into the work that you do.""

Brexit backlash fears for British expats,"The ups and downs of Brexit are covered in some of the day's papers, as fears arise about Brits abroad while the forecast for the nation's economy improves. According to the Guardian,,externala document leaked from the European parliament is warning that British expats living in European countries could face ""a backlash"" because of the UK government's stance on foreigners since the vote to leave the EU. The document says that while member states will decide whether British citizens can carry on living in those countries, ""the fact that it appears to be particularly difficult for foreign nationals... to acquire permanent residence status or British nationality may colour member states' approach to this matter"". The Daily Express proclaims good news on its front page,,externalsaying EU officials ""have admitted"" that UK's economy is ""thriving since the Brexit vote"". It also says predictions that the ""gloomy"" forecast that the UK's economy would grow by 1%, made by Brussels last autumn, has been revised up to 1.5%. The Times has alarming news for commuters.,externalThe paper reports a study by the University of Surrey, which says travelling to work by public transport exposes people to up to eight times as much air pollution as those who drive there. According to the authors, there's little ""environmental justice"" - because those who contribute most to air pollution are also the least likely to suffer from it. Researchers found that bus passengers, for example, experience higher levels of pollution, and their journeys last longer. Diesel cars do the most harm to the wellbeing of other travellers - but motorists tend to keep their windows closed, and are protected from harmful particles by filters. THE ""I"" devotes eight pages to an investigation which, it says,reveals that 19 NHS hospitals in England face closure,external.  The paper has analysed 44 ""sustainability and transformation plans"" - which it describes as regional blueprints to remodel the health service - as bosses seeks to plug a Â£22bn ""black hole"" in funding. The ""I"" concludes there is to be a massive shift towards ""out-of-hospital"" care, with patients encouraged to manage their own health needs. Other far-reaching changes are proposed, including the loss of almost 3,000 jobs. The Department of Health tells the paper the plans are designed to ensure best standards of care, with doctors, hospitals and councils working in partnership with local communities for the first time. Reaction is mixed.  A GP in Lancashire says the proposals merely move ""the deckchairs around on the Titanic"", as social care is collapsing, general practice is ""on its knees"", and the hospital service is in ""meltdown"". But Harry Quilter-Pinner, from the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank, tells the paper the NHS cannot stand still in the face of new technology and an ageing population. He says that while the health service is under-funded, there are many instances where treatment could be moved out of hospital and into the community - saving money and improving outcomes for patients. The Daily Telegraph carries a warning,externalthat half a million women are being left at a higher risk of breast cancer because GPs are unaware they should be prescribing a preventative drug. The figures come from a study produced by researchers at University College London, Queen Mary London, and Cancer Research UK.

Fifty Shades 'fuels 999 sex game calls',"The movie Fifty Shades of Grey has been cited as a reason for the upsurge in incidents Firefighters have blamed a rise in callouts involving sex games on kinky blockbuster Fifty Shades of Grey. The London Fire Brigade said the number of people who had to be released from handcuffs almost doubled in two years, from 15 in 2014-15 to 27 in 2015-16. There were nine callouts involving ""men with rings stuck on their penises"" since April, it said. The brigade urged adventurous couples to be careful in order to to avoid an ""embarrassing"" visit. In the last five years the capital's fire crews have been called out to: 102 incidents involving people being trapped in handcuffs 810 rings removed, including 23 instances of men with rings stuck on their penises Other incidents including releasing men's genitals from toasters or vacuum cleaners Each incident costs taxpayers at least Â£326 - a total of Â£830,000 over the past three years. London Fire Brigade director of operations Dave Brown said: ""We're pleased that fewer people are getting themselves stuck in difficult situations and reducing callouts; however, it seems the Fifty Shades of Grey effect is still leading to some call embarrassing callouts."" The warning was issued upon the cinematic release of the second Fifty Shades of Grey film. Based on EL James's trio of hit erotic novels, it follows an affair between student Anastasia Steele and billionaire Christian Grey. According to BBC Entertainment, the film adaptation has received a""critical spanking""from reviewers. Fifty Shades 999 call spike expected Stores whip up Fifty Shades profits.

Trudeau's balancing act at White House,"This video can not be played Justin Trudeau was asked to comment on Donald Trump's migrant ban. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a fine line to walk on Monday and came through with his best diplomatic balancing act. Mr Trudeau headed to Washington hoping to secure reassurances that President Donald Trump valued the Canada-US relationship, especially its economic ties. The prime minister can travel back to Ottawa with Mr Trump on the record as calling the trade relationship between the two nations ""outstanding"" and only in need of a ""tweaking"". What those tweaks might entail is still to be revealed, but you could almost hear anxious Canadian businesspeople breathing a sigh of relief. Trade relations with the US are crucial for Canada. More than 75% of its exports head south of the border, while 18% of US exports are sent north. But Mr Trudeau and his ministers have repeatedly hammered home other statistics over the past few weeks that underscore the importance of Canada to American commerce. Nearly nine million US jobs depend on trade and investment from Canada, while Canada is the top customer for 35 US states. US President Donald Trump (L) holds a news conference Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Mr Trump also made it clear he views economic relations with Mexico in a very different light than those with Canada. Mexico is the third partner with Canada and the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement. ""It's a much less severe situation than what's taking place on the southern border,"" the president said in reference to Canada-US trade during the joint news conference with Mr Trudeau at the White House. This first face-to-face meeting also offered a clue at how far Mr Trudeau was willing to go preserve those vital trade ties. He refused to bite when the press repeatedly baited him to criticise his host on thorny issues like immigration, though many of his own policies stand as a reproach to those of the new US president's. Mr Trudeau is a self-described feminist who calls himself ""extremely free trade"" and has made Canada's openness to immigration, diversity, and refugees part of the country's - and his own - brand. This video can not be played A brief look at the long friendship between the United States and Canada But on Monday his message was that ""the last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they chose to govern themselves"". In fact, Mr Trudeau and Liberal MPs have been disciplined in their refusal to criticise Mr Trump over the past few months. The most pointed they got was when the prime minister tweeted out a welcome to refugees just as the US was implementing the temporary ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Opposition Conservative leader Rona Ambrose said that discipline is a smart move given how paramount relations with the US are to Canada. ""This is a delicate situation here. I don't think it would help anyone in this country if the prime minister went to the US and started a fight,"" she told reporters in Ottawa. Another clue as to just how much significance Ottawa has placed on this first face-to-face meeting with the new American administration was the prime minister's entourage. Mr Trudeau brought five ministers with him to Washington, a who's who of Canada's top Cabinet members, as well as his most trusted senior aides. The two world leaders worked hard to play up the similarities in their first meeting and beyond that key trade assurance, the Canadian delegation will leave Washington having secured a few other commitments from the US. Those include commitments to collaborate on improving clean energy and enhancing efficiency at border crossings, to tackle opioid trafficking, and the creation of a Canada-US council geared towards promoting women-owned enterprises.

"Heartbreak, rejection, devotion","Tales of heartbreak, elation, rejection and redemption - to mark Valentine's Day, here are four love letters, each telling a unique story. This video can not be played Davy Moakes, 86, reads a letter to his long-lost love Helen Andre My Dearest Helen, Here we are in each other's arms at long last, settling into our home, we can't stop talking about our lives and especially those three very precious years we spent together over 65 years ago in the 1950s. We cuddled together when my three-wheeler spluttered to a stop on our way home from Chesterfield College of Art and I would ring my Dad to tow us home. What a good excuse that made to have a lingering kiss, although at times it could be a cold wait! We got engaged and planned to get married when you were 19 but your parents objected to me, forbidding you to ever see me again. I don't think we knew then how our love would live on. Three years passed before we met again by chance. For your 21st birthday your grandfather bought you a new car and we made a date to meet for a drive the following day. But you never turned up. I was heartbroken but later found out you had discovered I was engaged to someone else, which had broken your heart. As I seemed unavailable, you had no option but to look elsewhere. A dashing corporal in the Canadian Air Force swept you off your feet and you married him. A long period of 35 years with the wrong partners ensued but fate still wasn't on our side because at almost the same time, our spouses died and we both married again. Davy and Helen around 1951 Decades later, quite by chance, you came across a man with my second name, who turned out to be my son. With the help of your daughter you were able to make contact with me, after a wait of 65 years! My second wife Margaret had recently suffered a fatal stroke and my grief was understood by you when we met some months later. Gradually we both realised we felt the same love we had retained in our hearts for all those years and went ahead with plans to have a quiet wedding last November. Our home is full of photographs featuring our separate lives and I can't help feeling pangs of envy when I see you as a beautiful lady, happy in another's arms. But you are finally all mine now and you make me very happy. You are still the elegant lady I have always loved. There's a lot of work needed on our small bungalow and quite soon when finished, it will become the love nest of our dreams. We will spend our limited future together very much in love and although we will always regret the circumstances that kept us apart in 1956, we are happy together for ever. Dear Granddad, It's been nearly eight years since I wrote. I still have your response, telling me my marriage was offensive. Daily I forgive you for the hurt when you rejected my Mark, the day you found out he was black. No-one but Mark and my best friend fully understand how painful it was and still is. I choose not to see you to protect myself and my family. But I recently lost someone. A reminder that time is short and there are things I have to say. This video can not be played Sarah hasnât spoken to her granddad since her marriage to Mark, who is black Mark says the thing he loves most about me is that I always see the good in people. I always seek the other perspective. What's made you so angry Granddad? What's made you so hateful of black, Asian or anyone who doesn't conform to your standards that you were prepared to sacrifice me? Did I not matter more than your racism? I like to think you were brought up in a time when men weren't allowed to show their emotions. That the hard and angry exterior hides a deeply sensitive soul. I glimpsed yours the day you told me about meeting Grandma. This beautiful woman with sparkling blue eyes walking down the street. You fell in love. I don't believe, as others do, in a Hollywood ending. I don't believe that if I turned up at your door with my darling family you'd welcome us as if nothing had happened. Let me tell you about my tan-skinned children you were so afraid of. These stories are taken fromBBC Radio 5 Live'sLove Season, which runs from 14-28 February There are many times I've watched my beautiful, sensitive Daniel playing with his trains, fascinated by engines or taking comfort in the rolling of a toy car and thought of you. My extraordinary boy who could have shared your passion for model trains and methodical construction. And little Anna who is all emotion and love and - apparently - so like me. I tell my son people come into our lives for a reason. Sometimes briefly but always for a reason. I think of the times you were my Granddad. The smell of your bungalow when we visited. How you were always waiting at the door as we arrived. You loved birds (and therefore hated cats) and those rescue dogs no-one else loved. I love you for those memories. I can't be angry with you because you are in those memories. There are days I find it hard to believe it's not my fault. I simply fell in love with this amazing man - just as you fell in love with Grandma. I believe your anger hides a hurting soul. So I'll take your anger and send you love. The wedding Dear Joe, I'm sitting here with my Mum talking about wedding stuff like a fairy tale story and looking at the photo album. In this one, it makes me feel a bit scared, my eyes, my face and my hands... I really was scared. Excited and scared to begin with.  Oh my goodness Dad, I'm going to get married! Joe, you were already there in the marquee waiting for me. When I was waiting to come down the red carpet, I felt a bit tearful listening to my favourite song... When You Wish Upon a Star. This video can not be played Polly Gibson retells the story of her wedding day to husband Joe Minogue I walked down the aisle with my Dad, he brought me to you Joe.  I never felt this way before our wedding day. Everyone stood up and clapped, it made me happy. Joe, you came up to me from the unicorn throne, you gave me a little kiss on the cheek and put your hands around my waist, it felt really ticklish. You looked like a dream husband looking all grown up in your lovely blue suit. I loved touching the pink rose on your jacket because I love the colour pink. The unicorn throne was like a fairytale fantasy film. It was fun to sit on it especially when we did our legs kicks to I do, I do, I do. Now we're looking at the photo of us dancing to Come What May.  Joe, did you like my lovely dress?  Colourful, big giant pattern like a leaf and a spinny swishy shape.  Oh my gosh, my garter slipped down and I kicked if off away and Dad picked it up and put it in his top pocket... It made me laugh! When Vivienne said: ""You're husband and wife, you may kiss now,"" we both threw our arms around each other and we kissed on the lips.  It felt like love's dream. The best thing in the whole wide world. Once we were married, we're wife and husband with our rings on, everyone's throwing confetti - I'm surrounded in confetti and it's down my top... too much confetti! We look too happy. Holding my bouquet with everyone smiling and cheering. I like the photos just of us that Leela took in the garden. I like the way you held my hand. I like the way you've put your arms all round my back. You feel like a really strong person and I want to spend my life being with you. All times. I just love the kissing photo. Joe, it was so much fun at the party.  I love the way I spun round with the singing waiters.  I liked the pink and blue balloons and the bunting.  Our friends and family found it really good fun. We are going to be happy ever after. Lots and lots of love from your Polly This video can not be played Hina overcame her views on arranged marriage after meeting her (now) husband Kam (Picture: Khawer Riaz) My Dear Kam, Before I met you, love hadn't been all it was cracked up to be. Life had knocked me down, then just as I picked myself up, it tripped me at a bend. It was a phone call that revealed all. I discovered my ex was involved with someone else. So that perfect wedding hadn't turned into the marriage I'd expected to have. And I became lonely. So lonely that loneliness became a thing. It sat with me at work and followed me home at the end of each day. I'd speak to the birds when no one could see, and stare at the bark of twisted old trees. And all the friends in the world couldn't fill the void it formed in me. Each day I'd walk about, waiting for that lightning strike. An electric shock. Love at first sight. Hoping it would happen to me, perhaps even while shopping at the local Sainsbury's. But nothing. I realised then that stars aren't obliged to align to make our dreams come true. And so, on holiday with mum to see my gran in Pakistan, I caved. Mustering all my courage, I challenged my views on arranged marriage and agreed to marry you. This man I hardly knew. It wasn't love at first sight, but your kind eyes and that smile really drew me in. I ditched my search for lightning bolts and now I can see it was the best decision I would ever make. One year in we were told we couldn't have a baby. Had we considered a pet instead, asked that grey-faced doctor in London? You took me in your arms and, with heartbroken eyes, said it would be ok. That it didn't matter if it wasn't meant to be. When I was hurt by those closest to me, it was you that made me see straight. You showed me that I already had all the love I could ever need. We've had joy-filled times when we've danced the jive right in the middle of our living room: the news I was pregnant, the birth of our sons and an amazing book deal with my publishers. Then last year, I faced the toughest test of all. My dear mum passed with me at her side after weeks in the intensive care unit. Each day and night, you held me tight, tears from your eyes mingling with mine. So what I'm trying to say to you, is that it may not be a flash of lightning, a six-pack or stubble that makes for perfect chemistry. Love can grow another way. Stars are not obliged to align to make our dreams come true. Except sometimes they do. And if anyone tells me I'm wrong, I'll tell them they really ought to meet my Kam.
