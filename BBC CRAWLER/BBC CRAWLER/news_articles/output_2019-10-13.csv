Six authors await Booker Prize 2019 announcement,"This video can not be played Atwood and Evaristo become the first authors to jointly win the Booker Prize since 1992 Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo have been named the joint winners of the 2019 Booker Prize after the judges broke their rules by declaring a tie. Atwood's The Testaments, the Canadian writer's follow-up to The Handmaid's Tale, was recognised alongside Londoner Evaristo's novel Girl, Woman, Other. The pair will split the literary award's Â£50,000 prize money equally. The Booker rules say the prize must not be divided, but the judges insisted they ""couldn't separate"" the two works. Atwood, 79, is the oldest ever Booker winner, while Evaristo is the first black woman to win. After their names were called, the pair stood arm-in-arm on stage and Atwood joked: ""I would have thought I would have been too elderly, and I kind of don't need the attention, so I'm very glad that you're getting some. ""It would have been quite embarrassing for meâ¦ if I had been alone here, so I'm very pleased that you're here too."" Atwood praised Evaristo for encouraging black female writers The award's rules were changed after the last tie in 1992, and organisers told this year's judges they were not allowed to pick two winners. But after five hours of deliberations, Peter Florence, the chair of the judges, said: ""It was our decision to flout the rules."" He told reporters: ""The more we talked about them, the more we found we loved them both so much we wanted them both to win."" Evaristo and Atwood spoke together on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning. Evaristo said winning was ""a real game changer"", adding: ""It means my work gets out there to a much wider audience around the world. ""There are lots of prizes which people from certain communities don't win, certainly black people don't win lots of literary awards. No one seems to notice, but it's really important. ""A black woman has never won [the Booker before]. Only four black women have ever been shortlisted and there have been about 300 books shortlisted. ""Hopefully this signals a new direction for the Booker and the kind of judges they have. This year there were four women judges and one male. ""I hope more black women win this prize."" Atwood, who is from Ottawa, said: ""It's great to be sharing with Bernardineâ¦ and I certainly hope you'll come to Canada, bring your warm clothing!"" She told Evaristo: ""What you have done is to make it possible for more black women to consider that writing is something they can do."" It is 19 years since Atwood won the Booker for The Blind Assassin, and 33 years since she was nominated for The Handmaid's Tale. With the latter book enjoying newfound popularity and resonance against the backdrop of Donald Trump's America, The Testaments picks up 15 years after the end of that novel. Returning to the totalitarian, patriarchal Gilead, it is narrated by Aunt Lydia, one of the handmaids' instructors, and two teenage girls. Peter Florence said: ""It does massively more than follow the single story that we had from Offred. This is beautiful in its depth and exploration of the world of Gilead. ""As [Atwood] has said, it might have looked like science fiction back in the day, although all of the extremities are rooted in fact. Now it looks more politically urgent than ever before."" Published in September, The Testaments sold more than 100,000 copies in the UK in its first week, making it the fastest-selling hardback novel in four years. Speaking before the ceremony, Atwood said winning would be ""a double-edged sword for me, but for a younger person I think it would be great"". Bernardine Evaristo was born the fourth of eight children, in Woolwich, south east London, to an English mother and a Nigerian father. Her father was a welder and local Labour councillor; her mother was a schoolteacher. She spent her teenage years at Greenwich Young People's Theatre, which was where she first became involved in the arts.. She went on to study at Goldsmiths, University of London, where she earned her PhD in creative writing. A career in theatre followed and she was a co-founder of the Theatre of Black Women company in 1982. She also set up the Spread the Word writer development agency, the Complete Works mentoring scheme for poets of colour and the Brunel International African Poetry Prize. She was made an MBE in 2009 for services to literature. Girl, Woman, Other is 60-year-old Evaristo's eighth novel. It gives a chapter each to the lives of 12 intertwining characters, who are mostly black British women. ""We black British women know that if we don't write ourselves into literature no one else will,""the author has said,external. Lesbian theatre director Amma, non-binary Morgan (formerly Megan), Barbadian bride Winsome and Northumbrian farmer Hattie are among the characters in a book that spans more than 100 years. Peter Florence said there was ""something utterly magical"" about the book's characters, whom he said ""give a wonderful spectrum of black British women today"". ""There are stories there of people who haven't been visibly represented in contemporary literature, and in that sense this book is groundbreaking, and I hope encouraging and inspiring to the rest of the publishing industry."" In her acceptance speech, Evaristo said she hoped it would not be long before another black woman won the prize. ""It's so incredible to share this with Margaret Atwood, who's such a legend and so generous,"" she said. ""A lot of people say, 'I never thought it would happen to me', and I will say I am the first black woman to win this prize, and I hope that honour doesn't last too long. I hope other people come forward now."" She has called Girl, Woman, Other ""a readable experimental novel"". The experimental element mainly comes from the unorthodox punctuation, which often dispenses with quotation marks and capital letters. The Booker Prize rules,externalstate that the prize ""may not be divided or withheld"". The award has been shared twice before - in 1974 and 1992 - but the rules were then changed. ""The thinking was it just doesn't work - it sort of detracts attention from both, rather than drawing attention to either,"" said Gaby Wood, literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation. So when Florence told her the five judges wanted to announce a tie, she said no. The judges got back around the table. Again, they told Wood they wanted two winners. This time, Wood phoned Baroness Kennedy QC, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, who told her: ""Absolutely not."" The judges deliberated again. ""We tried voting, it didn't work,"" Florence said. ""There's a metaphor for our times. And equally, today of all days, when rebellion is in the air, maybe we were a little moved by that."" The panel resolved to hold firm on their split decision. Baroness Kennedy was called again. ""She said, 'Well, if that's what they've chosen to do, there's nothing we can do,'"" Wood said. ""We had to move on."" Florence added that both winning books ""have urgent things to say"". He told reporters: ""They also happen to be wonderfully compelling, page-turning thrillers, which can speak to the most literary audience, to readers who maybe are only reading one, or in this case I hope two books a year, and can speak at different levels to all sorts of different readerships. ""So in that sense they are, I hope and believe, really valuable Booker Prize winners.""

"De Niro, Pacino & Pesci de-aged by Scorsese âââââ","This video can not be played ""We could not get any financing"" from Hollywood, says Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese. Martin Scorsese says he couldn't get a Hollywood studio to back his three-and-a-half-hour mob movie The Irishman. ""Nobody was interested in making a film with me and Bob [Robert De Niro] anymore,"" he said. ""I just think they thought the audience wasn't there."" Possibly. Although I think they probably ran the numbers first. I mean, if you're a studio exec and have one of the greatest movie directors of all time pitching an idea in a genre he's made his own, starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, you'd listen, wouldn't you? I imagine it came down to money and cautiousness. The Irishman sees the reunion of Joe Pesci (Russell Bufalino), Robert De Niro (Frank Sheeran) and Martin Scorsese for the first time in 24 years The three male leads are all in their 70s, which is not a problem in itself, but the majority of their screen-time is spent when their characters are in their late 30s, early 40s. No amount of make-up was going to paper over those facial cracks. Stand-ins were discounted. Digital de-aging was the only option, but it had never been done in the way that Scorsese demanded: no green-screen, no image-capture head-gear - new technology was required. Too risky, maybe. Would it work? Would it cost a fortune? Would the actors play ball? Netflix stepped in and answered all three questions in the affirmative. But for all the very expensive high-tech trickery The Irishman is a staunchly old-school movie spanning half a century of mafia mischief in post-war America. Classic Scorsese, you could say. And so it is, up to a point. Cars are dramatically blown up, there are a lot of cold-blooded murders, and attention to every detail is paid with a historian's soul and an artist's eye. Martin Scorsese says The Irishman has ""the rhythm of how we think when we look back on time"" The Irishman is a beautifully made film. It is also very slow. It starts with a long tracking shot inside an old people's home, at the end of which we meet our elderly narrator Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), the eponymous Irishman. He tells us his story in a series of flashbacks in which we see a de-aged De Niro go from a trigger-happy American soldier to a trigger-happy Pennsylvania gangster working for mafia don Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Scorsese says Pesci took a lot of persuading to put away his golf clubs and return to acting. For Marty and for us it was time well invested. Pesci's performance as the quietly-spoken, business-like organised crime boss is exceptional. It will take something very special to deprive him of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Robert De Niro (Frank Sheeran), with Joe Pesci, who wasn't keen to return to movie making, plays the role of the ""quiet-don"" Russell Bufalino The spine of the movie is a road trip he takes with Frank (whom he calls ""kid"" throughout without even the smallest twinkle in his eye) to attend a family wedding. It's a structural device that allows Scorsese to take all the side-tracks he needs to fill in the back story of the three inter-connected protagonists: Frank, Russell, and trade union president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Russell engineers a job interview for Frank as Hoffa's wingman, which takes place over the phone. ""I heard you paint houses"", Hoffa posits. ""I do"", replies Frank, ""and I do my own carpentry"" - a line that wins an approving Sicilian smile from Russell. They are not discussing DIY. In a 1960s world of phone taps and wire traps, underworld America developed its own patois: hit men were known as house painters. Those who cleaned up afterwards did their own joinery. It's a central exchange in the film, establishing the crime triangle, the pecking-order of the protagonists, and the relationships that would develop. Pacino is excellent, although slightly undermined by the de-aging process which, at times, makes him look more like the camp British TV host Larry Grayson than a tough-as-teak union leader. Oscar-winning Al Pacino had never worked with Scorsese before, and said ""the character of Jimmy Hoffa was irresistible"" De Niro is also let down by the technology, which is a shame, because he is on top form. The facial changes are fine, they work. But it still leaves him with a body of a septuagenarian, which looks incongruous when moving stiff-hipped over rocks, or assaulting a local shopkeeper with arms pinned to his body. It's not a disaster, but it looks odd: it jars and distracts from an otherwise first-class film, which wears its duration lightly. In fact, the slow pace acts as another character, giving a very specific personality to the film, which is a re-telling of a true story made public in book form by Charles Brandt, a lawyer and friend of Frank Sheeran. Pesci, Pacino, Scorsese, De Niro, and Harvey Keitel attending the world premiere of ""The Irishman"" in New York Martin Scorsese says it is about ""power, love, betrayal, and then, ultimately, the price you pay for the life you lead"". I said I thought it was also about old age, which elicited the sort of look you don't quickly forget from the legendary helmsman. ""Old age?"" he said, eyebrows raised. ""Yeah"", I replied, ""it's about the aging process"". ""The aging process"", he says and slowly and nods, ""yes, the aging process ultimatelyâ¦ [pauses, smiles] without scaring an audience saying we won't go and see a film about old age."" A nerve unintentionally touched. Perhaps the perception that it was a film about old folk was an issue when it came to financing. Who knows. But it is. That is the perspective from which the story is being told and rationalised: Sheeran is an old man facing his day of reckoning, like King Lear on the heath: not with two cruel daughters on his mind, though, but the two powerful masters he served. It is a story of divided loyalties we've heard before, from 18th Century commedia dell'arte to the National Theatre's hit play One Man Two Guvnors. They were comedies, The Irishman isn't, but it is not beyond the realms of reason that Netflix ends up laughing all the way to the bank with a hit Hollywood rejected.

Harry Dunn's parents 'hopeful' about US meeting,"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's mother Charlotte spoke to the BBC while on a plane to the US The parents of Harry Dunn say they are hopeful about meeting the US diplomat's wife who was involved in the crash that killed their son. The 19-year-old motorcyclist died in the crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas left the UK under diplomatic immunity while police were investigating her as a suspect. Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, told the BBC they were stepping in the right direction towards a meeting. Speaking on a plane to the US, where she hopes to publicise the case, she said: ""The statement from [Mrs Sacoolas's] lawyer is promising, that we may be able to hopefully get a meeting put together. ""Whether it's face-to-face or lawyer-to-lawyer, we're not really sure yet, but fingers crossed we're stepping in the right direction."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official - said in a letter from her lawyers she was ""devastated by the tragic accident"" and extended her ""deepest sympathies"" to Mr Dunn's family. Ms Charles told Sky News earlier that ""sorry doesn't cut it"" but she would not be aggressive if they were to meet. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The Foreign Office said Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity following the crash, but it no longer applied.  On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. Ms Charles said receiving the letter was ""amazing"" and described it as a ""breakthrough"". Mr Dunn's father, Tim Dunn, said he was ""shocked, but hopeful something can come of this"". Home Secretary Priti Patel told The Andrew Marr Show earlier the situation had moved on over the last 24 hours and it was ""right"" that ""co-operation takes place"". ""It is right that justice is served, that an investigation takes place, and that Anne Sacoolas actually does co-operate with investigation,"" she said. Priti Patel said it was ""right"" that ""co-operation takes place"" Northamptonshire Police said it was liaising with the Foreign Office and International Crime Co-ordination Centre about what to do next. In a statement, it said it was ""absolutely committed"" to achieving justice for the teenager and his family. A statement issued on behalf of Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband worked at RAF Croughton near the scene of the crash, said she had ""fully co-operated with the police"". It added: ""She spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to co-operate with the investigation. ""Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn's parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident."" This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they do not have British citizenship. It means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. However, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity. Read more on the Harry Dunn crash Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, with Radd Seiger (centre), who hope to visit New York and Washington DC during their trip Mr Dunn's parents have previously said they are considering civil action against Mrs Sacoolas. The family's spokesman Radd Seiger said they would be ""engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing"". Harry Dunn's Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in August On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the US was ""absolutely ruthless"" in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity. He said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Mr Dunn's family, the US was ""very reluctant"" to allow citizens to be tried abroad. Mr Raab said now that neither government deemed Mrs Sacoolas's immunity relevant, the matter was ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. The police force previously said CCTV of the crash in which Mr Dunn died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road.

Queen's Speech: What can we expect?,"Sitting on the Sovereign's Throne, Elizabeth II delivered the 65th Queen's Speech of her reign to Parliament earlier. The speech outlined the government's agenda for the coming parliamentary session, with 26 bills - pieces of proposed legislation - spanning health, education, defence, technology, transport and crime, as well as Brexit. Here's what the Queen's Speech contained, and what it may mean in practice. What the speech said:""My government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly co-operation."" What it means:If Boris Johnson can secure a deal this week - which is backed by MPs - he will then need to pass the European Union Agreement Bill, ratifying it into UK law. Her Majesty also spoke of ""new regimes"" post-Brexit for fisheries, agriculture and trade and a new immigration system. All of these require new laws. What the speech said:""My government is committed to addressing violent crime, and to strengthening public confidence in the criminal justice system."" What it means:Law and order dominated the government's announcements.They included separate bills covering sentencing, foreign national criminals, extradition, serious violence, prisoners and police protections. The extradition bill would create powers to immediately arrest suspected criminals who are in the UK but wanted in other ""trusted"" countries. The sentencing bill would push back the automatic release point for violent and sexual offenders from half-way to two-thirds of the way through a sentence. A Foreign Nationals Offenders Bill would increase the maximum punishment for those who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order. What the speech said:""Proposals on railway reform will be brought forward."" What it means:Ministers are signalling that a new commercial model for the railways will arrive in 2020, replacing the existing franchised system - with more details to be published soon. What the speech said:""New laws will be taken forward to help implement the National Health Service's Long Term Plan in England."" What it means:On top of a renewed commitment to the plan - first published under Theresa May - the government will focus on improving mental health care and will bring in new laws aimed at improving patient safety and increasing the number of clinical trials for new drugs. Health is devolved, so Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have other plans. What the speech said:""My government will bring forward proposals to reform adult social care in England to ensure dignity in old age."" What it means:In the long term, ministers are promising a further consultation - in the form of a green paper - on reforming the existing system. In the shorter term, local authorities could be allowed to increase council tax by an extra 2% to raise Â£500m towards paying for care for the elderly. What the speech said:""For the first time ever, environmental principles will be enshrined into law."" What it means:Recalling especially pollutant vehicles, charges for certain single-use plastics and protecting trees are just some of the measures being considered in a new environment bill. There is also a strong focus on animal welfare, with bills pledged increasing the sentence for animal cruelty. What the speech said:""A white paper will be published to set out my government's ambitions for unleashing regional potential in England, and to enable decisions that affect local people to be made at a local level."" What it means:The government is not committing to specific new laws in this area, but the policy paper is expected to expand the number, powers and funding of local mayors in England. What the speech said:""My Ministers... will bring forward laws to implement new building safety standards."" What it means:With the continuing fall-out from the Grenfell disaster in 2017, ministers plan to put into law a new safety framework for high-rise housing blocks. It would include giving local residents more of a say and putting in place strong significant sanctions for house builders that don't meet the safety standards. The government also plans to pass a new law to secure the compensation scheme for victims of the Windrush scandal. What the speech said on drones:""An aviation bill will provide for the effective and efficient management of the UK's airspace."" What it means:A bill would give police more powers to tackle unlawful use of drones and other model aircraft following last year's high-profile disruption at Gatwick airport. What the speech said on tips:""Take steps to make work fairer, introducing measures that will support those working hard."" What it means:This is a popular measure, welcomed by Labour, that would force employers in England and Wales to distribute all tips to workers without deductions. What the speech said:""My government will take steps to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral system."" What it means:A new law is being touted which would require people to show photo ID to vote in UK elections. Labour says this is an attempt to ""rig"" the next election, by suppressing turnout among younger and ethnic minority voters. There are four pieces of legislation that were ""carried over"" from the last session. This means the government has decided to carry on from where they left off before prorogation, rather than starting from scratch. The four include the Domestic Abuse Bill, which has cross-party support and started its journey through Parliament at the beginning of October. After six days of debate, MPs will vote on the Queen's Speech and any amendments made by MPs. Boris Johnson, who does not have a majority in the Commons, is at risk of potential defeat. The last PM to lose such a vote was Stanley Baldwin in 1924. Could MP's vote down the Queen's Speech? What is the King's Speech and why is it important? Why are MPs being sent home again?

Could MPs reject Queen's Speech?,"King Charles has delivered the Labour government's first King's Speech in the House of Lords. Part of the State Opening of Parliament ceremony, the speech marks the start of the parliamentary year. The King's Speech set out the new Labour government's priorities for the months ahead, following the party's general election victory. Formally called the Speech from the Throne, Charles gavehis first King's Speech in November 2023. He also delivered the Queen's Speech on behalf of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, in May 2022. The quirks and crowns of the King's State Opening The speech is written by the government, and the monarch delivers it in a neutral tone, to avoid any appearance of political support. Its length depends on the number of proposed laws and other announcements - such as foreign policy objectives - but it normally lasts about 10 minutes. The 2024 Kings Speech outlined the draft laws which Labour plan to introduce in the coming months. These include bills on workers' rights, the renationalisation of the railways, illegal immigration, housing and planning and House of Lords reform. Key points in King's Speech at a glance Traditionally, the State Opening begins with a procession in which the King travels from Buckingham Palace to Westminster by carriage. On arrival, he uses the Sovereign's Entrance, reserved for the monarch. The King then processes to the throne in the House of Lords. MPs are summoned to the Lords by Black Rod,an official position currently held by Sarah Clarke,external. Before entering the House of Commons, Black Rod has the door shut in their face. They then have to knock three times on the door with the rod to gain entry before it is opened, and MPs follow Black Rod back to the House of Lords to hear the speech. MPs, peers and other dignitaries generally listen in silence. Traditionally, the government MP holding the position ofvice-chamberlain of the household,external- currently Samantha Dixon - is ""held hostage"" in Buckingham Palace while the King is in Parliament, to ensure the monarch's safe return. Who is Black Rod and what do they do in Parliament? What does the King do? Yes. About two hours after the speech is delivered, MPs reassemble in the House of Commons to begin debating its contents. After introductory speeches by two MPs, the prime minister will ""sell"" the speech to the Commons, setting out a vision for the country. The leader of the opposition then gets the chance to respond, before other MPs are allowed to contribute. The last prime minister to lose a vote on the speech was Stanley Baldwin in 1924 The debate on what is known as ""the Humble Address"" normally lasts about five days. At the end of the debate there is a vote. It is normally seen as symbolic, as it is extremely rare for a government to lose it. The last time this happened was in January 1924, under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Mr Baldwin proceeded with a King's Speech - George V was the monarch at the time - despite having lost his majority in the previous month's general election. He was forced to resign, and Labour formed a short-lived government. The speech outlined21 laws that ministers had intended to pass in the 2023 Parliamentary session. They included plans to boost investment in transport, laws to stop people smoking, and tougher sentences for serious offenders.

Sturgeon: Corbyn must back indyref2 for SNP votes,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said she favoured replacing Boris Johnson's Tory government with a ""progressive-style alliance"" Nicola Sturgeon has told Jeremy Corbyn not to ""bother picking up the phone"" to ask the SNP to put him in government unless he backs an independence vote. The Scottish first minister said she was in favour of removing Boris Johnson from office and holding an election. But she said her backing for a future ""progressive alliance"" government relied on a deal to hold a referendum. Ms Sturgeon also said she would seek UK government consent this year to hold a new independence vote. Mr Corbyn has said he does not think a new independence poll is ""a good idea"", but has not ruled out allowing one. Ms Sturgeon wants to hold a new vote in the second half of 2020, but has yet to ask UK ministers for the required ""section 30"" request to allow it. She said it was not yet clear who the prime minister would be at that point. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that she would be willing to oust the Conservatives in favour of a ""progressive-type alliance"", but warned Mr Corbyn to not ""even bother picking up the phone to me"" unless he accepted ""Scotland's right to choose our own future"". SNP formally backs decriminalisation of drugs SNP conference: Three questions facing the party SNP election win 'could be independence mandate' Sturgeon: 'No shortcut route to independence' Ms Sturgeon's comments come as the SNP gathers in Aberdeen for its autumn conference, and at a pivotal moment in UK politics and the Brexit process. Boris Johnson has repeatedly challenged other parties to support a snap general election, but opposition leaders want to rule out a no-deal Brexit first - and are divided on whether a fresh EU referendum should come before an election. The SNP leader told Andrew Marr she was ""ruling nothing out"" in the coming weeks, but said an election would be the most realistic outcome due to the difficulty of leaving an interim government in place throughout a referendum campaign. Mr Corbyn has said he would not allow an independence referendum in the ""formative years"" of a Labour government Should an election not produce a clear winner, Ms Sturgeon said the SNP ""will not put the Tories in office and are not in favour of coalitions"". However, she warned that votes from her MPs - currently the third-largest group at Westminster - would be contingent on the new prime minister giving the green light to an independence referendum. She said: ""We would favour a progressive-type alliance, but I would say this to Jeremy Corbyn or any Westminster leader who's looking to the SNP for support - if you don't accept Scotland's right to choose our own future, at the time of our own choosing, don't even bother picking up the phone to me."" Mr Corbyn has previously said Labour would not actively stand in the way of ""indyref2"", but has indicatedhe would seek to delay it. He said he would not agree to a vote ""in the formative years of a Labour government"", while focusing on ""central priorities"" such as ""sorting the Tory Brexit nightmare"" and pursuing ""transformative investment in Scotland's people, communities and public services"". This approach could see the independence vote pushed back beyond Ms Sturgeon's preferred timetable in 2020, and past the Holyrood elections in 2021. A ""section 30"" agreement is the same legal mechanism used to facilitate the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon said she would make a section 30 request ""over the next matter of weeks - it is coming soon. But we don't yet know who is likely to be in Downing Street - the situation is very fluid, and that is why I've chosen to do the preparations that are within our control and we're getting on with that."" Some supporters of independence have called for a ""plan b"" for securing independence The current UK government has repeatedly refused to countenance allowing a new independence vote, with Home Secretary Priti Patel telling the same programme that ministers were determined to ""respect the result of referendums that took place previously"". This has led some SNP members - including MPs, MSPs and councillors - to call for a ""plan B"", such as securing a majority in an election or holding an unauthorised poll. However, Ms Sturgeon ruled out such an approach, saying a legal and constitutional referendum was the only way forward. She said: ""If I thought there was any quicker way, an easier way, a plan B that would get us there quicker, I would have taken it by now. ""What we have to do is have a process that allows us to demonstrate that there is majority support in Scotland for independence, and we have to have a process that is legal and accepted, otherwise our independence will not be recognised."" At the conference in Aberdeen, an attempt to add a debate on ""plan B"" to the agenda was voted down overwhelmingly. Earlier, the party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told delegates that the SNP had prepared a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson and his government. Mr Blackford said the only way to put an end to the ""chaos"" was to have a general election. He called on the leaders of the other opposition parties to act with the SNP, although he didn't specify when they would bring the motion in Parliament.

"De Niro, Pacino & Pesci de-aged by Scorsese âââââIt's not beyond the realms of reason that Netflix ends up laughing all the way to the bank with a hit Hollywood rejected.","This video can not be played ""We could not get any financing"" from Hollywood, says Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese. Martin Scorsese says he couldn't get a Hollywood studio to back his three-and-a-half-hour mob movie The Irishman. ""Nobody was interested in making a film with me and Bob [Robert De Niro] anymore,"" he said. ""I just think they thought the audience wasn't there."" Possibly. Although I think they probably ran the numbers first. I mean, if you're a studio exec and have one of the greatest movie directors of all time pitching an idea in a genre he's made his own, starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, you'd listen, wouldn't you? I imagine it came down to money and cautiousness. The Irishman sees the reunion of Joe Pesci (Russell Bufalino), Robert De Niro (Frank Sheeran) and Martin Scorsese for the first time in 24 years The three male leads are all in their 70s, which is not a problem in itself, but the majority of their screen-time is spent when their characters are in their late 30s, early 40s. No amount of make-up was going to paper over those facial cracks. Stand-ins were discounted. Digital de-aging was the only option, but it had never been done in the way that Scorsese demanded: no green-screen, no image-capture head-gear - new technology was required. Too risky, maybe. Would it work? Would it cost a fortune? Would the actors play ball? Netflix stepped in and answered all three questions in the affirmative. But for all the very expensive high-tech trickery The Irishman is a staunchly old-school movie spanning half a century of mafia mischief in post-war America. Classic Scorsese, you could say. And so it is, up to a point. Cars are dramatically blown up, there are a lot of cold-blooded murders, and attention to every detail is paid with a historian's soul and an artist's eye. Martin Scorsese says The Irishman has ""the rhythm of how we think when we look back on time"" The Irishman is a beautifully made film. It is also very slow. It starts with a long tracking shot inside an old people's home, at the end of which we meet our elderly narrator Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), the eponymous Irishman. He tells us his story in a series of flashbacks in which we see a de-aged De Niro go from a trigger-happy American soldier to a trigger-happy Pennsylvania gangster working for mafia don Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Scorsese says Pesci took a lot of persuading to put away his golf clubs and return to acting. For Marty and for us it was time well invested. Pesci's performance as the quietly-spoken, business-like organised crime boss is exceptional. It will take something very special to deprive him of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Robert De Niro (Frank Sheeran), with Joe Pesci, who wasn't keen to return to movie making, plays the role of the ""quiet-don"" Russell Bufalino The spine of the movie is a road trip he takes with Frank (whom he calls ""kid"" throughout without even the smallest twinkle in his eye) to attend a family wedding. It's a structural device that allows Scorsese to take all the side-tracks he needs to fill in the back story of the three inter-connected protagonists: Frank, Russell, and trade union president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Russell engineers a job interview for Frank as Hoffa's wingman, which takes place over the phone. ""I heard you paint houses"", Hoffa posits. ""I do"", replies Frank, ""and I do my own carpentry"" - a line that wins an approving Sicilian smile from Russell. They are not discussing DIY. In a 1960s world of phone taps and wire traps, underworld America developed its own patois: hit men were known as house painters. Those who cleaned up afterwards did their own joinery. It's a central exchange in the film, establishing the crime triangle, the pecking-order of the protagonists, and the relationships that would develop. Pacino is excellent, although slightly undermined by the de-aging process which, at times, makes him look more like the camp British TV host Larry Grayson than a tough-as-teak union leader. Oscar-winning Al Pacino had never worked with Scorsese before, and said ""the character of Jimmy Hoffa was irresistible"" De Niro is also let down by the technology, which is a shame, because he is on top form. The facial changes are fine, they work. But it still leaves him with a body of a septuagenarian, which looks incongruous when moving stiff-hipped over rocks, or assaulting a local shopkeeper with arms pinned to his body. It's not a disaster, but it looks odd: it jars and distracts from an otherwise first-class film, which wears its duration lightly. In fact, the slow pace acts as another character, giving a very specific personality to the film, which is a re-telling of a true story made public in book form by Charles Brandt, a lawyer and friend of Frank Sheeran. Pesci, Pacino, Scorsese, De Niro, and Harvey Keitel attending the world premiere of ""The Irishman"" in New York Martin Scorsese says it is about ""power, love, betrayal, and then, ultimately, the price you pay for the life you lead"". I said I thought it was also about old age, which elicited the sort of look you don't quickly forget from the legendary helmsman. ""Old age?"" he said, eyebrows raised. ""Yeah"", I replied, ""it's about the aging process"". ""The aging process"", he says and slowly and nods, ""yes, the aging process ultimatelyâ¦ [pauses, smiles] without scaring an audience saying we won't go and see a film about old age."" A nerve unintentionally touched. Perhaps the perception that it was a film about old folk was an issue when it came to financing. Who knows. But it is. That is the perspective from which the story is being told and rationalised: Sheeran is an old man facing his day of reckoning, like King Lear on the heath: not with two cruel daughters on his mind, though, but the two powerful masters he served. It is a story of divided loyalties we've heard before, from 18th Century commedia dell'arte to the National Theatre's hit play One Man Two Guvnors.

Ministers say a Brexit deal is a ""priority"" and they hope one can be passed through Parliament ""at pace"".

Prime MinisterBoris Johnson updated his cabinet on the progress of the talks in Brussels on Sunday, saying he believed there was a ""way forward"" but also ""a significant amount of work"" to do. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she believed it was important for people to see Parliament delivering on the issues that matter to them. She said: ""Tomorrow you will see a Queen's Speech being announced - 22 new bills, working on the people's priorities, these are the types of issues that absolutely matter to the British public."" The first Queen's Speech of Mr Johnson's premiership, delivered during the State Opening of Parliament on Monday, will see the government highlight its priorities. Mr Johnson said: ""Getting Brexit done by 31 October is absolutely crucial, and we are continuing to work on an exit deal so we can move on to negotiating a future relationship based on free trade and friendly co-operation with our European friends. ""But the people of this country don't just want us to sort out Brexit... this optimistic and ambitious Queen's Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides."" The government says the Queen's Speech will outline 22 bills including some that will introduce measures to allow the UK to ""seize the opportunities that Brexit presents"". The proposals include: An Immigration and Social Co-ordination Bill to end freedom of movement and bring in a points-based immigration system from 2021. EU citizens arriving after January 2021 would be subject to the same immigration controls as non-EU citizens, based on people's skills. The immigration status of Irish citizens will be clarified once free movement rules are removed. It would also allow for changes to current rules for access to benefits for EU nationals. Scrapping the rail franchise system - the contracting out of services introduced when the rail system was privatised in the 1990s. Reforms will focus on getting trains to run on time, a simplified fares system, a new commercial model and industry structure, and new proposals for a skilled, diverse and engaged workforce. Plans for an independent NHS investigations body with legal powers - the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) - intended to improve patient safety, and a pledge to update the Mental Health Act intended to reduce the number of detentions made under the act. An environment bill that will set legally binding targets to reduce plastics, cut air pollution, restore biodiversity and improve water quality. There are also proposals to tackle serious and violent crime, improve building standards, and increase investment in infrastructure and science. The government said if it can strike a deal with the EU, it will introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and aim to secure its passage through Parliament before 31 October. But Labour has criticised the decision to hold a Queen's Speech before any general election as a ""stunt"". Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky News: ""Having a Queen's Speech and a State Opening of Parliament tomorrow is ludicrous. What we have got in effect is a party political broadcast from the steps of the throne."" The government does not have a Commons majority but Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly is urging opposition MPs not to reject the Queen's Speech - saying they should ""put differences over Brexit aside and give Parliament the power to get our country moving forward"". Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Special sitting of Parliament and the date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal.

California bans animal fur products,"California has become the first US state to ban the manufacture and sale of animal fur. Residents will no longer be able to sell or make clothing, shoes or handbags from fur as of 2023. The move has been celebrated by animal rights groups which have been calling for a ban for some time. Governor Gavin Newsom also signed a bill banning most animals from circus shows, except cats, dogs and horses. It does not apply to rodeos. Is this the end for real fur? Prada to stop using fur from next year ""California is a leader when it comes to animal welfare and today that leadership includes banning the sale of fur,"" Mr Newsom said in a statement. The bandoes not apply to leather, cow hides and the full skin of deer, sheep and goats,external, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. It also does not apply to stuffed animals. Those found breaking the law could face a fine of $500 (Â£395) or in repeat cases, $1,000. ""We applaud Gov Newsom and the state's lawmakers for recognising that California citizens do not want their state's markets to contribute to the demand for fur products,"" a statement from Humane Society USA said. But the decision was criticised by the Fur Information Council's spokesman Keith Kaplan. He claimed it was part of a ""radical vegan agenda using fur as the first step to other bans on what we wear and eat."" Last May, fashion house Prada announced that it would stop using fur, starting with its spring-summer 2020 line.

Parents of Harry Dunn fly out to US,"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's mother Charlotte spoke to the BBC while on a plane to the US The parents of Harry Dunn say they are hopeful about meeting the US diplomat's wife who was involved in the crash that killed their son. The 19-year-old motorcyclist died in the crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas left the UK under diplomatic immunity while police were investigating her as a suspect. Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, told the BBC they were stepping in the right direction towards a meeting. Speaking on a plane to the US, where she hopes to publicise the case, she said: ""The statement from [Mrs Sacoolas's] lawyer is promising, that we may be able to hopefully get a meeting put together. ""Whether it's face-to-face or lawyer-to-lawyer, we're not really sure yet, but fingers crossed we're stepping in the right direction."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official - said in a letter from her lawyers she was ""devastated by the tragic accident"" and extended her ""deepest sympathies"" to Mr Dunn's family. Ms Charles told Sky News earlier that ""sorry doesn't cut it"" but she would not be aggressive if they were to meet. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The Foreign Office said Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity following the crash, but it no longer applied.  On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. Ms Charles said receiving the letter was ""amazing"" and described it as a ""breakthrough"". Mr Dunn's father, Tim Dunn, said he was ""shocked, but hopeful something can come of this"". Home Secretary Priti Patel told The Andrew Marr Show earlier the situation had moved on over the last 24 hours and it was ""right"" that ""co-operation takes place"". ""It is right that justice is served, that an investigation takes place, and that Anne Sacoolas actually does co-operate with investigation,"" she said. Priti Patel said it was ""right"" that ""co-operation takes place"" Northamptonshire Police said it was liaising with the Foreign Office and International Crime Co-ordination Centre about what to do next. In a statement, it said it was ""absolutely committed"" to achieving justice for the teenager and his family. A statement issued on behalf of Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband worked at RAF Croughton near the scene of the crash, said she had ""fully co-operated with the police"". It added: ""She spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to co-operate with the investigation. ""Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn's parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident."" This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they do not have British citizenship. It means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. However, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity. Read more on the Harry Dunn crash Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, with Radd Seiger (centre), who hope to visit New York and Washington DC during their trip Mr Dunn's parents have previously said they are considering civil action against Mrs Sacoolas. The family's spokesman Radd Seiger said they would be ""engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing"". Harry Dunn's Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in August On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the US was ""absolutely ruthless"" in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity. He said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Mr Dunn's family, the US was ""very reluctant"" to allow citizens to be tried abroad. Mr Raab said now that neither government deemed Mrs Sacoolas's immunity relevant, the matter was ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.

Thomas Cook collapse sends shivers across Spain,"Staff at Thomas Cook's largest subsidiary in Spain say they are the biggest victims of its demise ""We have the hotels here, open and waiting - but the customers can't get here,"" says RamÃ³n Estalella, head of Spain's leading hotelier association. The sudden collapse last month of one of Europe's biggest travel groups, Thomas Cook, ruined the holidays of 600,000 stranded tourists. Hundreds of thousands more had trips booked when the news was announced. But for parts of Spain's tourist sector, Thomas Cook's demise is also an existential threat. The economic future of industry workers and staff at Thomas Cook's local suppliers and subsidiaries is at stake. Thomas Cook: How have overseas businesses been affected? The Spanish Confederation of Hotels and Tourist Accommodation has said that 1.3 million autumn and winter visitors will be unable to fly into Spanish destinations. This will result, it says, in the shutting down of at least 500 hotels, generating losses to the tourism sector running into the hundreds of millions of euros. Spain's government has announced a package of measures worth â¬300m (Â£260m; $330m), including emergency credit lines and a reduction in airport fees, particularly for hubs in the Balearic and Canary islands, plus plans to spend â¬500m in improving tourism infrastructure. Spain's Canary Islands archipelago is preparing for its high season as a popular winter sun destination, but the Spanish government calculates that 400,000 Thomas Cook travellers will not be reaching the islands after all. Thomas Cook staff hug at an airport on the island of Majorca after word of the group's collapse The first hotel on the islands to close its doors as a result of the impact on tourism was the Fuerteventura Princess, which had an exclusive deal with Thomas Cook covering 95% of its 688 rooms up to 2023. Its 160 staff are to be laid off, a fate to be shared by at least 3,400 others in the sector, according to estimates. For Mr Estalella from Spain's CEHAT hotelier association, an immediate response is required to fill the hole left by Thomas Cook. ""They need to do something to get airlines to pick up the slack and take more slots by slashing costs. We need to take a bigger risk. Meanwhile, it's unfair that hotels are having to pay VAT on bills charged to Thomas Cook and its subsidiaries which they know they'll never be paid."" More than 700 staff at Thomas Cook's largest subsidiary in Spain say they are the biggest victims of the travel giant's crash, having not been paid since the summer and now finding themselves in a legal limbo. This video can not be played Hotel owners in Majorca are worried about what the collapse of Thomas Cook means for their livelihoods. The In Destination Incoming agency, based in Palma, Majorca, went into liquidation days after Thomas Cook ceased operations, reportedly announcing debts of a â¬57m. ""We have no guests in any resorts, but due to Spanish law we have to present ourselves at work every day to complete our 40 hours,"" one worker from Palma told the BBC on the condition of anonymity due to what she described as ""ongoing legal proceedings"". ""If we do not go, they will take it as our resignation instead of an official dismissal or redundancy, and we won't be able to claim anything at all,"" she added. A much-loved brand with humble roots Pep Ginard, of the CCOO services sector union in the Balearics, confirmed that staff at In Destination Incoming faced a ""long and difficult process"" to claim back pay and a redundancy package which, under Spanish labour laws, should be worth at least 20 days' wages per year of service. Thomas Cook's Palma Beach hotel in Spain ""We are in no man's land and have just been left. Part of our job was dealing with deaths, rapes, assaults and serious illness. We have worked extra hours with no extra pay as Thomas Cook didn't follow the new labour laws this year. All of this is for nothing,"" the worker said. Beyond the immediate impact of the Thomas Cook crash, some Spanish tourism sector leaders say there is some soul-searching to be done regarding the future of the country's biggest industry. After six years of record international tourist arrivals, reaching 82.8 million in 2018, the negative impact from Thomas Cook's collapse may lead to stagnation, with growth up to August reaching only 1.5%, according to government figures. ""There is an unsustainable level of saturation in sunshine and sand tourism, and we have to start competing on another level, in long-distance travel,"" said Juan Antonio Samaranch, a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee, speaking at an event in Madrid earlier this month. This video can not be played Staff in emotional farewell with passengers Spain saw non-European arrivals grow by close to 14% in the first half of this year, but Mr Samaranch claimed that much more could be done, especially to attract visitors from China in search of cultural experiences. According to Rafael Gallego, president of Spain's CEAV travel agency association, the Thomas Cook debacle should jog policymakers into realising that increasingly few travellers merely sign up to a package based on a destination's climate or vibes. ""People travelling today don't go so much to a place, but rather to do something specific,"" he told the newspaper El Mundo. Nowadays, he argued, tourists were looking for a product. Either active holidays such as playing golf, paragliding and diving, or more leisure-based breaks involving nature, gastronomy and cultural tourism.

"Brexit plans centre stage in Queen's SpeechMinisters say a deal with the EU is a ""priority"" as they prepare to outline their future plans.UK Politics","The Queen will outline the government's plans at the State Opening of Parliament Measures to help the UK prosper after Brexit are to be set out in the Queen's Speech, the government has said. Plans to end the free movement of EU citizens into the UK and provide faster access to medicines will be unveiled. Ministers say a Brexit deal is a ""priority"" and they hope one can be passed through Parliament ""at pace"". But the UK and EU are still involved in talks ahead of a key summit - with a Downing Street source saying they were ""a long way from a final deal"". Queen's Speech 2019: What can we expect? Amnesty for veterans 'won't be in Queen's speech' Irish border 'an afterthought' during Brexit campaign Brexit jargon explained The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October and the European leaders' summit next Thursday and Friday is being seen as the last chance to agree any deal before that deadline. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson updated his cabinet on the progress of the talks in Brussels on Sunday, saying he believed there was a ""way forward"" but also ""a significant amount of work"" to do. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she believed it was important for people to see Parliament delivering on the issues that matter to them. She said: ""Tomorrow you will see a Queen's Speech being announced - 22 new bills, working on the people's priorities, these are the types of issues that absolutely matter to the British public."" The first Queen's Speech of Mr Johnson's premiership, delivered during the State Opening of Parliament on Monday, will see the government highlight its priorities. Mr Johnson said: ""Getting Brexit done by 31 October is absolutely crucial, and we are continuing to work on an exit deal so we can move on to negotiating a future relationship based on free trade and friendly co-operation with our European friends. ""But the people of this country don't just want us to sort out Brexit... this optimistic and ambitious Queen's Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides."" The government says the Queen's Speech will outline 22 bills including some that will introduce measures to allow the UK to ""seize the opportunities that Brexit presents"". The proposals include: An Immigration and Social Co-ordination Bill to end freedom of movement and bring in a points-based immigration system from 2021. EU citizens arriving after January 2021 would be subject to the same immigration controls as non-EU citizens, based on people's skills. The immigration status of Irish citizens will be clarified once free movement rules are removed. It would also allow for changes to current rules for access to benefits for EU nationals. Scrapping the rail franchise system - the contracting out of services introduced when the rail system was privatised in the 1990s. Reforms will focus on getting trains to run on time, a simplified fares system, a new commercial model and industry structure, and new proposals for a skilled, diverse and engaged workforce. Plans for an independent NHS investigations body with legal powers - the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) - intended to improve patient safety, and a pledge to update the Mental Health Act intended to reduce the number of detentions made under the act. An environment bill that will set legally binding targets to reduce plastics, cut air pollution, restore biodiversity and improve water quality.

SNP gathers amid pressure over indy strategy,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said she favoured replacing Boris Johnson's Tory government with a ""progressive-style alliance"" Nicola Sturgeon has told Jeremy Corbyn not to ""bother picking up the phone"" to ask the SNP to put him in government unless he backs an independence vote. The Scottish first minister said she was in favour of removing Boris Johnson from office and holding an election. But she said her backing for a future ""progressive alliance"" government relied on a deal to hold a referendum. Ms Sturgeon also said she would seek UK government consent this year to hold a new independence vote. Mr Corbyn has said he does not think a new independence poll is ""a good idea"", but has not ruled out allowing one. Ms Sturgeon wants to hold a new vote in the second half of 2020, but has yet to ask UK ministers for the required ""section 30"" request to allow it. She said it was not yet clear who the prime minister would be at that point. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that she would be willing to oust the Conservatives in favour of a ""progressive-type alliance"", but warned Mr Corbyn to not ""even bother picking up the phone to me"" unless he accepted ""Scotland's right to choose our own future"". SNP formally backs decriminalisation of drugs SNP conference: Three questions facing the party SNP election win 'could be independence mandate' Sturgeon: 'No shortcut route to independence' Ms Sturgeon's comments come as the SNP gathers in Aberdeen for its autumn conference, and at a pivotal moment in UK politics and the Brexit process. Boris Johnson has repeatedly challenged other parties to support a snap general election, but opposition leaders want to rule out a no-deal Brexit first - and are divided on whether a fresh EU referendum should come before an election. The SNP leader told Andrew Marr she was ""ruling nothing out"" in the coming weeks, but said an election would be the most realistic outcome due to the difficulty of leaving an interim government in place throughout a referendum campaign. Mr Corbyn has said he would not allow an independence referendum in the ""formative years"" of a Labour government Should an election not produce a clear winner, Ms Sturgeon said the SNP ""will not put the Tories in office and are not in favour of coalitions"". However, she warned that votes from her MPs - currently the third-largest group at Westminster - would be contingent on the new prime minister giving the green light to an independence referendum. She said: ""We would favour a progressive-type alliance, but I would say this to Jeremy Corbyn or any Westminster leader who's looking to the SNP for support - if you don't accept Scotland's right to choose our own future, at the time of our own choosing, don't even bother picking up the phone to me."" Mr Corbyn has previously said Labour would not actively stand in the way of ""indyref2"", but has indicatedhe would seek to delay it. He said he would not agree to a vote ""in the formative years of a Labour government"", while focusing on ""central priorities"" such as ""sorting the Tory Brexit nightmare"" and pursuing ""transformative investment in Scotland's people, communities and public services"". This approach could see the independence vote pushed back beyond Ms Sturgeon's preferred timetable in 2020, and past the Holyrood elections in 2021. A ""section 30"" agreement is the same legal mechanism used to facilitate the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon said she would make a section 30 request ""over the next matter of weeks - it is coming soon. But we don't yet know who is likely to be in Downing Street - the situation is very fluid, and that is why I've chosen to do the preparations that are within our control and we're getting on with that."" Some supporters of independence have called for a ""plan b"" for securing independence The current UK government has repeatedly refused to countenance allowing a new independence vote, with Home Secretary Priti Patel telling the same programme that ministers were determined to ""respect the result of referendums that took place previously"". This has led some SNP members - including MPs, MSPs and councillors - to call for a ""plan B"", such as securing a majority in an election or holding an unauthorised poll. However, Ms Sturgeon ruled out such an approach, saying a legal and constitutional referendum was the only way forward. She said: ""If I thought there was any quicker way, an easier way, a plan B that would get us there quicker, I would have taken it by now. ""What we have to do is have a process that allows us to demonstrate that there is majority support in Scotland for independence, and we have to have a process that is legal and accepted, otherwise our independence will not be recognised."" At the conference in Aberdeen, an attempt to add a debate on ""plan B"" to the agenda was voted down overwhelmingly. Earlier, the party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told delegates that the SNP had prepared a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson and his government. Mr Blackford said the only way to put an end to the ""chaos"" was to have a general election. He called on the leaders of the other opposition parties to act with the SNP, although he didn't specify when they would bring the motion in Parliament.

Japan counts cost of biggest typhoon in decades,"Helicopters rescued people trapped in their homes when the Chikuma river burst its banks At least nine people are reported dead as Japan recovers from its biggest storm in decades. Typhoon Hagibis triggered floods and landslides as it battered the country with wind speeds of 225km/h (140mph). Rivers have breached their banks in at least 14 different places, inundating residential neighbourhoods. The storm led to some Rugby World Cup matches being cancelled but a key fixture between Japan and Scotland will go ahead on Sunday. Hagibis is heading north and is expected to move back into the North Pacific later on Sunday. In pictures: Typhoon Hagibis hits Japan It made landfall on Saturday shortly before 19:00 local time (10:00 GMT), in Izu Peninsula, south-west of Tokyo and moved up the east coast. Almost half a million homes were left without power. In the town of Hakone near Mount Fuji more than 1m (3ft) of rain fell on Friday and Saturday, the highest total ever recorded in Japan over 48 hours. This video can not be played More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes Further north in Nagano prefecture, levees along the Chikuma river gave way sending water rushing through residential areas, inundating houses. Flood defences around Tokyo have held and river levels are now falling, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Japan. Officials said some of those killed were swept away by landslides while others were trapped in their cars as floodwaters rose. Another 15 people are listed as missing and dozens are reported injured. More than seven million people were urged to leave their homes as the huge storm approached, but it is thought only 50,000 stayed in shelters. Many residents stocked up on provisions before the typhoon's arrival, leaving supermarkets with empty shelves. Torrential rain has caused rivers to flood huge areas A huge clean-up operation was under way in Kawasaki near Tokyo ""Unprecedented heavy rain has been seen in cities, towns and villages for which the emergency warning was issued,"" Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) forecaster Yasushi Kajiwara told a press briefing. Many bullet train services were halted, and several lines on the Tokyo metro were suspended for most of Saturday.

Tornado-like winds whipped up by the typhoon struck east of Tokyo Andrew Higgins, an English teacher who lives in Tochigi, north of Tokyo, told the BBC he had ""lived through a few typhoons"" during seven years in Japan. ""I feel like this time Japan, generally, has taken this typhoon a lot more seriously,"" he said. ""People were out preparing last night. A lot of people were stocking up."" Only last month Typhoon Faxai wreaked havoc on parts of Japan, damaging 30,000 homes, most of which have not yet been repaired. ""I evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. I'm so worried about my house,"" a 93-year-old man told NHK, from a shelter in Tateyama, Chiba.

'I had an interest in school - but zero help',"This video can not be played Kai's mum Debbie Bendall said dealing with the problem has reduced her to tears The experiences of a 14-year-old boy, whose social anxiety disorder has led to him missing school for much of the academic year, have prompted others to come forward to share their stories. Kai, from Chesterfield, has a condition known as school refusal, but his mother Debbie Bendall said he was treated like a truant and the family had faced threats of fines over his non-attendance. Since Kai's story was published, a number of people have come forward to tell similar stories of how their conditions affected their school life. Ms Bendall said she shared the family's story to help others and had been inundated with messages of support from parents going through the same difficulties. ""Too many people are quick to judge and don't recognise the bigger picture,"" she said. ""There is a lack of empathy... but it's good that we've got the issue out there."" Jon Ward, pictured during his school years, said he never connected his school attendance problems with his anxiety until he read Kai's story After reading Kai's story, Jon Ward, 60, from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, realised he had experienced the same condition in the late 1960s and early '70s. ""It could have been me. I did all of those things,"" he said. ""I never really thought school was anything to do with [my anxiety]. No-one gave it a thought."" Mr Ward, who married in 1986 and has a daughter, said he enjoyed learning but found many aspects of school ""stressful"" and did anything to avoid it. His mother would usually write him sick notes for PE, but on one occasion she refused. It was a decision that could have ended in tragedy because Jon responded by taking a bottle of painkillers to the garden shed. ""I swallowed the whole lot,"" he said. ""I laid down and thought I would die."" Thankfully he woke up but, still faced with the prospect of school, he ""skived off"" and visited the library instead where he could relax and read. ""No-one ever discussed anything about mental health,"" he said. ""I was seen as a rebel but I did have an interest in school. There was zero help."" Jon Ward and his wife Rowena Harry (not his real name), who is 14, was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at the age of six and autism at nine. He has not been to school at all since February 2018, which has led to his mother, a trained social worker, being taken to court and fined. When Harry started high school in 2016, his mother said she was led to believe he would get the support he needed but it never materialised and after the half-term break he started refusing to go to school. She said her son had pathological demand avoidance - a behaviour profile within the autistic spectrum - which meant he needed to be in ""control of everything"". Harry's mum said she has given up re-plastering the walls As a result, the demands of school on her son had the ""coke bottle effect"", she said, with everything shaken up in the day before being released at home. ""Trying to get him to conform causes anxiety which manifests itself as aggression,"" she said. ""I have been physically attacked, had TVs, windows, doors smashed. [I have given] up re-plastering all the holes in his bedroom wall."" She said her parenting had been blamed but she believed his behaviour was because he ""couldn't cope in a mainstream classroom"". After years of trying, she has succeeded in getting an Education, Health and Care Plan, intended for children who needed more support than was available, for Harry - but it had come at a cost. He has largely missed two years of education and as his mother had been unable to work she was at risk of losing her home because of the loss of earnings. However, Harry has since started on a foundation learning programme in animal studies and horticulture and his mum said she hoped this would get him back into a routine. The mother of a 10-year-old told the BBC his journey through the education system had been ""shambolic"". Sarah said Charlie (not their real names) was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of four and subsequently with a number of other problems, including high anxiety levels and sleep issues. He has been out of school completely for about a year. Sarah said Charlie found it hard to process what he was being taught in class and without one-to-one support he struggled, which led to him not wanting to go to school. His school refusal ""pulled her world apart"" leading to her splitting from her husband and having to give up her career as a marketing director to care for her son full-time. ""I would drive him there and he would be kicking at the windscreen and taking his seat belt off,"" Sarah said. ""[On arrival] the teachers would just say 'well, he's here now'."" Sarah said she would often be told Charlie was ""fine"" and that she was an ""overbearing parent"" who should ""toughen up"". But she said it was the schools Charlie attended that had failed to recognise or accept his disabilities and special needs. Charlie would ""explode"" following a day at school, sometimes becoming ""violent"" and ""withdrawn"" and even ""self-harming"", Sarah said. ""The damage to me and him has been immense and there are thousands of us,"" she said. Sarah remains positive, however, and has managed to secure funding to get Charlie some private tuition. Harry enjoys learning says his mother, but cannot cope in a classroom Mind said children experiencing social anxiety disorder or school refusal experienced emotional distress about attending school. Fran Morgan runs a parent-led organisation called Square Peg that aims to bring about national change for families experiencing these problems. She said there could be a ""variety of different scenarios"" for a child's school refusal and ""no two cases will be the same"", adding that many parents have been fined and prosecuted, while others have been investigated by social services. ""These children want to go to school and their parents want that too, it's just that they can't,"" she said. Harry and Charlie's mums have both worked with Not Fine in School, a similar organisation supporting the families of children struggling with school attendance, which has about 8,000 members on its closedFacebook Group for parents,external. Not Fine in School and Square Peg both said they wanted the government to recognise the challenges many parents faced and have called for an overhaul of the attendance system with more help for children who are struggling. The two organisations have also called for the accountability of schools and local authorities to be improved. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""The advice to schools is clear, they should authorise absences due to illness, related to both physical and mental health.""

How Glasgow pulled together to solve a 'dognapping',"Kirsteen's daughter Tess was delighted to see her pet again A stolen dog has been reunited with its owners after a social media campaign brought together a Glasgow community to track down the missing pet. Six-year-old Shih Tau Bichon cross Blake was stolen from outside a shop in the Gorbals area at 21:25 on Monday. Owner Kirsteen Marshall turned to social media and launched the Bring Blake Home appeal to find him. In just over 48 hours she and her friends had tracked him down at a house in another part of the city. Blake was reunited with his owners at 02:00 on Thursday. Ms Marshall, 34, said ""an army"" of friends, family and members of the public had helped find her prized pet. CCTV image of a man walking towards the shop where Blake was stolen In a message to the thief, she said: ""Wrong dog, wrong community, wrong city. We did this the old school way and it worked."" Blake was stolen from a Nisa store on Ballater Street in the Gorbals area on Monday evening. The following day Ms Marshall started her Bring Blake Home appeal on social media. She said: ""This is a message to the people that took Blake. In only 24 hours we have managed to access numerous CCTV footage which shows very clearly the man who took him."" Kirsteen Marshall made an appeal on social media Mr Marshall added: ""I need you to know that I am not interested in you being charged or persecuted or hurt in any way but I also need you to know that we have an army of social media friends who are helping to bring Blake home. ""And we have the amazing people of Glasgow who are behind this."" She said she thought the man who took Blake wanted to sell him, and offered a Â£5,000 reward for his safe return - ""way more money than he is worth"". In other posts, Ms Marshall released CCTV footage, including an image of a man walking to the shop and another of a man carrying Blake away. At 02:00 on Thursday, Blake was recovered from a property in the Possil area of the city. Kirsteen is reunited with Blake Ms Marshall said: ""This was honestly like that Liam Neeson film, Taken. ""We were blown away by the support on social media. For three days I was inundated with messages of support. ""We spent a lot of time out in the street speaking to people and asking for CCTV. Every message we got meant that we were pointed in a certain direction and we could eliminate other things."" She added: ""We pieced the puzzle together and knew he was in Possil and we were closing in. Then out of the blue, I got a message saying: 'I have your dog'."" She thanked everyone who helped spread the word and share her posts. She promised to return all donations made to a fundraising page, or pass them on to an animal charity. She told BBC Scotland news: ""I am exhausted. I haven't slept in 50 hours. ""But I am so relieved and over the moon that Blake is home with us."" A Police Scotland spokeswoman confirmed a dog was reported stolen on Monday evening from Ballater Street and that officers were carrying out inquiries. She said: ""Information was passed to officers in the early hours of Thursday, 10 October, regarding the potential location of the dog. ""Officers passed on advice to the owner regarding their safety and the call was given an appropriate priority based on other ongoing incidents and operational demand. ""We fully appreciate the distress that this incident will have caused. Officers continue to investigate and are following a positive line of inquiry in connection with this.""

'Witnesses' appeal over woman's US return,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The lawyer for the family of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash has appealed for ""witnesses"" to the suspect's return to the United States. Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat, left the UK despite being a suspect in the fatal crash with Harry Dunn, 19, on 27 August. The US government has not waived Mrs Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity. Lawyer Radd Seiger asked for those with information ""before, during, or after her departure"" to come forward. Mr Dunn's parents, who have previously said they areconsidering civil actionagainst Mrs Sacoolas, are set to fly out to the US on Sunday and will visit both New York and Washington DC. Mr Seiger said they would be ""engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing"". On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said his administration would speak to Mrs Sacoolas ""very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet"". This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" But a briefing note held by Mr Trump at the press conference appeared to suggest Mrs Sacoolaswould not be returning to the UKafter being granted diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the US's apparent approach was ""beyond any realm of human thinking"". His father Tim Dunn said: ""We have to go to America and speak to the American people. We can't let this be swept under the carpet."" Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? Crash death parents 'let down' by governments PM's plea to US to rethink immunity over crash Radd Seiger (centre) has invited President Trump to meet Harry Dunn's parents The family met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday, which they have since described as a ""publicity stunt"". Afterwards Mr Raab said the justice process was ""not being allowed to properly run its course"". Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police Nick Adderley said the investigation into the crash was ""carrying on"" and that a file would be passed to the Crown Prosecution Service soon. Mr Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash at about 20:30 BST near the RAF base at Croughton in Northamptonshire, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan had been working. Police have said CCTV of the crash in which the teenager died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road.

Parents 'let down' by governments,"This video can not be played Dunn family on Raab meeting: ""We feel let down"" The family at the centre of a row over diplomatic immunity after their son died in a car crash described a meeting with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab as feeling like a ""publicity stunt"". Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. American diplomat's wife Anne Sacoolas, suspected of driving the other vehicle, later left the UK to return to the US. Boris Johnson has spoken to President Trump who told a press briefing Harry's death was a ""terrible accident"". This video can not be played Trump says fatal car crash by diplomat's wife was 'accident' Police have said CCTV of the crash which killed the teenager shows the Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road. Speaking after his conversation with the prime minister, President Trump said: ""The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. ""You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. ""So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet. ""It was an accident, it was a terrible accident."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo After meeting the foreign secretary, Harry's mother Charlotte Charles said  she felt ""let down"" by both the UK and US governments. She said: ""I can't really see the point as to why we were invited to see Dominic Raab. We are no further forward than where we were this time last week. ""Part of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK Government side to show they are trying to help. ""But, although he is engaging with us, we have no answers. We are really frustrated that we could spend half an hour or more with him and just come out with nothing."" Together with Harry's father Tim Dunn, she met Mr Raab in the hope he would urge the US to waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn said: ""I felt extremely let down by the Government today, or by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. ""I'm deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it's okay to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away. ""I don't think the government or the Commonwealth Office have any clout to do anything."" Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles felt there was little point to their meeting with the foreign secretary Number 10 said the Prime Minister urged US President Donald Trump to reconsider the decision to allow Ms Sacoolas immunity in order that ""the individual involved can return to the UK, cooperate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice"". Downing Street said the ""leaders agreed to work together to find a way forward as soon as possible"" during their conversation on Wednesday evening. Following the meeting with Harry's parents, the foreign secretary said: ""I share the frustration of Harry's mother and father. ""They have lost their son and the justice process is not being allowed to properly run its course."" Meanwhile, Ms Charles urged Ms Sacoolas to do the ""humane thing to do and get on a plane and come back"". Crash death mother 'will appeal to US president' Police urge US to waive crash suspect's immunity What is diplomatic immunity? Their lawyer Radd Seiger said they were in talks to launch a civil case against Ms Sacoolas and they were ""going to Washington soon to help us get that justice for Harry"". He also invited the US President to meet the family about the case. ""If meeting with President Trump would help us get a step closer to seek justice for Harry, to get justice for that boy who died that night needlessly, one of the most wonderful kids in our community, if that's what it takes then I will extend an invitation now to President Trump. ""Meet us. Let's have a chat. Nobody wants to litigate."" Mr Johnson had already urged the USto reconsider its decision to allow Ms Sacoolas immunity, while Mr Raab has previously spoken to the US ambassador and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Northamptonshire's chief constable and its police and crime commissioner have also urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Drivers, cooks and other support staff whose names do not appear, but have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity as those who are listed. Equally, there are a number of foreign nationals in Britain attached to international organizations who have the same status and protection. Harry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 in Croughton, close to an RAF base. He was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died. Chief Constable Nick Adderley said ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"".
