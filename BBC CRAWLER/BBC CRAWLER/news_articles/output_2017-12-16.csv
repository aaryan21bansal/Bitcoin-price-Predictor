US secret UFO programme revealed,"The Pentagon has been running a secret multi-million dollar programme to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), US media report. Only a small number of officials were aware of the programme, which began in 2007 and was reportedly closed in 2012. The New York Times says documents from the operation describe strange speeding aircraft and hovering objects.,external But scientists were doubtful, stressing that unexplained happenings were not necessarily proof of alien life. CIA releases 13m pages of declassified documents The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Programme was the brainchild of Harry Reid, a retired Democratic senator who was the Senate majority leader at the time. He told the New York Times: ""I'm not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going. I've done something that no one has done before."" Mr Reid - former senator for Nevada, home to the mythologised ""Area 51"" classified US Air Force base - later tweeted that the programme was a serious effort to get to truth amid ""plenty of evidence to support asking the questions"".

The programme is reported to have cost the Department of Defense more than $20 million (Â£15m) before it was shut down in order to save costs.

Shopper footfall down 'significantly',"The number of people out shopping in the UK in the first two weeks of December fell ""significantly"" compared to last year, retail researchers say. Analysis firm Springboard found a 4.9% decrease in footfall at shopping centres, retail parks and high streets. Bad weather and rise in online shopping were both factors in the decline, according to Diane Wehrle. The figures come as a retail analyst said it expected shops to make big discounts in the week before Christmas. Consultancy firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) said it was anticipating more retailers to be discounting in the week leading up to Christmas than during the Black Friday weekend. Springboard's analysis for this month - up to 14 December - showed that the number of people visiting shops compared to the same period last year fell by 4.9% - almost three times the 1.7% decrease in 2016. Ms Wehrle said last week's snow had a ""clear impact"" on footfall, but was just one of a number of factors. She said: ""The reasons are associated with budgetary constraints, due to inflation and the recent interest rate rise, but also due to the heavy discounting in November. ""Black Friday pulled spending forward, thereby impacting on customer activity in December. And of course all of this is set against a backdrop of a continuing rise in online spending."" She added that while online spending accounts for about 15% of total retail spending, it is rising approximately 10% year on year. Meanwhile, PwC said it expected retailers to make big discounts in the final week before Christmas to convince shoppers to keep spending throughout the festive period. The firm has analysed the number of promotions advertised in shops and online during November and December for the past seven years. It found that many of the retailers offering promotions during the Black Friday weekend in late November returned to full price sales by the beginning of December, before relaunching discounts in the lead up to Christmas. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: ""As we rapidly approach Christmas itself, we are already seeing an uptick in promotional activity as retailers try to attract customers through their doors and clear festive stock."" Earlier this week it was revealed thatBlack Friday helped retail sales to grow by 1.1% last month- despite average prices rising faster than average wages. By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam The six weeks from the end of November to the start of January account for up to half of any major retailer's annual profits. Have a bad Christmas, and you'll have a bad year. Add in falling real incomes because inflation is high and wage growth is modest, and retailers are especially nervous this year. So that's why some of them are offering decent discounts in the very fortnight before Christmas that they need to maximise their margins (profits). And the reason? Competition. The rivalry on - and offline - between retailers is intense. No flash sale by a large company, will go unmatched by its rivals. And consumers, thanks to the internet, are now increasingly aware of sudden discounting. So bargains don't go a-begging.

Five traced over fatal hit-and-run,"The victim was hit on a pedestrian crossing on the South Circular Road Five drivers who may have been involved in a hit-and-run which killed a woman in south London have all been traced. The 29-year-old Polish national was hit by a lorry on a pedestrian crossing on Norwood Road, Tulse Hill, on Monday. It is thought she was then struck by another lorry and up to three cars. None of the drivers stopped at the crash site, the Met said. The identity of the victim, who was staying in Wandsworth, has not yet been released. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple injuries. The 49-year-old driver of the first lorry was interviewed under caution earlier in the week. The driver of the second car - a 52-year-old man - was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and released under investigation. Police said the drivers of the first car and second lorry have now been spoken to, as has the driver of a third car which officers believe may also have struck the woman. None of the three have been arrested. The force is appealing for witnesses to the crash, which happened at about 06:50 GMT and when the lights were on green. Acting Det Sgt Alastair Middleton, said: ""Even though we have traced all the vehicles that we believe were involved, I continue to appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision and the moments afterwards to contact us immediately. ""We are particularly interested in any dashcam footage that may have captured some of the incident before or after the collision.""

Wildfire prompts Santa Barbara evacuationStrong winds drive the Thomas fire - now California's third-biggest on record - towards the coast.1h39 minutes agoUS & Canada,"Firefighters are dropping red flame retardant to try to quench the flames Authorities in California have issued new evacuation orders as a huge wildfire flares up again in Santa Barbara County. Meteorologists said fresh northerly winds were likely to drive the flames from the fire - named Thomas - towards the Pacific coast. The blaze, the state's third largest on record, has now burnt almost 1,000 sq km (405 sq miles) since 4 December. Two people are reported to have died as a result of the fire. Fire apparatus engineer Cory Iverson was killed tackling the blaze last week, along with a woman, Virginia Rae Pesola, who was in a car crash as she evacuated. Governor brands fires 'new normal' Sentinel satellite tracks wildfire smoke plume The resurgence of strong ""sundowner"" winds combined with low humidity forecast for Sunday could fuel the flames and has prompted new mandatory evacuation orders for several Santa Barbara communities, including hillside homes in Montecito and Summerland.

"Stop infighting, SA's Zuma tells party","Mr Zuma said his ANC party was at a ""crossroads"" South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has called on the African National Congress (ANC) to stop infighting as it decides who will next lead the party. Mr Zuma warned the future of the ANC was under threat, with South Africans ""not happy"" with it. The main contenders to succeed him are the deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, President Zuma's ex-wife. Whoever wins is likely to succeed Mr Zuma as South African president. But their bitter leadership battle has raised fears that the ANC could split before national elections in 2019. President Zuma can remain head of state until those elections. He has been in office since 2009 and South Africa limits the presidency to two five-year terms. The leadership contest is expected to be a close one, with legal challenges a possibility. Who are the main candidates? Why ANC leadership vote matters The trials of Jacob Zuma Addressing delegates at the beginning of a gathering to decide the next ANC leader, Mr Zuma said their movement was at a ""crossroads"". ""Petty squabbling that takes us nowhere needs to take back seat, our people are frustrated when we spend more time fighting among ourselves instead of solving the daily challenges they experience,"" he said. Last year's disappointing results for the ANC in local elections, Mr Zuma said, ""were a stark reminder that our people are not happy with the state of the ANC"". The leading candidates are Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa President Zuma, 75, has been the focus of much controversy and has survived several votes of no confidence in parliament. He faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. In his final speech as ANC president, he asserted that ""theft and corruption"" were as prominent in the private sector as they are in government. He added that ""being black and successful is being made synonymous to being corrupt"". He lashed out at the media, which he said was not ""impartial and fair"". He also targeted the judiciary, arguing that the courts should have no role in deciding internal party matters. For the leadership, President Zuma is backing his 68-year-old former wife, Ms Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran politician in her own right who has been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businesses. This video can not be played What advice should South Africa's ruling party take on board? Mr Ramaphosa, 65, has spoken out strongly against state corruption and has the backing of the business community. Recent news that he had a modest lead in the polls was quickly reflected by a rise in the financial markets. Lebo Diseko, Johannesburg, BBC News Jacob Zuma came out fighting in his speech, hitting out at his critics both inside and outside the party. It seemed like no one was spared - from ANC members who voted with the opposition to try and remove him, alliance partners who have booed him and called on him to stand down, to ""counter-revolutionary forces"" he said were intent on reversing the progress made since 1994, when apartheid was brought to an end. Indeed, that idea of malevolent forces working to bring down both him and the ANC was a thread that ran right through his speech. Mr Zuma placed his fight against his opponents within the wider framework of the fight against apartheid. He ended his speech by saying ""I tried my best"", and of those who tried to bring him down ""I bear no grudges"". He then led the room in song. This was Jacob Zuma in his element: a rousing speaker, a fierce opponent, delivering cutting rebukes with charm and charisma. More than 5,000 delegates are taking part in the four-day ANC elective conference at the Expo Centre in Johannesburg. A vote on the new leader is expected on Sunday. The first major engagement for the new leader will be the party's anniversary celebrations on 8 January. The ANC has governed South Africa since the first democratic election more than 20 years ago. The BBC's Andrew Harding says a question remains whether the ANC is in terminal decline, and what that might mean for South Africa's stability and its future.

Rocket rumbles give volcanic insights,"An ""upside down volcano"" (L) and an ""upside down rocket"" (R) What do volcanoes and rockets have in common? ""Volcanoes have a nozzle aimed at the sky, and rockets have a nozzle aimed at the ground,"" explains Steve McNutt, a geosciences professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa. It explains why he and colleague Dr Glenn Thompson have installed the tools normally used to study eruptions at the famous Kennedy Space Center. Comparing the different types of rumblings could yield new insights. In the case of rockets, the team thinks their seismometers and infrasound (low-frequency acoustic waves) detectors might potentially be used by the space companies as a different type of diagnostic tool, to better understand the performance of their vehicles; or perhaps as a way to identify missiles in flight. In the case of volcanoes, the idea is to take the lessons learned at Kennedy and fine-tune the algorithms used to interpret what is happening in an eruption. It might even be possible to develop systems that give early warnings of some of the dangerous debris flows associated with volcanoes. This video can not be played Glenn Thompson and Steve McNutt: ""Kennedy has strong signals to test equipment "" ""It all started really as a way to test and calibrate our equipment,"" says Glenn. ""We don't have any volcanoes in South Florida - obviously. But Kennedy provided some strong sources, and it also gave our students the opportunity to learn how to deploy stations and work with the data."" The team has now recorded the seismic and acoustic signals emanating from about a dozen rockets. Most have been associated with launches; a few have been related to what are called static fire tests, in which the engines on a clamped vehicle are briefly ignited to check they are flight-ready. But perhaps the most fascinating event captured so far was the SpaceX pad explosion in September 2016. This saw a Falcon 9 rocket suffer a catastrophic failure as it was being fuelled. Many people will have seen the video of the spectacular fireball. ButGlenn's and Steve's equipment caught information not apparent in that film,external. This video can not be played The moment the SpaceX rocket exploded For example, they detected more than 150 separate sub-events in the infrasound over the course of 26 minutes. These were likely individual tanks, pipes or other components bursting into flames. Of course, the SpaceX explosion was an unusual occurrence, and it is the more routine activity that most interests the team. And some clear patterns are starting to emerge in their study of ""upside down volcanoes"". ""As the rocket gets higher and higher and accelerates, we see a decrease in the frequency in the infrasound - that's basically a Doppler shift because the source is moving away from us,"" says Steve. ""And then you get a coupling of the signal in the air into the ground and this produces seismic waves recorded on the seismometer. ""So, we get some common features between the infrasound and the seismometer, but then there's a little separation of the energy between the two."" A deadly pyroclastic flow heads down the flanks of the SoufriÃ¨re Hills volcano in Montserrat There is a lot still to learn, but the pair think they can distinguish the different types of rockets - to tell a Falcon from an Atlas from a Delta. There are subtle but significant divergences in their spectral signatures, which almost certainly reflect their distinct designs and modes of operation. Where in particular the rockets could have instruction for volcano monitoring is in describing moving sources. A rocket is a very well understood physical process. Its properties and parameters - such as the size of the nozzle orifice, the thrust, the trajectory and the distance - are all precisely known. The related seismic and acoustic signals should therefore serve as templates to help decipher some of the features of eruptions that share similar behaviours. Good examples of rapid movement in the volcano setting are the big mass surges like pyroclastic flows (descending clouds of hot ash/rock) and lahars (mud/ash avalanches). An objective of the team is to improve seismometer and infrasound systems' characterisation of these dangerous phenomena. This could lead to useful alerts being sent to people who live around volcanoes. ""Assuming you can find a few safe places to put your instruments that are reasonably close, you'd get your advance warning,"" said Steve. ""What you'd be doing then is getting the time and the strength of the signal and then watching it evolve to figure out which direction it's going. ""If you can do that successfully then you can forecast with a couple of minutes in advance things like lahars and pyroclastic flows downstream."" Glenn added: ""I worked on [the Caribbean island of] Montserrat during the crisis from 1995 to 2011, and we did have a rudimentary system even then for tracking the pyroclastic density currents coming down the slopes of the volcano. ""It wasn't quite a real-time application, but we hope with this kind of work that we can improve those algorithms and make them more of an automated alarm system."" The equipment at Kennedy has been temporary, but the team is looking for a permanent installation. Like everyone, Glenn and Steve are particularly looking forward to the launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy vehicle in the New Year. The Heavy should produce nearly 23 meganewtons of thrust at lift-off, more than any rocket in operation today. It is sure to make for some interesting seismic and infrasound signals.

Smith humiliates England at the WacaSteve Smith and Mitchell Marsh put Australia in control of the third Ashes Test with huge centuries.11h11 hours agoBBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Australia pile on the punishment on day three Third Ashes Test, Waca (day three of five) England 403 (115.1 overs):Malan 140, Bairstow 119, Starc 4-91 Australia 549-4 (152 overs):Smith 229*, M Marsh 181*, Overton 2-102 Australia lead by 146 runs Scorecard Australia captain Steve Smith struck a magnificent double century and Mitchell Marsh a huge hundred of his own to demoralise England on the third day of the third Ashes Test in Perth. The fifth-wicket pair shared a stand of 301 as Australia racked up 549-4 at the Waca, a lead of 146. Smith - who made 141 not out in his side's first-Test win in Brisbane - batted throughout the day, moving from his overnight 92 to an unbeaten 229, his highest Test score. Marsh, on his return to the side, compiled his maiden Test ton on his home ground and was 181 not out at the close. England managed only one wicket all day - their attack wholehearted but lacking the tools to be incisive on a flat pitch and under scorching sunshine. Australia's remorselessness - they added 346 to their overnight 203-3 -  highlighted the tourists' profligacy on the second day, when they lost six wickets for 35 runs to slip from 368-4 to 403 all out. Steve Smith's innings has now lasted more than nine hours At 2-0 down, England must avoid defeat on a ground where they have not won since 1978 if they are to avoid surrendering the Ashes at the earliest possible opportunity. With the chance of victory now looking slim, it is likely they will have to bat for much of the fourth and fifth days in order to save the game. The pitch is only showing occasional signs of wear and there is rain forecast for Sunday and Monday - but they are only small crumbs of comfort for an England side who will have to face the fierce Australia attack after the best part of two days in the field. 'Guts and determination' needed to keep Ashes alive Reaction and analysis to third day's play Podcast - Is Smith the best since Bradman? Such was Smith's comfort, calmness and composure, a massive score seemed inevitable both when he arrived at the crease on Friday and again when he resumed on Saturday. It was chanceless and ruthless from the skipper, who moved his batting average to 62.89, second to only the great Donald Bradman on the all-time list. He reached his 22nd Test century in the fifth over of the day by clipping James Anderson through mid-wicket and, even then, there was the sense he was just getting started. Twice Anderson asked for a review, once when the ball was missing leg stump and again after what was revealed to be a no-ball - and it would not have been given out in any case. As on the second day, the off-side scoring was a feature of Smith's play as he became the first captain for 24 years to score a double hundred in an Ashes Test. His celebrations on reaching 200 were animated and, by the close, he had 416 runs in the series at an average of 208. How good is Smith and how do you get him out? Marsh had played 21 previous Tests and averaged only 21 with the bat before being recalled to replace the out-of-form Peter Handscomb and give Australia an all-round option. He entered after brother Shaun edged the off-spin of Moeen Ali to slip with the hosts still 155 behind and the second new ball looming. The closest he came to offering an opportunity was an uppish drive towards mid-on off Craig Overton when he was on only one. Patient and powerful, Marsh played drives down the ground and on both sides, as well some scything cut shots. His century was reached with a square drive off Stuart Broad, his celebration an emotional run towards the dressing room. As Smith was becalmed in the evening, Marsh accelerated and will be eyeing a double century when play gets back under way at 02:30 GMT on Sunday. England took just one wicket on the third day in Perth England did not bowl badly. At times they looked short of inspiration and their ground fielding was sometimes ragged - but that can be expected in such circumstances. It was a day that further highlighted the limitations of their attack. Though Anderson and Broad have more than 900 Test wickets between them, England do not have the pace or quality spin to make openings when the conditions are hot and flat. In eight consecutive away Tests - here and in India - the lowest first-innings total England have conceded is 328. On every other occasion the opposition have gone past 400. The tourists went through numerous plans. Over and round the wicket, sometimes with as many as six men on the leg side. If anything, they did not spend enough time settled on a traditional line and length. There was no lack of effort, though. Overton even bowled with a hairline crack of the rib, suffered when he was hit while batting in the second Test and aggravated when diving on Friday. Smith and Marsh were simply immovable - and England had no answers. England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on BT Sport:""Everybody has got to get stuck in, stand up and fight and scrap in the second innings. ""Until the Test match finishes, we have to believe you can get something out of it. ""It's going to be hard, but it is Test cricket. The best teams find a way to compete when their backs are against the wall. Now we need to show we have got character, we have got guts."" Mitchell Marsh also has a one-day international hundred to his name, against India in Sydney in 2016 Mitchell Marsh, speaking to ABC about his maiden century:""It's taken me 22 Tests. I wasn't really nervous. I felt calm and that kept me going. I wasn't thinking about too much. Anything wide, I was just going to slash at. ""You aspire to do that every game you play for Australia. To have to wait this long, it's very sweet. It's why we play - we play to win and play to make big runs. It means a lot for me to make a 100 in front of my grandparents.

Smith humiliates England at the Waca,"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Australia pile on the punishment on day three Third Ashes Test, Waca (day three of five) England 403 (115.1 overs):Malan 140, Bairstow 119, Starc 4-91 Australia 549-4 (152 overs):Smith 229*, M Marsh 181*, Overton 2-102 Australia lead by 146 runs Scorecard Australia captain Steve Smith struck a magnificent double century and Mitchell Marsh a huge hundred of his own to demoralise England on the third day of the third Ashes Test in Perth. The fifth-wicket pair shared a stand of 301 as Australia racked up 549-4 at the Waca, a lead of 146. Smith - who made 141 not out in his side's first-Test win in Brisbane - batted throughout the day, moving from his overnight 92 to an unbeaten 229, his highest Test score. Marsh, on his return to the side, compiled his maiden Test ton on his home ground and was 181 not out at the close. England managed only one wicket all day - their attack wholehearted but lacking the tools to be incisive on a flat pitch and under scorching sunshine. Australia's remorselessness - they added 346 to their overnight 203-3 -  highlighted the tourists' profligacy on the second day, when they lost six wickets for 35 runs to slip from 368-4 to 403 all out. Steve Smith's innings has now lasted more than nine hours At 2-0 down, England must avoid defeat on a ground where they have not won since 1978 if they are to avoid surrendering the Ashes at the earliest possible opportunity. With the chance of victory now looking slim, it is likely they will have to bat for much of the fourth and fifth days in order to save the game. The pitch is only showing occasional signs of wear and there is rain forecast for Sunday and Monday - but they are only small crumbs of comfort for an England side who will have to face the fierce Australia attack after the best part of two days in the field. 'Guts and determination' needed to keep Ashes alive Reaction and analysis to third day's play Podcast - Is Smith the best since Bradman? Such was Smith's comfort, calmness and composure, a massive score seemed inevitable both when he arrived at the crease on Friday and again when he resumed on Saturday. It was chanceless and ruthless from the skipper, who moved his batting average to 62.89, second to only the great Donald Bradman on the all-time list. He reached his 22nd Test century in the fifth over of the day by clipping James Anderson through mid-wicket and, even then, there was the sense he was just getting started. Twice Anderson asked for a review, once when the ball was missing leg stump and again after what was revealed to be a no-ball - and it would not have been given out in any case. As on the second day, the off-side scoring was a feature of Smith's play as he became the first captain for 24 years to score a double hundred in an Ashes Test. His celebrations on reaching 200 were animated and, by the close, he had 416 runs in the series at an average of 208. How good is Smith and how do you get him out? Marsh had played 21 previous Tests and averaged only 21 with the bat before being recalled to replace the out-of-form Peter Handscomb and give Australia an all-round option. He entered after brother Shaun edged the off-spin of Moeen Ali to slip with the hosts still 155 behind and the second new ball looming. The closest he came to offering an opportunity was an uppish drive towards mid-on off Craig Overton when he was on only one. Patient and powerful, Marsh played drives down the ground and on both sides, as well some scything cut shots. His century was reached with a square drive off Stuart Broad, his celebration an emotional run towards the dressing room. As Smith was becalmed in the evening, Marsh accelerated and will be eyeing a double century when play gets back under way at 02:30 GMT on Sunday. England took just one wicket on the third day in Perth England did not bowl badly. At times they looked short of inspiration and their ground fielding was sometimes ragged - but that can be expected in such circumstances. It was a day that further highlighted the limitations of their attack. Though Anderson and Broad have more than 900 Test wickets between them, England do not have the pace or quality spin to make openings when the conditions are hot and flat. In eight consecutive away Tests - here and in India - the lowest first-innings total England have conceded is 328. On every other occasion the opposition have gone past 400. The tourists went through numerous plans. Over and round the wicket, sometimes with as many as six men on the leg side. If anything, they did not spend enough time settled on a traditional line and length. There was no lack of effort, though. Overton even bowled with a hairline crack of the rib, suffered when he was hit while batting in the second Test and aggravated when diving on Friday. Smith and Marsh were simply immovable - and England had no answers. England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on BT Sport:""Everybody has got to get stuck in, stand up and fight and scrap in the second innings. ""Until the Test match finishes, we have to believe you can get something out of it. ""It's going to be hard, but it is Test cricket. The best teams find a way to compete when their backs are against the wall. Now we need to show we have got character, we have got guts."" Mitchell Marsh also has a one-day international hundred to his name, against India in Sydney in 2016 Mitchell Marsh, speaking to ABC about his maiden century:""It's taken me 22 Tests. I wasn't really nervous. I felt calm and that kept me going. I wasn't thinking about too much. Anything wide, I was just going to slash at. ""You aspire to do that every game you play for Australia. To have to wait this long, it's very sweet. It's why we play - we play to win and play to make big runs. It means a lot for me to make a 100 in front of my grandparents. They've watched every game in the past eight years. ""It's reward for all the hard work. I'm ecstatic. I'm a bit lost at the moment. I'll be having a cold beer tonight."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""Australia were ruthless today. You can achieve ruthlessness when you face an attack you're not fearful of and can't take you out of your bubble.

Weinstein 'derailed my career',"Peter Jackson said he was ""fed false information"" about ""talented women"" Actress Mira Sorvino said she is ""heartsick"" after learning she may have lost out on major roles because of Harvey Weinstein. Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said both Sorvino and Ashley Judd were ""blacklisted"" following conversations with Weinstein's company. Both actresses have claimed the media mogul sexually harassed them. Weinstein has denied allegations of misconduct, and of blacklisting the actresses. The Lord of the Rings trilogy was initially in development with Weinstein's Miramax company, before being passed to New Line Cinema. In an interview with Stuff.co.nz this week, Jackson said he was interested in casting both women in the blockbuster franchise. ""I recall Miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998,"" he told the site. ""At the time, we had no reason to question what these guys were telling us."" ""I now suspect we were fed false information about both of these talented women - and as a direct result their names were removed from our casting list."" ""In hindsight, I realise that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing,"" Jackson said. How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers Sorvino said in a tweet: ""Just seeing this after I awoke, I burst out crying."" ""There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure. Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. I'm just heartsick."" Allow Twitter content?

Judd, meanwhile, recalled how her involvement progressed far enough to be invited by Jackson to see preparation work for the blockbuster trilogy. ""I remember this well,"" she tweeted. ""They asked which if the two roles I preferred,  and then I abruptly never heard from them again.  I appreciate the truth coming out,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

In a statement through a publicist, Weinstein denied the allegations that he was involved in blacklisting Sorvino and Judd, saying that the casting for Lord of the Rings was carried out by New Line Cinema - not Miramax. The statement said that Judd was cast in two other films by Mr Weinstein, and that ""Sorvino was always considered for other films as well."" Weinstein's denial prompted Jackson to write a further response, carried by Entertainment Weekly, calling it a ""deflection from the truth"".,external ""In the 18 months we developed the Lord of the Rings at Miramax, we had many casting conversations with Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein and their executives,"" Jackson wrote. ""The movies changed hands from Miramax to New Line before casting actually got underway - but because we had been warned off Ashley and Mira by Miramax, and we were naive enough to assume we'd been told the truth, [we] did not raise their names in New Line casting conversations."" Sorvino made her allegation in October, prompting a wave of further accusations from others Weinstein is the central figure of the Hollywood sexual harassment scandal, in which dozens of actresses have accused him of misconduct. Sorvino and Judd were among the first women to publicly share her experiences of sexual harassment from Weinstein back in October. The Hollywood film producer has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. Weinstein threatened to kill me - Hayek Peter Jackson's AR studio reveals demo.

Strictly champion to be crowned,"This video can not be played Who waltzed off with the Strictly glitterball? Former Holby City actor Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones have lifted the glitterball trophy and been crowned Strictly Come Dancing champions. The pair beat finalists Alexandra Burke, Gemma Atkinson and Debbie McGee and their partners after each couple had danced three times. The Glaswegian, 42, said he had not expected to win ""in a million years"". The final was watched by 13.1 million viewers at its peak, with an average audience of 11.6 million. McFadden, who won the public vote, is the oldest champion of the show, which was in its 15th series. ""It feels completely surreal and I'm so in awe of everyone who started all of those weeks ago,"" he said. He called Jones an ""amazing woman"", adding ""thank you for sticking with me and persevering"". His partner Jones said: ""You did it, you are so brilliant."" Joe McFadden: Child star to dance champion How Strictly has changed finalists' lives Reality Check: Did we predict the finalists?

The oldest person to have won previously was BBC presenter Chris Hollins in 2009, at the age of 38. There was a 50/50 chance that this year's winner would be the oldest contestant to be crowned in the show's history with 59-year-old McGee, widow of magician Paul Daniels, also in the final. The star-studded final narrowly missed out on matching last year's viewing figures, which peaked at 13.3 million. Alexandra Burke topped the leaderboard with partner Gorka after two perfect scores in the final During the final, each duo performed a showdance - where there were no rules and contestants were allowed to perform any moves they chose. They also revisited the judges' favourite dance of theirs from the series, as well as their own personal favourite, which was only revealed on the night. Former X Factor winner Burke has impressed the judges throughout the series. Her American smooth set the tone for the night, scoring four 10s, and judge Craig Revel Horwood joked that it was ""absolutely dreadful because I couldn't find a single thing wrong with the routine"". Debbie McGee was the oldest contestant remaining in the contest McGee scored a perfect 40 with her final performance of the night, an Argentine tango, and was praised by judge Bruno Tonioli for being an inspiration to an older generation. Atkinson earned her best score with 39 points for her American smooth but her thunder was almost stolen by Tonioli - who fell off his chair as the panel started their feedback. Actress Gemma Atkinson came fourth with partner Aljaz Skorjanec Debbie McGee and Giovanni Pernice: Judges' pick: Salsa to Can't Take My Eyes Off You, Boys Town Gang Showdance: One Day I'll Fly Away, Vaults Contestant's pick: Argentine tango to Por Una Cabeza by Carlos Gardel and Alfredo Le Pera Alexandra Burke and Gorka Marquez: Judges' pick: American Smooth to Wouldn't It Be Lovely from My Fair Lady Showdance: There's No Business Like Showbusiness, Ethel Merman Contestant's pick: Jive to Proud Mary, Tina Turner Joe McFadden and Katya Jones: Judges' pick: Viennese Waltz to Somewhere My Love from Dr Zhivago Showdance: You Make My Dreams, Hall and Oates Contestant's pick: Charleston to Alexander's Ragtime Band, Ella Fitzgerald Gemma Atkinson and Aljaz Skorjanec: Judges' pick: Paso Doble to Coldplay's Viva La Vida Showdance: Show Me How You Burlesque, Christina Aguilera Contestant's pick: American Smooth to Downtown, Petula Clark The previous contestants of this year's series also took to the dancefloor one last time for a group number. All in all, the dancing marathon lasted two and a half hours. Last year's final, which was won by Ore Oduba, only featured three finalists as singer Will Young had dropped out of the show earlier in the series, leaving them one couple short.

Argentine admiral sacked after sub loss,"Adm Srur (right) is seen here with President Macri last month The head of the Argentine navy has been sacked following the loss of a submarine and its crew in the South Atlantic last month. The defence minister placed Adm Marcelo Srur in retirement on Friday night, it has emerged. The ARA San Juan disappeared with 44 crew on board after reporting an electrical problem off the coast of Patagonia. An international search operation has failed to locate the vessel. The families of the missing have urged the government to keep looking for the submarine, describing the anguish of living with uncertainty since the rescue operation was wound up just over two weeks ago. Some ships are still searching in an area where a loud noise was recorded in the hours following the disappearance - possible evidence that the submarine imploded. President Mauricio Macri has created a special independent commission to investigate the disappearance of the submarine, following criticism about the handling of the operation. The commission will comprise three submariners - one the father of one of the disappeared crew. Defence Minister Oscar Aguad has promised the investigation will be ""transparent"" and will have an unlimited budget. The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman ""We ask that they always tell us the truth, that they keep us informed about what's happening,"" said Jorge Villareal, father of missing crew member Fernando, according to Efe news agency. ""We just find things out through the media."" Adm Srur, 60, was appointed by President Macri in January 2016. What happens when a submarine vanishes Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine?

Uber used 'undercover agents',"The letter emerged during Uber's legal battle with Waymo Uber set up a covert unit tasked with stealing competitors' secrets and engaging in undercover surveillance, a letter published by a US court on Friday has alleged. It is critical evidence in Uber's legal battle with Waymo, the self-driving car company that accuses the ride-sharing firm of stealing its technology. The letter, sent by lawyers representing a former Uber employee, sparked an internal investigation when it was sent to Uber in May, but has not been made public until now. In a statement, Uber said: ""While we havenât substantiated all the claims in this letter - and, importantly, any related to Waymo - our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology."" The allegations in the letter were made by Richard Jacobs, who worked at Uber until February this year. He left after an incident in which he felt he was unfairly demoted. Shortly afterwards, he sent the letter alleging the misconduct. ""These tactics were employed clandestinely through a distributed architecture of anonymous servers, telecommunications architecture, and non-attributable hardware and software,"" the letter read. Uber: Scandals that drove Kalanick out What do we know about Uber's new boss? Uber concealed huge data breach Snooping Mr Jacobs settled with Uber for $4.5m (Â£3.4m), and he has since said some of what he wrote was in fact not true, specifically the remarks about Waymo's trade secrets. However, several other details in the letter have already been confirmed, including an incident in whichUber accessed the medical records of a woman who accused an Uber driver of rape. Other allegations include Uber employees posing as protesters in order to gain access to private online chat groups. In one particularly bizarre example, Mr Jacobs alleged that an Uber ""surveillance team"" was deployed to a hotel in order to record and observe conversations between executives at a rival company - the name of which has been redacted from the version of the letter made public. Specifically, those agents wanted to monitor the competitors' reaction to the news that Uber had secured a large amount of funding from a Saudi investor. Angry judge The emergence of the ""Jacobs letter"" has been a dramatic turn of events in the Uber v Waymo trial, which had been due to start earlier this month but has now been delayed until February. Presiding Judge William Alsup was made aware of the letter's existence by the US Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California, which is currently investigating Uber on a range of other matters. In court last month, Judge Alsup chastised Uber's legal team, accusing them of withholding evidence. ""I can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,"" he said. ""Weâre going to have to put the trial off because if even half of whatâs in that letter is true it would be a huge injustice to force Waymo to go to trial."" Internally, Uber is going to great lengths to reassure employees that the old ways of working, under ousted chief executive Travis Kalanick, no longer exist at the firm. ""There is no place for such practices or that kind of behaviour at Uber,"" wrote Tony West, Uber's general counsel, in a note to employees. ""We donât need to be following folks around in order to gain some competitive advantage. Weâre better than that. We will compete and we will win because our technology is better, our ideas are better, and our people are better. Period.""

Austrian far-right returns to power,"Sebastian Kurz has promised a pro-EU government with the Eurosceptic Heinz-Christian Strache Austria's president has approved a coalition government between the conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party. The deal will make Austria the only Western European state with a governing far-right party, which is opposed to migration and the European Union. The parties previously governed the country together between 2000 and 2005. But at just 31, the People's Party's Sebastian Kurz is set to become the world's youngest head of government. No details have been given about the government's programme, but several important ministerial roles are expected to be handed to the smaller Freedom Party as part of the deal. What propels young leaders to power? President Alexander Van der Bellen gave the green light to the deal on Saturday morning. He said the new government had assured him of both a pro-EU stance and a continued commitment to the European convention on human rights. The election on 15 October failed to yield a conclusive result. The campaign was dominated by Europe's migration crisis, something the anti-immigration Freedom Party has long campaigned about. On the campaign trail, Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache labelled Sebastian Kurz an ""imposter"" Mr Kurz appealed to conservative and right-wing voters with pledges to shut down migrant routes to Europe, cap benefit payments to refugees, and bar immigrants from receiving benefits until they have lived in Austria for five years. But he has promised to form a pro-EU government, despite his coalition partner's traditional Euroscepticism. Bethany Bell, Vienna Unlike most of Europe's populist parties, the Freedom Party has managed to translate its success at the ballot box into real political power. It has been a major player in Austrian politics for decades. In recent years, the party has toned down some of its more extreme rhetoric. But many analysts believe that, in or out of government, it has helped set a right-wing agenda, not just in Austria - but in other countries across Europe as well. Its stance against immigration is becoming more mainstream, along with its populist tone. The Freedom Party accused Mr Kurz of stealing their policies. Their candidate, Heinz-Christian Strache, branded him an ""imposter"". When the far-right Freedom Party last entered a coalition in Austria in 2000, its fellow EU member states froze bilateral diplomatic relations in response. Those diplomatic sanctions were lifted months later, after the move failed to force the Freedom Party out of government and amid fears that continued sanctions could further increase nationalist tensions. That is unlikely to happen again, as resurgent right-wing populist groups have been promoting anti-immigration and Eurosceptic agendas across much of the EU. But unlike the Freedom Party, they have struggled to convert electoral success into real power. Earlier this year, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front party lost the French presidential election comprehensively. Ms Le Pen was defeated by Emmanuel Macron, a liberal centrist and strong supporter of the European Union. Elsewhere, the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party of Geert Wilders was defeated by liberal leader Mark Rutte. In Germany, the nationalist and populist right of Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained seats in the national parliament, where  it is now third biggest party, but it is not in the frame for coalition talks.

Far-right minister reassures Austrians,"Sebastian Kurz (R) has agreed a coalition deal with far-right party leader Heinz-Christian Strache The far-right Freedom Party has secured the key posts of foreign, interior and defence in Austria's new coalition government for its nominees. Governing with the conservative People's Party, the move makes Austria the only country in Western Europe to have a far-right party in power. Austria's president approved the new coalition on Saturday, two months after inconclusive elections. People's Party leader Sebastian Kurz, 31, will be Austria's new chancellor. He will become the world's youngest head of government. What propels young leaders to power? Introducing the new government, and the 180-page document setting out its agenda, Mr Kurz said the two parties had agreed ""on a clear pro-European outlook"". Although it is the junior coalition partner, the anti-immigration Freedom Party has secured several key posts in the new cabinet. Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache will be vice-chancellor. His party colleagues will run the interior, defence and health and social security ministries. The new foreign minister will be Middle East expert and writer Karin Kneissl, who is not a Freedom Party member but was nominated by the party. Mr Kurz's People Party won 32% of the vote in October's elections, securing the largest number of seats (62) in the 183-seat national council. The Freedom Party came third, securing 26% of the vote and 51 seats. At the request of Austria's president, the posts of justice minister and interior minister would not be held by the same party, Mr Kurz said. The chancellor-designate was quick to retweet congratulations from his fellow youthful conservative prime minister, Ireland's Leo Varadkar. Allow Twitter content?

Analysis byBethany Bell, BBC News, Vienna Unlike most of Europe's populist parties, the Freedom Party, a major player in Austria for years, has managed to translate its success at the ballot box into real political power. That's reflected in the key posts that it has secured in this government: the interior, defence and foreign ministries.

ANC gathers to choose new leader,"Mr Zuma said his ANC party was at a ""crossroads"" South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has called on the African National Congress (ANC) to stop infighting as it decides who will next lead the party. Mr Zuma warned the future of the ANC was under threat, with South Africans ""not happy"" with it. The main contenders to succeed him are the deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, President Zuma's ex-wife. Whoever wins is likely to succeed Mr Zuma as South African president. But their bitter leadership battle has raised fears that the ANC could split before national elections in 2019. President Zuma can remain head of state until those elections. He has been in office since 2009 and South Africa limits the presidency to two five-year terms. The leadership contest is expected to be a close one, with legal challenges a possibility. Who are the main candidates? Why ANC leadership vote matters The trials of Jacob Zuma Addressing delegates at the beginning of a gathering to decide the next ANC leader, Mr Zuma said their movement was at a ""crossroads"". ""Petty squabbling that takes us nowhere needs to take back seat, our people are frustrated when we spend more time fighting among ourselves instead of solving the daily challenges they experience,"" he said. Last year's disappointing results for the ANC in local elections, Mr Zuma said, ""were a stark reminder that our people are not happy with the state of the ANC"". The leading candidates are Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa President Zuma, 75, has been the focus of much controversy and has survived several votes of no confidence in parliament. He faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. In his final speech as ANC president, he asserted that ""theft and corruption"" were as prominent in the private sector as they are in government. He added that ""being black and successful is being made synonymous to being corrupt"". He lashed out at the media, which he said was not ""impartial and fair"". He also targeted the judiciary, arguing that the courts should have no role in deciding internal party matters. For the leadership, President Zuma is backing his 68-year-old former wife, Ms Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran politician in her own right who has been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businesses. This video can not be played What advice should South Africa's ruling party take on board? Mr Ramaphosa, 65, has spoken out strongly against state corruption and has the backing of the business community. Recent news that he had a modest lead in the polls was quickly reflected by a rise in the financial markets. Lebo Diseko, Johannesburg, BBC News Jacob Zuma came out fighting in his speech, hitting out at his critics both inside and outside the party. It seemed like no one was spared - from ANC members who voted with the opposition to try and remove him, alliance partners who have booed him and called on him to stand down, to ""counter-revolutionary forces"" he said were intent on reversing the progress made since 1994, when apartheid was brought to an end. Indeed, that idea of malevolent forces working to bring down both him and the ANC was a thread that ran right through his speech. Mr Zuma placed his fight against his opponents within the wider framework of the fight against apartheid. He ended his speech by saying ""I tried my best"", and of those who tried to bring him down ""I bear no grudges"". He then led the room in song. This was Jacob Zuma in his element: a rousing speaker, a fierce opponent, delivering cutting rebukes with charm and charisma. More than 5,000 delegates are taking part in the four-day ANC elective conference at the Expo Centre in Johannesburg. A vote on the new leader is expected on Sunday. The first major engagement for the new leader will be the party's anniversary celebrations on 8 January. The ANC has governed South Africa since the first democratic election more than 20 years ago. The BBC's Andrew Harding says a question remains whether the ANC is in terminal decline, and what that might mean for South Africa's stability and its future.

"Scientist Heinz Wolff dies, aged 89","This video can not be played Heinz Wolff's show challenged scientists to create weird and wonderful gadgets Renowned scientist and TV presenter Heinz Wolff has died, aged 89. The German-born inventor and professor, famed for hosting BBC Two's long-running science showThe Great Egg Race, died of heart failure on 15 December, his family said. A former advisor to the European Space Agency, he became emeritus professor at London's Brunel University, working on projects linked to ageing populations. His son Laurence paid tribute to his humour, curiosity, and enthusiasm. Speaking to BBC News, Laurence Wolff said his father had ""touched so many people through his ingenuity in terms of his inventing... and his great belief in educating about science and technology"". He had a ""natural sense of fun and he knew that was also a way of engaging people... People would stop him in the street... and they would say, 'you got me into science'"". A Jewish refugee, Wolff moved to the UK from Berlin at the age of 11 on the day World War Two broke out in September 1939. After attending school in Oxford, he worked in haematology at the city's Radcliffe Infirmary, where he invented a machine for counting patients' blood cells. He later went on to graduate from University College London with a first-class honours degree in physiology and physics. This video can not be played Laurence Wolff says his father had a sense of humour, curiosity and enthusiasm Wolff moved into television in 1966, first appearing on the BBC's Panorama programme with Richard Dimbleby, where he produced a pill that could measure pressure, temperature and acidity. However, he was best known for hosting BBC Two's The Great Egg Race from 1977 until 1986 - instantly recognisable for his trademark bow tie and eccentric hairstyle. The show challenged contestants to invent useful objects with limited resources. Friends and colleagues also recalled his love of practical jokes, particularly one instance when he arrived at his 80th birthday party on a scooter propelled by fire extinguishers. Wolff was an emeritus professor at Brunel University Professor Julia Buckingham, vice-chancellor and president of Brunel University, said: ""Heinz's remarkable intellect, ideas and enthusiasm combined to make him the sparkling scientist we will so fondly remember. ""He was a wonderful friend and supporter to staff and to students - and an inspiration to all of us."" Brunel colleague Professor Ian Sutherland added: ""There was nothing he loved more than having a team of people around him, devising completely new ways of doing things."" Alongside his television appearances, Wolff continued in his efforts to advance human progress through his scientific work. He was made an honorary member of the European Space Agency in 1975, and his work into how humans could survive hostile space environments led to Dr Helen Sharman becoming the first British astronaut and the 15th woman in space in 1991. Wolff balanced his mischievous curiosity with serious scientific research Laurence Wolff said this space work - known as Project Jupiter - had been greatly valued by his father, who wished to ""inspire young people"" and use science to ""entertain as well as educate"". He also described how Heinz Wolff's early interest in science had been stoked by his own father, who had him taking part in chemistry experiments at the age of four. He added: ""The person that people saw when they met him was the person we knew at home. His sense of humour, his curiosity, his enthusiasm. That was our father."" Wolff was also a strong supporter of local charities throughout his life, including spending more than 25 years as a trustee, and then Life President, of the Hillingdon Partnership Trust. He was married to his wife Joan until her death in 2014, and is survived by two sons and four grandchildren. Testing Britain's record on inventions.

There was no sign of forced entry to the property, police said in a statement Friday evening. Local media reported that investigators were not searching for a suspect at this time.

Theatre reverses decision to axe play,"Samantha Robinson and James Atherton are in the cast of Rita, Sue and Bob Too London's Royal Court theatre has reversed its decision to cancel a production of Rita, Sue and Bob Too. The theatre had said it was axing the play after allegations that its co-director Max Stafford-Clark made inappropriate sexual comments to staff. But artistic director Vicky Featherstone said she had been ""rocked to the core by accusations of censorship"" and it would now go ahead. Stafford-Clark apologised in October for ""any inappropriate behaviour"". The Guardian reported in October,externalhow he had left his theatre company Out Of Joint after a staff member had made a formal complaint about his lewd comments. Before starting Out Of Joint, he was artistic director at the Royal Court from 1979 to 1993. Earlier this week, the theatre said the play had ""themes of grooming and abuses of power on young women"" that were not appropriate. But in a statement Ms Featherstone said,externalshe had reinstated the production, which had been due to run for two-and-a-half weeks in January before it was cancelled. She said the theatre was ""nothing without the voices and trust of our writers"". ""This is the guiding principle on which the theatre was founded and on which it continues to be run,"" she said. ""I have therefore been rocked to the core by accusations of censorship and the banning of a working-class female voice. ""For that reason, I have invited the current Out of Joint production of Rita, Sue and Bob Too back to the Royal Court for its run. ""As a result of this helpful public debate we are now confident that the context with which Andrea Dunbar's play will be viewed will be an invitation for new conversations."" Performance dates and times will remain the same, the theatre said. The play, which has toured the UK, opened in September at the Octagon theatre in Bolton, which was also a partner in the co-production with the Royal Court. In recent months, the Royal Court has been at the forefront of tackling sexual harassment and abuse in the theatre world. Earlier this year, it staged a ""day of action"", which led toa code of conduct,external. In October, a spokesperson for Stafford-Clark told The Guardian the director had suffered from pseudobulbar palsy and ""occasional disinhibition"" since a stroke and brain injury in 2006. A statement said: ""Mr Stafford-Clark's occasional loss of the ability to inhibit urges results in him displaying disinhibited and compulsive behaviour and his usual (at times provocative) behaviour being magnified, often causing inappropriate social behaviour. ""Whilst this is an explanation it isn't an attempt to dismiss his behaviour and he apologises for any offence caused.""

US Republicans agree landmark tax bill,"Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, revealed details of the final bill to reporters US Republicans from both houses of Congress have revealed their joint bill for the biggest overhaul of the country's tax system in 30 years. The plan brings the US corporate tax rate down to 21% from the current 35%. The top individual income tax drops to 37% from 39.6%. President Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to cut taxes, and passing the legislation marks a significant victory. He has said he wants the bill signed into law before Christmas. Democrats have argued that the tax cuts will favour only the rich and offer little to the middle class. The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation said on Friday the measures would add as much as $1.4tn (Â£1tn) to the $20tn national debt over 10 years. The Senate and the House of Representatives - which both have Republican majorities - are due to vote on the measures next week. What is in the final version of the US tax plan? Reality Check: Will tax plan hurt Trump? Friday's agreement came after hours of talks in which the bill's supporters sought to win over wavering Republicans. Senator Marco Rubio added his support following changes to child tax credit, reports said. Fellow Senator Bob Corker, who had opposed the original bill, also said he would back the draft bill despite reservations. Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he was ""very excited about this moment"". ""It's been 31 years in the making and took a lot of hard work,"" he told reporters. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The pieces are falling in place for Donald Trump's tax bill, which now seems almost guaranteed to become law. This will certainly satisfy critics within the Republican Party, particularly the big-business donors, who were lamenting Congress's inability to enact even modest parts of their party's legislative agenda. The question, however, is whether the success here will do anything to reverse the president's low poll numbers and dispel the growing consensus that Republicans are in for a rough ride in next year's mid-term congressional elections. At the very least this will make it easier for the party incumbents to survive primary challenges from anti-establishment outsiders who otherwise would have railed against a do-nothing Congress. The tax bill's overall unpopularity according to recent polls, however, may do little to improve the party's standings in the eyes of the general public. Cutting corporate tax rates, whether or not it is in the long-term interest of the nation, is unlikely to capture the imagination of the average American. Republicans are now in a position to fully take credit for a booming economy, however - and they have 11 months to make the case to voters that they deserve to stay in power. The proposed new measures ran into opposition from a senior UN official on Friday, who said they could worsen social inequality in the US. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty who has been on a two-week fact-finding visit to US States, said the tax bill threatened to ""blow apart"" social welfare provision. ""The US Congress is trying desperately to pass a tax bill that, if adopted, would represent the single most dramatic increase in inequality that could be imagined,"" he said.

Profile: Cyril Ramaphosa,"With his suave, urbane demeanour, decades worth of political experience and significant role in the anti-apartheid movement, one would have expected Cyril Ramaphosa to confidently land a second term as South Africa's president. But Mr Ramaphosa led his African National Congress (ANC) to its worst election result in 30 years - falling short of the 50% of votes needed to govern alone. As a result of their dismal election performance in May, Mr Ramaphosa only survives as party leader and national president thanks to a power-sharing deal with the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) and two smaller parties. The 71-year-old's first stint in office was blighted by stubbornly high unemployment, persisting economic inequalities, widespread power cuts and corruption allegations. It is a far from ideal state of affairs, especially for a man said to have coveted the presidential role since the ANC came to power in 1994. Born close to the centre of Johannesburg in 1952, Mr Ramaphosa experienced the injustices of the racist system of apartheid early. His family were forcibly moved to the township of Soweto when he was just a young child - they were among the millions of black South Africans relocated to distant, often economically deprived reserves by the authorities. As a secondary school pupil Mr Ramaphosa ""took his school teachers to task if he didn't think they were working hard enough"", his biographer Anthony Butler tells the BBC. ""He was very confident and popular,"" Prof Butler adds. Mr Ramaphosa became involved in the black consciousness movement at university and as a result of his activism he endured two months-long stints in solitary confinement. He crafted a reputation as a thorn in the side of white mine bosses in the 1980s, leading the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in one of the largest strikes in South Africa's history. He also joined the ANC and worked closely with Nelson Mandela to negotiate an end to minority rule, which came in 1994. When Mr Mandela became South Africa's first black president, Mr Ramaphosa harboured ambitions to become his deputy. However it was not to be - he was overlooked for the more senior Thabo Mbeki. Dispirited, Mr Ramaphosa took up the role of MP and played a leading role in drafting South Africa's post-apartheid constitution, one of the most liberal in the world. He later withdrew from the political centre-stage to become a business executive, despite being well-liked by the public. Nelson Mandela (R) chose Thabo Mbeki (L) as his successor, rather than Mr Ramaphosa ""He was persuaded by Mandela and the others to take time out. He was a relatively young man,"" Prof Butler says. As white businessmen tried to accommodate him, Mr Ramaphosa acquired a stake in nearly every key sector - from telecoms and the media to beverages and fast food (he owned the South African franchise of the US chain, McDonalds) to mining. His ventures were wildly lucrative - by 2015 he had become one of South Africa's wealthiest politicians with a net worth of about $450m (Â£340m). But Mr Ramaphosa's reputation was tainted after police killed 34 workers in August 2012 at the Marikana platinum mine - the most deadly police action since white-minority rule ended. With Mr Ramaphosa then a director in Lonmin - the multinational that owns the mine - he was accused of betraying the workers he once fought for, especially after emails emerged showing he had called for action against the miners for engaging in ""dastardly criminal acts"" - an apparent reference to their wildcat and violent strike. A judge-led inquiry cleared him of involvement in the killings, but failed to totally scrub the stain from his legacy. The unionist turned tycoon had just started his political comeback, after being chosen as the ANC's deputy leader. Two years later, he became South Africa's deputy president, giving legitimacy to the scandal-hit presidency of Jacob Zuma. But as Mr Zuma neared his two-term limit as ANC leader, Mr Ramaphosa entered the succession battle, positioning himself as the anti-Zuma candidate. His pledges to fight corruption were widely seen as a dig at the man who remained his boss at the national level. Mr Ramaphosa was the natural favourite for the top job, but the then president threw his weight behind his ex-wife and former African Union Commission chief, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. A bitter contest ensued, with Mr Ramaphosa eventually beating Ms Dlamini-Zuma to become ANC leader in December 2017. Mr Zuma intended to stay on as South Africa's president until the 2019 general election. But following intense pressure from ANC leaders - including Mr Ramaphosa -the embattled president was forced to resign. After almost 25 years Mr Ramaphosa's long-held dream was realised - MPs broke into song in parliament when it was announced he would succeed Mr Zuma as president of South Africa. The new leader used his initial speech to make a stand against corruption - but shortly afterwards became embroiled in a series of of his own scandals. In 2018, Mr Ramaphosa told parliament he had not received campaign donations from a controversial local company during his ANC leadership bid. He later apologised, saying he had been misinformed when he gave the answer. This admission undermined Mr Ramphosa's own anti-corruption drive butyears later the High Court dismissed the notion that he deliberately misled parliament. In 2022, a long-awaited inquirylaid bare the looting of billions of dollars from South Africa's state coffersduring Mr Zuma's presidency. Mr Ramaphosa was implicated in the findings, with investigators concluding he should have done more to stop the rot while he was Mr Zuma's deputy. And just a few months later, before the dust had settled from that inquiry, Mr Ramaphosa became the focus of another corruption scandal. In June, the president wasaccused of hiding a theft of $4m (Â£3.25m) in cashfrom his Phala Phala game farm. While denying any wrongdoing, the president admitted that money hidden in his sofa had been stolen in 2020. He said the cash totalled $580,000 (Â£460,000), not $4m, and that he had earned the $580,000 by selling buffalo. An independent panel of legal experts, headed by a former chief justice, said it had ""substantial doubt"" about whether such a sale actually took place. His opponents - both inside and outside the ANC - called for him to resign over ""Farmgate"" while parliament weighed up whether or not to launch impeachment proceedings. But the president ultimately won the backing of the ANC's leaders and stayed on in the top job. ""He rode that out quite effectively,"" says Paddy Harper, a journalist with South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper, adding that the major criticisms of Mr Ramaphosa's first term were issues like the water crisis, load shedding and unemployment"". The ANC's popularity certainly suffered because of these issues, but political analyst Richard Calland tells the BBC Mr Ramaphosa has been a ""steady, if not spectacular"" president who inherited unfavourable conditions from the previous government. ""I think that he has been the leader we needed and the best available leader, despite his weaknesses, despite the fact that many of the metrics around the recovery of the economy and so on are still negative,"" he says. Mr Ramaphosa has been a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza Under Mr Ramaphosa, South Africa has emphasised its credentials as a champion of the global south, most notably in the way that it has led the condemnation of Israel over its war in Gaza. This culminated in South Africa taking Israel to the International Court of Justice in The Hague,accusing it of genocide. It is also a leading voice in theBrics grouping of countries, seen as an alternative to the more Western-oriented G7. South Africa has refused to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, straining relations with the US. The president led a delegation of African heads of state to both Kyiv and Moscowin an ultimately fruitless attempt to broker a peace deal. In 2019 the president was praised forappointing a new cabinet in which, for the first time in the country's history, half of all ministers were women. From trade unionist to leader of one of Africa's biggest economies, Mr Ramaphosa's career has been a catalogue of contradictions, history-making moments and fierce battles. He now has yet another huge challenge on his hands. If the deal with his former enemies in the DA succeeds in turning round South Africa's moribund economy and creating jobs for the millions who need them, he will be remembered as the man who saved his country, and party. But if not, even more South Africans will be tempted to back his arch-rival - Jacob Zuma and his uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party.

Profile: Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,"Jacob Zuma wants his ex-wife to succeed him as party leader South Africa's President Jacob Zuma is keen to hand over the reins of power to the mother of his children. Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini-Zuma, 68 - a senior member of the governing African National Congress (ANC) - has been criss-crossing the country in recent months seeking a mandate to be its first woman president. Since returning from a five-year stint in Addis Ababa running the African Union, Ms Dlamini-Zuma has addressed crowds at events from funerals to political rallies. The eldest of eight children, she was born in the rolling hills of KwaZulu-Natal province in 1949 and joined the underground anti-apartheid student movement in the early 1970s while at medical school there. This raised the ire of the apartheid regime. She was forced to flee into exile and eventually completed her studies at Bristol University in the UK in 1978. The newly qualified Ms Dlamini-Zuma worked at Mbabane Government Hospital in Swaziland. This is where she met and was charmed by Mr Zuma, then also an exiled member of the ANC. Mr Zuma is a polygamist, and she was one of his three wives until she divorced him in 1998. Ms Dlamini-Zuma, who had four children with her ex-husband, never remarried. Nevertheless, President Zuma, who steps down as party leader in December, has endorsed her to succeed him as ANC president, and preferably of the country after elections due in 2019. Pressure has been increasing on him to step down earlier amid accusations of corruption, which he denies. Asked whether she should rise to the very top of the political landscape, he said: ""She has grown in the struggle. She has run a number of positions. She has been a minister in a number of departments, there's no question at all. ""If the ANC says we think we can give this responsibility and she agrees, then that's not a concern at all."" A leading anti-apartheid activist Fled South Africa and completed medical training in UK Met ex-husband Jacob Zuma while working as a doctor in Swaziland Divorced him in 1998 after 16 years of marriage Declined offer to take place of her sacked ex-husband as deputy president in 2005 Chair of the African Union commission from 2012 to 2016 She reported the local Sunday Times newspaper to the independent press council after it quoted unnamed sources in January as saying that she was spending ""a lot of time"" at the president's rural homestead. The council ordered the newspaper to apologise for presenting the allegation ""as fact in its headline"". Her lawyers had dismissed the report as ""untruthful, inaccurate and unfair"", and accused the newspaper of publishing a ""bizarre story that an African woman, despite divorcing her husband to whom she had been married in terms of the Civil Law, remains in the claws of the ex-husband in the name of polygamy"". A former leader of the women's wing of the ANC, she had the confidence of South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, who appointed her as health minister after the end of white minority rule in 1994. She was widely credited with introducing legislation which made it illegal for people to smoke in public areas such as restaurants and airports. Her tenure as health minister was followed by a 10-year stint as foreign minister, during the rule of Mr Mandela's successor - and Mr Zuma's rival - Thabo Mbeki. Mr Mbeki had offered her the post of deputy president after he sacked Mr Zuma in 2005, following allegations of corruption against him. The rise of NDZ - as she is sometimes referred to nowadays - has not come without controversy. While health minister she became embroiled in the first big corruption scandal to hit the ANC government. Increasing numbers of South Africans want Jacob Zuma to resign Her department awarded a 14 million rand ($1,2m; Â£700,00) tender to renowned playwright  Mbongeni Ngema to come up with a sequel to Sarafina, a musical to educate people about the dangers of HIV/Aids. Following a public outcry over the huge cost of the musical, an anti-corruption body - the public protector's office - carried out an investigation. It led to the termination of the contract. ""Mr Ngema's company had not adhered fully to the spirit and terms of the contract, and it appeared they had tendered a defective service,"" the public protector's office said. Ms Dlamini-Zuma refused to resign, despite pressure from the opposition. Also as health minister, she was criticised for supporting Virodene, a toxic substance which had been rejected by the wider scientific community, as a remedy for HIV/Aids. After spending most of her life fighting for the downtrodden, she has uncharacteristically chosen to walk with the wolves during the current campaign. Some of her current backers have a litany of corruption scandals hanging around their necks. Many of her old comrades are irked by her political expediency, even if it is for the top job in Africa's most industrialised economy. More recently, she was chastised for labelling nationwide protests calling for President Zuma to step down as ""rubbish"" in a tweet which was then deleted from her timeline. This video can not be played Girls should be at school, says AU Chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Some said Mr Zuma was trying to protect himself from prosecution over corruption allegations, because if his former wife becomes president, she would be reluctant to send the police to lock him up during his retirement in his village of Nkandla. However NDZ was incensed at the suggestion she wants to be president in order to protect her former husband from his legal woes. She said: ""I am my own woman and I have worked hard to be here,"" she told the Johannesburg Star newspaper. ""I have my own track record in the ANC and in government. I am a doctor and one of the longest-serving cabinet ministers under former Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. Before Zuma became president,"" she was quoted as saying. Those who know her well describe Ms Dlamini-Zuma as firm, controlling and someone who at times tells it like it is. But at home some of her stories are of a motherly figure. Even though there are other women aspiring to the number one spot, she has become the face of the ANC Women's League's call that ""South Africa is ready for a woman president."" The diminutive figure I have come to know over the years is a humble and intellectually astute individual. But unlike her former husband, her personality cannot be described as charming. But the question is whether the people will follow her as she continues to soldier on towards the presidential seat.

UK must not be EU 'colony' after Brexit,"This video can not be played Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg tells Newsnight the EU's terms for a transition period are unacceptable. A leading Brexiteer has said the UK cannot become a ""colony"" of the EU during the two year transition period after Britain's withdrawal in 2019. EU leaders have agreedBrexit talks can move on, with the UK staying in the customs union, single market and under the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction during the  transition. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said that would be unacceptable. But Tory remainer Ken Clarke said the UK must not ""go off a cliff edge"". The former chancellor told BBC Newsnight that during the transition the UK would continue economically under the current terms, but would have left the union politically. Otherwise, he said it would be a ""disaster"" if come March 2019 negotiations were not finished and the UK would have to resort to tariff and customs barriers. ""I doubt we'd get the planning permission for the lorry parks in time,"" he said. However, Mr Rees-Mogg said leaving under these terms would be ""a ridiculous position to be in"". ""The transition which the EU is offering means that we're still effectively in the European Union for the following two years,"" he told Newsnight. Reality Check: Guidelines for Brexit negotiations Move to head off another Brexit rebellion On Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May hailed an ""important step"" as Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, announced that all 27 EU leaders were happy to move on to the next phase of negotiations. The first issue to be discussed, early next year, will be the details of the expected two-year transition period after the UK's exit. The EU has published its guidelines,externalwhich say: ""As the UK will continue to participate in the customs union and the single market during the transition, it will have to continue to comply with EU trade policy."" The three-page document says the UK will remain under the jurisdiction of the ECJ and be required to permit freedom of movement during any transition period. But Mr Rees-Mogg said such a situation would make the UK ""a vassal"" - or subordinate - state of the EU, having to accept laws ""without any say-so"" from the British people. Mrs May  sufferedher first Commons Brexit defeatearlier this week when MPs voted to give Parliament a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. Former cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the defeat was a ""fuss about nothing"". Sir Oliver, who is backing an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill designed to avoid another rebellion over the timing of Brexit, told Today that he did not believe the vote earlier in the week ""has much of an effect at all."" Among the Tories who rebelled in the vote was Mr Clarke, who told Newsnight his actions had in no way undermined the government's negotiating position. He said he had since received a death threat, although he added it was not his first.

Hope siblings can be buried 'side-by-side',"Four siblings died as a result of the fire and their mother is in a coma in hospital The uncle of four children who died in a house fire wants them to be ""buried together side-by-side"" and hopes they get the ""funeral they deserve"". Demi Pearson, 14, Brandon, eight, Lacie, seven, and three-year-old Lia died following the blaze in Walkden, Salford on Monday. Their mother Michelle Pearson, 35, remains in a drug-induced coma. Matt Pearson, who is the brother of Ms Pearson, has started a fundraising appeal to help with funeral costs. He said: ""I want to give these kids the best funeral they deserve with customized coffins for them."" He added Lia loved Peppa Pig and ""it would be nice to get her this coffin"" as well as a horse and carriage to take the siblings to the cemetery. Mr Pearson added: ""They will all be buried together side-by-side."" The appeal has already raised more than Â£11,500. Two men and a woman appeared in court on Friday charged with murdering the siblings. David Worrall, 25, of no fixed address, has beencharged with four murders, arson with intent to endanger life and attempted murder.

Full details of tax changes,"What is in the US tax plan? US lawmakers have unveiled the final draft of a bill set to be the most significant overhaul of the US tax code in a generation. After weeks of politicking, lobbying and vote-trading, the Republican-controlled Congress is set to vote on the plan. If it passes it will give President Donald Trump an early Christmas present - his first major piece of legislation since taking office. Republicans say the tax cuts for businesses and families will unleash investment, spending and growth. But critics say it will result in a huge transfer of wealth from poor to rich, and future generations will have to pay for it. So what are the key points in the plan? It's being described as the biggest single drop in corporation tax in US history. Under current law, businesses face a range of tax rates, starting at 15% and rising to 35% on taxable income over $10m. The new plan creates a single 21% corporate rate, effective in 2018. That is low, but not quite as low as the 20% rate included in earlier versions of the plan. Current law requires people to carry health insurance or face a tax penalty. That mandate is eliminated in the new code, a provision that the Joint Committee on Taxation projects could raise $318bn, since it is expected to lead to 13 million fewer people with insurance coverage. The tax bill has aroused opposition, since many of the benefits go to the wealthy and large corporations The US currently has seven tax brackets ranging from 10% to a top rate of 39.6%, which applies to income above about $418,000 for individuals and $471,00 for couples. Under the new plan, some of those rates fall, including the top rate, which would be 37%, applicable to income over $500,000 for individuals and $600,000 for couples. The lower rates expire after 2025. Under current law, inheritances worth more than about $5.5m for individuals and roughly $11m for couples are subject to a 40% tax. The new plan roughly doubles the amount of inheritance exempt from tax. That provision expires after 2025. Under current law, taxpayers can either claim a standard deduction or opt to deduct specific items. The new plan roughly doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. In exchange for that boost - which expires after 2025 and is intended to make the itemising option less attractive - the plan eliminates a slew of targeted benefits, such as deductions for moving expenses and tax preparation costs. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has championed the tax efforts. He says he wants families to be able file their taxes on a post card. Republicans in the Senate attached a measure that will open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. That made it into the final version. How tax reforms could mean more oil drilling in Alaska House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) addresses questions from reporters during the final negotiations The Republican plan eliminates the personal exemption, which was worth roughly $4,000 and could be claimed for each member of a family. To offset that move, the plan expands a tax credit for children. That is currently worth $1,000 per child for families who make less than a certain amount. Under the new plan, it would be worth $2,000 and available to more families. Debate over how much the child tax credit would be worth almost killed the bill, after Senator Marco Rubio, Republican from Florida, said he wanted the provision structured to be more generous for low income families. The benefit expires after 2025. Multinational companies currently pay US taxes on income earned abroad. The new plan changes the code to a so-called territorial system, making companies responsible for income earned in the US. It also creates new rules to prevent companies from unfairly taking advantage of the shift. The plan also imposes one-time, ultra-low tax rates for corporate profits currently being held offshore, charged at 15.5% on liquid assets and 8% for illiquid assets. US President Donald Trump has rallied support for tax changes, which he says will boost economic growth Under current law, owners of businesses organised as so-called pass through entities pay taxes on profits based on the personal rate (since the profits ""pass through"" to the owners). The new bill allows for 20% of that income to be deducted for households making less than $315,00. After that, the perk is only available to some businesses. The Trump tax reform Kansas conservatives regret Corporate tax avoidance: How do companies do it? Republicans had threatened to eliminate a number of industry specific benefits. But the final version is less aggressive than earlier proposals. For example, the bill preserves tax perks for wind energy. The plan caps the deduction forstate and local taxesat $10,000. Preserving some kind of deduction was important to Republicans from high-cost states such as California, New Jersey and New York. It also retains themortgage interest deduction, a priority of the powerful property lobby, while lowering the cap on what new mortgages are eligible for the perk from $1m to $750,000. The bill does not subjectgraduate school tuition waiversto taxes, as had been proposed. The plan also maintains, and temporarily expands, deductions for certainmedical expenses.

Who will succeed Jacob Zuma?,"Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (c) and Cyril Ramaphosa (r) are the top candidates in the race to take over from Jacob Zuma (l) South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) is set to elect a new leader at a conference starting on Saturday following a fierce contest between seven candidates. The scandal-hit President Jacob Zuma will step down as party leader, opening the way for his successor to spearhead the ANC's campaign for the 2019 general election. The ANC has governed South Africa since the first democratic election more than 20 years ago, so there is a strong chance that whoever the party picks as its leader will also succeed Mr Zuma as president when his two terms end in 2019. But under Mr Zuma the ANC has become wracked by infighting and allegations of corruption, raising, for the first time, the possibility that it could lose its majority. So the incoming ANC leader will be expected to knock the party into shape, and regain the trust of voters. While there are seven candidates, only two, Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, have a realistic chance of winning. Currently the deputy president, Mr Ramaphosa is said to have long had his eye on the top job in South African politics. He worked closely with anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela to negotiate an end to minority rule, and to give black people the right to vote for a government of their choice. Cyril Ramaphosa at a glance: Cyril Ramaphosa is said to have long held ambitions to be president Born in Soweto, Johannesburg, in 1952 Detained in 1974 and 1976 for anti-apartheid activities Launched the National Union of Mineworkers in 1982 Chairman of the National Reception Committee which prepared for Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990 Became an MP and chairman of constitutional assembly in 1994 Moved full-time into business in 1997, becoming one of South Africa's richest businessmen On Lonmin board during 2012 Marikana massacre Became South Africa's deputy president in 2014 Ramaphosa: The man who wants to make South Africa great The legend goes that he was so upset about not being chosen by Mr Mandela as his deputy following South Africa's first democratic election in 1994, that he did not attend the presidential inauguration, and refused to take up a post in government. He stepped out of the political limelight and went into business. The former trade unionist is now one of the richest politicians in South Africa. Mr Ramaphosa's track record in the private sector has helped him win the backing of the business community. He supports the ANC policy of Radical Economic Transformation - putting more of the economy and land in black hands, in an effort to address the legacy of apartheid. But Mr Ramaphosa has also sought to reassure the business sector, acknowledging the need to ""improve investor confidence"", and stressing the need for ""partnership"". The ANC has battled to fulfil its promise to curb unemployment This is important because South Africa's economy has been in something of a tail-spin in recent years, with several credit-rating downgrades. More than a quarter of the population is unemployed, and more than half live in poverty. The country is one of the most unequal in the world. Mr Ramaphosa has positioned himself as the man who can turn this around. He has also spoken out against corruption and so-called ""state capture"", saying ""If corruption holds our economy back, we must solve the problem of corruption. If state capture holds our economy, we must solve the problem of state capture."" Ten phrases which have entered South African speech under Zuma And he is promising to unify the party, which has been torn apart by bitter rivalry over who should take over from Jacob Zuma as its leader. What he cannot seem to shake off though, is the shadow of Marikana. He is tainted by allegations that he pushed for police action against striking miners at the Lonmin mine in 2012. Thirty-four miners were killed, in what was the worst police shooting since the end of apartheid. At the time Mr Ramaphosa was a director at Lonmin. Emails emerged showing he had called for  ""concomitant action"" to be taken against the striking miners, who had been taking part in a violent, wildcat strike. Families of those killed in the Marikana massacre are demanding justice The leader of the opposition EFF party, Julius Malema, has repeatedly blamed Mr Ramaphosa for the killings, calling him a ""murderer"" and vowing not to let the matter rest. Although Mr Ramaphosa was cleared of any responsibility for the tragedy by a judicial commission, going into an election with the opposition continuing to bring these allegations up is far from ideal. He is also considered by some to be less in touch with ordinary people than his main rival Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, with a support base that is more affluent. And Mr Ramaphosa's critics say the events at Marikana show he does not care about poor people. The choice then for ANC delegates as they prepare to vote, is whether the candidate who seems more likely to steady the markets and rescue the country's troubled economy, is worth the risk of alienating its core support base. She is a medical doctor, and has served in the cabinets of all four of South Africa's post-apartheid presidents. After serving as Minister of Health, Foreign Affairs, and Home Affairs, she went on to become the chair of the African Union Commission - the first woman to lead the organisation. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma at a glance: A leading anti-apartheid activist Fled South Africa and completed medical training in UK Met ex-husband Jacob Zuma while working as a doctor in Swaziland Divorced him in 1998 after 16 years of marriage Declined offer to take place of her sacked ex-husband as deputy president in 2005 Chair of the African Union commission from 2012 to 2016 Dlamini-Zuma: The woman who wants to make history Ms Dlamini-Zuma was born in KwaZulu-Natal, the second most populous province in the country, and which will have a big bearing on the outcome of any general election. Whoever leads the ANC needs to bring votes from this province to guarantee victory. Although it has been said that Ms Dlamini-Zuma lacks charisma, she is considered by many within the ANC to be someone who gets the job done. She is credited with having turned around the performance of the Department of Home Affairs. And the fact that she spent almost two decades in key positions at the heart of government, speaks to her political ability. Women will make up 50% of delegates at the ANC conference Ms Dlamini-Zuma has complained bitterly about being referred to as Mr Zuma's ex-wife, pointing out that she was a politician in her own right. The national broadcaster, SABC, has apologised for doing so, admitting it was ""sexist and demeaning"". Her relationship with Mr Zuma is one of her greatest strengths in this race, and her biggest weakness. Her former husband is a formidable force who can mobilise support for her, particularly at grassroots. And like him she is considered to be down to earth and more able to connect with voters than some of the other candidates. But her detractors argue that Mr Zuma has cut a deal with his ex-wife, backing her candidature to avoid being prosecuted for alleged corruption once he steps down. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes Kinder critics say that as the mother of four of his children, she would find it difficult to make sure he stands trial, even if she wanted to. For those within the ANC who are tired of being hit by one corruption scandal after another, the elevation of Ms Dlamini-Zuma to the top job would be a perpetuation of the status quo. And, they fear, that might be an election loser in 2019. Cyril Ramaphosa - union leader, mine boss, president Ramaphosa heckled at Marikana probe Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma - first female leader?

What you may have missed in US tax plan,"Republicans are hurrying to pass tax reform - leaving uncertainty about some provisions in the bill Republicans are rushing to pass the biggest revamp of the US tax code in decades. And despite promises to simplify the code and eliminate special interest loopholes, the bill is packed with targeted goodies. What makes it into a final compromise between theHouse bill,externaland theSenate bill,externalremains to be seen. In the meantime, here are some provisions you may have missed as lawmakers rush to finalise a plan. New drilling Senator Lisa Murkowski attached a piece of legislation to the tax plan that would allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, located in her home state of Alaska. A man holds a sign during a 2005 rally to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from drilling Securing Senator Murkowski's support for the bill was critical after she broke with Republicans earlier this year on a healthcare repeal effort. Early education The House and Senate bills allow families to save money for education in tax-privileged accounts for children ""at any stage of development"" - including those carried in the womb. That's a provision designed to appeal to pro-life members of Congress. How does the US tax plan compare to other countries? Reality Check: Is Trump right that US has highest taxes? Football fight The bills would do away with a range of privileges enjoyed by sports teams, such as the tax-free status given to professional football leagues. The House bill also strikes at tax-privileged financing for sports stadiums and a perk related to purchases of college athletics tickets. Church power Under current law, nonprofits - including churches and schools - cannot participate in political campaigns and retain their tax-free status. Some groups, including evangelical churches, have chafed at that rule. The House bill moves to reduce that risk, allowing nonprofits to make political statements, assuming they incur minimal expense and are made ""in the ordinary course of the organisation's business"". Brew buzz The Senate bill widens the range of wine producers eligible for tax credits, among other special rules for the beer and wine industry. Production of kombucha - fermented tea that contains small amounts of alcohol - gets a special call-out for exemption from certain taxes, thanks toan amendment,externalintroduced by a Colorado senator. Jet jockeying The Senate bill would exempt firms that manage private jets from having to pay federal excise tax - one of the fees charged on ticket sales of commercial flights. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2012 said private jet services were subject to the tax, but it has since been re-examining how to treat those payments. Citrus squeeze The Senate bill allows firms to expense ""certain costs"" of replanting citrus plants - a win for growers in states such as Florida, where crops have been marred by disease. The citrus industry has been hurt by a disease that affects the trees Florida lawmakers tried to secure this kind of perk in 2016 as a standalone measure. Newman's Own Current law limits how big a stake private foundations can hold in for-profit companies to discourage the creation of fake foundations. The Senate bill removes those limits, provided the business meets certain requirements such as donating all profits to charity. Politico reported,externalthe perk was a priority for Newman's Own, which sells food items including pasta sauce and salad dressing. It is just one example of the pet projects in the bill. Teacher's pet Under the Senate proposal, teachers can deduct up to $500 in classroom purchases - at least through 2025. The perk was introduced in 2002 by Republican Senator Susan Collins, who holds a key vote in passing the bill. It was extended - and doubled - after its elimination in the House proposal. Carried interest During his campaign for president, Donald Trump pledged to eliminate this controversial benefit, which provides managers of companies - including private equity firms - a lower tax rate on money received for overseeing investments. But the perk stands, although the House bill would require that the investment be held for at least three years to qualify for the lower rate, which was intended to encourage ""long-term"" capital investments.

US Republicans agree landmark tax billSenate and House lawmakers reveal final details of the biggest change to the US tax code in 30 years.,"Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, revealed details of the final bill to reporters US Republicans from both houses of Congress have revealed their joint bill for the biggest overhaul of the country's tax system in 30 years. The plan brings the US corporate tax rate down to 21% from the current 35%. The top individual income tax drops to 37% from 39.6%. President Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to cut taxes, and passing the legislation marks a significant victory. He has said he wants the bill signed into law before Christmas. Democrats have argued that the tax cuts will favour only the rich and offer little to the middle class. The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation said on Friday the measures would add as much as $1.4tn (Â£1tn) to the $20tn national debt over 10 years. The Senate and the House of Representatives - which both have Republican majorities - are due to vote on the measures next week. What is in the final version of the US tax plan? Reality Check: Will tax plan hurt Trump? Friday's agreement came after hours of talks in which the bill's supporters sought to win over wavering Republicans. Senator Marco Rubio added his support following changes to child tax credit, reports said. Fellow Senator Bob Corker, who had opposed the original bill, also said he would back the draft bill despite reservations. Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he was ""very excited about this moment"". ""It's been 31 years in the making and took a lot of hard work,"" he told reporters. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The pieces are falling in place for Donald Trump's tax bill, which now seems almost guaranteed to become law. This will certainly satisfy critics within the Republican Party, particularly the big-business donors, who were lamenting Congress's inability to enact even modest parts of their party's legislative agenda. The question, however, is whether the success here will do anything to reverse the president's low poll numbers and dispel the growing consensus that Republicans are in for a rough ride in next year's mid-term congressional elections. At the very least this will make it easier for the party incumbents to survive primary challenges from anti-establishment outsiders who otherwise would have railed against a do-nothing Congress. The tax bill's overall unpopularity according to recent polls, however, may do little to improve the party's standings in the eyes of the general public. Cutting corporate tax rates, whether or not it is in the long-term interest of the nation, is unlikely to capture the imagination of the average American. Republicans are now in a position to fully take credit for a booming economy, however - and they have 11 months to make the case to voters that they deserve to stay in power. The proposed new measures ran into opposition from a senior UN official on Friday, who said they could worsen social inequality in the US. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty who has been on a two-week fact-finding visit to US States, said the tax bill threatened to ""blow apart"" social welfare provision. ""The US Congress is trying desperately to pass a tax bill that, if adopted, would represent the single most dramatic increase in inequality that could be imagined,"" he said.

ANC gathers to choose new leaderA conference will pick a new party leader to succeed South African President Jacob Zuma.1han hour agoAfrica,"Mr Zuma said his ANC party was at a ""crossroads"" South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has called on the African National Congress (ANC) to stop infighting as it decides who will next lead the party. Mr Zuma warned the future of the ANC was under threat, with South Africans ""not happy"" with it. The main contenders to succeed him are the deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, President Zuma's ex-wife. Whoever wins is likely to succeed Mr Zuma as South African president. But their bitter leadership battle has raised fears that the ANC could split before national elections in 2019. President Zuma can remain head of state until those elections. He has been in office since 2009 and South Africa limits the presidency to two five-year terms. The leadership contest is expected to be a close one, with legal challenges a possibility. Who are the main candidates? Why ANC leadership vote matters The trials of Jacob Zuma Addressing delegates at the beginning of a gathering to decide the next ANC leader, Mr Zuma said their movement was at a ""crossroads"". ""Petty squabbling that takes us nowhere needs to take back seat, our people are frustrated when we spend more time fighting among ourselves instead of solving the daily challenges they experience,"" he said. Last year's disappointing results for the ANC in local elections, Mr Zuma said, ""were a stark reminder that our people are not happy with the state of the ANC"". The leading candidates are Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa President Zuma, 75, has been the focus of much controversy and has survived several votes of no confidence in parliament. He faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. In his final speech as ANC president, he asserted that ""theft and corruption"" were as prominent in the private sector as they are in government. He added that ""being black and successful is being made synonymous to being corrupt"". He lashed out at the media, which he said was not ""impartial and fair"". He also targeted the judiciary, arguing that the courts should have no role in deciding internal party matters. For the leadership, President Zuma is backing his 68-year-old former wife, Ms Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran politician in her own right who has been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businesses. This video can not be played What advice should South Africa's ruling party take on board? Mr Ramaphosa, 65, has spoken out strongly against state corruption and has the backing of the business community. Recent news that he had a modest lead in the polls was quickly reflected by a rise in the financial markets. Lebo Diseko, Johannesburg, BBC News Jacob Zuma came out fighting in his speech, hitting out at his critics both inside and outside the party. It seemed like no one was spared - from ANC members who voted with the opposition to try and remove him, alliance partners who have booed him and called on him to stand down, to ""counter-revolutionary forces"" he said were intent on reversing the progress made since 1994, when apartheid was brought to an end. Indeed, that idea of malevolent forces working to bring down both him and the ANC was a thread that ran right through his speech. Mr Zuma placed his fight against his opponents within the wider framework of the fight against apartheid. He ended his speech by saying ""I tried my best"", and of those who tried to bring him down ""I bear no grudges"". He then led the room in song. This was Jacob Zuma in his element: a rousing speaker, a fierce opponent, delivering cutting rebukes with charm and charisma. More than 5,000 delegates are taking part in the four-day ANC elective conference at the Expo Centre in Johannesburg. A vote on the new leader is expected on Sunday. The first major engagement for the new leader will be the party's anniversary celebrations on 8 January. The ANC has governed South Africa since the first democratic election more than 20 years ago. The BBC's Andrew Harding says a question remains whether the ANC is in terminal decline, and what that might mean for South Africa's stability and its future.

UK must not be EU 'colony' after BrexitConservative backbenchers are split over the terms of a transition period once the UK leaves the EU.6m7 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg tells Newsnight the EU's terms for a transition period are unacceptable. A leading Brexiteer has said the UK cannot become a ""colony"" of the EU during the two year transition period after Britain's withdrawal in 2019. EU leaders have agreedBrexit talks can move on, with the UK staying in the customs union, single market and under the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction during the  transition. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said that would be unacceptable. But Tory remainer Ken Clarke said the UK must not ""go off a cliff edge"". The former chancellor told BBC Newsnight that during the transition the UK would continue economically under the current terms, but would have left the union politically. Otherwise, he said it would be a ""disaster"" if come March 2019 negotiations were not finished and the UK would have to resort to tariff and customs barriers. ""I doubt we'd get the planning permission for the lorry parks in time,"" he said. However, Mr Rees-Mogg said leaving under these terms would be ""a ridiculous position to be in"". ""The transition which the EU is offering means that we're still effectively in the European Union for the following two years,"" he told Newsnight. Reality Check: Guidelines for Brexit negotiations Move to head off another Brexit rebellion On Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May hailed an ""important step"" as Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, announced that all 27 EU leaders were happy to move on to the next phase of negotiations. The first issue to be discussed, early next year, will be the details of the expected two-year transition period after the UK's exit. The EU has published its guidelines,externalwhich say: ""As the UK will continue to participate in the customs union and the single market during the transition, it will have to continue to comply with EU trade policy."" The three-page document says the UK will remain under the jurisdiction of the ECJ and be required to permit freedom of movement during any transition period. But Mr Rees-Mogg said such a situation would make the UK ""a vassal"" - or subordinate - state of the EU, having to accept laws ""without any say-so"" from the British people. Mrs May  sufferedher first Commons Brexit defeatearlier this week when MPs voted to give Parliament a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. Former cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the defeat was a ""fuss about nothing"". Sir Oliver, who is backing an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill designed to avoid another rebellion over the timing of Brexit, told Today that he did not believe the vote earlier in the week ""has much of an effect at all."" Among the Tories who rebelled in the vote was Mr Clarke, who told Newsnight his actions had in no way undermined the government's negotiating position.

"Uber used 'undercover agents'A covert unit at Uber snooped on competitors and regulators, says a letter released by a US court.","The letter emerged during Uber's legal battle with Waymo Uber set up a covert unit tasked with stealing competitors' secrets and engaging in undercover surveillance, a letter published by a US court on Friday has alleged. It is critical evidence in Uber's legal battle with Waymo, the self-driving car company that accuses the ride-sharing firm of stealing its technology. The letter, sent by lawyers representing a former Uber employee, sparked an internal investigation when it was sent to Uber in May, but has not been made public until now. In a statement, Uber said: ""While we havenât substantiated all the claims in this letter - and, importantly, any related to Waymo - our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology."" The allegations in the letter were made by Richard Jacobs, who worked at Uber until February this year. He left after an incident in which he felt he was unfairly demoted. Shortly afterwards, he sent the letter alleging the misconduct. ""These tactics were employed clandestinely through a distributed architecture of anonymous servers, telecommunications architecture, and non-attributable hardware and software,"" the letter read. Uber: Scandals that drove Kalanick out What do we know about Uber's new boss? Uber concealed huge data breach Snooping Mr Jacobs settled with Uber for $4.5m (Â£3.4m), and he has since said some of what he wrote was in fact not true, specifically the remarks about Waymo's trade secrets. However, several other details in the letter have already been confirmed, including an incident in whichUber accessed the medical records of a woman who accused an Uber driver of rape. Other allegations include Uber employees posing as protesters in order to gain access to private online chat groups. In one particularly bizarre example, Mr Jacobs alleged that an Uber ""surveillance team"" was deployed to a hotel in order to record and observe conversations between executives at a rival company - the name of which has been redacted from the version of the letter made public. Specifically, those agents wanted to monitor the competitors' reaction to the news that Uber had secured a large amount of funding from a Saudi investor. Angry judge The emergence of the ""Jacobs letter"" has been a dramatic turn of events in the Uber v Waymo trial, which had been due to start earlier this month but has now been delayed until February. Presiding Judge William Alsup was made aware of the letter's existence by the US Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California, which is currently investigating Uber on a range of other matters. In court last month, Judge Alsup chastised Uber's legal team, accusing them of withholding evidence. ""I can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,"" he said. ""Weâre going to have to put the trial off because if even half of whatâs in that letter is true it would be a huge injustice to force Waymo to go to trial."" Internally, Uber is going to great lengths to reassure employees that the old ways of working, under ousted chief executive Travis Kalanick, no longer exist at the firm. ""There is no place for such practices or that kind of behaviour at Uber,"" wrote Tony West, Uber's general counsel, in a note to employees. ""We donât need to be following folks around in order to gain some competitive advantage. Weâre better than that. We will compete and we will win because our technology is better, our ideas are better, and our people are better. Period.""

North Korea must earn right to talks - US,"North Korea's ambassador to the UN, Ja Song Nam, said Pyongyang posed no threat as long as its interests were not infringed upon US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said North Korea must ""earn its way back to the table"" for negotiations between the two countries to restart. Mr Tillerson said Pyongyang had to carry out a ""sustained cessation"" of weapons testing before any talks. It is a U-turn from comments made earlier this week, when Mr Tillerson said the US was ""ready to talk any time time North Korea would like to talk"". That remark was swiftly contradicted by the White House. What missiles does North Korea have? How North Korea could tip the balance North Korea has carried out repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests this year, in defiance of global condemnation and increasingly heavy international sanctions. Earlier this week Mr Tillerson said: ""Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about. ""Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards."" There are reports that Mr Tillerson had planned to repeat his offer of talks without preconditions But his remarks, welcomed by China and Russia, were promptly greeted witha rebuttal from the White Houseand a reiteration that North Korea must admit to abandoning its nuclear weapons before talks resume. Within just a few hours press secretary Sarah Saunders released a statement to reporters saying Mr Trump's views ""have not changed"". ""North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world,"" she said. Trumplomacy- Tillerson's 2018 hopes for North Korea UN urges N Korea to keep channels open On Friday, Mr Tillerson also urged Russia and China to put more pressure on Pyongyang by taking action beyond mere compliance with UN Security Council resolutions. Both countries rejected this. He told the UN Security Council that diplomatic options remained open, but that the US would not bow to North Korean conditions for negotiations. ""We do not accept any relaxing of the sanctions regime as a precondition of talks,"" he said. ""We do not accept the resumption of humanitarian assistance as a precondition of talks.  So we are not going to accept preconditions for these talks."" Also on Friday at the Security Council: Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono said North Korea was not ready to talk and was ""nowhere near ready"" to stop developing weapons UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said it was time to reignite and strengthen communication channels with Pyongyang in order to pursue diplomacy and avoid conflict, the risk of which was being multiplied due to dangerous rhetoric North Korean Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the Security Council session, focusing on North Korea's nuclear programme, was ""a desperate measure plotted by the US being terrified by the incredible might of our Republic that has successfully achieved the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force"" Mixed US messages on North Korea Tillerson's 2018 hopes for North Korea Tillerson hints at future US-N Korea talks UN urges N Korea to keep channels open US 'in race to address N Korea threat' What missiles has North Korea been testing?

Strictly champion to be crownedFour celebrities are in with a shot of lifting the Strictly Come Dancing glitterball trophy.,"This video can not be played Who waltzed off with the Strictly glitterball? Former Holby City actor Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones have lifted the glitterball trophy and been crowned Strictly Come Dancing champions. The pair beat finalists Alexandra Burke, Gemma Atkinson and Debbie McGee and their partners after each couple had danced three times. The Glaswegian, 42, said he had not expected to win ""in a million years"". The final was watched by 13.1 million viewers at its peak, with an average audience of 11.6 million. McFadden, who won the public vote, is the oldest champion of the show, which was in its 15th series. ""It feels completely surreal and I'm so in awe of everyone who started all of those weeks ago,"" he said. He called Jones an ""amazing woman"", adding ""thank you for sticking with me and persevering"". His partner Jones said: ""You did it, you are so brilliant."" Joe McFadden: Child star to dance champion How Strictly has changed finalists' lives Reality Check: Did we predict the finalists? Why some men won't dance Behind the scenes at Blackpool Joe McFadden is the 15th winner of Strictly It was a grand final which featured top-scoring dances from three of the four contestants - only Atkinson missed out. McFadden and Jones performed the final dance of the series, a Charleston, and claimed a perfect score of 40. He finished second on the leaderboard, one point behind singer Burke, with McGee and Atkinson third and fourth respectively, but topped the public vote. Following his final dance, head judge Shirley Ballas said: ""You've done things I never thought you would be able to do. You have truly turned into a magnificent dancer."" Jones was competing in only her second series after finishing sixth last year with former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who tweeted his congratulations following her victory. He hailed his former partner as a ""genius"" and described McFadden as ""brilliant"". Prime Minister Theresa May also tweeted her congratulations to McFadden, along with commiserations to McGee, who lives in her constituency in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Allow Twitter content?

The oldest person to have won previously was BBC presenter Chris Hollins in 2009, at the age of 38. There was a 50/50 chance that this year's winner would be the oldest contestant to be crowned in the show's history with 59-year-old McGee, widow of magician Paul Daniels, also in the final. The star-studded final narrowly missed out on matching last year's viewing figures, which peaked at 13.3 million. Alexandra Burke topped the leaderboard with partner Gorka after two perfect scores in the final During the final, each duo performed a showdance - where there were no rules and contestants were allowed to perform any moves they chose. They also revisited the judges' favourite dance of theirs from the series, as well as their own personal favourite, which was only revealed on the night. Former X Factor winner Burke has impressed the judges throughout the series. Her American smooth set the tone for the night, scoring four 10s, and judge Craig Revel Horwood joked that it was ""absolutely dreadful because I couldn't find a single thing wrong with the routine"".

The oldest person to have won previously was BBC presenter Chris Hollins in 2009, at the age of 38. There was a 50/50 chance that this year's winner would be the oldest contestant to be crowned in the show's history with 59-year-old McGee, widow of magician Paul Daniels, also in the final. The star-studded final narrowly missed out on matching last year's viewing figures, which peaked at 13.3 million. Alexandra Burke topped the leaderboard with partner Gorka after two perfect scores in the final During the final, each duo performed a showdance - where there were no rules and contestants were allowed to perform any moves they chose. They also revisited the judges' favourite dance of theirs from the series, as well as their own personal favourite, which was only revealed on the night. Former X Factor winner Burke has impressed the judges throughout the series.

ANC gathers to choose new leaderA Johannesburg conference will pick a new party leader to succeed South African President Jacob Zuma.,"Mr Zuma said his ANC party was at a ""crossroads"" South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has called on the African National Congress (ANC) to stop infighting as it decides who will next lead the party. Mr Zuma warned the future of the ANC was under threat, with South Africans ""not happy"" with it. The main contenders to succeed him are the deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, President Zuma's ex-wife. Whoever wins is likely to succeed Mr Zuma as South African president. But their bitter leadership battle has raised fears that the ANC could split before national elections in 2019. President Zuma can remain head of state until those elections. He has been in office since 2009 and South Africa limits the presidency to two five-year terms. The leadership contest is expected to be a close one, with legal challenges a possibility. Who are the main candidates? Why ANC leadership vote matters The trials of Jacob Zuma Addressing delegates at the beginning of a gathering to decide the next ANC leader, Mr Zuma said their movement was at a ""crossroads"". ""Petty squabbling that takes us nowhere needs to take back seat, our people are frustrated when we spend more time fighting among ourselves instead of solving the daily challenges they experience,"" he said. Last year's disappointing results for the ANC in local elections, Mr Zuma said, ""were a stark reminder that our people are not happy with the state of the ANC"". The leading candidates are Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa President Zuma, 75, has been the focus of much controversy and has survived several votes of no confidence in parliament. He faces numerous corruption allegations but denies any wrongdoing. In his final speech as ANC president, he asserted that ""theft and corruption"" were as prominent in the private sector as they are in government. He added that ""being black and successful is being made synonymous to being corrupt"". He lashed out at the media, which he said was not ""impartial and fair"". He also targeted the judiciary, arguing that the courts should have no role in deciding internal party matters. For the leadership, President Zuma is backing his 68-year-old former wife, Ms Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran politician in her own right who has been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businesses. This video can not be played What advice should South Africa's ruling party take on board? Mr Ramaphosa, 65, has spoken out strongly against state corruption and has the backing of the business community. Recent news that he had a modest lead in the polls was quickly reflected by a rise in the financial markets. Lebo Diseko, Johannesburg, BBC News Jacob Zuma came out fighting in his speech, hitting out at his critics both inside and outside the party. It seemed like no one was spared - from ANC members who voted with the opposition to try and remove him, alliance partners who have booed him and called on him to stand down, to ""counter-revolutionary forces"" he said were intent on reversing the progress made since 1994, when apartheid was brought to an end. Indeed, that idea of malevolent forces working to bring down both him and the ANC was a thread that ran right through his speech. Mr Zuma placed his fight against his opponents within the wider framework of the fight against apartheid. He ended his speech by saying ""I tried my best"", and of those who tried to bring him down ""I bear no grudges"". He then led the room in song. This was Jacob Zuma in his element: a rousing speaker, a fierce opponent, delivering cutting rebukes with charm and charisma. More than 5,000 delegates are taking part in the four-day ANC elective conference at the Expo Centre in Johannesburg. A vote on the new leader is expected on Sunday. The first major engagement for the new leader will be the party's anniversary celebrations on 8 January. The ANC has governed South Africa since the first democratic election more than 20 years ago. The BBC's Andrew Harding says a question remains whether the ANC is in terminal decline, and what that might mean for South Africa's stability and its future.

"Former PM takes on UK-China investment roleDavid Cameron to lead a Â£750m fund to improve links between Britain and China, says the government.7m8 minutes agoUK","As prime minister, David Cameron said the UK and China were in a ""golden era"" of trade relations David Cameron is to take on a new role leading a UK government-backed investment initiative between Britain and China. The former prime minister will take charge of a Â£750m ($1bn) fund to improve ports, roads and rail networks between China and its trading partners. The government said working with China'sBelt and Road Initiativewould create jobs and boost trade links. It comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond's two-day trip to China. The Belt and Road Initiative was first unveiled in 2013, but this year China's President Xi Jinping pledged Â£96bn ($124bn) for the scheme. The Chinese government said it would invest tens of billions of dollars as part of an ambitious economic plan to rebuild ports, roads and rail networks linking China and its trading partners. President Xi intends on developing ancient trade routes through China and Europe to make it easier for the world to trade with China. China hopes that by improving and creating trade links with other countries - by sea and rail - will help boost its economic growth of the Asian superpower, which has slowed in recent years. A statement from the Treasury also detailed progress on allowing British banks and insurers to access the Asian superpower's bond and insurance markets. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means By Robin Brant David Cameron has adopted a fairly low profile since he left Downing Street last year. He's campaigned for more research into dementia and stuck by the national citizen service he set up in office. Now he'll be involved in investing hundreds of millions of pounds in projects linked to China's awkwardly named Belt and Road Initiative. The private fund will be supported by the British government but won't involve any taxpayer's money. It will focus on projects in the UK and China and countries that China assists in central Asia and Europe. China's plan is not without controversy though as some critics see it as a global push to increase Beijing's political influence and presence. Mr Cameron championed a drive to increase trade ties with China while he was prime minister, marking what both sides now call a ""golden era"". Reuters news agency said the UK and China had agreed to accelerate preparations for a London-Shanghai stock connect programme. But the BBC understand plans to link the London Stock Exchange with its counterparts in Shanghai and Shenzhen remain at the ""research stage"".

Uber used covert 'undercover agents',"The letter emerged during Uber's legal battle with Waymo Uber set up a covert unit tasked with stealing competitors' secrets and engaging in undercover surveillance, a letter published by a US court on Friday has alleged. It is critical evidence in Uber's legal battle with Waymo, the self-driving car company that accuses the ride-sharing firm of stealing its technology. The letter, sent by lawyers representing a former Uber employee, sparked an internal investigation when it was sent to Uber in May, but has not been made public until now. In a statement, Uber said: ""While we havenât substantiated all the claims in this letter - and, importantly, any related to Waymo - our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology."" The allegations in the letter were made by Richard Jacobs, who worked at Uber until February this year. He left after an incident in which he felt he was unfairly demoted. Shortly afterwards, he sent the letter alleging the misconduct. ""These tactics were employed clandestinely through a distributed architecture of anonymous servers, telecommunications architecture, and non-attributable hardware and software,"" the letter read. Uber: Scandals that drove Kalanick out What do we know about Uber's new boss? Uber concealed huge data breach Snooping Mr Jacobs settled with Uber for $4.5m (Â£3.4m), and he has since said some of what he wrote was in fact not true, specifically the remarks about Waymo's trade secrets. However, several other details in the letter have already been confirmed, including an incident in whichUber accessed the medical records of a woman who accused an Uber driver of rape. Other allegations include Uber employees posing as protesters in order to gain access to private online chat groups. In one particularly bizarre example, Mr Jacobs alleged that an Uber ""surveillance team"" was deployed to a hotel in order to record and observe conversations between executives at a rival company - the name of which has been redacted from the version of the letter made public. Specifically, those agents wanted to monitor the competitors' reaction to the news that Uber had secured a large amount of funding from a Saudi investor. Angry judge The emergence of the ""Jacobs letter"" has been a dramatic turn of events in the Uber v Waymo trial, which had been due to start earlier this month but has now been delayed until February. Presiding Judge William Alsup was made aware of the letter's existence by the US Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California, which is currently investigating Uber on a range of other matters. In court last month, Judge Alsup chastised Uber's legal team, accusing them of withholding evidence. ""I can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,"" he said. ""Weâre going to have to put the trial off because if even half of whatâs in that letter is true it would be a huge injustice to force Waymo to go to trial."" Internally, Uber is going to great lengths to reassure employees that the old ways of working, under ousted chief executive Travis Kalanick, no longer exist at the firm. ""There is no place for such practices or that kind of behaviour at Uber,"" wrote Tony West, Uber's general counsel, in a note to employees. ""We donât need to be following folks around in order to gain some competitive advantage. Weâre better than that. We will compete and we will win because our technology is better, our ideas are better, and our people are better. Period.""

Disabled man's cancer care criticisedThe family of disabled man Ian Shaw were told he was dying - now he is responding well to cancer treatment.10h10 hours agoHealth,"This video can not be played Ian's family were told he was dying The failure to offer a learning disabled young man cancer treatment has been described as a shocking example of health inequalities by charities. Ian Shaw was sent home to die, but a doctor queried that decision afterseeing his story on the BBC. Ian, 35, who has since been given chemotherapy, is now doing well. The hospital involved has said his learning disabilities had not been a factor in the decision to put him on end-of-life care. Ian has learning disabilities, autism and epilepsy. In December 2016, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. His parents say they were told by doctors nothing more could be done for him as the cancer had spread too far. In February, he arrived home for what his family believed would be his final few months. Ian, whose behaviour could at times be challenging, spent nearly a decade in secure units, moving between three different places. His family believe in the units he was over-medicated and his health neglected. They had to fight to get him moved to a supported home in the community, it was a few months after the move that the cancer was detected. His parents believe it could have been found the year before when he was treated for a testicular swelling, if there had been a thorough investigation. In July of this year, the BBC reported on Ian's case after it led to a call for the prime minister to appoint a commissioner to champion the rights of people with learning disabilities. Sir Stephen Bubb, who had written two reports for NHS England on secure units, described Ian's case as ""all too typical"" of the continuing failures vulnerable people faced. Dr Justin Wilson was watching the report on the BBC News at Six and Ten. He is a psychiatrist who has also studied treatment of cancer in people with learning disabilities. He asked to be put in touch with the family. Dr Justin Wilson queried Ian's diagnosis He says: ""Knowing that testicular cancer is one of the most treatable cancers that there is, I was surprised that the decision had been made not to provide treatment and I wanted to understand what that was about."" As a result, a second opinion was sought about Ian's treatment. ""My concern was that perhaps judgements were made about the quality of life that he has because of his severe learning disabilities and because of the physical impact of how the cancer has spread,"" says Dr Wilson. ""I'm also clearly aware that providing cancer treatment for someone with the problems that Ian has is a real challenge. ""It is really difficult to give the best possible treatment to somebody in that situation, but my view is those challenges can be overcome."" Ian is now undergoing chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital - and he is doing well. A scan at the end of November showed after four rounds of chemotherapy the tumour, which had spread to his stomach, had shrunk.

Watch: Alternatives to the job interview Hundreds of 'restraint injuries' at special schools Patients with learning disabilities missing out on health checks Boost for 1,000 people with learning disability or autism Ian was a patient at Luton and Dunstable Hospital when his family were told last February that he was terminally ill and could not be treated. In a statement, the University Hospital Trust said a course of chemotherapy had been planned but Ian's condition had then worsened. A range of experts had been consulted and it had been decided he had been too ill to undergo treatment. It added: ""The decision was therefore taken, in consultation with his family, to start palliative care. ""The trust can confirm that Mr Shaw's learning difficulties were not a factor in the decision to move to a palliative care pathway."" Ian's family were told he was dying NHS England says it is working to reduce the health inequalities faced by people with learning disabilities. But neither it nor the Department of Health wanted to comment on Ian's case. NHS policy is that reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure that people with learning disabilities get the medical help they need. In Ian's case, he is put under an anaesthetic for a short time while he is given the chemotherapy. The tumour has affected Ian's spine so he is unable to walk, but after 10 months in bed, in November he was moved into a wheelchair. In a joint statement, the charities Mencap and Challenging Behaviour Foundation said: ""We know 1,200 people with a learning disability die every year when their lives could have been saved had they had access to good quality healthcare at the right time.

Austrian far-right to return to government,"Sebastian Kurz has promised a pro-EU government with the Eurosceptic Heinz-Christian Strache Austria's president has approved a coalition government between the conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party. The deal will make Austria the only Western European state with a governing far-right party, which is opposed to migration and the European Union. The parties previously governed the country together between 2000 and 2005. But at just 31, the People's Party's Sebastian Kurz is set to become the world's youngest head of government. No details have been given about the government's programme, but several important ministerial roles are expected to be handed to the smaller Freedom Party as part of the deal. What propels young leaders to power? President Alexander Van der Bellen gave the green light to the deal on Saturday morning. He said the new government had assured him of both a pro-EU stance and a continued commitment to the European convention on human rights. The election on 15 October failed to yield a conclusive result. The campaign was dominated by Europe's migration crisis, something the anti-immigration Freedom Party has long campaigned about. On the campaign trail, Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache labelled Sebastian Kurz an ""imposter"" Mr Kurz appealed to conservative and right-wing voters with pledges to shut down migrant routes to Europe, cap benefit payments to refugees, and bar immigrants from receiving benefits until they have lived in Austria for five years. But he has promised to form a pro-EU government, despite his coalition partner's traditional Euroscepticism. Bethany Bell, Vienna Unlike most of Europe's populist parties, the Freedom Party has managed to translate its success at the ballot box into real political power. It has been a major player in Austrian politics for decades. In recent years, the party has toned down some of its more extreme rhetoric. But many analysts believe that, in or out of government, it has helped set a right-wing agenda, not just in Austria - but in other countries across Europe as well. Its stance against immigration is becoming more mainstream, along with its populist tone. The Freedom Party accused Mr Kurz of stealing their policies. Their candidate, Heinz-Christian Strache, branded him an ""imposter"". When the far-right Freedom Party last entered a coalition in Austria in 2000, its fellow EU member states froze bilateral diplomatic relations in response. Those diplomatic sanctions were lifted months later, after the move failed to force the Freedom Party out of government and amid fears that continued sanctions could further increase nationalist tensions. That is unlikely to happen again, as resurgent right-wing populist groups have been promoting anti-immigration and Eurosceptic agendas across much of the EU. But unlike the Freedom Party, they have struggled to convert electoral success into real power. Earlier this year, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front party lost the French presidential election comprehensively. Ms Le Pen was defeated by Emmanuel Macron, a liberal centrist and strong supporter of the European Union. Elsewhere, the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party of Geert Wilders was defeated by liberal leader Mark Rutte. In Germany, the nationalist and populist right of Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained seats in the national parliament, where  it is now third biggest party, but it is not in the frame for coalition talks.

Austria country profile,"Austria was a major imperial power in Central Europe for centuries in various state guises, until the fall of its Habsburg dynasty after World War One. But its position at the geographical heart of Europe, and its neutral status during the Cold War between Nato and the Soviet bloc, maintained the much-reduced country's strategic significance. Austria is now a member of the European Union, though not Nato, and an enduring legacy of its decades of post-war neutrality can be seen in the large number of international organisations that call its capital Vienna their home. These include the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Opec, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. For much of the post-war period, so-called ""grand coalition"" governments of left and right wing parties have ruled Austria, although the Social Democrats led by Bruno Kreisky ruled alone in the 1970s. More recently, the centre-right People's Party ruled in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, but this coalition collapsed in May 2019 after a scandal involving the leader of the Freedom Party.

Van der Bellen - a Green Party politician running as an independent - had won a extremely narrow victory in the initial run-off vote against Hofer in May, but the result was annulled because of vote-counting irregularities. In October 2022, Van der Bellen was re-elected president, taking 57% of the vote in the first round. Freedom Party candidate Walter Rosenkranz came second with 18% of the votes, far short of what Hofer received in 2016. Chancellor: Karl Nehammer Interior Minister Nehammer took over on as chancellor and leader of the conservative People's Party in December 2021, following months of turmoil after the resignation of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Mr Kurz's departure was a condition for the Green Party to remain in the governing coalition, pending a corruption investigation. Foreign Minister Alexander von Schallenberg was chancellor in the interim, but resigned to make way for Mr Nehammer when the later assumed the post of People's Party leader in December. Austria's public broadcaster, Oesterreichischer Rundfunk (ORF), has long-dominated the airwaves. It faces competition from private TV and radio broadcasters. Cable or satellite TV is available in most Austrian homes and is often used to watch German stations, some of which tailor their output for local viewers. A daily newspaper is a must for many Austrians. National and regional titles contest fiercely for readers.

Collapsed rape trial accused 'betrayed'Police are accused of failing to disclose vital phone records to the defence before the trial.,"This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape A man whose rape trial collapsed after detectives failed to disclose vital evidence to the defence said he felt ""betrayed"" by police and the CPS. Liam Allan was charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault but his trial collapsed after police were ordered to hand over phone records. The 22-year-old student said his life had been ""flipped upside down"" and he wanted lessons to be learned. The Met Police said it was ""urgently reviewing this investigation"". The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when the evidence on a computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim pestered him for ""casual sex"". Met review after rape trial collapse Police evidence failings 'harm cases' He told the BBC his life had been ""torn away"" by the process, which included being on bail for two years. ""You just think the worst case scenario... People have to start planning for life without you,"" he said. Mr Allan faced a possible jail term of 12 years and being put on the sex offenders register for life had he been found guilty. He said he felt ""pure fear"" when he learned he had been accused of rape but would never be able to understand why the accusations were made. The 22-year-old student had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault ""There was no possible real gain from it other than destroying somebody else's life... It's something I will never be able to forgive or forget."" But he said he wanted to use his experience ""to change the system"". ""This wasn't a case of people trying to prove my innocence, it was a case of people trying to prove I was guilty,"" Mr Allan said. This video can not be played Rape prosecutor: It's just sheer incompetence It is understood police had looked at thousands of phone messages when reviewing evidence in the case, but had failed to disclose to the prosecution and defence teams messages between the complainant and her friends which cast doubt on the allegations against Mr Allan. Prosecution barrister Jerry Hayes accused police of ""sheer incompetence"" over the case. Before the trial the defence team had repeatedly asked for the phone messages to be disclosed but was told there was nothing to disclose. Mr Hayes, who demanded the messages to be passed to the defence, said he believed the trial had come about because ""everyone is under pressure"". ""This is a criminal justice system which is not just creaking, it's about to croak,"" he said.

She said it was ""amazing"" the case had got to the stage it did ""but it's not uncommon"" because of problems with disclosure. A Met spokesman said the force was ""urgently reviewing this investigation and will be working with the Crown Prosecution Service to understand exactly what has happened in this case. ""The Met understands the concerns that have been raised as a result of this case being dismissed from court and the ongoing review will seek to address those,"" he said. A spokesman for the CPS said: ""In November 2017, the police provided more material in the case of Liam Allan. Upon a review of that material, it was decided that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.

'Shocking apathy' to fraternity drinking,"Several fraternity members are still facing charges related to the death of Tim Piazza (centre) A committee probing the Pennsylvania State University's response to drinking in fraternities has issued a blistering report following a student's death. A grand jury found on Friday that administrators displayed a ""shocking apathy"" to dangerous levels of drinking and hazing in university social clubs. The report claims officials knew of the dangers but did nothing. The report says Tim Piazza, a 19 year old who died last February after binge drinking, ""did not have to die"". Penn State officials have yet to comment on the damning report. The findings say officials ""were aware of the excessive and dangerous alcohol abuse indulged by fraternities, such that it was only a matter of time before a death would occur during a hazing event"". The deadly problem with US fraternities ""The university bears the ultimate responsibility for the failure to supervise the safety of its students involved in the fraternity system,"" the report says, adding that although the university's actions were not themselves illegal, their ""inaction set the table to allow these criminal acts to occur"", which caused Piazza's death. Tim Piazza, from New Jersey, was left unconscious for hours and suffered internal injuries after falling down steps during an initiation ritual. He later died in hospital. Other members of the fraternity waited nearly 12 hours to call an ambulance, and were charged with manslaughter, although the most serious charges were later dropped. Officials say he was fed 18 drinks in a period of one hour and 22 minutes, and that he never obtained the drinks on his own. Hazing at the school, the report found, is ""rampant and pervasive"" and encourages ""sadistic"" rituals that reach ""peaks of depravity"". The jury calls for ""profound changes on college campuses and communities in Pennsylvania"", and for universities to ensure protections for younger students wishing to join fraternities, and sororities - which together are known as campus Greek social life. Other US universities have taken measures recently to protect students who are seeking to join social clubs. On Thursday, a University of Houston fraternity in Texas was indicted for hazing, with officials charging that students were deprived of adequate food, water and sleep during a three-day initiation event. The president of Florida State University told the Associated Press on Thursday that there is currently no timeline for reinstating campus Greek activities there, after they were suspended in November following a student's death.

The beautiful flower with an ugly past,"It looks simple - a pretty blue cornflower - but this plant is causing controversy in Austria.   It's the chosen flower of the far-right Freedom Party, even though it was once associated with the Nazis. Dieter Dorner takes a long sip of hisGemischtes, a mix of dark beer and lager, and smiles. We are sitting in an inn in Untersiebenbrunn, a little town east of Vienna, where he is a councillor for the far-right Freedom Party. Over a meal of sausage, chips and locally grown white asparagus, he tells me about a planned dance. In true Austrian fashion, it's to be a ball - the local Freedom party's first Cornflower Ball,Der Kornblumenball. ""We've never had a Freedom Party Ball in Untersiebenbrunn before,"" he explains. ""So we said to ourselves, let's do something, let's have a ball. The band will play dance music. My favourite is the slow waltz."" A poster for the Austrian Freedom Party's Cornflower Ball The ball was arranged last September, but the timing is felicitous, because these days the Freedom Party in Untersiebenbrunn has a lot to celebrate. In the first round of voting in Austria's presidential election in April, 53% of people here voted for the Freedom Party candidate, Norbert Hofer. Dotted through the town's leafy streets are the blue Freedom Party campaign placards and posters for the Kornblumenball, featuring a silhouette of a dancing couple in evening dress. ""Hasn't there been some controversy about the blue cornflower?"" I ask. ""Something to do with the Nazis?"" Dieter shakes his head. ""The cornflower is simply the Freedom Party flower and we like it,"" he says. ""To discuss what happened 80 years ago, or what didn't happen or perhaps happened doesn't bring us forward. There is certainly nothing deliberately nasty about it."" From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 But other Austrians are not so sure. ""The cornflower is a complicated symbol,"" Vienna historian, Bernhard Weidinger, tells me. ""It was the German Kaiser Wilhelm's favourite flower, and was used by pan-German nationalists in the 19th Century. ""Then between 1934 and 1938, when the Nazis were a banned party in Austria, it was the secret symbol they used to wear in order to recognise each other."" Austrian Freedom Party members Heinz Christian Strache and Martin Graf, 2008 Nowadays, it's traditional for Austrian MPs to wear a flower in their buttonholes at the opening of parliament, he explains. The colour of the Freedom Party is blue, so they wear a cornflower. ""You are not a neo-Nazi if you wear a cornflower,"" he continues. ""But it is fair to say that the Freedom Party cultivates a certain ambivalence when it comes to the past."" Their presidential hopeful, Norbert Hofer, continues to face sharp criticism about his occasional choice of floral decoration. In response to a question last week, he declared that he wanted nothing to do with the Nazis, and wouldn't let them take away things like the cornflower. Latin name:Centaurea cyanus,also known as bachelor's buttons Native to the Mediterranean and Europe National flower of Estonia Worn in France as a ""le bleuet"" a symbol of remembrance akin to the poppy in the UK The Freedom Party has moved on a long way from the heyday of its firebrand leader, Joerg Haider, who died in a car crash in 2008. Back in the 1980s and 90s, Haider openly praised aspects of the Third Reich. These days, Freedom Party members who veer in that direction are quickly silenced or removed from their posts. A day or so later I fall into conversation with a young man called Michael, in a park in Vienna. It's a balmy spring evening, the chestnut trees are in bloom, and in the distance a jazz band is playing a free concert on an open-air podium. ""What do you think about the Freedom Party and the cornflower?"" I ask. ""I hate those people,"" he replies. ""And the cornflower isn't great. But you know, I'm not quite as worried about their attitude towards the past as I am about their attitude to what's going on now. Their barely-concealed racism, their rhetoric against Muslims and refugees is really wrong."" A demonstrator at an anti-Hofer rally in Vienna holds up an image of the cornflower He looks around at a family playing with their well-groomed dogs. ""And the other thing that bothers me,"" he says, ""is that they are working on people's fears and encouraging our worst instincts. Like Donald Trump does. Austria is better off than most countries in the world. It's safe - and in general life is pretty good here. But to hear the Freedom Party talk, you'd think we were living in some desperately difficult country."" He shrugs. I think back to my conversation with Dieter in the comfortable little town of Untersiebenbrunn. I had asked him if the Freedom Party was deliberately stirring up fears to gain votes. ""We don't create people's concerns, we express them,"" he had said. ""We're worried about our future. When you have a lot, you also have a lot to lose.""

North Korea must earn right to talks - USSecretary of State Rex Tillerson toughens his stance after earlier offering talks with no preconditions.,"North Korea's ambassador to the UN, Ja Song Nam, said Pyongyang posed no threat as long as its interests were not infringed upon US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said North Korea must ""earn its way back to the table"" for negotiations between the two countries to restart. Mr Tillerson said Pyongyang had to carry out a ""sustained cessation"" of weapons testing before any talks. It is a U-turn from comments made earlier this week, when Mr Tillerson said the US was ""ready to talk any time time North Korea would like to talk"". That remark was swiftly contradicted by the White House. What missiles does North Korea have? How North Korea could tip the balance North Korea has carried out repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests this year, in defiance of global condemnation and increasingly heavy international sanctions. Earlier this week Mr Tillerson said: ""Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about. ""Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards."" There are reports that Mr Tillerson had planned to repeat his offer of talks without preconditions But his remarks, welcomed by China and Russia, were promptly greeted witha rebuttal from the White Houseand a reiteration that North Korea must admit to abandoning its nuclear weapons before talks resume. Within just a few hours press secretary Sarah Saunders released a statement to reporters saying Mr Trump's views ""have not changed"". ""North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world,"" she said. Trumplomacy- Tillerson's 2018 hopes for North Korea UN urges N Korea to keep channels open On Friday, Mr Tillerson also urged Russia and China to put more pressure on Pyongyang by taking action beyond mere compliance with UN Security Council resolutions. Both countries rejected this. He told the UN Security Council that diplomatic options remained open, but that the US would not bow to North Korean conditions for negotiations. ""We do not accept any relaxing of the sanctions regime as a precondition of talks,"" he said. ""We do not accept the resumption of humanitarian assistance as a precondition of talks.  So we are not going to accept preconditions for these talks."" Also on Friday at the Security Council: Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono said North Korea was not ready to talk and was ""nowhere near ready"" to stop developing weapons UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said it was time to reignite and strengthen communication channels with Pyongyang in order to pursue diplomacy and avoid conflict, the risk of which was being multiplied due to dangerous rhetoric North Korean Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the Security Council session, focusing on North Korea's nuclear programme, was ""a desperate measure plotted by the US being terrified by the incredible might of our Republic that has successfully achieved the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force"" Mixed US messages on North Korea Tillerson's 2018 hopes for North Korea Tillerson hints at future US-N Korea talks UN urges N Korea to keep channels open US 'in race to address N Korea threat' What missiles has North Korea been testing?

But in a passage added during the past week, it invites the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to ""continue internal preparatory discussions"" on future relations rather than having to wait until March to do so. Tory rebels defeated the government on Wednesday Sources have told the BBC that the government is highly likely to accept an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill next week to see off another potential Commons defeat for Theresa May. Conservative rebels have been concerned about plans to put the Brexit date and time - 11pm on 29 March 2019 - into law. Backbenchers, including former minister Oliver Letwin, have tabled an amendment, suggesting a change to the legislation. Ministers are likely to accept their plan, which is a change that some of the potential rebels have been asking for, the BBC understands. Senior sources are confident they can see off a defeat, after No 10 said there were no plans to take the date out of the bill.

Austrian far-right to return to governmentCentre-right leader Sebastian Kurz will become the world's youngest national leader under the deal.1han hour agoEurope,"Sebastian Kurz has promised a pro-EU government with the Eurosceptic Heinz-Christian Strache Austria's president has approved a coalition government between the conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party. The deal will make Austria the only Western European state with a governing far-right party, which is opposed to migration and the European Union. The parties previously governed the country together between 2000 and 2005. But at just 31, the People's Party's Sebastian Kurz is set to become the world's youngest head of government. No details have been given about the government's programme, but several important ministerial roles are expected to be handed to the smaller Freedom Party as part of the deal. What propels young leaders to power? President Alexander Van der Bellen gave the green light to the deal on Saturday morning. He said the new government had assured him of both a pro-EU stance and a continued commitment to the European convention on human rights. The election on 15 October failed to yield a conclusive result. The campaign was dominated by Europe's migration crisis, something the anti-immigration Freedom Party has long campaigned about. On the campaign trail, Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache labelled Sebastian Kurz an ""imposter"" Mr Kurz appealed to conservative and right-wing voters with pledges to shut down migrant routes to Europe, cap benefit payments to refugees, and bar immigrants from receiving benefits until they have lived in Austria for five years. But he has promised to form a pro-EU government, despite his coalition partner's traditional Euroscepticism. Bethany Bell, Vienna Unlike most of Europe's populist parties, the Freedom Party has managed to translate its success at the ballot box into real political power. It has been a major player in Austrian politics for decades. In recent years, the party has toned down some of its more extreme rhetoric. But many analysts believe that, in or out of government, it has helped set a right-wing agenda, not just in Austria - but in other countries across Europe as well. Its stance against immigration is becoming more mainstream, along with its populist tone. The Freedom Party accused Mr Kurz of stealing their policies. Their candidate, Heinz-Christian Strache, branded him an ""imposter"". When the far-right Freedom Party last entered a coalition in Austria in 2000, its fellow EU member states froze bilateral diplomatic relations in response. Those diplomatic sanctions were lifted months later, after the move failed to force the Freedom Party out of government and amid fears that continued sanctions could further increase nationalist tensions. That is unlikely to happen again, as resurgent right-wing populist groups have been promoting anti-immigration and Eurosceptic agendas across much of the EU. But unlike the Freedom Party, they have struggled to convert electoral success into real power. Earlier this year, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front party lost the French presidential election comprehensively. Ms Le Pen was defeated by Emmanuel Macron, a liberal centrist and strong supporter of the European Union. Elsewhere, the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party of Geert Wilders was defeated by liberal leader Mark Rutte. In Germany, the nationalist and populist right of Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained seats in the national parliament, where  it is now third biggest party, but it is not in the frame for coalition talks.

Disabled man's cancer care criticisedThe family of disabled man Ian Shaw were told he was dying - now he is responding well to cancer treatment.2h2 hours agoHealth,"This video can not be played Ian's family were told he was dying The failure to offer a learning disabled young man cancer treatment has been described as a shocking example of health inequalities by charities. Ian Shaw was sent home to die, but a doctor queried that decision afterseeing his story on the BBC. Ian, 35, who has since been given chemotherapy, is now doing well. The hospital involved has said his learning disabilities had not been a factor in the decision to put him on end-of-life care. Ian has learning disabilities, autism and epilepsy. In December 2016, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. His parents say they were told by doctors nothing more could be done for him as the cancer had spread too far. In February, he arrived home for what his family believed would be his final few months. Ian, whose behaviour could at times be challenging, spent nearly a decade in secure units, moving between three different places. His family believe in the units he was over-medicated and his health neglected. They had to fight to get him moved to a supported home in the community, it was a few months after the move that the cancer was detected. His parents believe it could have been found the year before when he was treated for a testicular swelling, if there had been a thorough investigation. In July of this year, the BBC reported on Ian's case after it led to a call for the prime minister to appoint a commissioner to champion the rights of people with learning disabilities. Sir Stephen Bubb, who had written two reports for NHS England on secure units, described Ian's case as ""all too typical"" of the continuing failures vulnerable people faced. Dr Justin Wilson was watching the report on the BBC News at Six and Ten. He is a psychiatrist who has also studied treatment of cancer in people with learning disabilities. He asked to be put in touch with the family. Dr Justin Wilson queried Ian's diagnosis He says: ""Knowing that testicular cancer is one of the most treatable cancers that there is, I was surprised that the decision had been made not to provide treatment and I wanted to understand what that was about."" As a result, a second opinion was sought about Ian's treatment. ""My concern was that perhaps judgements were made about the quality of life that he has because of his severe learning disabilities and because of the physical impact of how the cancer has spread,"" says Dr Wilson. ""I'm also clearly aware that providing cancer treatment for someone with the problems that Ian has is a real challenge. ""It is really difficult to give the best possible treatment to somebody in that situation, but my view is those challenges can be overcome."" Ian is now undergoing chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital - and he is doing well. A scan at the end of November showed after four rounds of chemotherapy the tumour, which had spread to his stomach, had shrunk. Ian's mother, Jan, says: ""Especially when I thought there was no treatment and no cure, it was just a waiting game, but now there is hope."" Watch: Alternatives to the job interview Hundreds of 'restraint injuries' at special schools Patients with learning disabilities missing out on health checks Boost for 1,000 people with learning disability or autism Ian was a patient at Luton and Dunstable Hospital when his family were told last February that he was terminally ill and could not be treated. In a statement, the University Hospital Trust said a course of chemotherapy had been planned but Ian's condition had then worsened. A range of experts had been consulted and it had been decided he had been too ill to undergo treatment. It added: ""The decision was therefore taken, in consultation with his family, to start palliative care. ""The trust can confirm that Mr Shaw's learning difficulties were not a factor in the decision to move to a palliative care pathway."" Ian's family were told he was dying NHS England says it is working to reduce the health inequalities faced by people with learning disabilities. But neither it nor the Department of Health wanted to comment on Ian's case. NHS policy is that reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure that people with learning disabilities get the medical help they need. In Ian's case, he is put under an anaesthetic for a short time while he is given the chemotherapy. The tumour has affected Ian's spine so he is unable to walk, but after 10 months in bed, in November he was moved into a wheelchair. In a joint statement, the charities Mencap and Challenging Behaviour Foundation said: ""We know 1,200 people with a learning disability die every year when their lives could have been saved had they had access to good quality healthcare at the right time. ""Failures to train healthcare professionals on how to support patients with a learning disability and the refusal to involve families in key decisions about their loved one's health continue to contribute to this scandal of unequal health treatment.""

Unilever sells margarine business for Â£6bn,"Unilever has agreed to sell its margarine and spreads business, which include Flora and ProActiv, to private equity giant KKR for â¬6.8bn ($8bn; Â£6bn). The move follows a wide-ranging review of its business which was prompted by a takeover attempt by rival Kraft. Unilever said it would look for a buyer of the spreads business in April. At the time, it said the firm would step up its cost-cutting, aiming for a 20% margin by 2020. It said the margarine business was a ""declining segment"" that could be ""better managed by others"". As well as Flora and ProActiv, it also owns I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and Bertolli. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, said: ""The announcement today marks a further step in reshaping and sharpening our portfolio for long term growth. ""I am confident that under KKR's ownership, the spreads business, with its iconic brands, will be able to fulfil its full potential as well as societal responsibilities."" Unilever's other household names include Persil, Domestos and Hellman's mayonnaise. It operates across more than 190 countries. The deal is expected to be completed in the middle of next year, and is subject to regulator approval in certain jurisdictions.
