Proposed David Bowie memorial unveiled,"The proposed memorial would stand 9m high opposite the entrance to Brixton Tube station A crowdfunding campaign to erect a permanent memorial to David Bowie has been launched by a team of south London designers. The campaign aims to raise just under Â£1m in the next 28 days to fund the art installation opposite Brixton Tube station. It follows calls for various memorials to be erected to the musician, who died in January 2016. Thousands of pounds was pledged within hours of the launch of the campaign. Bowie's last live performance was in 2006 The proposed memorial takes its inspiration from the flash on Bowie's sixth album, Aladdin Sane, which was released in 1973. The artists said the blue and red steel memorial - nicknamed the ZiggyZag - would be ""embedded in the Brixton pavement"" and rise to three-storeys - or 9m - high. The Bowie mural in Brixton has become a focal point for fans since the singer's death last year The proposed site would be five streets from Bowie's Stansfield Road birthplace and next to Jimmy C's internationally famous Aladdin Sane mural, which has become a focal point for tributes since the artist's death. Situated on Tunstall Road, opposite Brixton Tube station, it would be likely to be the first thing most visitors to Brixton would see when completed. The artists worked with Bowie's team in London and New York. It also has the support of Lambeth Council, which began discussing the possibility of a permanent memorial with Bowie's family last year. Lambeth Council leader Lib Peck called the proposed memorial ""bold and ambitious"". She added: ""Brixton has become central to David Bowie's huge legacy, so what better place for this stunning and imaginative memorial to this locally-born legend."" The crowdfunding campaign hopes to raise just under Â£1m within 28 days in order to create the memorial The design team behind the project, This Ain't Rock'n'Roll, previously designed the ""Brixton Pound"". The currency, which features David Bowie on its Â£10 note, was launched in 2009 to support businesses in the area.

"Policeman helps girl, 10, with homework","Lt BJ Gruber (right) went above and beyond the call of duty when he answered this appeal for help (left) from Lena Draper, 10 Every child knows when you are in trouble, you call the cops. But it is fair to say, no police officer expects that trouble to be related to the complexities of a 10-year-old's maths homework. Yet when faced with just such an issue, one brave officer in Marion, Ohio, stepped up to the mark. Lena Draper decided to use Facebook to get in touch with her local police force, sending them an appeal for help at the weekend. ""I am having trouble with my homework. Could you help me?"" she asked. ""What's up?"" asked officer BJ Gruber, who told the BBC he was hoping ""for something in the realm of history"". Unfortunately for him it was maths, with the added complication of a few brackets. Undeterred, Lt Gruber threw himself into the challenge. Unfortunately, Lt Gruber's second answer was less correct ""I felt pretty confident with my answers on both questions and perhaps that worked against me with the second equation,"" Lt Gruber admitted. Indeed, more than a few people have pointed out the answer he gave to the second, more complicated question, was incorrect - but the Police Department in Marion, Ohio, are still seeing the episode as a win. ""We are nailing our goals of increasing trust, transparency & being approachable. Still a work in product on the math skills,"" the force wrote on its Twitter page after Lena's mum Molly uploaded screenshots of the conversation to Facebook. The post has now been liked more than 2,300 times. ""We really hope that are are not flooded with homework requests... so far, so good,"" Lt Gruber said. ""We really see this not different that a child walking up to an officer on the street and asking for help. This is just a 21st Century version of that interaction. We do however encourage kids to communicate with parents, teachers, siblings and fellow students before asking us."" As for Lena, she knows she can't always rely on the police to help her with her homework. But she does have a backup plan. ""Well, I'd call Ghostbusters then,"" she toldInside Edition,external.

Accessing the world,"This video can not be played Ricardo Shimosakai: ""I can go through all sorts of problems so that other wheelchair users don't have to"" Ricardo Shimosakai has been to 25 countries and 200 holiday destinations. But he sometimes finds it difficult to travel in his home country, Brazil. Ricardo has been a wheelchair user since 2001, when he was shot after an attempted kidnapping. He is now a tourist agent who specialises in finding holiday packages for people with mobility issues. He believes all tourists - regardless of any disability they may have - should be able to go anywhere they please, and not just to destinations with good standards of accessibility. But sometimes that is easier said than done. ""One time flying back from Argentina, I had to sit inside the plane for more than one hour in Sao Paulo. The company did not have anyone to help me get off the plane,"" he says. Ricardo is determined to improve the tourist experience for people with mobility issues The sad part, he says, is that this was not an isolated incident. It happens repeatedly to virtually all wheelchair users who fly in Brazil. One of the main differences with the US or European countries is that Brazilian airports do not have a dedicated company to assist passengers in wheelchairs. That task is left to each airline, some of them with very poorly trained staff. The level of service to passengers in wheelchairs is always left to chance. ""In Brazil, our accessibility conditions are too precarious. People with disabilities are not seen as consumers,"" says Ricardo. Infrastructure in Europe and the US is generally much more accessible than that in Brazil It is not just airports and planes that are below international standard. The whole infrastructure is poor, even in big cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Ricardo once had a request for a travel package for a group of 22 people from Israel - 10 of whom were wheelchair users. ""There is no transport company in Brazil that can assist 10 people in wheelchairs at the same time. Also no hotels would be able to house all of them together. We would have to split them into three hotels, far away from each other,"" says Ricardo. ""I never heard from the Israeli group again."" The BBC's business and economics unit is looking at how businesses work with people with disabilities and how disabled people have made business work for them A range of stories will feature across online, TV and radio from 20-24 February 2017 On Twitter and Facebook you can follow the hashtag #DisabilityWorks and at the end of the week you can download theOuch podcast Disability Works: Breaking down barriers in business More Disability stories If that group had wanted to go to France, on the other hand, Ricardo would have been better placed to assist them. He offers a package for groups of up to 14 people. There they use the same bus, see all sights together and spend the night in the same hotel. Ricardo has made a career out of fighting for change. It is hard for him to offer good holiday packages to his clients - as he does not own the airports, buses and hotels. Ricardo offers holiday packages for disabled groups to see the sights of Paris But he can reach out to the owners and authorities to demand better infrastructure, and has won awards for his work. ""In Brazil people will only act to help out others with disabilities out of obligation or pity. No-one sees the person with disability as a proper consumer, as they are seen abroad. Other countries earn billions of dollars offering services to this niche. But not here."" It is estimated that more than 24 million people have some sort of disability in the country, although there is little detail about that number. Statistics show that people with disabilities are at an economic disadvantage in Brazil - they have higher unemployment rates and a lower level of education. ""Even if you have money, many things are denied to you if you have a disability,"" says Andrea Koppe, from Unilehu, a non-governmental organisation that helps people with disabilities. ""Some schools won't take in children with special needs, saying they lack the preparation and specialisation. Others say parents have to pay extra for special tutors, in the case of visually impaired students."" Brazil has been trying to change that with affirmative action. Since 1991, legislation requires companies with more than 100 employees to give at least 2% of their jobs to people with disabilities. Accessible route? Ricardo has scaled the heights of Machu Picchu as part of his research Andrea Koppe says that over the course of 20 years, that has helped transform many disabled people who were once ignored by shops and companies into proper consumers. The number of people with disabilities in the labour market rose from 15,000 to 350,000. Still, she says that if the affirmative action law had been followed fully and properly, that number should be more than a million. Overall there are 11 million people of working age with disabilities - and most of them are unemployed. Ricardo Shimosakai says there is much work to be done by everyone. He is still trying to convince Brazilian authorities of the importance of changing regulation. The country is about to privatise some of its airports. The tourist agent would like to see contracts that demand airport administrators hire specialised firms to assist disabled passengers, as happens elsewhere. But from his own experience, most businesses don't have the energy to promote change. The wheelchair he uses was given to him by an airline as compensation. The company had broken his because staff did not have a proper way to transport it. ""I tried talking to them,"" he says. ""But instead of properly training their staff, they just thought it would be easier to buy me a new one. They don't want to change things.""

Inexcusable inaction,"In the pre-dawn darkness of a February morning in 1917, a ship carrying hundreds of black South African men was sunk in the English Channel.  But this was no act of war. A Royal Mail cargo ship had ploughed full speed into the SS Mendi - and its captain inexplicably did nothing to help. Who were these men and - 100 years later - has there been a lasting legacy from their deaths? The vast majority of those who drowned or died from hypothermia were South Africans recruited to work as manual labourers on the Western Front. Many had signed up hoping they would win more political freedoms if they demonstrated their willingness to help the British Empire's war effort. More than 800 members of the South African Native Labour Corps were on board the Mendi at the time of the disaster The Mendi had already completed a 34-day journey from Cape Town when it sailed past the Isle of Wight in foggy weather on 21 February. At about 05:00 GMT, a Royal Mail packet-boat, the SS Darro, ploughed into the Mendi at full speed, smashing a 20ft (6m) hole on her starboard side. It ripped through to crowded holds where men were sleeping in tightly-packed tiers of bunks. A total of 646 people died. Only 267 survived the sinking; 195 black men, two of the four white officers and 10 of the 17 white NCOs. From the safety of the Darro, Captain Harry Stump stood by and watched - but for reasons that are still murky, did nothing to save the lives of the men. Why didn't he help? King George V inspected the South African Native Labour Corps at Abbeville on 10 July 1917 The SS Darro sustained only minor damage and there was plenty of room on board,according to the official investigation,external. Survivors were instead picked up by the destroyer HMS Brisk and then other ships. South African historian Professor Albert Grundlingh, said it was difficult to explain Cpt Stump's actions. ""It's shrouded in mystery,"" he said. ""At a tribunal Cpt Stump said it was dark, and he couldn't see in the conditions. Maybe he was confused or lost his nerve. ""Was is because the men were black? There has certainly been speculation to that effect, but no firm conclusion. In South Africa, people believed that."" The SANLC was formed in response to a British request for manual workers on the Western Front. The men were to have become part of a huge multinational labour force. Their role was to build the railways, trenches, camps and roads upon which the Allied war effort depended. They were not allowed to bear arms, were kept segregated, and were not eligible for military honours. Following the disaster, bodies continued to be washed up on both sides of the Channel for several weeks. The news of the sinking reached South Africa two weeks after it happened. Prime Minister General Louis Botha rose in parliament to inform the nation, and the house unanimously carried a motion conveying ""parliament's sadness"". Botha praised the labour corps for ""doing everything possible"" in the war and for their ""loyalty to the flag and the King"". This deference did not stretch to awarding medals to any of the black servicemen - living or dead - from the South African Native Labour Force. Such honours were reserved for white officers only. The wreck of the SS Mendi has been designated an official military maritime grave In the years that followed, the disaster was not made much of in South Africa. Indeed, some African National Congress (ANC) leaders viewed war veterans as ""sell-outs"", according to Prof Grundlingh, and felt ""embarrassed"" about black military service. Col Daisy Tshiloane, a former member of the ANC's military wing, said she had learned the story of the Mendi in ""ANC camps"". Speaking as a South African deputy defence advisor in 2014, she said she found it ""very hurtful"" that ""so many black African lives meant nothing"". The story was not included in school curriculums set by the country's white rulers but was passed on from generation to generation, says author Fred Khumalo. ""It's a huge gap in our history,"" says the writer of Dancing the Death Drill, a novel based on the sinking. The book's title comes from an unconfirmed but persistent anecdote about Reverend Isaac Wauchope Dyobha, a pastor on the ship. Reverend Isaac Dyobha reportedly told sailors, ""You are going to die, but that is what you came to do"". He was a prominent member of a group of East Cape African intellectuals, who encouraged their compatriots to join the Labour Corps in the hope the show of loyalty would benefit black people politically. The story goes that he told the doomed men: ""Be quiet and calm, my countrymen, for what is taking place now is exactly what you came to do. ""You are going to die, but that is what you came to do. ""Brothers, we are drilling the drill of death. ""I, a Xhosa, say you are all my brothers, Zulus, Swazis, Pondos, Basutos, we die like brothers. ""We are the sons of Africa. ""Raise your cries, brothers, for though they made us leave our weapons at our home, our voices are left with our bodies. He then led them in a barefoot dance - the ""death drill"" - drumming their feet on the deck as the ship wallowed and sank. The Hollybrook memorial in Southampton lists the names of many of the Mendi victims Historians have varyingly described the legend as ""pure nationalist mythology based on African oral tradition"" or containing a ""solid core of truth"". Other stories of heroism include that of Joseph Tshite, a schoolmaster from near Pretoria, who encouraged those around him with hymns and prayers until he died. A white sergeant was supported by two black compatriots, who swam with him and found place for him on a raft. This video can not be played A total of 646 men died in the tragedy - most of them members of the South African Native Labour Corps The site of the wreck was discovered by an English diver in 1974 and an official memorial was erected by the South African government in 1986 at Delville Wood in France. By then, South Africa's black majority had lived under decades of apartheid rule, the hopes that loyalty in WW1 would lead to greater political rights having been long dashed. However, in post-apartheid South Africa, the story is now better known. A Mendi medal for bravery was established in 2003 and a modern South African navy ship bears its name. A memorial for the SS Mendi in Simon's Town, South Africa And the controversy over the actions - or lack of - by Cpt Stump rumbles on. He was found entirely to blame for the sinking. An official report ruled he was going too fast and had not sounded a warning whistle in the fog. According to Prof Grundlingh, the captain never explained why he did not help the stricken men on board the Mendi, nor express any regret or remorse. Yet despite calls for him to be jailed, the only sanction he faced was to have his licence suspended for a year. ""He must have heard the cries proceeding from the water for hours [after the accident],"" the report into the disaster said. ""There was nothing to have prevented him from sending boats on the then smooth water... had he done so, many more lives would have been saved. ""His inaction was inexcusable.""

Thaw on pause,"Iran-US hostility eased under President Obama but is threatening to intensify again Are the US and Iran heading for a new confrontation? After a turbulent first three weeks in which President Donald Trump described Iran as ""the world's number one terrorist state"" and put it ""on notice"", it is a question many are asking. For Iranians with connections in the United States, these are worrying times. Of the seven majority Muslim countries named in President Trump's January travel ban (frozen pending a legal review), Iran is the one with the largest US-based diaspora, the most overseas students and the highest number of people travelling on visitor visas. After the ban was announced, BBC Persian received hundreds of messages from anxious Iranians whose lives have been plunged into uncertainty. They come from all walks of life - research students, LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) refugees and grandparents on family visits - and many are worried the story is far from over. ""Last year our family applied to migrate to the US,"" wrote Bardia, a 16-year-old from the persecuted Bahai religious minority. ""Now there's a big hold-up in the process."" But since President Trump moved into the White House it is not just Iranians with travel plans who are feeling unsettled. Across the country people are asking themselves if he will really deliver on his promise to ""rip up"" the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and ""triple-up"" sanctions. And if the war of words between Washington and Tehran continues, what will the impact be on Iran's presidential elections this May? On the campaign trail Donald Trump dismissed the Iran nuclear deal as ""disastrous"", but Iran experts say comments by his new Secretary of Defence James Mattis are probably the best indicator of what lies ahead. ""I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement,"" Mr Mattis told a Senate committee in January. ""But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it."" It is possible the Trump administration could push to toughen up the deal, says Gary Samore, former Obama White House Co-ordinator for Arms Control, ""But they will quickly find out any renegotiation of the agreement will require the US to offer additional sanctions relief."" The Isfahan uranium conversion plant - the US has vowed to robustly police the nuclear deal Many point out the US is not the only signatory to the deal. If Mr Trump walks away he will risk alienating the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Russia, which would make enforcing any new sanctions more difficult. But there are more subtle ways of undermining the agreement, says Nader Hashemi, of the Centre for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver. ""I suspect Trump will try to strictly enforce the nuclear deal, hoping that Iran will break the agreement and thus be blamed internationally for it."" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and his hardline supporters have been relatively muted in their response to President Trump. It has lead some to suggest it might actually suit them to have a more confrontational president in the White House. For someone used to rallying his supporters with denunciations of the ""Great Satan"", Mr Khamenei clearly feels on familiar ground responding to tougher rhetoric from Washington. ""We appreciate Trump! Because he largely did the job for us in revealing true face of America,"" he Tweeted recently. Some hardliners actually see Mr Trump as a man they could do business with, says Mohsen Milani, an Iran specialist at the University of South Florida. ""They believe he is a practical, non-ideological businessman and a good deal-maker who would be willing to negotiate with Tehran."" One person for whom Mr Trump's ascendancy is less welcome is President Hassan Rouhani. He is standing for re-election in May, and the accelerating war of words between Washington and Tehran casts a long shadow over his two biggest achievements - securing the nuclear deal and improving relations with the US. As the election campaign gets under way Mr Rouhani's hardline opponents will seek to use the Trump administration's actions to undermine him. US-Iran tensions could work against President Rouhani's re-election bid ""If the [travel] ban is a sign of a general line towards Iran with additional measures, then it certainly could affect the elections,"" says Trita Parsi, of the National Iranian-American Council. But whether the hardliners will succeed is open to question. Even if the tangible benefits of the end of sanctions have yet to be widely felt in Iran, the prospect of the country returning to the international stage and opening up for business has given hope to millions of ordinary voters. It is clear they do not want to see these achievements reversed. Since Mr Trump's travel ban thousands of young Iranians have taken to Twitter using the hashtag #LoveBeyondFlags to reach out to Americans. And among the traditional anti-American slogans on display at the annual rally to commemorate the Revolution in Tehran last week there were some in English with a rather different message: ""Americans are welcome and invited to Iran"". In the months to come foreign policy concerns will also influence US-Iranian relations. Both the US and Iran are currently supporting Iraqi forces in the crucial battle to recapture Iraq's second city of Mosul from so-called Islamic State. It is not in the interests of either side to jeopardise this. If President Trump delivers on his pledge to mend fences with Russia that could also impact on the US relationship with Iran. Trump has warned Iran over its long-range missile tests (file photo) ""Tehran's biggest fear is that Trump will seek to move Russia away from Iran in order to open space for Russia-America co-operation in Syria and across the Middle East,"" says Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute. Going forward there will be many possible flashpoints for tension between Iran and the US. Iranian ballistic missile tests, more unilateral US sanctions, stand-offs between the Iranian and US navies in the Gulf, and between US-backed and Iran-backed militia forces in Iraq will all test the relationship. ""Over time the [nuclear] deal may unravel because of these,"" says Gary Samore. ""But I think it's unlikely either side will immediately abrogate the agreement. The US benefits from the constraint on Iran's nuclear programme and Iran benefits from the sanctions relief.""

Officer chases swan down motorway,"After a failed attempt to fly away the swan was captured This is the moment a traffic officer chased a ""stubborn"" swan down a motorway. The obstinate bird caused a bottleneck on the M27 in Hampshire when it swanned onto the eastbound carriageway, blocking two lanes. After a failed attempt to fly away, the swan was rescued and ""safely taken away"", Highways England said. Swan Lifeline said the birds can often mistake roads for rivers in wet weather. Highways England tweeted a picture of the bird holding up traffic at junction 11, near Fareham, at about 08:00 GMT. The agencytweeted,external: ""Two lanes are closed on the #M27 eastbound within J11 due to a stubborn swan on the carriageway!"" The bird blocked two lanes on the eastbound carriageway Swan Lifeline said the birds can often mistake roads for rivers in wet weather Swan Lifeline is working with the RSPCA and Hampshire Police, which sent officers to the scene. It has advised the force to take the swan to a rescue centre near Portsmouth. Manager Richard Stokes said: ""Swans think the motorway is a river when it has been raining and the tarmac is wet, which is why it was running up and down the carriageway."" Recently, the rescue of a swan from a motorway in Gloucestershire by two police officers was likened to something out of spoof film Hot Fuzz,after they posted a selfie with the bird in their vehicle. Other animals have also caused chaos by wandering into unexpected places, including last month when a cowblocked a rail line between Southampton and Brockenhurst,external.

Jeepers creepers,"This video can not be played Angelina Jolie taught Yalda Hakim how to cook bugs in Cambodia Angelina Jolie cooked up a storm while promoting her latest film in Cambodia by eating bugs with her kids. The actress was seen frying a scorpion and eating the leg of a spider which she said had a ""really good flavour"". Eating creepy crawlies has been long associated with the TV show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. But should we all be more like Angelina and swap our bacon for bugs? It's estimated that by 2050 the world will be home to nine billion people, meaning current food production will need to almost double. As the population grows, there's been a real push to look at sources of food - particularly protein - other than your traditional meat and fish. Eating insects is said to be one way of meeting this challenge because they are environmentally sustainable, nutritious and can be harvested relatively cheaply and easily in the right conditions. It's estimated that two billion people worldwide eat insects as part of their traditional diet, but Western countries have yet to catch up. There is a ""yuck factor"",says the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP),external. It says Western attitudes towards entomophagy - humans eating insects - are negative because bugs are seen as unclean and disease-carrying. The rise of agriculture and a change in lifestyle in Western societies has also led to insects being seen as ""pests"",says the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),external. Mosquitoes and flies invade homes and bite, termites destroy wood, and some insects end up as unwanted extras in restaurant meals - all of which trigger a ""disgust"" reaction, it added. However, there has been a slow shift in attitudes with the art of eating bugs being considered a novelty, which has seen a rise in their purchase as an unusual gift. Insects can be sprinkled onto pizza as a topping ""They are the original superfood,"" says Shami Radia, co-founder ofGrub,externalwhich sells a range of edible bugs. ""They are high in protein, minerals and amino acids so it makes sense to eat them."" Insects are also better for the environment than conventional livestock farming. They can feed on bio-waste, produce less greenhouse gases, use less water and take up less land than animals. Bugs also have what's called a high feed conversion efficiency because they are cold-blooded. On average, insects can convert 2kg of feed into 1kg of insect mass, whereas cattle require 8kg of feed to produce 1kg of body weight gain. There are around 1,900 different species of insects that have been used as food, according to the FAO. The most commonly eaten insect groups include beetles, caterpillars, bees, wasps, ants, grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, termites, dragonflies and flies. Despite such a variety of insects being available though, UK suppliers have focused on a more limited choice with the most popular being crickets, mealworms, locusts and grasshoppers. Grasshoppers - the new sushi? Grub sellers believe the UK is a long way from embracing spiders and scorpions on our dinner plate. ""We have to take baby steps,"" says Mr Radia. ""It's not something we would sell. You've got to think about what insects to push and what will get people into eating grubs. ""You have to think of the consumer journey. You can start off with cricket powder because you can't actually see the insect and hopefully it will make people more comfortable with eating insects as a whole."" So far, the UK market has seen pop-up shops and restaurants incorporate insects into more traditional dishes such as buffalo worm macaroni cheese, meal worm bolognaise, chocolate cherry cricket brownies or sprinkled on a pizza. They are also marketed as an on-the-go snack that would sit alongside your roasted peanuts or chia seeds. Bug sellers say there has been a real shift in the popularity of edible bugs. Nick Cooper, owner ofCrunchy Critters,externalwhich was set up in 2012, has seen a sales growth rate of 25% year on year with products being sold to schools as well as gyms. He notes there is a particular boom around Halloween and the festive period. ""People are much more aware of eating insects,"" he said. ""There's not that shock horror factor now. The market is definitely heading in the right direction. It won't be an overnight change and will probably be led in the future by youngsters."" Mr Radia believes that eating insects will one day become as popular as eating sushi. ""Behaviour can be changed,"" he said. ""Prawns are ugly and taste delicious and there's no reason why eating insects can't be normalised."" Grasshoppers - the new sushi?

Hens housed,"Stickers have started to appear on boxes of free range eggs announcing that the hens that laid the eggs have been kept, temporarily, in barns ""for their welfare"". So what are the rules around the free range status - and what do recent changes mean for farmers and consumers? There are four different types of eggs sold in the UK, all of which are stamped on the carton for you to see: organic, free range, barn-reared, and caged. To be classed as a free range egg, the hen laying it must have had unlimited daytime access to runs - fenced areas - with vegetation and at least four square metres of outside space per bird. The hens are then kept in barns with bedding and perches overnight, with nine birds allowed per square metre. Yes. Towards the end of 2016, there was an outbreak of avian flu - or bird flu - across Europe. Farmers hoped it would never make it to British shores, but in December the H5N8 strain of the disease was found in some wild and farmed birds in the UK. As a result, on 6 December the government'sDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) issued a prevention zone orderin England, making farmers keep their birds inside to stop the spread of the disease. Similar restrictions were introduced in Scotland and Wales. After the flocks were taken indoors, companies selling the eggs started to put stickers on their products, or signs in shops, to let consumers know animals were being ""temporarily housed"" during the outbreak. However, this is only a temporary solution. Rules from the European Commission (EC) state that after 12 weeks of hens being housed indoors, their eggs cannot be marketed as ""free range"" and instead would become ""barn-reared"". The current Defra order runs until 28 February, after which the majority of farmers are expected to be allowed to let their hens back out. Some shops, including Co-op, are putting up signs to tell customers about the rules But farmers forced to continue following the order after this date will no longer be able to call their eggs ""free range"". For now, the stickers and signs are within regulations, but the situation has been described as ""fluid"" by retailers and it is uncertain how long stickers can be used after the end of the month, instead of full package redesigns. There is much debate in the industry as to whether free range eggs taste any different to those from caged or barn-reared hens. While high-profile chefs like Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall sing the praises of letting hens loose around the farm, taste inevitably remains subjective. But there are no health concerns for consumers during the avian flu outbreak, according to the government and producers. Retailers have told the BBC that the prices - up to twice as much as caged hens' eggs - will remain static for now. A spokesman for Sainsbury's said the cost to their suppliers would not change, so prices would stay put to support them - although the supermarket expects few of its suppliers to continue to be affected after the end of the month. But farmers know they cannot continue to charge a premium forever if their hens stay indoors. The National Farmers Union (NFU) has warned of a potentially ""huge impact"" on the free range sector and is ""very concerned"" for its members. Places that sell products containing eggs, including Boots, are also putting up signs It is lobbying the EU decision makers to extend the 12-week rule. But, according to the British Egg Industry Council, its demands have had no impact so far. According to the Daily Mail,external, farmers in Holland are already in the process of re-labelling free range eggs and poultry after losing an appeal against the EU to extend the 12-week rule. Three quarters of farms will be allowed to let free range birds back outside by the end of February, according to Defra. However, farmers will have to continue with extra bio-security measures, including fencing off ponds. Bird flu is also transmitted via the environment, for example in wild bird droppings, making strict bio-security vital, says chief veterinary officer Nigel Gibbens. Precautions include: putting up netting keeping food and water inside, and disinfecting footwear and equipment after contact with birds And concern about avian flu persists in high-risk areas. The remaining quarter of farms can expect the emergency rules to stay in place - thereby affecting some producers' claims to free range status. Some smaller farms will, however, be able to allow hens outside under netting, meaning their eggs can be classed as free range.

Coyle leaves Championship club Blackburn,"Owen Coyle lost just under half of his matches in charge of Blackburn Blackburn Rovers manager Owen Coyle has left the Championship side by mutual consent after eight months in charge. The 50-year-old took over at Rovers in June 2016, but won just 11 of 37 games. Blackburn are 23rd in the table, three points from safety, in a season which has also been marred by fan protests against the club's owners, Venky's. ""The decision has been taken to give the club the best possible chance of climbing to a position of safety in the Championship,""said a club statement.,external Coyle's last game was the2-1 defeatin the FA Cup fifth round by Manchester United on Sunday. Assistant manager Sandy Stewart, first-team coach John Henry and goalkeeping coach Phil Hughes have also left Ewood Park. Blackburn's next game is away to fellow Championship strugglers Burton Albion on Friday - with Rovers winless on the road since November. The club have said that the search for new manager will begin with ""immediate effect"". BBC Radio Lancashire's Andy Bayes Owen Coyle's appointment was never going to be a success in the eyes of the supporters. The abuse from the travelling support directed at him in the recent draw with Rotherham was vociferous and I understand that his position was very much hanging in the balance from then on. Coyle can rightly claim that he wasn't backed in terms of budget. He was given Â£250,000 to spend in the summer while he recouped in excess of Â£10m and the January transfer window saw him frustrated that the club failed to land his list of potential targets. The fact that Rovers haven't been higher than 20th all season is the reason behind his departure. Financially they can ill afford relegation to League One, and whoever comes in has 15 games to save them. Since the takeover of the club by Venky's in November 2010, the club are now looking to appoint a seventh permanent manager.

Hospital saves baby hippo at Harambe zoo,"Doctors from a children's hospital have helped save the life of a premature baby hippo at Cincinnati Zoo. The ailing baby, named Fiona, had become dehydrated after refusing milk and required an urgent intravenous drip. Fiona was born six weeks early to 17-year-old hippo Bibi on 24 January. At birth she weighed 13 kg (29 lbs), which the zoo says is about half the previous lowest recorded birth weight for her species. The normal range is 25-54 kg and at almost a month old she does not yet weigh 25 kg. Zoo staff, who have beenblogging about the little hippo's progress,external, said last week that she was teething. The discomfort may have made her bottle feeding uncomfortable, they said. Pictured: Baby hippo starts teething Lovelorn red panda escapes from US zoo London Zoo counts every animal When she grew sick and lethargic, the local Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center stepped in to help rehydrate her. ""Preemies have very tiny and unstable veins, and even though our vet team was able to get multiple IVs placed, the veins could not sustain the IV and would blow,"" said the zoo's curator of mammals Christina Gorsuch. ""Lucky for us, we're right next door to a world-class facility with a whole department dedicated to working with difficult veins."" Staff from Cincinnati Children's Hospital joined zoo carers to help revive Fiona Two members of the hospital's vascular team brought ultrasound equipment to the zoo on Friday and put an IV catheter into Fiona. It lasted just 30 minutes before her vein ruptured, but the team were able to secure a line into one of her deep leg veins. Keepers have been monitoring the IV round the clock since then. ""Five bags of fluid later, Fiona is showing signs of recovery,"" Ms Gorsuch said. ""She is still sleeping a lot but has started to take bottles again and has periods of carefully-supervised activity. The catheter is still in place."" Baby Fiona is being cared for close to her mother Bibi and father Henry, so the family can hear and smell each other. She made the history books even before her arrival, when scientists at the zoo captured the first ever ultrasound image of a Nile hippo foetus. The Vascular Access Team were delighted to help the diminutive beast, whose growing pains have charmed fans online. ""Like many people, we are rooting for Fiona!"" said clinical director Sylvia Rineair. Zoo staff have been bottle feeding Fiona to help her gain strength The hippo calf is being kept near her parents so they can hear and smell each other Cincinnati Zoo was in the news last year over the fatal shooting of gorilla Harambe after the animal grabbed a four-year-old boy who had fallen into his enclosure. The shooting last May sparked angry reaction and prompted a social media backlash that saw the zoo temporarily delete its Twitter account. How a dead gorilla became the meme of 2016 Fiona isn't the first of Cincinnati's animal residents to get help from the local children's hospital. In 2015, Ali the aardvark had CT and MRI scans at Cincinnati Children's after suffering from eye trouble. The multi-talented team have also helped baby gorillas, and consulted on a polar bear pregnancy test.

Driver proves parking bays 'too small',"Jago Lawless said drivers have to adjust their parking to get in and out of their cars, which resulted in his front wheel being ""an inch, two inches over the line"" A motorist has had a fine for parking over the line of a bay overturned after he proved the spaces were ""too small"". Jago Lawless, 46, was fined Â£80 for not parking his Hyundai i10 within a bay at Southampton Central station about a week ago. After receiving the ticket, the naval architect measured the space and said it was ""too small for an average-size car"". South West Trains said some spaces at the station would now be repainted. According to theBritish Parking Association, there is no legal minimum size for parking bays, but there is a design standard which is 15.7ft (4.8m) in length and 7.8ft (2.4m) in width. ""When I first measured the entrance into the car parking bay, it measured at about 2.4m,"" Mr Lawless said. ""But because they've angled the parking bar over, the parallel width between the lines is actually only 1.978m wide, which is too small for an average-size car."" Mr Lawless measured the space after receiving an Â£80 fine for not parking within the white lines Mr Lawless added: ""I couldn't believe that, having parked such a small car, that I could not have parked it properly. ""Because they are at an angle, they are too small - they're far too narrow and they're not long enough. ""You have to adjust parking your car to enable you to get in and out of the car."" South West Trains said the 21 angled spaces at the 182-space car park would be repainted South West Trains said the spaces at the car park were set up prior to any recommendations on parking bays being issued. In a statement, it said: ""Now this issue has been raised, we will be re-marking the small number of angled spaces in this car park to increase their width."" It said the penalty issued to Mr Lawless had also been withdrawn.

Faster drugs?,"Developing new drugs to fight major diseases can take years and cost billions of dollars Developing a drug from a promising molecule to a potential life-saver can take more than a decade and cost billions of dollars. Speeding this process up - without compromising on safety or efficacy - would seem to be in everyone's interests. And cloud computing is helping to do just that. ""Cloud platforms are globally accessible and easily available,"" says Kevin Julian, managing director at Accenture Life Sciences, Accelerated R&D Services division. ""This allows for real-time collection of data from around the world, providing better access to data from inside life sciences companies, as well as from the many partners they work with in the drug development process."" All pharmaceutical drugs are tested on animals first before humans Clinical trials - testing how a new drug works on people once you've tested it on animals - are a crucial part of this process. But they can be very complex to organise and run. There are three main phases, starting with a small group of healthy volunteers, then widening out to larger groups who would benefit from the drug. ""A big phase three trial will cost anything from $30m-$60m (Â£24m-Â£48m) for a pharma company,"" says Steve Rosenberg, general manager of Oracle Health Sciences Global Business Unit. These trials may be conducted over 30 to 50 countries and involve hundreds or even thousands of patients - this takes a lot of time and money. Genomics is driving the development of more targeted drugs rather than ""blockbusters"" ""Patient recruitment has always been the number one problem,"" says Mr Rosenberg. And as drug development targets more specific groups of people, largely thanks to the insights coming from genomics, finding the right patients for such clinical studies is becoming even harder. This is where the cloud can help. ""With cloud and related technologies, we are now able to mine real-world data to find patient populations better, and utilise globally available technology to conduct trials in an even more distributed and inclusive manner,"" says Mr Julian. Cloud and increasing digitalisation is also helping to improve the efficiency of data collection and analysis. ""Data collection used to be very inefficient, with data being written on paper forms, faxed and then entered into computers manually,"" explains Tarek Sherif, co-founder and chief executive of Medidata, a company that has developed a cloud platform for clinical trials. ""Then it had to be double-checked for errors. It could take up to a year before you could draw any conclusions from the patient data."" The demand for cheap medicines is often at odds with drug companies' need to make a profit Digitising the process and automating the checking process in the cloud has reduced this time to ""one to two weeks,"" says Mr Sherif. And cloud offers many additional advantages to pharma companies, says Mr Rosenberg. ""These days health data is coming from a wide variety of sources, like labs, wearable devices, electronic diaries, health records. Pharma companies can't necessarily handle all the data that's coming in to them. ""So cloud computing helps them do that and gives them a whole bunch of other advantages - the technology is kept up to date, you get the latest security, the latest features and so on."" A spokesman for pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) told the BBC: ""Advances in computing and data analytics are providing new opportunities to improve the efficiency of our research and increase our understanding of a disease or a patient's response to medication."" Finding the right patients for a clinical trial is time-consuming and costly Speeding up the clinical trial process also cuts costs. ""We were able to save one of our clients about 30% on the cost of running a trial,"" says Mr Sherif, whose firm facilitates nearly half of all clinical trials in the world and counts 17 of the top 25 pharma companies as clients. And Accenture's Mr Julian says: ""We've seen overall savings of 50% - in some cases up to 75% - on the historically labour-intensive parts of the drug development process."" Of course, not all prospective drugs work, or they're shown to work but not any better than existing drugs on the market. ""So the Holy Grail is to fail faster so you're not failing in the very final phases of drug development when you've already spent most of your money,"" says Mr Sherif. Winning regulatory approval for a drug is only half the battle. Pharma companies also have to convince health services and insurance companies that's it's worth paying for. This means collecting reliable patient data. In the past, patients were often asked to keep written diaries of their experiences with a drug being tested, but these were ""horribly inefficient"", says Mr Sherif. Wearable health trackers are increasingly helping to monitor patients' vital signs So the rise of electronic diaries and wearable devices is helping to improve the evidence a pharma company can present in defence of their latest drug. With this is mind, Oracle is helping add ""mHealth"" capability to Accenture Life Sciences' cloud platform. And GSK says: ""We've been conducting clinical studies with biosensors and mobile devices for some time. ""Today's digital technology is enabling us to collect and analyse data in new ways - monitoring activity and vital signs in patients, and collecting patient feedback in real time, improving the quality of data we use in the development of new medicines."" The cloud is also encouraging more pharma companies to co-operate on molecule development [the building blocks of a potential drug], says Mr Rosenberg, as well as on data analysis. And all this anonymised patient data - historical and recent - can potentially be shared in the battle to combat disease. Discovering new molecules that could be developed in to drugs is still very difficult ""We are seeing clients increasingly use 'virtual studies' - using external and historical data to perform advanced statistical analysis and reduce the need for complicated, costly site-based study activity,"" says Accenture's Mr Julian, citing a collaborative Alzheimer's project between some of its clients and the Coalition Against Major Disease.

What future for E numbers after Brexit?,"Thinking about E numbers might stir up images of hyperactive children guzzling fluorescent soft drinks. But have you ever wondered what the E stands for? Looking at this system of food additives can help illustrate some of the tough issues facing the British government as it prepares to leave the European Union. The European Council introduced food colouring legislation in 1962 alongside a number classification system. In the 1990s the scheme was expanded to cover all additives permitted to be used in food sold in the EU and now forms a key part of UK food and drink regulation. The government wants to begin formal Brexit negotiations by the end of March, after which UK laws will be made ""not in Brussels but in Westminster"", according to Prime Minister Theresa May. So will the UK ditch E numbers and come up with a new system for assessing and labelling food additives? And what about the many other areas of UK regulation currently set by EU law? For a substance to be permitted for use as a food additive in the EU, it must be given an E number (the E stands for Europe). Codes like E101, E150d and E1209 are assigned to substances which change food colour, taste, shelf life or other properties. For example E160b, or annatto, gives Red Leicester cheese its distinctive glow. E numbers are often associated with processed food. Some, like E122, may have adverse effects on children prone to hyperactivity according to the NHS. But most are perfectly benign and lots are good for us, like E300, otherwise known as Vitamin C. At the moment if a food company comes up with a new additive, it must seek authorisation from an expert panel at the European Food Safety Authority. This EU body is made up of scientists from across the continent, including two from the UK. They are experts in chemistry, toxicology and other relevant fields and meet regularly to assess which additives are safe. Once agreed, these substances must be clearly labelled on food sold in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. As part of the Brexit process, the government has announced it will introduce a ""Great Repeal Bill"" in the next Queen's Speech. This will remove the European Communities Act 1972 from the statute book and enshrine all existing EU law into British law, before the government decides which to keep and which to jettison. This is likely to include EU regulations on food additives and labelling. However such an approach opens up a number of other questions. For example, what would happen when the EU changes its list of E numbers - will the UK adopt or ignore the new rules? If it adopts them, how does this square with the government's wish that laws be made in Westminster and if it ignores E number changes, will domestic food companies be able to trade freely with European suppliers? Brexit: All you need to know UK warned over ""divide and rule"" Brexit Lords urged not to ""cave in"" over Brexit Reality Check: Four claims in Tony Blair's speech The government says it will push for the ""freest possible trade"" with the EU after Brexit. But if the UK decided to keep E numbers while not being under the jurisdiction of European courts, there would need to be a new system whereby the EU's remaining 27 states could verify that UK goods observe the rules, says Stephen Weatherill, professor of European law at Oxford University. ""It is beyond complicated - and this is true of thousands and thousands of such matters,"" says Prof Weatherill. But not everyone agrees. ""Some of the academics are making it more complicated than they need to,"" says Conservative MP Bill Cash, who chairs the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee and is a long-standing supporter of Brexit. He says the UK may choose to adopt standards like E numbers, but on the basis of voluntary compliance rather than by submitting to the EU's legal jurisdiction, enforced by the European Court of Justice. There are many other unresolved questions when it comes to E numbers. How will standards set by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation be incorporated, will the UK set up its own expert panel and will E numbers be renamed - ""UK numbers"" perhaps? Nobody is quite sure of the answers yet. These uncertainties hang over many areas of UK law which currently come from the EU, like farm subsidies, clean energy targets and fishing rules. But if non-EU Switzerland is a model, we may simply retain many existing structures. Switzerland uses E numbers and belongs to lots of similar schemes like the European Health Insurance Card. ""There may not be as much change as people are trying to suggest there would be,"" says Mr Cash. The Brexit negotiations will involve plenty of big constitutional issues, but there are many apparently smaller things, like E numbers, which will need to be sorted out as well.

Are business rates figures misleading?,"The claim:The government's figures on business rates are misleading because they exclude inflation and an appeals adjustment. Reality Check verdict:The figures do exclude both those things, but government publications specify that they do. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome. The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business. The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes."" The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year. But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again. They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points. Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"". This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.

Who will be Britain's next top cop?,"The UK's next top police officer will be chosen on Wednesday. The final four candidates for Metropolitan Police Commissioner will face interviews with Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Policing Minister Brandon Lewis. The Commissioner is not only the head of policing in London. He or she also has a range of national responsibilities including leading on counter-terrorism, national security policing, protection of the royal family and parliamentarians and major public events. That means the job is not just about how to deploy the 31,000 police officers across the capital - but also how to deal with the complex challenges of keeping Britain and London's streets safe. So who are the final four candidates for one of the toughest jobs in policing anywhere in the world? Cressida Dick is one of the country's most experienced and well-known chief police officers who isn't actually working as one. In 2014 she left Scotland Yard to take up a highly sensitive and undisclosed director-general post at the Foreign Office. If the 56-year-old is selected to be the next commissioner, it will mean for the first time that all three top policing jobs in the UK are held by women: the Met Commissioner, the head of the National Crime Agency and the president of the National Police Chief's Council. Ms Dick joined the Met in 1983 after graduating from Oxford University. She first came to public prominence when she was the senior officer in charge of the operation in July 2005 that led to the mistaken killing of Jean Charles de Menezes as a suspected suicide bomber. When the force was later prosecuted for breaching health and safety laws, the jury in the case said they believed there was ""no personal culpability"" for then Commander Dick after listening to her evidence. In 2009 she became the first woman to be appointed an assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police, becoming the national lead for counter-terrorism across the UK. Her other experience includes taking on internal reforms of Scotland Yard and being one of the two senior officers in charge of security at the London 2012 Olympic Games. Sara Thornton became the first chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) in 2015 when it replaced the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo). It is the co-ordinating body for all of the police forces in England and Wales, bringing together all the chief officers to thrash out national policies on everything from investigating murders to modernising the workforce. That means that she has been at the heart of the extremely complex challenges of changing the way police are recruited, trained and prepared for how their role is changing as crime does in the 21st century. She joined the Metropolitan Police in 1986 after studying at Durham University and in 2000 went to neighbouring Thames Valley Police as an assistant chief constable. Seven years later she was made chief constable before becoming vice-president of the NPCC in 2011. Shortly after taking over at the NPCC she warned that in the future the public should not expect to see a police officer after some burglaries. She told the BBC that budget cuts and the changing nature of criminality meant the police had to prioritise and there had to be a conversation with the public about where limited police resources should be focused. Stephen Kavanagh is the chief constable of Essex. He began his policing career with the Metropolitan Police Service in 1985 as a constable in Leyton in East London. As a detective sergeant he worked in homicide and the then anti-terrorist branches and rose up the ranks to become area commander for North London. Before that, he was part of the team that had to come up with the force's action plan and response to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, which had branded the Met institutionally racist. His other roles inside Scotland Yard have included working as a commander in counter-terrorism after the 2005 attacks on London and designing anti-corruption plans to root out crooked officers. In 2011 he became the public face of the Metropolitan Police during the August riots that followed the shooting of Mark Duggan. As deputy assistant commissioner he also had responsibility for the politically-charged investigations into phone hacking and payments to public officials by journalists. Mark Rowley is the only one of the four candidates currently working inside Scotland Yard - and the only one to have started his career with another force. After graduating from Cambridge, he joined West Midlands Police in 1987 and, after serving as a detective, joined the then National Criminal Intelligence Service, one of the predecessors of the National Crime Agency. While he was there, Mr Rowley worked on developing covert techniques to target major organised crime gangs that work across the UK and other countries. In 2009 he was appointed chief constable of Surrey, nine years after joining the force and having been in the chair temporarily since 2008. Two years later he was recruited to the Metropolitan Police as an assistant commissioner - the rank inside the force broadly equivalent to a chief constable outside of London. During his five years inside Scotland Yard he has been one of the public faces of the force. He has talked widely about terrorism threats - including the changes to counter-terrorism strategy in the wake of the Paris attacks. When an inquest jury concluded that Mark Duggan had been lawfully killed by firearms officers in 2011, AC Rowley was the officer who gave a statement outside the court amid a barrage of chants from the dead man's supporters.

Who is internet 'supervillain' Milo Yiannopoulos?,"Writer Milo Yiannopoulos at one of his controversial university speaking engagements in the US Ultra-conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos has been uninvited from speaking at a US conservative conference, which will also host President Donald Trump, after footage emerged of him appearing to condone paedophilia. Mr Yiannopoulos has denied the allegations, but is known to thrive on provoking offence and controversy. Publisher Simon & Schuster has announced it iscancelling his forthcoming book, Dangerous, after the latest outcry. The writer calls himself the ""most fabulous supervillain on the internet"". His critics call him a purveyor of hate speech. This video can not be played 'Alt-right is unstoppable,' says Milo Yiannopoulos Mr Yiannopoulos blamed ""sloppy editing"" and ""usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour"" for creating the wrong impression of his views on paedophilia. ""I would like to restate my utter disgust at adults who sexually abuse minors,"" the 32-year-old wrote on Facebook. However, the American Conservative Union (ACU), which organises the influential Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, said his response was ""insufficient"". ACU chairman Matt Schlapp said the invitation to speak at the CPAC this week had been rescinded. ""We urge him to immediately further address these disturbing comments,""he said.,external President Donald Trump is speaking at the event on Friday. Milo Yiannopoulos is a British writer and editor, based in the US. Born to a Greek father and British mother, he grew up in Kent in the south of England. In July 2016, he was banned from Twitter for what the social media company referred to as ""inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others"". It came after he took aim at Leslie Jones, a black actress in an all-female Ghostbusters reboot, andshe received a barrage of abuse from other Twitter users. Milo Yiannopoulos tweets about Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones (far left) were blamed for encouraging a stream of racist abuse He has also been widely criticised for comments he has made about transgender people, Muslims, Black Lives Matter activism, feminists and gay people, even though he is openly gay. He co-founded online technology magazine The Kernel in 2011 and sold it in 2014, after running up large debts and encountering legal battles with writers who sued for unpaid earnings. In 2015, he was appointed as a senior editor at Breitbart News, a right-wing US website that has been criticised for racist and misogynist content. Milo Yiannopoulos has written columns titled ""Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy"" and ""Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?"" Colorado Springs police make a barrier between protesters against Milo Yiannopoulos, who are on the right, and those going to hear him speak at University of Colorado in January 2017 When presidential candidate Hillary Clinton read those headlines out disdainfully at one of her rallies last year, he considered it a win. ""Little did I realise when I coined the #FeminismIsCancer hashtag that it would end up in the mouth of the Democratic nominee for President,"" he wrote on Breitbart.com. Trumpâs shock troops: Who are the âalt-rightâ? Violent rally halts campus Breitbart talk America's extremist battle: antifa v alt-right How Breitbart became Donald Trump's favourite news site This week, footage of a year-old podcast was unearthed, where Mr Yiannopoulos appears to condone paedophilia. He said relationships between ""younger boys"" and older men could be a ""coming-of-age relationship â¦ in which those older men help those younger boys discover who they are"". Mr Yiannopoulos has denied the allegations on his Facebook page, blaming the way the clips were edited and his own ""sloppy phrasing'' for any indication he supported paedophilia. ""It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst,"" he said. Breitbart News has close ties to the Trump administration. The site's chief executive, Steve Bannon, first headed Mr Trump's presidential campaign and was later appointed as his chief strategist in the White House. Mr Yiannopoulos is an avid supporter of President Trump, whom he calls ""daddy"". Former Breitbart News chief executive Steve Bannon (right) in a White House meeting with US President Donald Trump (left) During the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio last July, Mr Yiannopoulos headlined an event called Gays for Trump. President Trump criticised the University of Berkeley in California after it cancelled a talk by Mr Yiannopoulos, followingviolent student protests earlier this month. A vandalised Bank of America office in Berkeley, Calfornia, after protests against Milo Yiannopoulos's university talk got out of hand Mr Yiannopoulos's regular public speaking engagements often lead to protests on university campuses. Mr Yiannopoulos went to Simon Langton Boys Grammar School in Canterbury, and dropped out of undergraduate courses at the University of Manchester and the University of Cambridge. However, he came to prominence by playing a key role in an online troll war, known as Gamergate, which critics say is about misogyny in the video game world, but which supporters says is about ethics in games journalism. He built up a following by being a ""troll king"", according to technology magazine Wired. His YouTube channel now has more than 500,000 subscribers. Mr Yiannopoulos is regularly associated with the alt-right, a disparate nationalistic group, which is outspoken against so-called political correctness and feminism. It includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. He says he does not consider himself part of the alt-right, although he has called it ""energising and exciting"". Comedian Bill Maher (left) hosted Milo Yiannopoulos (right) on his television show During an appearance on US television show Real Time on Friday, he joked about not being able to fit in as he is a ""gay Jew who never shuts up about his black boyfriend"". Mr Yiannopoulos had a Jewish maternal grandmother. On the same show, hosted by comedian Bill Maher, he equated feminism with a disease (again) and said transgender people was a disorder comparable to sociopathy. His autobiography, Dangerous, had been due for publication next month. When the book deal with publisher Simon & Schuster was announced in December 2016, it caused an outcry among his critics, who accused the company of promoting and funding hate speech. On Monday, Simon and Schuster announced it was cancelling the publication of the book, after more than 100 of the publisher's other authors had protested against it. Mr Yiannopoulos reportedly received a $250,000 (Â£200,000) advance for the book. In protest at the deal, the Chicago Review of Books had already announced it would not review any Simon & Schuster books in 2017.

Sutton reserve keeper Shaw resigns,"This video can not be played Sutton substitute keeper enjoys in-game pie Sutton United have accepted the resignation of reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw, who is under investigation for potentially breaching betting rules. The Gambling Commission and Football Association areinvestigating if there was a breach of betting regulationsafter the 45-year-old ate a pie during Monday's FA Cup loss to Arsenal. A bookmaker had offered odds of 8-1 that Shaw would eat a pie on camera. ""What happened didn't make us look very professional,"" said boss Paul Doswell. ""It's something that we've dealt with quickly as a club,"" he told Sky News on Monday. ""Wayne himself offered his resignation to the chairman this afternoon, which has been accepted. ""It's a very sad end to what has been a very good story."" Shaw, who said he was aware of the betting promotion prior to the match, played the incident - in which he ate the pie while standing by the substitutes' bench -  down as ""a bit of fun"". This video can not be played Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw says the food was for his belly, not a bet ""We are told we are not allowed to gamble as it is full-time professional football,"" Shaw told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""In no way did I put anyone in jeopardy of that - this is not the case here, this is just a bit of fun and me being hungry."" However, the Gambling Commission confirmed it was looking into whether there was any ""irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity"". 5 live In Short: Lawyer says pie eating should be ""treated in the same light as spot-fixing"" ""It's clear in FA rules that you're not allowed to bet - and whether it was a fun bet, or whatever it was, it wasn't acceptable,"" added Doswell. ""Obviously we were very concerned with the implication that the club, myself, my assistant Ian Baird or anyone else had been involved in the decision-making. ""It's been very disappointing, there's no doubt about that. I woke up this morning to this storm of criticism. ""It's with a very heavy heart, because he was a good friend of mine, but I think the board felt they had no other choice."" Joe Wilson, BBC sports correspondent What happened at Sutton United might have seemed like a joke but it's clear that both the FA and the Gambling Commission are taking 'piegate' very seriously. Wayne Shaw has stated that he didn't place a bet himself, but it's also clear than somebody must have done. Sun Bets used their own Twitter account to publicise that they had ""paid out a five figure sum"". The fact that Mr Shaw might have consumed a pasty rather than a pie (as he maintains) clearly was not a barrier to paying out for the betting company. Anyone in Sutton United's playing and non-playing staff is covered by the FA's rules which forbid betting on any football match. The FA also makes it clear its rules cover 'football related' bets and the passing on of any insider information. Typically any breaking of these rules results in a fine. for example in November Newcastle United midfielder Jack Colback was fined Â£25,000 after accepting a Football Association misconduct charge related to betting. In information provided by The Professional Footballers Association for its members there is also a warning that breaking rules in regard to betting could be a criminal offence. There is then the responsibility of betting companies to report any suspicious or unusual betting activity. This is the way all sports would seek to guard against a manipulation of their matches and outcomes, to prevent a collusion between players and fixers. The gambling commission regulates the betting industry in Great Britain. In regard to the Sutton United v Arsenal match it is ''â¦looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity"". The 'novelty market' is a general trend which concerns the Gambling Commission. In June last year it sent a general letter to bookmakers warning that standards should be upheld as it was concerned novelty bets could be ""harmful to the wider perception of gambling in Great Britain"".

Jeepers Creepers,"This video can not be played Angelina Jolie taught Yalda Hakim how to cook bugs in Cambodia Angelina Jolie cooked up a storm while promoting her latest film in Cambodia by eating bugs with her kids. The actress was seen frying a scorpion and eating the leg of a spider which she said had a ""really good flavour"". Eating creepy crawlies has been long associated with the TV show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. But should we all be more like Angelina and swap our bacon for bugs? It's estimated that by 2050 the world will be home to nine billion people, meaning current food production will need to almost double. As the population grows, there's been a real push to look at sources of food - particularly protein - other than your traditional meat and fish. Eating insects is said to be one way of meeting this challenge because they are environmentally sustainable, nutritious and can be harvested relatively cheaply and easily in the right conditions. It's estimated that two billion people worldwide eat insects as part of their traditional diet, but Western countries have yet to catch up. There is a ""yuck factor"",says the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP),external. It says Western attitudes towards entomophagy - humans eating insects - are negative because bugs are seen as unclean and disease-carrying. The rise of agriculture and a change in lifestyle in Western societies has also led to insects being seen as ""pests"",says the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),external. Mosquitoes and flies invade homes and bite, termites destroy wood, and some insects end up as unwanted extras in restaurant meals - all of which trigger a ""disgust"" reaction, it added. However, there has been a slow shift in attitudes with the art of eating bugs being considered a novelty, which has seen a rise in their purchase as an unusual gift. Insects can be sprinkled onto pizza as a topping ""They are the original superfood,"" says Shami Radia, co-founder ofGrub,externalwhich sells a range of edible bugs. ""They are high in protein, minerals and amino acids so it makes sense to eat them."" Insects are also better for the environment than conventional livestock farming. They can feed on bio-waste, produce less greenhouse gases, use less water and take up less land than animals. Bugs also have what's called a high feed conversion efficiency because they are cold-blooded. On average, insects can convert 2kg of feed into 1kg of insect mass, whereas cattle require 8kg of feed to produce 1kg of body weight gain. There are around 1,900 different species of insects that have been used as food, according to the FAO. The most commonly eaten insect groups include beetles, caterpillars, bees, wasps, ants, grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, termites, dragonflies and flies. Despite such a variety of insects being available though, UK suppliers have focused on a more limited choice with the most popular being crickets, mealworms, locusts and grasshoppers. Grasshoppers - the new sushi? Grub sellers believe the UK is a long way from embracing spiders and scorpions on our dinner plate. ""We have to take baby steps,"" says Mr Radia. ""It's not something we would sell. You've got to think about what insects to push and what will get people into eating grubs. ""You have to think of the consumer journey. You can start off with cricket powder because you can't actually see the insect and hopefully it will make people more comfortable with eating insects as a whole."" So far, the UK market has seen pop-up shops and restaurants incorporate insects into more traditional dishes such as buffalo worm macaroni cheese, meal worm bolognaise, chocolate cherry cricket brownies or sprinkled on a pizza. They are also marketed as an on-the-go snack that would sit alongside your roasted peanuts or chia seeds. Bug sellers say there has been a real shift in the popularity of edible bugs. Nick Cooper, owner ofCrunchy Critters,externalwhich was set up in 2012, has seen a sales growth rate of 25% year on year with products being sold to schools as well as gyms. He notes there is a particular boom around Halloween and the festive period. ""People are much more aware of eating insects,"" he said. ""There's not that shock horror factor now. The market is definitely heading in the right direction. It won't be an overnight change and will probably be led in the future by youngsters."" Mr Radia believes that eating insects will one day become as popular as eating sushi. ""Behaviour can be changed,"" he said. ""Prawns are ugly and taste delicious and there's no reason why eating insects can't be normalised."" Grasshoppers - the new sushi?

NewsbeatBlurred lines,"London Fashion Week has traditionally only been aimed at women, but seven of the major catwalk shows this season have mixed in menswear. Added to that, we've seen men modelling women's wear, unisex clothing brands and androgynous designs that would work on anyone. It seems like British fashion is going through a gender revolution at the moment. Newsbeat meets the designers leading the way. J. W. Anderson Irish-born designer Jonathan Anderson started his J. W. Anderson brand as menswear in 2008, before launching his first women's collection two years later. He designs with the idea that men can borrow clothes from women and vice versa. ""It's something that we play with each season, this idea,"" he tells Newsbeat backstage at his London Fashion Week show. ""We'll do a mac on a guy and a mac on a woman. They are the same thing, but on a man and a woman they can mean different things."" J. W. Anderson used androgynous looks in both his men's and women's collections Anderson is seen by many in the fashion world as a pioneer for taking this unisex approach years ago. Although he now presents his women's and menswear collections separately, he says he doesn't want to dictate who should wear what. ""I can give you an idea of how I see it on both a man and a woman, but I'm not going to tell you if it's for a man or a woman."" Nicola Formichetti The artistic director of Diesel, and founder of the unisex range Nicopanda, Nicola Formichetti was also Lady Gaga's stylist for three years (yes, he was responsible for the meat dress). ""Fashion has always been about mixing gender, but now it's becoming such an issue,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""Now there are products like jeans and hoodies and military jackets that are becoming very very unisex."" He thinks designers have a ""duty"" to create clothes that every gender can feel comfortable in. ""We have a voice and we need to use it."" Julien Macdonald Julien Macdonald's sequin-studded ball gowns are a favourite with some of the world's most glamorous women, including Beyonce and Gigi Hadid. So it surprised some in the fashion world when he launched a menswear collection in 2015. And at this London Fashion Week, male models walked alongside women in tight-fitting sequin jackets and lycra bodysuits - looks that would traditionally be considered very feminine. He says men are becoming more comfortable experimenting with the way they dress. Julien Macdonald escorts Canadian model Winnie Harlow down the catwalk ""We live in a metrosexual community,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""When you see your girlfriend going out in an amazing dress, you think, 'I want to look just as good as you,' so men do want to have fun. Julien Macdonald featured men and women together on his catwalk ""Nobody cares if you look camp or gay - you know what? Now everybody's got a mixed community of friends. It doesn't matter."" Robert Sanders and Oliver Thame Robert and Oliver are both menswear designers who presented their debut collections as part of the Central Saint Martins MA show at London Fashion Week. Robert Sanders, 25, uses layers of recycled fabric to create tunics, skirts and shorts that drape over the models in an androgynous way. ""I grew up dressing up in my mum's clothes, and getting negative feedback off people,"" he tells Newsbeat. Newsbeat chatted to Robert backstage Robert Sanders' collection featured skirts A look from Robert Sanders's collection Oliver Thame's collection featured bold clashing prints, and tops with cut outs that revealed the torsos of his male models. ""I presented it on men, but I feel like it could've been just as well presented on women,"" says the 25-year-old.

'Business rates battle' and the Â£6bn bill,"The Prime Minister Theresa May makes several of the front pages after her surprise appearance at the Brexit debate in the House of Lords on Monday. The Daily Express says she""dramatically confronted peers,externalover a plot to delay Brexit"" and the Sun says she ""stunned"" the upper house by ""staring down rebellious Lords in person"". Writing in the Daily Mail, Quentin Letts says Mrs May ""scowled, she shook her head, she scratched her knee. She was watching them andher tail was swishing,external"". The House of Lords also makes The Daily Mirror front page, which says that peers are facing a newclocking-in scandal,external. It picks up an allegation in a BBC TV programme - that one lord signed in to claim his Â£300 allowance - then returned to his taxi which was waiting outside. The paper itself reported similar claims four years ago and its scathing editorial accuses some lords of a ""scandalous abuse of public funds"", describing them as ""vermin in ermine"". Several papers highlight conflict within the Conservative Party over changes to business rates in England and Wales. The Times says the Communities Secretary, Sajid Javid, isbeing accused of ""misleading"",externalhis own MPs with an analysis of the revaluation he sent to them at the weekend to try to head off a backbench rebellion. The Mail views his attempts to reassure the rebels as a""Dodgy Business Rates Dossier"",externalthat underestimated the rate rises faced by small firms. Most people have heard of a ""granny annexe"" for elderly relatives but the Times reports on a new phenomenon in home extensions. The paper says so many university graduates are moving back in with their parents that there's been a surge in what architects have dubbed the""graddy annexe"",external.  It puts the trend down to high rents and the difficulties in saving for a deposit to get on the property ladder. The Guardian leads with its analysis that crashing out of the EU with no trade deal would saddle British exporters withÂ£6bn a year,externalin extra costs. As part of a series on the implications of Brexit, it says its work ""reveals the limited options facing UK negotiators just weeks before Brexit talks start"". The paper says the Â£6bn figure is what would happen if Theresa May fell back on World Trade Organisation rules and their resulting tariffs. It suggests the implications of this Plan B ""remain poorly understood within Whitehall"". And a woman who claims to be usingBritain's oldest carrier bag,externalis featured in several papers including the Daily Express.

'Too little attention' to athlete welfare,"This video can not be played 'No indication of King report significance' British Cycling has been accused of watering down the findings of an internal review in 2012 by the chief executive of UK Sport. Liz Nicholl said the governing body ""fed a very light-touch version"" to the funding agency. Former British Cycling chief executive Peter King took anonymous statements from 40 personnel as part of a report that was never made public. ""We didn't receive the King report,"" Nicholl told BBC Sport. ""We were given to believe that... actually we had a very light-touch version of it fed to us at UK Sport, so we had no indication of the significance of that report. ""It's only now come to light."" Speaking to national newspapers,Nicholl confirmed she considered it to effectively be a cover-up,,externaladding: ""That's a complete lack of transparency and that's a relationship that is not acceptable in terms of what was shared with us as opposed to what the actual facts of that report were."" UK Sport have faced questions over why they did not act on a report that is known to include allegations of bullying. Nicholls' incendiary comments come as the country's most successful and best-funded sports governing body braces itself for thepublication of another reportinto alleged bullying, favouritism and sexism, led by British Rowing chair Annamarie Phelps. Publication is expected in the next month. Former British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake commissioned the King report in September 2012 but left the organisation in January, three months earlier than planned. He could not be reached for comment. UCI president Brian Cookson, who was president of British Cycling when King delivered the report in December 2012, said he would not comment until the Phelps report was published. UK Sport are currently considering whether to help fund Cookson's re-election campaign, having contributed Â£77,000 in 2013. King told BBC Sport he was ""disappointed"" to hear Nicholl say she never saw his full report. In a statement, British Cycling said: ""Contributions were made with a guarantee of anonymity, so key findings and recommendations were shared in briefings with UK Sport and the British Cycling board. ""The full report was also made available to the 2016 independent review, jointly commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling in April last year, of the world class programme."" The current Phelps inquiry was jointly commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling following allegations of sexism and bullying made by rider Jess Varnish against former technical director Shane Sutton. Varnish claimed the coach had used sexist and discriminatory language when dropping her from the Olympic programme, something he strongly denies. In October, Sutton resigned and was found guilty of one charge of using inappropriate language by an internal review. A number of other riders and former staff members have backed Varnish's portrayal of ""a culture of fear"" within British Cycling, including former road world champion Nicole Cooke, who told a parliamentary select committee that it was a sport ""run by men, for men"". Former performance director Sir Dave Brailsford has insisted he ran a regime that was ""not sexist but definitely medallist"". This video can not be played Sutton resigns amid discrimination row ""All those views are being taken into account through the review,"" said Nicholl. ""It's fair to say that the high-performance system here is pretty male-dominated. There aren't very many female coaches and there's an opportunity to address that in future, and to get a better balance to support athletes in a way that athletes of today want to be supported. ""Athletes have moved on and maybe the programmes haven't moved on as fast as they should have done, but what we see is an opportunity."" The legally sensitive nature of Phelps' report has meant it has been delayed, with fears it could be heavily redacted to protect witness confidentiality. Those who gave evidence are now being asked how much of their testimony can be revealed, while those criticised have an opportunity to respond. Publication could take another month, but on 1 March British Cycling will brief staff and riders on an ""action plan"" - effectively its response to the report and concerns over the way it operates. This will include greater oversight of its high-performance programme, and more consideration of athlete welfare. ""There's no excuse for not addressing duty of care responsibilities to athletes,"" said Nicholls. ""There's no excuse for not putting athletes first. ""They are are the ones who'll deliver the medals and every programme should be trying to ensure they have happy and successful athletes and there probably hasn't been enough attention in sport about how they do things. ""There's a lot of focus on operational delivery, probably not enough on leadership management and communication."" Nicholl told the BBC that she would be ""clear about the actions that UK Sport and British Cycling need to take"". Should welfare come before winning?

Rare 'fire rainbow' charms Singapore,"A rare cloud phenomenon over Singapore has delighted people in the city-state. The multi-coloured glow appeared in the sky on Monday in the late afternoon, lasting for about 15 minutes, and was seen across the island. Media reports said it was likely a fire rainbow, which occurs when sunlight refracts through ice-crystal clouds. Others have also said it could have been cloud iridescence, which happens when water droplets or crystals scatter light. Fazidah Mokhtar, who works in a childcare centre, told the BBC that she spotted it around 17:10 on Monday (09:10 GMT).

Keeper's pie eating under investigation,"This video can not be played Sutton substitute keeper enjoys in-game pie Sutton reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw is under investigation by the Football Association for potentially breaching betting rules during Monday's FA Cup loss to Arsenal. The Gambling Commission is also investigating if there was a breach of betting regulations after Shaw ate a pie in the 83rd minute of the game. Before Monday's game, a bookmaker offered odds of 8-1 that Shaw would eat a pie on camera during the match. He later said it was ""a bit of fun"". Shaw, 46, ate the pie while standing by the substitutes' bench. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the pie was in fact a pasty and he ate it as he was ""light-headed"". ""We are told we are not allowed to gamble as it is full-time professional football,"" he added. ""In no way did I put anyone in jeopardy of that - this is not the case here, this is just a bit of fun and me being hungry."" This video can not be played Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw says the food was for his belly, not a bet Asked whether he knew if anyone had taken up the bet, he told theDaily Mail:,external""I think there were a few people. I think a few mates and a few of the fans."" The Gambling Commission, which licenses and regulates gambling in Britain, says it is looking into whether there was any ""irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity"". It warned operators in June last year about the integrity of taking bets on novelty markets. ""Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened,"" said enforcement and intelligence director Richard Watson. Sun Bets, who sponsored the club on Monday for the fifth-round tie,tweeted,externalthat it had paid out a ""five-figure sum"" on the bet. Sutton manager Paul Doswell said after the game: ""I don't think it shows us in the best light."" Club chairman Bruce Elliott told 5 live: ""I didn't know anything about it. He has got himself in the papers again and the fame obviously has gone to his head a little bit, but we will soon bring him back down to earth, don't worry about that."" Shaw said he was told about the betting promotion before the game. ""I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it,"" he added. ""All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. ""It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back."" A worldwide ban on betting in football was introduced in 2014 and covers everyone involved in the game, from the players and managers to the match officials and club staff.

The FA website defines that as ""information that you are aware of due to your position in the game and which is not publicly available"".

The riddle of Europe's election season,"Many Europeans eye the months ahead with foreboding. They see anti-establishment parties on the ascendancy. Angela Merkel - for so long Frau Europe - may lose power. And the financial markets are skittish over the possibility of a Marine Le Pen victory in France. Every edge up in her poll ratings sends bond yields rising. And yet an entirely different scenario may play out. It is quite possible that before the end of the year observers will declare that the Brexit-Trump tide has turned and that European integration has found new champions. First to the politics: in the Netherlands Geert Wilders has a history of under-performing at the polls. Even if he emerges as the leader of the largest party after the elections in March, he will struggle to get a foothold in government. The contest that preoccupies Europe's political class, however, is France. The conventional wisdom is that Marine Le Pen will win the first round in the presidential elections but be substantially defeated in round two. But France is on edge, gloomy and unsure of itself. She has expanded her lead in the polls and closed the gap on her most likely challenger in the second round, Emmanuel Macron. Still, he retains a 16% poll lead. Marine Le Pen supporters: Many believe she will win the first round of the election But observers no longer trust the polls, and they fear the unforeseen event that could turn even more voters against governing elites. Yet if Marine Le Pen loses, as seems most likely, Europe could be facing an entirely different future. Currently the candidate most likely to win in France is Mr Macron. Yes, he's a novice: a man who has never been elected to high office. He has been drawing the crowds because he has sold himself as a new politician, neither left nor right. Le Pen rails against globalisation Macron: France's ambitious man 'on the move' Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Schulz to stand against Merkel As the campaign gets under way, Marine Le Pen will be scathing, dismissing Mr Macron as an international banker, the epitome of the failed global elite, and the man who was Economy Minister under Francois Hollande. Mr Macron has yet to define himself, and he may yet stumble. But if he made it to the Elysee Palace, Europe and France would have a pro-European president, committed to the survival of the euro and the alliance with Germany. Emmanuel Macron has faced accusations that he is part of a governing elite At the same time, Germany has grown more restless and more open to change. Some see Angela Merkel, who is hoping for a fourth term as chancellor, as weary and burnt-out. Some of her zeal for power has gone. And many Germans will forever blame her for allowing more than a million refugees into the country. Her main political opponent, the Social Democratic Party, has a new standard bearer in Martin Schulz. In the past month, the SPD has surged 12 points, even surpassing Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. Mr Schulz is a former President of the European Parliament. For a long time in German politics, he has been known as ""Mr Europe"". He has a good back-story: he's a former bookseller without a high school degree. He is a straight-talker, passionate about Europe and further integration. Angela Merkel is standing for a fourth term as Chancellor of Germany His greatest strength is his unbridled passion to succeed, his weakness is a love of power and some of its trappings, which he demonstrated in Brussels. He also may stumble, having not yet declared his policy on refugees. And never underestimate the appeal of Angela Merkel and her safe pair of hands. But the crowds are turning out for Mr Schulz, much as they have done for Mr Macron in France. If both men were to win, the outlook in Europe would change suddenly and dramatically. Both are European integrationists who would look to deepen and strengthen the European project. Together, they would breathe new life into the Franco-German relationship that has always been the engine room of the EU. Martin Schulz is a former President of the European Parliament Both, politicians from the centre-left, would loosen austerity further and favour spending on infrastructure projects to help countries such as Italy escape stagnation. There would be little generosity from either man towards Britain as it starts to negotiate its exit from the European Union. Mr Macron has said that it will be ""pretty tough"" on the UK and Mr Schulz would want to see the UK pays a price for its departure. As this European election season begins, no-one yet knows what the Trump effect will be on Europe. Will US President Donald Trump's victory encourage voters that they can support anti-immigration candidates who want powers returned to the nation states and, in the case of France, have a vote on membership of the European Union? Or will President Trump deter voters from taking further risks? Will voters turn away from the United States - whose president has openly discussed which country would leave the EU next - and incline towards building a Europe more confident in its own values and security? The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has said Europe wants the US's ""wholehearted and unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe"". It may not be forthcoming, and the insecurity may yet prompt some voters to back deeper European integration rather the outsiders, the insurgents, the challengers. For Europe, the script for 2017 is a long way from being written and the outcome may yet surprise.

Hammondâs Â£10bn of green shoots,"Philip Hammond is not a man known for political surprises. Spreadsheet Phil, as he probably doesn't like to be called, prefers to keep any rabbits that might be hopping around Whitehall stuffed deep in the Treasury's public spending hat. So, anyone thinking that today'sbetter news on the state of government's financeswill lead to any Budget largesse is likely to be disappointed. The public sector net borrowing numbers showed a surplus in January, a month when the government receives a significant proportion of its tax receipts. With those receipts higher than expected and economic growth stronger than expected, the government earned more than it spent to the tune of Â£9.4bn. Taking a year to date comparison, these are the best borrowing numbers the government has achieved since the financial crisis. A little bit of that roof has been fixed, and the sun is still shining. Mr Hammond is now likely to undershoot his end of year deficit target by Â£10bn, borrowing less over the year, around Â£60bn, than the Office for Budget Responsibility expected last autumn. Though it should be remembered that target was significantly loosened following the referendum result. On the surface, a Â£10bn undershoot may appear good news, and is likely to lead to calls that the Treasury could loosen the public spending purse strings. The chancellor could spread a bit of salve on that toxic issue of the day -business rate increases due in Aprilwhich are leaving some firms with significantly higher bills - and still hit his deficit target. Business rate relief could be made more generous and transition periods extended so that any abrupt increases are put on a smoother trajectory. Which might be good politically. And Mr Hammond could offer something for the National Health Service and social care. Which might also be good politically. But, Mr Hammond does not want to be a ""political chancellor"" in the style of one George Osborne, moving rapidly to plug political holes with Treasury gold. Those close to him are making clear, there may be some minor tweaks but there will not be major changes of direction on Budget day on 8 March. Brexit is still, in the Treasury's mind, a risk to the economy that looms large and any buffers built up now are likely to be kept back for future rainy days - if they come - rather than be spent now. And January's strong numbers have been flattered by the recent sale of government shares in Lloyds Bank and the fact that self-assessment receipts from individual tax returns have come in earlier this year compared to last. The chancellor has set himself two tasks ahead of the next general election. Prove that the Treasury is the nation's cautious chief financial officer, focused on ""balancing the books"" and reducing the deficit (the amount the government spends over the amount it earns) to zero. And second, reboot the economy by improving private sector growth with a focus on productivity and infrastructure spending. In Mr Hammond's mind, one month's good figures do not change that sober to-do list.

Former US law chief leads Uber probe,"Uber said it would publish diversity figures in the 'coming months' On Sunday we learned that Uber was going to conduct an investigationinto claims of serious sexual harassment, following ascathing blog post,externalfrom a former employee. On Monday Uber boss Travis Kalanick sent an email to his employees with more information about the probe - and further plans the company has to address the issue. âItâs been a tough 24 hours,â he began, adding that the company was âhurtingâ. The investigation will be lead by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who served under President Obama between 2009 and 2015, and Tammy Albarran - both partners at law firm Covington and Burling. Arianna Huffington, best known for being the founder of the Huffington Post, will also help carry out the review. Ms Huffington has been on Uberâs board since April last year. Also conducting the review will be Uberâs new head of human resources, Liane Hornsey, and Angela Padilla, Uberâs associate general counsel. Diversity figures After coming into widespread criticism for never having published statistics on diversity at the company, Mr Kalanick said he would deliver figures in the ""coming months"". He said that of the employees working as engineers, product managers or data scientists, 15.1% are women - a number which he said hadnât changed significantly in the past year. âAs points of reference,â he wrote, âFacebook is at 17%, Google at 18% and Twitter at 10%.â Until now, Uber had been standing firm on not publishing its diversity figures. Most major technology companies make public their EEO-1 - a government filing that breaks down employees by race, religion, gender and other factors. Uber has not specified if it will publish its entire EEO-1, or just post select figures from the company. In her blog post, Susan Fowler cited anecdotal figures of women leaving Uber in droves. Speaking specifically about the site reliability engineering team, which she worked on for a year, she said that by the time she left, âout of over 150 engineers in the SRE teams, only 3% were womenâ. She now works at San Francisco-based payment firm Stripe. Uber said it would be holding an âall hands"" meeting on Tuesday to tell its employees what its ânext stepsâ will be.

How far into the red will the NHS sink?,"Call it overspending, underfunding or deficits, the latest news from NHS Improvement involves plenty of red ink on the books of hospitals and other trusts. And the picture is worse than it looked last November, which will lead to speculation that NHS finances in England are close to being out of control. As recently as November, Jim Mackey, head of the regulator NHS Improvement, was saying that trusts in England would run up a total deficit of Â£580m for the full financial year. Now that has been revised up to a range of Â£750m to Â£850m. That will hardly win him many friends at the Department of Health where ministers are anxious to demonstrate that a tighter grip has been applied to the NHS purse strings. So what's changed? NHS Improvement is pointing the finger at higher than expected patient demand, with emergency hospital admissions 3.5% higher in the final three months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The regulator had anticipated an increase of more like 2%. Social care problems are also being blamed. NHS Improvement says there was a 28% jump in the number of ""bed days"" lost because of problems discharging medically fit patients, who had to be kept in hospital when they were medically fit to leave. Difficulties finding the right community or social care were cited as reasons for that increase. Rising numbers of non-urgent operations and procedures were cancelled because of bed shortages.  That hit hospital finances as trusts lost the flow of income they would normally have received for carrying out the operations. It's easy to see why NHS England leaders and hospital chiefs have been calling for urgent action on social care. A delayed transfer is bad news for the patient stuck in the hospital bed, frustrating for the patient who has an operation postponed, and a real headache for hospital finance directors who lose income. NHS Improvement argues that more cost controls have been applied, resulting in a 24% lower bill for agency staff in December compared to 12 months earlier. Paul Briddock, of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, said staff had done a ""remarkable job in trying to keep services going while also delivering over Â£2bn of efficiencies"". A deficit overshoot of a few hundred million pounds should of course been seen in the context of total trust revenue of nearly Â£80bn and annual NHS spending in England of more than Â£100bn. To get to the real picture, though, you need to take into account the Â£1.8bn ""sustainability fund"" run by NHS Improvement. This, in effect, is financial support for trusts who follow the regulator's plans for cost reduction. Add that to the possible year end deficit of Â£850m, as already stated, and you get to a total overspend of around Â£2.6bn which would be higher than last year. A year ago we reported the pressure being exerted from on high on trusts to ensure they did not end the year too far into the red. The Department of Health has to ensure that trust deficits are covered by surpluses elsewhere so it does not overspend the budget agreed by Parliament. The process went to the wire last year and seems set to do so again. Remember this was supposed to be the ""year of plenty"" for NHS funding with annual increases tailing off in future years. The fact that trusts are struggling now is alarming. The government will argue the NHS could be more efficient and make better use of its resources. Critics will say the service in England is underfunded.

Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem?,"Uber has found itself in the spotlight over a high-profile and public sexual harassment claim Taxi-hailing app Uber has promised an ""urgent investigation"" into claims of workplace sexual harassment, after a female engineer said misogyny was rife at the firm and women were quitting in droves. Susan Fowler, a software engineer,wrote a blog postabout a ""very, very strange year at Uber"". In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first official day at work, sending her messages about his open relationship. It's just the latest blow for a company that has gained a reputation as a bastion of Silicon Valley's macho ""bro"" culture. But is Uber really any more sexist than other tech giants in the Valley? Ms Fowler's claims have resonated with many women in the tech world, and surveys suggest her experiences are not uncommon. According to a 2016 survey, 60% of women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances. The ""Elephant in the Valley,external"" survey found that 87% of the 220 women interviewed had witnessed demeaning comments from their colleagues. Almost 40% of those who said they were harassed at work did not report the situation, fearing it would damage their careers. ""I was propositioned by a hiring manager early in my career when I was a job candidate,"" one contributor to the study wrote. ""He clearly indicated that if I slept with him, he would make sure I was promoted as his 'second in command' as he moved up the ladder in the company."" Former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao tweeted a message of support after Ms Fowler's story was published Another said she had turned down her CEO's sexual advances the first time they travelled together for work. ""After that, I was never asked to travel with him again,"" she said. ""This impacted my ability to do my job."" The study followed a high-profile gender discriminationlawsuit in 2015 from former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao- one of those praising Ms Fowler's stand against Uber. On Twitter,Ms Pao said,externalMs Fowler's blog post shows ""the state of tech in one woman's story, also the story of many women, many people at many companies"". Sexist van slogans banned in Australia Meet the female gamers challenging sexism Are universities secretly sexist? Discrimination is difficult to quantify - especially when victims are unwilling to speak out. Yet on top of Ms Pao's case, there have been several high-profile lawsuits and sudden exits in the tech world in recent years: In 2014, former Tinder executive Whitney Wolfe sued the dating app, claiming she was called a ""slut"" and a ""whore"" by Tinder marketing chief Justin Mateen, and denied her rightful title of co-founder because she was a woman. She received a settlement worth $1m (Â£800,000) Whitney Wolfe, former Tinder executive, claimed she was harassed at the company - but went on to found competitor Bumble Tom Preston-Werner, founder of the social coding site GitHub, resigned in 2014 after a sexual harassment investigation. No legal wrongdoing was found, but the company said there had been ""evidence of mistakes and errors of judgement"" Kelly Ellis, a software engineer at Google for more than four years, levelled shocking allegations of harassment against the company on Twitter in 2015, saying senior colleagues had made unprofessional comments about her appearance. These allegedly included one superior telling her during a company trip to Maui that it was ""taking all of [his] self control not to grab"" her Comparing results from different studies with different questions can be problematic - but there are some hints that Silicon Valley has a problem. Statistics on sexual harassment vary widely, but an extensive 1992 US national study found that 41% of women had experienced it; and about 40-50% of women in the EU, according to the United Nations. Both estimates are still lower than the Silicon Valley survey's 60%. The 2016 Women in the Workplace study - a major US national survey - found that 19% of the technology sector's top executives are women - broadly in line with sectors like banking, media, or professional services. The same study found that, across all industries, 30% of women who negotiated for a promotion or a better salary were told they were ""bossy"", ""aggressive"" or ""intimidating"". In the Elephant in the Valley survey, that rocketed to 84% of women being told they were aggressive (though that question was not specifically about negotiation). The world's biggest tech companies know they're dominated by white men, and many are funding schemes to address that. In its annual diversity and inclusion report, Apple said it had closed pay gaps over the past year by analysing salaries, bonuses and stock grants. Facebook has pledged to give $15m (Â£12m) to Code.org, a non-profit group teaching young women and underrepresented minorities how to write computer code. And in 2015, Google told USA Today it would invest $150m (Â£120m) in workforce diversity initiatives that year, up from $115m in 2014. At the moment, 23% of Apple's tech employees are women. At Google, it's 19%. And at Facebook, just 17%. Change comes slowly in companies of this size, so the path could be a long one. But by broadening the pool of people qualified to work there, Silicon Valley is hoping to change the status quo.
