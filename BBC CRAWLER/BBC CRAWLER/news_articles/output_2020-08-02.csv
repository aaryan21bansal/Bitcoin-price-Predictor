Covid weddings: 'It's heartbreaking to see her face',"Justin and Kay say they are still waiting for a couple more refunds from cancelling their reception Couples due to get married had hoped that from 1 August, receptions of up to 30 people would be allowed in England. That's what the government had planned for the next stage of lockdown easing. But last week, they put back the date, andreceptions can still only be attended,externalby a group of six people outside, or two households inside. It means many brides and grooms have rehashed their plans once, and now have to cancel or change them again. Others, however, have gone on to celebrate within the restrictions. For Justin Dew and his fiancee, Kay, their day on 14 August will be a far cry from the 90-guest wedding they had originally planned. The couple had cut the guest list to 30 but, following the latest announcement, have cancelled their reception completely. However, they are going ahead with the ceremony. ""We thought about it and we've decided that the most important thing is to get married,"" says Justin, 43, from Essex. ""We we want something positive to come out of this so come hell or high water we'll be husband and wife on 14 August."" The couple plan to broadcast the ceremony - which will be attended by 10 people, the maximum that can fit safely in the small register office - via Facebook. ""I've got family abroad so we've decided to stream the wedding as a Facebook Live so that if they can't come to us they can be with us in another way,"" says Justin. ""Our honeymoon is booked to Spain, would you believe. We'll probably cancel that as we can't isolate."" Justin says he is gutted. ""It's been in planning for over a year and although we'll get married we won't share it with everyone. ""It's heartbreaking, my missus has put so much effort into everything. It's heartbreaking to see her face."" But he adds: ""I'm just happy that through technology we can still share the day with friends and family. It's not what we could have had but luckily we can still share the day. ""August was meant to be the most exciting month for us but at least we can still get married, that's the main objective."" Steph and her groom Rob The announcement that restrictions would no longer be easing on 1 August - and therefore no wedding receptions - came only the day before Steph Taylor's wedding. But Steph, and her groom Rob, decided they could still get married - despite having to cancel their 30-person reception - and celebrate in a socially-distanced fashion. ""The day before [our wedding] the rug was pulled from under our feet,"" Steph says of the moment she found out wedding receptions were no longer allowed. ""We just didn't want to have to cancel, we just made the best of a bad situation. ""We married at 12:00 - just us and six guests, then went for a lovely lunch with champagne together afterwards."" Steph, who runs a balloon business in Buxton, says some friends and family were able to join them at a pub for some ""socially distanced celebratory drinks"". They were also sure to take plenty of photos and share them with loved ones who were not able to pop by. It was then back to their house for a dance in their back garden. ""We had a live band and danced our first dance on the back lawn, it was perfect!"" Steph says. ""Our neighbours down the street were in their gardens dancing and clapping. ""We had an amazing day!"" Wedding ceremonies or civil partnerships (but not receptions) with up to 30 guests have been allowed since 4 July in England and the government has published guidelines onhow to have a ""Covid-secure"" wedding,external. The guidelines list a series of restrictions, including that no food or drinks should be consumed as part of the ceremony and hands should be washed before and after the exchanging of rings. Northern Ireland has allowed outdoors weddings with 10 people presentsince early June.WalesandScotlandalso now allow wedding ceremonies to take place, but social distancing must be observed, and big gatherings are not allowed. At present, receptions can only be attended by six people outside or two households inside. A planned relaxation in restrictions to allow a total of 30 people to attend wedding receptions from 1 August has been put back until 15 August at the earliest. What are the rules on weddings? Jane Watson and Dom Horsley, from York, are due to get married next weekend. Before the virus, the couple's plan was for a small ceremony with immediate family in Leeds and then a ""big party"" a couple of days later - but that prospect was axed when lockdown started. They then hoped to have a reception of 30 people in Jane's parents' garden. But after the government rowed back on allowing receptions, they're now looking at other ways they can celebrate. ""I guess everybody's got to pull their socks up and get on with it,"" says Dom ""Luckily the wedding is still going ahead in some form or another,"" says Dom. ""We want to get married. We love each other. And we're really hopeful we can do it in some way. ""And whether that means that we end up having to have sort of three separate receptions afterwards where we put groups of six people and go around and see them for a few hoursâ¦ We just want to do it whatever form we can."" ""It's been pretty stressful,"" Jane adds. ""I realise there are more important things going on but for us it's quite stressful, we're just trying to make plans that include people that also stick by the guidelines."" She says one of the worst things is that Dom's elderly grandparents will not be able to come. ""We're trying to include them in some way by maybe going to their home so they can at least see us through the window in our wedding stuff."" Alex Barclay and Katharina Lederle have already postponed their wedding once. The couple were due to celebrate with 90 friends and family in May over two floors of a West End club in London. They then postponed to 6 August and arranged a picnic for 30 people. But now they say they will probably only have four guests - including a photographer. ""We're frustrated, disappointed and confused about the government announcement."" Alex says. ""There's a lack of logic, a lack of consistency to allow people in pubs, but not a socially-distanced wedding."" Alex Barclay and Katharina Lederle had originally planned to get married in May They have had to cancel their suppliers, which, Alex says, is having a ""massive financial and emotional impact"". ""We knew quite soon we wanted to get married this year,"" Katharina says. ""When we heard you could have 30 people outdoors, we thought, 'great'."" Now the advice has changed they still hope to get married at Chelsea Town Hall and will possibly have a ""little picnic"" with their witnesses. Kirsty Drake is supposed to be getting married on 15 August in two weeks' time - when the decision on easing restrictions again is due to be reviewed. She had finalised plans this week for a small wedding reception but now the restrictions mean she is unable to go ahead with the gathering at her venue after her ceremony. ""I'm a little bit emotional about it today,"" she says, speaking the day after the announcement. ""Everything is all up in the air again."" ""What I don't understand is that if I wanted to now I could book six tables in a restaurant outside and sit and have a meal with those same group of people I've just got married with. We'd have to [socially distance] at the venue anyway. ""In our situation it would be safer to have a meal at the venue where we are due to get married."" When will all wedding restrictions be lifted?

Iran cover-up of Covid-19 deaths revealed by data leak,"Iran has been the worst-affected country in the Middle East The number of deaths from coronavirus in Iran is nearly triple what Iran's government claims, a BBC Persian service investigation has found. The government's own records appear to show almost 42,000 people died with Covid-19 symptoms up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry. The number of people known to be infected is also almost double official figures: 451,024 as opposed to 278,827. The official numbers still make Iran the worst-hit in the Middle East. In recent weeks, it has suffered a second steep rise in the number of cases. The first death in Iran from Covid-19 was recorded on 22 January, according to lists and medical records that have been passed to the BBC. This was almost a month before the first official case of coronavirus was reported there. Since the outbreak of the virus in Iran, many observers have doubted the official numbers. There have been irregularities in data between national and regional levels, which some local authorities have spoken out about,and statisticians have tried to give alternative estimates.,external. A level of undercounting, largely due to testing capacity, is seen across the world, but the information leaked to the BBC reveals Iranian authorities have reported significantly lower daily numbers despite having a record of all deaths - suggesting they were deliberately suppressed. The data was sent to the BBC by an anonymous source. It includes details of daily admissions to hospitals across Iran, including names, age, gender, symptoms, date and length of periods spent in hospital, and underlying conditions patients might have. The details on lists correspond to those of some living and deceased patients already known to the BBC. This video can not be played Iran's deputy health minister gets coronavirus The source says they have shared this data with the BBC to ""shed light on truth"" and to end ""political games"" over the epidemic. The discrepancy between the official figures and the number of deaths on these records also matches the difference between the official figure and calculations of excess mortality until mid-June. Excess mortality refers to the number of deaths above and beyond what would be expected under ""normal"" conditions. Tehran, the capital, has the highest number of deaths with 8,120 people who died with Covid-19 or symptoms similar to it. The city of Qom, the initial epicentre of the virus in Iran, is worst hit proportionally, with 1,419 deaths - that is one death with Covid-19 for every 1,000 people. It is notable that, across the country, 1,916 deaths were non-Iranian nationals. This indicates a disproportionate number of deaths amongst migrants and refugees, who are mostly from neighbouring Afghanistan. The overall trend of cases and deaths in the leaked data is similar to official reports, albeit different in size. The initial rise of deaths is far steeper than Health Ministry figures and by mid-March it was five times the official figure. Lockdown measures were imposed over the Nowruz (Iranian New Year) holidays at the end of the third week in March, and there was a corresponding decline in cases and deaths. Iran has introduced measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus But as government restrictions were relaxed, the cases and deaths started to rise again after late-May. Crucially the first recorded death on the leaked list occurred on 22 January, a month before the first case of coronavirus was officially reported in Iran. At the time Health Ministry officials were adamant in acknowledging not a single case of coronavirus in the country, despite reports by journalists inside Iran, and warnings from various medical professionals. In 28 days until the first official acknowledgement on 19 February, 52 people had already died. Doctors with direct knowledge of the matter have told the BBC that the Iranian health ministry has been under pressure from security and intelligence bodies inside Iran. Dr Pouladi (not their real name) told the BBC that the ministry ""was in denial"". ""Initially they did not have testing kits and when they got them, they weren't used widely enough. The position of the security services was not to admit to the existence of coronavirus in Iran,"" Dr Pouladi said. It was the persistence of two brothers, both doctors from Qom, which forced the health ministry to acknowledge the first official case. When Dr Mohammad Molayi and Dr Ali Molayi lost their brother, they insisted he should still be tested for Covid-19, which turned out to be positive. In Kamkar hospital, where their brother died, numerous patients were admitted with similar symptoms to Covid-19, and they would not respond to the usual treatments. Nevertheless, none of them were tested for the disease. Dr Pouladi says: ""They got unlucky. Someone with both decency and influence lost his brother. Dr Molayi had access to these gentlemen [health ministry officials] and did not give up."" Dr Molayi released a video of his late brother with a statement. The health ministry then finally acknowledged the first recorded case. Nevertheless state TV ran a report criticising him and falsely claiming the video of his brother was months old. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Iran mortuary worker cleanses bodies The start of outbreak coincided both with the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and with parliamentary elections. These were major opportunities for the Islamic Republic to demonstrate its popular support and not risk damaging it because of the virus. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, accused some of wanting to use the coronavirus to undermine the election. In the event, the election had a very low turnout. Iran's cover-up after it shot down a Ukrainian airliner fuelled anti-government protests Before the global coronavirus pandemic hit, Iran was already experiencing a series of its own crises. In November 2019, the government increased the price of petrol overnight and cracked down violently on protests which followed. Hundreds of protesters were killed in a few days. In January this year, the Iranian response to the US assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, seen as one of the most powerful figures in Iran after its Supreme Leader, created another problem. Then Iranian armed forces - on high alert - mistakenly fired missiles at a Ukrainian airliner only minutes after it had taken off from Tehran's international airport. All 176 people on board were killed. The Iranian authorities initially tried to cover up what happened, but after three days they were forced to admit it, resulting in considerable loss of face. This video can not be played Flight tracking data and open source footage shows how Mahan Air continued to fly Dr Nouroldin Pirmoazzen, a former MP who also was an official at the health ministry, told the BBC that in this context, the Iranian government was ""anxious and fearful of the truth"" when coronavirus hit Iran. He said: ""The government was afraid that the poor and the unemployed would take to the streets."" Dr Pirmoazzen points to the fact thatIran stopped international health organisation MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res from treating coronavirus cases in the central province of Isfahan,externalas evidence of how security-conscious its approach towards the pandemic is. Iran was going through tough times even before the military showdown with the US and coronavirus hit. The sanctions which followed Donald Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal in May 2018 hit the economy hard. Dr Pouladi says: ""Those who brought the country to this point don't pay the price. It is the poor people of the country and my poor patients who pay the price with their lives."" ""In the confrontation between the governments of the US and Iran we are getting crushed with pressures from both sides."" The health ministry has said that the country's reports to the World Health Organization regarding the number of coronavirus cases and deaths are ""transparent"" and ""far from any deviations"".

Trump 'to act on Chinese software in coming days',"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Mr Trump would take action ""in the coming days"" US President Donald Trump will take action ""in the coming days"" against Chinese-owned software that he believes pose a national security risk, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. Mr Pompeo said popular video app TikTok was among those ""feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party"". His comments came days after Mr Trump said he was banning TikTok in the US. The company has denied accusations that it is controlled by or shares data with the Chinese government. Speaking to Fox News Channel, Mr Pompeo said the action would be taken ""with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party"". Microsoft to continue talks to buy TikTok How would the US go about banning TikTok? Should we be worried about TikTok? He said there were ""countless"" companies doing business in the US that might be passing information on to the Chinese government. Data could include facial recognition patterns, addresses, phone numbers and contacts, he said. ""President Trump has said 'enough' and we're going to fix it,"" he told Fox News. Mr Trump told reporters on Fridayhe planned to sign an executive order to ban TikTok in the US,where it has up to 80 million active monthly users. The app - mostly used by people under 20 - is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. This video can not be played What is TikTok?

Unite threatens to review donations to Labour,"Len McCluskey said the payout was an ""abuse"" of Unite members' money Labour's largest trade union backer has promised to review its financial support after the party decided to pay off former staff who sued it in an anti-Semitism row. Unite leader Len McCluskeytold the Observer,externalthat Labour should not be ""taking Unite's money for granted"". The party agreed last month to a ""substantial"" payout to seven whistleblowers who spoke to the BBC. Claims of anti-Semitism within Labour dogged Jeremy Corbyn's time as leader. In a July 2019 BBC Panorama programme, entitled Is Labour Anti-Semitic?, a number of former party officials alleged that senior figures close to the leadership at the time had interfered in the process of dealing with anti-Semitism complaints. They also claimed they had faced a huge increase in complaints since Mr Corbyn's election as leader in 2015. Labour pays damages to anti-Semitism whistleblowers A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims A party statement at the time denounced them as ""disaffected former staff"" who had ""personal and political axes"" to grind and accused them of trying to undermine Mr Corbyn - who was replaced as leader by Sir Keir Starmer in April this year. Seven of the whistleblowers took legal action and, in a statement read out in the High Court last month, Labour unreservedly apologised, saying it was determined to root out anti-Semitism in the party and the wider movement. It admitted its earlier press statement had ""contained defamatory and false allegations about these whistleblowers"". Angela Rayner said it was time to heal Labour's divisions Mr McCluskey, a supporter of Mr Corbyn, has criticised the accompanying payout, telling the Observer: ""It's an abuse of members' money. A lot of it is Unite's money and I'm already being asked all kinds of questions by my executive. ""It's as though a huge sign has been put up outside the Labour Party with 'Queue here with your writ and get your payment over there'."" He said there was ""no doubt"" the union's executive would demand a review of its funding of Labour. Unite gave Â£401,875 to the party in the first three months of this year and has donated several million pounds over recent years. After the whistleblowers' settlement, Mr Corbyn described the party's response as ""disappointing"", adding that the legal advice had been that Labour ""had a strong defence"". But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said it was a ""prudent move"" which was ""part of that healing process"" that the party needed. The Labour Party has been contacted for a response to Mr McCluskey's comments.

Covid cluster linked to bar after 13 new cases,"The bar said customers who had visited on 26 July had tested positive for coronavirus A cluster of 13 cases of Covid-19 linked to a pub in Aberdeen is being investigated by public health officials. NHS Grampian said the cases were associated with The Hawthorn Bar in Holburn Street in the city centre. The pub said the outbreak was linked to customers who visited on 26 July. The cluster comes as thelatest figures,externalshowed 31 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Scotland in the past 24 hours. That is higher than the30 Covid-19 cases reportedon Friday - which was the biggest daily increase for eight weeks. Despite the rise in cases, there were no deaths reported in Scotland due to coronavirus for the 17th day in a row. All those who have tested positive in Aberdeen are showing only mild symptoms, though the health board said there may be further cases linked to the cluster. One man, who is now being treated in hospital for coronavirus and who visited the bar last week, said he first began feeling ill on Wednesday. The patient, who has asked not to be identified, told the BBC: ""By Saturday morning I felt terrible. I had a severe fever and my eyes were really sore. I also had a pain in my side and doctors considered removing my appendix which they thought may have become infected from the virus."" He added: ""It was very surreal being rushed to hospital and my mind did start to wonder in case things took a nasty turn. ""However, I do feel lucky that I only have mild symptoms and that I haven't had any breathing difficulties."" Health officials in Grampian said physical distancing measures were in place at the bar and contact tracing was being carried out to trace those linked with the cluster. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch said: ""We've sent people to have a look, and everything was in place that we have written down that should be in place. ""Same with thepharmacy earlier on in the week in Port Glasgow- very well managed, no blame. ""But this virus just needs a moment to jump across a household. So it's an individual responsibility as well as a business responsibility to take that enormously seriously."" In a statement published on their Facebook page, management at The Adams & The Hawthorn said they had been given permission to continue trading and that appropriate safety measures were in place. The statement said the venue had undergone deep cleaning as well as ""decontamination by fogging"". Phil Adams, who owns the bar, said he was ""absolutely devastated"" by news of the cluster. He added: ""We've put a lot of measures in place and we've worked very hard to ensure all our staff and customers are safe. ""This is a very trying time, not just for me but for everyone involved with the business."" The tally of 31 new cases across Scotland on Sunday accounts for 1.1% of newly tested individuals, according to the Scottish government. The figures also showed there were 265 people in hospital with Covid-19 as of Saturday evening, and three in intensive care. In response to the latest figures, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Another day y'day with no deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid. ""However, 31 new cases reported. All of these being carefully investigated and appropriate action taken. But we should take this as a further warning that Covid is still out there."" The daily figures showed that no new deaths were recorded among people who tested positive for the virus, meaning the tally under this specific measurement remains at 2,491. However, thetotal number of coronavirus-linked deaths as calculated by the National Records of Scotlandcurrently stands at 4,201. CASES:Where are the latest cases? DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

Microsoft pauses talks on TikTok US deal - reports,"US tech giant Microsoft has confirmed that it is continuing talks to purchase the US operations of Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella had a conversation with President Donald Trump about the acquisition on Sunday, the tech firm said. Microsoft stressed that it ""fully appreciates the importance"" of addressing President Trump's concerns. A full security review of the app will be conducted, the company added. Microsoft will also have to provide the US government with a list of the ""proper economic benefits"" to the country, it said in ablog post,external. The tech giant hopes to conclude discussions with TikTok's parent firm ByteDance by 15 September. TikTok hits back after Trump threatens US ban How would the US go about banning TikTok? Should we be worried about TikTok? Microsoft said it was looking to purchase the TikTok service in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and would operate the app in these markets. The tech firm added that it ""may"" invite other American investors to participate in the purchase ""on a minority basis"". Microsoft emphasised that it would ensure that ""all private data of TikTok's American users"" was transferred to and remained in the US. Further, it would ensure that any data currently stored or backed up outside the country would be deleted from servers after it was transferred to US data centres. It also said that Microsoft ""appreciates the US Government's and President Trump's personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country."" But the tech giant added that current discussions were still in the ""preliminary"" stage, and as such there was ""no assurance"" that the purchase would proceed. A possible sale of TikTok's US operations to Microsoft was thought to be on hold after Donald Trump vowed to ban the video-sharing app, according to aWall Street Journal report,external. The potential sale had been seen close to agreement but was put in doubt after the US president's warning on Friday. And on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that President Trumpwould take action ""in the coming days"" against Chinese-owned softwarethat he believed to pose a national security risk. Speaking to Fox News, Mr Pompeo said the action would be taken ""with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party"". Short-form video app TikTok is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide - and about 80 million in the US - with a huge proportion of these in their teens or early 20s. This video can not be played WATCH: Will TikTok be banned? Some US politicians are worried the app's Chinese owner ByteDance poses a risk to national security because it could be used to collect Americans' personal data. Regulators have also raised their own safety concerns. Late on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ""As far as TikTok is concerned we're banning them from the United States."" And in a statement on Saturday, a White House spokesman said: ""The administration has very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to evaluate future policy."" The Wall Street Journal said ByteDance tried to make significant concessions to the White House, including creating thousands of jobs over three years. A sale of the US operation to Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, would give the US tech giant a far greater presence in social media, an area dominated by rivals. The value of TikTok's US arm has been put at between $15bn and $30bn (Â£11bn-Â£23bn). According to the Financial Times,external, some executives at ByteDance believe Mr Trump's intervention may just be a negotiating ploy to help Microsoft secure a better deal. TikTok declined to discuss the possible Microsoft deal, but a spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday: ""While we do not comment on rumours or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok."" The statement re-iterated that the company was committed to protecting the privacy and safety of users. The move to ban TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The president's announcement on Friday was criticised by some in the tech sector, including former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos, who questioned whether the move was spurred by national security concerns. He tweeted: ""This is getting bizarre. A 100% sale to an American company would have been considered a radical solution two week ago and, eventually, mitigates any reasonable data protection concerns. If the White House kills this we know this isn't about national security."" Mr Trump was also criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Banning an app that millions of Americans use to communicate with each other is a danger to free expression and is technologically impractical,"" said the ACLU's surveillance and cybersecurity counsel, Jennifer Granick. ""Shutting one platform down, even if it were legally possible to do so, harms freedom of speech online and does nothing to resolve the broader problem of unjustified government surveillance,"" she said. On Saturday, in a bid to reassure TikTok's millions of US users,Vanessa Pappas, the country's general manager said in a video message: ""We're not going anywhereâ.â.â. We're here for the long run. ""When it comes to safety and security, we're building the safest app because we know it's the right thing to do. So we appreciate the support.""

'Major incident' in Manchester over Covid-19 rise,"Parts of northern England were subject to increased restrictions last week due to a rise in Covid-19 cases A major incident has been declared by authorities in Greater Manchester following recent rises in coronavirus infection rates. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the decision was taken to help agencies respond ""as effectively as possible"", including with extra resources. People ""should not be alarmed"" by the news as it was ""standard practice"", Manchester City Council said. Greater Manchester is one of the areas subject to new lockdown measures. The new restrictions announced on Thursday - that also apply in east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire - ban separate households from meeting each other at home. The new rules also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, but those businesses are permitted to remain open for those visiting individually or from the same household. The guidelines issued on Thursday remain ""unchanged"" says Greater Manchester Combined Authority Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), which is made up of ten councils - Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan - said the public should be ""reassured"" that the guidelines remain unchanged. ""This move was simply to enable public agencies to access any additional resources they need as quickly and efficiently as possible,"" a GMCA spokesperson said. ""This is no more than a boost to our capabilities... and maximise our resources in the drive to reverse the spike in infection which we have witnessed in the last seven to 10 days."" People, who do not live together, have been banned from meeting in a private home or garden.,external Your household only includes the people you live with. If you have formed a support bubble, which must include people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18, these can be treated as if they're members of your household. You can continue to meet in public outdoor spaces in groups of no more than six people, unless the group includes only people from two households. You cannot meet people you do not live with in a private garden. you should socially distance from people you do not live with - unless they are in your support bubble.

India is currently seeing a surge in coronavirus infections. On Sunday the country recorded more than 50,000 new cases for the fourth day in a row. Maharashtra, home to the financial capital, Mumbai, has been the worst affected state but there are rapid rises in other areas including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Assam. In another development on Sunday, Indian home minister Amit Shah said he had tested positive for Covid-19. Posting on Twitter, Mr Shah said he felt well but had been admitted to hospital on the advice of doctors.

Minke whale in danger of being stranded is rescued,"A minke whale was spotted off Fish Sands on the Hartlepool headland A minke whale in danger of being stranded on a beach has been rescued. It was spotted off Fish Sands on the Hartlepool headland at about 11:00 BST on Saturday. British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said mammal medics and the local coastguard team had supported the whale in the water until specialist equipment arrived. Rescuers had hoped to secure it again so it could be checked by a vet but said it had swum into deeper water. ""We needed to keep the animal close to shore without causing it to strand, so that we could continue to assess its breathing and manoeuvre it on to rescue pontoons,"" BDMLR said. ""But, before we were able to fully inflate them, the whale made a sudden movement and swam away."" BDMLR said minke whales were often found in the North Sea during the summer.

Who are Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken?,"Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley arrived in Florida on 20 May to prepare for launch Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by travelling to the International Space Station (ISS) and back aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members. On 30 May 2020, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken broke a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz. But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program. Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft. Key questions about the mission How we got to this point What is the Crew Dragon? Evolution of the spacesuit What's the mission plan? The Crew Dragon undergoes final processing prior to the Demo-2 launch ""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight. Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him."" This video can not be played Nasa's Dr Michael Barratt explains what qualities are required of today's astronauts. Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends. ""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley. When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too. Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel. Hurley and Nyberg take their son for a stroll in Red Square, just prior to Nyberg's 2013 flight Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas. ""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,""Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.,external Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six. Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport. Behnken in 2009, training for the STS-130 shuttle mission They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,""Behnken told CNN before the launch,external. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands."" Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two. The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009. Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010,he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"",external, adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person."" Hurley piloted the final flight of the shuttle era, in 2011 He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines. They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven. ""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table."" Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms. Behnken (L) and Hurley pose for pictures in front of the Crew Dragon Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay. When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as theprime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.,external ""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month. They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels. Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX. ""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained. Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley. Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship."" Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree. ""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""

How is Nasa using commercial partners?,"Elon Musk's SpaceX is flying people to and from the International Space Station (ISS), using the Crew Dragon vehicle. But why is Nasa paying a private company to launch its astronauts? To understand the background to the Crew Dragon missions, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident. On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster. The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America's human spaceflight programme. On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon. Artwork: Nasa conceived of the Orion spacecraft as a replacement to the shuttle The following year, then-Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit. This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort. At the time, SpaceX, the company started by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk was just a few years old. Musk had lofty ambitions about bringing down the cost of spaceflight by re-using space hardware and settling humans on Mars. ""SpaceX was founded to make life multi-planetary,"" says Jessica Jensen, director of Starship mission hardware and operation at SpaceX. But, she adds: ""We were a very small company for several years. So we had to look for opportunities - how do you go from being a small company to actually putting people into orbit. When Nasa came out with the need to fly cargo to and from the International Space Station, we jumped on that."" The Dragon 1 spacecraft was designed to carry cargo to and from the space station SpaceX was shortlisted for evaluation under the Nasa cargo programme in 2006. But by 2008, SpaceX and Tesla, the electric car manufacturer in which Musk had invested, were running low on cash. Musk was faced with an impossible choice: ""I could either split the funds that I had between the two companies, or focus it on one company - with certain death for the other,""he told Business Insider in 2013.,external ""I decided in the end to split what I had and try to keep both companies alive. But that could have been a terrible decision that could have resulted in both companies dying."" Fortunately, on 23 December 2008, Nasa awarded SpaceX with a $1.6bn contract to ferry cargo and supplies to the ISS. Describing his reaction, Musk said: ""I couldn't even maintain my composure, I was like: 'I love you guys'."" The company's Dragon 1 capsule could carry cargo and supplies, but not humans. Nevertheless, it represented a milestone for the company. In November 2008, Barack Obama had been elected president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor's plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation). SpaceX performed a successful flight to the space station without crew in 2019 However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space, backing the development of private crew vehicles. But it would take time and, after the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to fill the gap by paying Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur in Kazakhstan. Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief under Obama, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed. From their initial $50m investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014. Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs. In March 2019, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station. It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight, particularly the launch and return phases. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the aim of taking humans to other planets Despite this success, and others along the way, it hasn't always been plain sailing for SpaceX. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. And in April 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during a so-called static fire test on the ground. No one was hurt in either event. The spacecraft was also having problems with the parachute system designed to bring it back safely to Earth. These mishaps, along withearlier funding shortfalls for the Commercial Crew Program,external, had introduced delays to an original timeline that would have seen SpaceX launch crew to the ISS in October 2016. Frustrated by the hold ups and the time SpaceX was spending on its Starship project to build a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

Bridenstine sent the tweet the night before a major Starship media event where Musk was due to speak. The next day, Musk shot back with a dig at the agency's own timelines. Asked about the tweet by CNN, Musk answered: ""Did he (Bridenstine) say Commercial Crew or SLS?"" The SpaceX founder was referring to Nasa's Space Launch System rocket - designed to launch humans to the Moon - which has also been hit by delays and cost overruns. Musk's company wasn't alone in experiencing challenges, however. A timing anomaly prevented Boeing's spacecraft - the CST-100 Starliner - from docking with the space station during an uncrewed test flight last year. This video can not be played ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug"" However, a successful in-flight test of the Crew Dragon's launch abort system in January 2020 helped clear the way for the historic first lift-off with astronauts from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on 30 May. Nasa's Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken spent two months aboard the ISS before returning to Earth safely in the capsule. In the post-launch press conference, both Bridenstine and Musk struck more conciliatory tones, in contrast to the tensions over the Starship project. ""If you would have told me then (eight months prior, when he sent the tweet) that we would be right here today, I don't know that I would have believed it,"" said Bridenstine. ""Since that day, Elon Musk and SpaceX have delivered on everything Nasa has asked them to deliver on - and at a speed that we never would have guessed."" The Nasa chief also congratulated SpaceX on its safety culture. Musk replied: ""Nasa made us way better than we would otherwise have been - and of course, we couldn't even have got started without Nasa.""

Union calls for clarity on schools,"Schools in England began reopening to some year groups in June Teachers and parents need ""greater clarity"" on the reopening of schools amid a rise in coronavirus cases, the head of a leading teachers' union says. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said teachers need extra details to prepare for pupils' return. Schools inEnglandare due to reopen in September. There are separate plans forScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. The government said it has set out the measures that schools in England should follow to reduce the transmission risk. It comes as two scientists advising the government said some restrictions may need to come back into force to allow pupils back into the classroom. And England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned the country is ""near the limit"" for opening up society. Mr Roachtold the Observer,externalministers will have to convince staff and parents that it is still safe to reopen schools next month. ""The warning from the chief medical officer that a fine balance has to be struck in ensuring public health at this stage of the pandemic, and that the country may have reached the limits to the easing of lockdown, will no doubt prompt questions for many parents as well as for those working in schools,"" he said. Boris Johnson has previously pledged that both primary and secondary schools in England will return in September ""with full attendance"". Mr Roach warned that, if schools are to reopen safely, the government needed to give teachers clarification around the latest scientific advice ""as well as sufficient time to review and, if necessary, adjust their reopening plans"". The National Education Union also issued a statement, saying the government needs ""to monitor the situation nationally and in each region"" and ""be transparent about what the picture means for schools"". ""It is clear, however, that [the] government needs a plan B in the event that restrictions have to be increased in or before September,"" said the union's deputy general secretary Avis Gilmore. On Sunday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told Times Radio that schools would definitely return to full capacity in September. ""I think you're right to say that reopening schools and getting our children back into the classroom with that direct face-to-face contact with their teachers will be a priority for the government when we have to make those tough choices,"" he said. At-a-glance: What can I do now? Does my child have to go back to school? 'Soft play is heading for a cliff edge' Prof Graham Medley, a scientist advising the government, told the BBC on Saturday that pubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month. Prof Medley, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) sub-group on pandemic modelling, said he believed most people ""think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households"". ""And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools,"" he added. ""It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other, and then that's a matter of prioritising. Do we think pubs are more important than schools?"" Another Sage member, Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, said there would probably be a second wave of the virus in October and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children from September."" On Friday,the PM said further easing of the lockdown would be delayed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Measures due to come in this weekend, including the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and some close-contact services, as well as the return of indoor performances and pilots of large gatherings in sports venues and conference centres, have been postponed for at least a fortnight. The expansion of wedding receptions to allow up to 30 people is also on hold. Mr Johnson said on Friday he needed to ""squeeze the brake pedal"" on easing restrictions following a rise in coronavirus cases. Latest figures showed a further 74 deaths were reported in the UK on Saturday, taking the total number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus to 46,193.The latest government statistics,externalalso showed 771 new cases had been confirmed.

Astronauts' SpaceX capsule heading for splashdown,"This video can not be played ""Thank you for flying SpaceX"" - Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken return to Earth Two American astronauts have splashed down, as the first commercial crewed mission to the International Space Station returned to Earth. The SpaceX Dragon Capsule carrying Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken came down in the Gulf of Mexico just south of Pensacola on Florida's Gulf coast. A recovery vessel moved in to pick up the vehicle and extricate the men. The touchdown marks the first crewed US water landing since the final outing of an Apollo command module 45 years ago. Hurley's and Behnken's capsule hit the water at about 14:48 EDT (19:48 BST; 18:48 GMT). Private boats which came close to the Dragon were asked to leave amid concern over hazardous chemicals venting from the capsule's propulsion system. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said the presence of the boats ""was not what we were anticipating"". ""What is not common is having passersby approach the vehicle close range with nitrogen tetroxide in the atmosphere; that's not something that is good,"" he said. ""And we need to make sure that we're warning people not to get close to the spacecraft in the future."" Photos of the boats were shared on social media. Allow Twitter content?

The successful end to the crew's mission initiates a new era for the American space agency.

The government agency says contracting out to service providers in this way will save it billions of dollars that can be diverted to getting astronauts to the Moon, as part of its Artemis programme, and afterwards to Mars. The Dragon capsule launched to the space station at the end of May on a Falcon 9 rocket, also supplied by SpaceX. Hurley's and Behnken's mission served as an end-to-end demonstration of the astronaut ""taxi service"" the company, owned by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, will be selling to Nasa from now on. The Boeing corporation is also developing a crew capsule solution but has had to delay its introduction after encountering software problems on its Starliner vehicle. The sight of the vehicle's four main parachutes floating down over the Gulf of Mexico was confirmation the spacecraft had survived its high-speed, fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. The parachutes were required to further slow the capsule from about 350mph (560km/h) to just roughly 15mph (7m/s) at splashdown. Rigging was used to hoist the capsule out of the water and on to the recovery vessel. Technicians monitored ""remnant vapours"" around the spacecraft before the hatch was opened.

New homes to get 'automatic' planning permits,"New homes and hospitals will be granted ""automatic"" permission to be built as part of sweeping planning reforms in England, the housing secretary says. Robert Jenrick announced a ""permission in principle"" will be given to developments on land designated ""for renewal"" to speed-up building. It comes after the PM pledged Â£5bn to ""build, build, build"" to help soften the economic impact of coronavirus. Shelter has warned against any reforms that lead to ""bad-quality"" housing. The homeless charity has said 280,000 homes received permission in England between 2011 and 2016 but were never built. Writing inthe Sunday Telegraph,external, Mr Jenrick said that, under the new rules, land will be designated in one of three categories: for growth, for renewal and for protection. And he insisted: ""We are cutting red tape, but not standards."" However, James Jamieson, the chair of the Local Government Association, said the idea that planning was a barrier to house building was ""a myth"". ""Nine in 10 planning applications are approved by councils, while more than a million homes given planning permission in the last decade have not yet been built,"" he said. ""Only last week the government's own independent report warned of the worse quality of homes not delivered through the planning system. We urge the government to heed these warnings and not further sideline the planning process."" The changes being brought forward this week are expected to only impact England, as national planning policy is devolved to administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Where can I afford to live? Download your BBC guide to housing in the UK Lack of open spaces 'highlighted by pandemic' Mr Jenrick said that the country's ""outdated and cumbersome"" planning system had contributed to a generational divide between those who are homeowners and those who are not. And he claimed that, under the existing guidelines, it takes an average of five years for a ""standard housing development"" to go through the planning system. BBC Reality Check saidthere had been criticism in recent years of the amount of time it takes to get planning permission. But it also noted that many developers secure planning permission and then do not immediately build. In 2017-18, 382,997 applications were granted, which would be more than enough to meet the government target of 300,000 new homes a year. Tree-lined streets will be ""provided for in law"", Mr Jenrick pledged ""Land designated for growth will empower development - new homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices will be allowed automatically,"" Mr Jenrick said. However, he did not specify the criteria for designating land under these proposals. Areas of outstanding natural beauty and the green belt will be protected. ""I am completely overhauling the system so we can build more good quality, attractive and affordable homes faster - and more young families can finally have the key to their own home,"" Mr Jenrick added. He said the new plans will also focus on quality and design, drawing on inspiration from the idea of design codes and pattern books that built the picturesque city of Bath, model village of Bournville and wealthy district of Belgravia in London. Eco-friendly homes with new spaces and parks nearby would be built, he added, saying local authorities will move away from placing notices on lampposts towards an interactive online system. Housing campaigners have called for reforms to protect the quality of new homes The Federation of Master Builders, which represents small traders, has previously said construction output fell to historic lows due to the coronavirus pandemic and that streamlining planning applications would bring forward new developments. Mr Jenrick said the reforms would ""create thousands of new jobs, from bricklayers to architects"". In June, Boris Johnson vowed to ""build, build, build"" to help Britain bounce back from the pandemic, promising a Â£5bn package to build homes and infrastructure. The PM promised the ""most radical reforms"" of the planning system since World War Two. This is the moment to be ambitious â PM Boris Johnson's economy speech fact-checked The Conservative Party has repeatedly pledged to ""build and fund"" 40 new or rebuilt NHS hospitals before 2029. The UK's planning system was effectively established in 1947, two years after the end of the war, with the Town and Country Planning Act. Mr Jenrick's announcement comes a few weeks after he came under fire for his decision to grant planning permission for a Â£1bn property scheme in east London just before changes to local planning rules and two weeks prior to the developer donating Â£12,000 to the Conservatives. The secretary of state denied any link between the events, but accepted that his decision to approve the development was unlawful.

Teachers' union urges clarity on school reopening,"Schools in England began reopening to some year groups in June Teachers and parents need ""greater clarity"" on the reopening of schools amid a rise in coronavirus cases, the head of a leading teachers' union says. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said teachers need extra details to prepare for pupils' return. Schools inEnglandare due to reopen in September. There are separate plans forScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. The government said it has set out the measures that schools in England should follow to reduce the transmission risk. It comes as two scientists advising the government said some restrictions may need to come back into force to allow pupils back into the classroom. And England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned the country is ""near the limit"" for opening up society. Mr Roachtold the Observer,externalministers will have to convince staff and parents that it is still safe to reopen schools next month. ""The warning from the chief medical officer that a fine balance has to be struck in ensuring public health at this stage of the pandemic, and that the country may have reached the limits to the easing of lockdown, will no doubt prompt questions for many parents as well as for those working in schools,"" he said. Boris Johnson has previously pledged that both primary and secondary schools in England will return in September ""with full attendance"". Mr Roach warned that, if schools are to reopen safely, the government needed to give teachers clarification around the latest scientific advice ""as well as sufficient time to review and, if necessary, adjust their reopening plans"". The National Education Union also issued a statement, saying the government needs ""to monitor the situation nationally and in each region"" and ""be transparent about what the picture means for schools"". ""It is clear, however, that [the] government needs a plan B in the event that restrictions have to be increased in or before September,"" said the union's deputy general secretary Avis Gilmore. On Sunday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told Times Radio that schools would definitely return to full capacity in September. ""I think you're right to say that reopening schools and getting our children back into the classroom with that direct face-to-face contact with their teachers will be a priority for the government when we have to make those tough choices,"" he said. At-a-glance: What can I do now? Does my child have to go back to school? 'Soft play is heading for a cliff edge' Prof Graham Medley, a scientist advising the government, told the BBC on Saturday that pubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month. Prof Medley, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) sub-group on pandemic modelling, said he believed most people ""think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households"". ""And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools,"" he added. ""It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other, and then that's a matter of prioritising. Do we think pubs are more important than schools?"" Another Sage member, Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, said there would probably be a second wave of the virus in October and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children from September.""

Stars from music industry sign anti-racism letter,"More than 700 people from the UK music industry - including artists, managers, producers and companies -have written an open letter,externalurging people to ""stand together"" and ""wipe out racism now"". Little Mix, Nile Rodgers, Lewis Capaldi and Rita Ora are among the stars calling for an end to racism. ""We are at our worst when we attack one another,"" the letter said. It cited recent ""anti-Jewish racism"", after grime artist Wiley shared anti-Semitic posts.Wiley later apologised. Hundreds of representatives from the music industry co-signed the letter, which says they want to show ""that love, unity and friendship, not division and hatred, must and will always be our common cause"". Black Lives Matter: From social media post to global movement BBC iPlayer: My Fight to Protest The stars who have signed it include The 1975, MNEK, Clean Bandit, Yungblud, Labrinth, Biffy Clyro, Mabel, Years & Years, Jess Glynne, Jonas Blue, Niall Horan, James Blunt, Naughty Boy, Grace Carter, and Joy Crookes. Ed Sheeran's manager, Stuart Camp, as well as Stevie Wonder's manager, Keith Harris, have also signed it, along with the president of EMI and labels such as Universal Music UK, Warner Music UK and Sony Music UK. ""Whether it be systemic racism and racial inequality highlighted by continued police brutality in America or anti-Jewish racism promulgated through online attacks, the result is the same: suspicion, hatred and division,"" it says. ""We are at our worst when we attack one another. ""Minorities from all backgrounds and faiths have struggled and suffered. From slavery to the Holocaust we have painful collective memories. ""All forms of racism have the same roots - ignorance, lack of education and scapegoating. ""We, the British music industry are proudly uniting to amplify our voices, to take responsibility, to speak out and stand together in solidarity. Silence is not an option."" The letter adds that music ""brings joy and hope and connects us all"", adding: ""Through music, education and empathy we can find unity. We stand together, to educate and wipe out racism now and for our future generations."" Wiley - known as the ""godfather of grime"" - recently made headlines after sharing a series of anti-Semitic tweets. He was dropped by his management and later banned by Twitter, following a public boycott of the social media network. In an interview with Sky News last week, Wiley apologised for ""generalising"" about Jewish people and said: ""I'm not racist,"" although the broadcaster said he repeated comments similar to those posted on his Twitter which were too inflammatory to broadcast. Organisers of the letter said that anyone that wants to add their name to the letter can do so over the coming week.

"New homes to get 'automatic' planning permitsThe housing secretary says a ""permission in principle"" will speed-up building and create jobs.UK","New homes and hospitals will be granted ""automatic"" permission to be built as part of sweeping planning reforms in England, the housing secretary says. Robert Jenrick announced a ""permission in principle"" will be given to developments on land designated ""for renewal"" to speed-up building. It comes after the PM pledged Â£5bn to ""build, build, build"" to help soften the economic impact of coronavirus. Shelter has warned against any reforms that lead to ""bad-quality"" housing. The homeless charity has said 280,000 homes received permission in England between 2011 and 2016 but were never built. Writing inthe Sunday Telegraph,external, Mr Jenrick said that, under the new rules, land will be designated in one of three categories: for growth, for renewal and for protection. And he insisted: ""We are cutting red tape, but not standards."" However, James Jamieson, the chair of the Local Government Association, said the idea that planning was a barrier to house building was ""a myth"". ""Nine in 10 planning applications are approved by councils, while more than a million homes given planning permission in the last decade have not yet been built,"" he said. ""Only last week the government's own independent report warned of the worse quality of homes not delivered through the planning system. We urge the government to heed these warnings and not further sideline the planning process."" The changes being brought forward this week are expected to only impact England, as national planning policy is devolved to administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Where can I afford to live? Download your BBC guide to housing in the UK Lack of open spaces 'highlighted by pandemic' Mr Jenrick said that the country's ""outdated and cumbersome"" planning system had contributed to a generational divide between those who are homeowners and those who are not. And he claimed that, under the existing guidelines, it takes an average of five years for a ""standard housing development"" to go through the planning system. BBC Reality Check saidthere had been criticism in recent years of the amount of time it takes to get planning permission. But it also noted that many developers secure planning permission and then do not immediately build. In 2017-18, 382,997 applications were granted, which would be more than enough to meet the government target of 300,000 new homes a year. Tree-lined streets will be ""provided for in law"", Mr Jenrick pledged ""Land designated for growth will empower development - new homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices will be allowed automatically,"" Mr Jenrick said. However, he did not specify the criteria for designating land under these proposals. Areas of outstanding natural beauty and the green belt will be protected. ""I am completely overhauling the system so we can build more good quality, attractive and affordable homes faster - and more young families can finally have the key to their own home,"" Mr Jenrick added. He said the new plans will also focus on quality and design, drawing on inspiration from the idea of design codes and pattern books that built the picturesque city of Bath, model village of Bournville and wealthy district of Belgravia in London. Eco-friendly homes with new spaces and parks nearby would be built, he added, saying local authorities will move away from placing notices on lampposts towards an interactive online system. Housing campaigners have called for reforms to protect the quality of new homes The Federation of Master Builders, which represents small traders, has previously said construction output fell to historic lows due to the coronavirus pandemic and that streamlining planning applications would bring forward new developments. Mr Jenrick said the reforms would ""create thousands of new jobs, from bricklayers to architects"". In June, Boris Johnson vowed to ""build, build, build"" to help Britain bounce back from the pandemic, promising a Â£5bn package to build homes and infrastructure. The PM promised the ""most radical reforms"" of the planning system since World War Two. This is the moment to be ambitious â PM Boris Johnson's economy speech fact-checked The Conservative Party has repeatedly pledged to ""build and fund"" 40 new or rebuilt NHS hospitals before 2029. The UK's planning system was effectively established in 1947, two years after the end of the war, with the Town and Country Planning Act. Mr Jenrick's announcement comes a few weeks after he came under fire for his decision to grant planning permission for a Â£1bn property scheme in east London just before changes to local planning rules and two weeks prior to the developer donating Â£12,000 to the Conservatives. The secretary of state denied any link between the events, but accepted that his decision to approve the development was unlawful.

"South African virus cases pass half million markThe country has the world's fifth-highest number of infections, and largest tally in Africa.Africa","This video can not be played Coronavirus in South Africa: A day in the life of a contact tracer More than half a million coronavirus cases have been confirmed in South Africa, according to the country's health minister. Zweli Mkhize announced 10,107 new cases on Saturday, bringing the tally to 503,290, along with 8,153 deaths. South Africa is the hardest-hit country on the continent and accounts for half of all reported infections in Africa. It also has the fifth-highest number of cases in the world after the US, Brazil, Russia and India. Researchers have said the true number of deaths in the country may be far higher. South African health authorities have said the rate of infection is increasing rapidly, with cases currently concentrated around the capital, Pretoria. Coronavirus in SA: Why things are going both right and wrong South Africa's outbreak: Eight lessons for the rest of the continent How fast is coronavirus spreading in Africa? More than a third of all infections have been reported in Gauteng,external- South Africa's financial hub, and a province that has quickly become the epicentre of the national outbreak. Infections are not expected to peak for another month. Responding to the new figures, President Cyril Ramaphosa called on citizens to remain vigilant. ""We have to continue to work together to reduce the number of new infections. As with many other countries across the world, we need to continually adjust the measures we take to prevent new outbreaks or to safeguard our health system"", he said. South Africa imposed a strict lockdown in April and May that slowed the spread of the coronavirus. South Africa is grappling with the largest outbreak on the continent It began a gradual reopening in June but restrictions - including a ban on alcohol sales - were reintroduced last month as infection rates began to rise again. A state of emergency is also in force until 15 August. By Lucy Fleming, BBC News The president tried to highlight the positive as South Africa reached its grim milestone in the battle against coronavirus. He pointed to a recovery rate of 68% and said the number of deaths was ""significantly lower than the global average"". But experts warn to be wary of statistics given the different criteria and methods used by different provinces - and comparisons with African countries where there has low levels of testing. Mr Ramaphosa said the lockdown had prevented the health system from becoming initially overwhelmed and the suspension of alcohol sales had significantly reduced the number of trauma cases in hospitals Yet even with such strict restrictions - it has been mandatory, for example, to wear face masks in public since May - social distancing is often impossible in South Africa's densely packed townships, where the virus has been quick to spread during the winter season. The president's comments about investigations into allegations of corruption over the procurement of medical supplies - some alleged to implicate his own aides - perhaps underline the crux of the problems facing the country's health system. ""It is unconscionable that there are people who may be using this health crisis to unlawfully enrich themselves,"" he said. The influx of patients has put an incredible strain on South Africa's hospitals, anda BBC investigation found an array of systematic failuresthat had exhausted healthcare professionals and brought the health service near to collapse. President Ramaphosa said last month that 28,000 hospital beds had been made available for Covid-19 patients but the country still faced a ""serious"" shortage of doctors and nurses. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health Last week the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that South Africa's experience was a likely a precursor to what would happen across the rest of the continent. So far African countries have generally reported low death rates per capita compared to other parts of the world. The WHO says this could be partly because of the relatively young population in Africa - more than 60% are under the age of 25. Covid-19 is known to have a higher mortality rate for older age groups.

Maximilian de Courten, an epidemiologist at the University of Victoria, said the outbreak was different to the first phase of infections earlier in the year. In the early stages of the pandemic, most of the cases were imported from abroad with âvery little spread of the virus in the communityâ, De Courten told the BBC. âBut now the virus is out in the community and the same lockdown measures from the earlier round were probably not strong enough,â the expert said. He said a significant proportion of what he called âmystery casesâ - those that cannot be traced back to work or home - had made matters worse this time. ""In comparison to the first wave in March and April, we had a fraction, about 10 to 15%, of cases where our trackers could not find out how they got infected in the community and those are the worrisome ones,â De Courten said.

""After a rapid rise in infections over the last two months, the daily increase in infections appears to be stabilising, particularly in the Western Cape, Gauteng and Eastern Cape,"" he said. ""While it may be too soon to draw firm conclusions, this suggests that the prevention measures that South Africans have implemented are having an effect.""

"Stars from music industry sign anti-racism letterNile Rodgers, Rita Ora and Lewis Capaldi are among those urging people to ""stand together"".Entertainment & Arts","More than 700 people from the UK music industry - including artists, managers, producers and companies -have written an open letter,externalurging people to ""stand together"" and ""wipe out racism now"". Little Mix, Nile Rodgers, Lewis Capaldi and Rita Ora are among the stars calling for an end to racism. ""We are at our worst when we attack one another,"" the letter said. It cited recent ""anti-Jewish racism"", after grime artist Wiley shared anti-Semitic posts.Wiley later apologised. Hundreds of representatives from the music industry co-signed the letter, which says they want to show ""that love, unity and friendship, not division and hatred, must and will always be our common cause"". Black Lives Matter: From social media post to global movement BBC iPlayer: My Fight to Protest The stars who have signed it include The 1975, MNEK, Clean Bandit, Yungblud, Labrinth, Biffy Clyro, Mabel, Years & Years, Jess Glynne, Jonas Blue, Niall Horan, James Blunt, Naughty Boy, Grace Carter, and Joy Crookes. Ed Sheeran's manager, Stuart Camp, as well as Stevie Wonder's manager, Keith Harris, have also signed it, along with the president of EMI and labels such as Universal Music UK, Warner Music UK and Sony Music UK. ""Whether it be systemic racism and racial inequality highlighted by continued police brutality in America or anti-Jewish racism promulgated through online attacks, the result is the same: suspicion, hatred and division,"" it says. ""We are at our worst when we attack one another. ""Minorities from all backgrounds and faiths have struggled and suffered. From slavery to the Holocaust we have painful collective memories. ""All forms of racism have the same roots - ignorance, lack of education and scapegoating. ""We, the British music industry are proudly uniting to amplify our voices, to take responsibility, to speak out and stand together in solidarity. Silence is not an option."" The letter adds that music ""brings joy and hope and connects us all"", adding: ""Through music, education and empathy we can find unity. We stand together, to educate and wipe out racism now and for our future generations."" Wiley - known as the ""godfather of grime"" - recently made headlines after sharing a series of anti-Semitic tweets. He was dropped by his management and later banned by Twitter, following a public boycott of the social media network. In an interview with Sky News last week, Wiley apologised for ""generalising"" about Jewish people and said: ""I'm not racist,"" although the broadcaster said he repeated comments similar to those posted on his Twitter which were too inflammatory to broadcast.

Aubameyang double wins FA Cup for Arsenal,"This video can not be played Highlights: Arsenal beat Chelsea 2-1 to win FA Cup Arsenal's talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang worked his Wembley magic once again as they came from behind to beat Chelsea and win the FA Cup for a record 14th time. Chelsea took the lead in theHeads Up FA Cup finalinside five minutes through Christian Pulisic's smart finish but then fell victim to the brilliance of Aubameyang, who was also Arsenal's hero when he scored twice in the semi-final win over Manchester City. The Gabon forward drew Arsenal level from the penalty spot before the break after he was fouled by Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, then produced a moment of world-class finishing to make the defining contribution to the first behind-closed-doors FA Cup final. Chelsea were hampered by a first-half injury to Azpilicueta and were struggling even further when they lost the outstanding Pulisic to a hamstring problem after the break. As the Blues battled to overcome those setbacks, the brilliant Aubameyang was able to give Mikel Arteta silverware in his first season as the Gunners' manager. Aubameyang, who Arsenal are understandably desperate to secure on a new long-term contract, turned Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma inside out in the 67th minute before delivering the most audacious finish, chipping over keeper Willy Caballero from an angle. Chelsea's agony increased further when Mateo Kovacic was very harshly sent off for a second yellow card, awarded by referee Anthony Taylor for the most innocuous of challenges on Granit Xhaka. Arsenal closed out the win to secure a place in the Europa League next season but it was bitter disappointment for Chelsea manager Frank Lampard at the conclusion of his first campaign in charge. Reaction from Wembley as Arsenal beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final 'Aubameyang would cost zillions to replace' Arsenal v Chelsea: How you rated the players 'We got complacent' - Chelsea boss Lampard 'We can win titles together' - Arteta This video can not be played 'I can't even talk' - Martinez in tears after FA Cup win Arteta's delight at the final whistle was obvious as he secured his first major trophy as a manager, having only succeeded Unai Emery in December. There have been some mixed moments - but in recent weeks, Arsenal have shown their development by defeating new Premier League champions Liverpool and ending Manchester City's hopes of retaining the FA Cup by beating them to reach the final. Now the Gunners have the trophy in their hands after seeing off Chelsea. In each game they have shown character, courage and resilience - all qualities they have regularly been accused of lacking - and have a world-class spearhead in Aubameyang. A player of that calibre makes the difference in the big games. Aubameyang has shown that, making Wembley his personal playground in both the semi-final and the final. It may have been a surreal occasion, this FA Cup final played in a virtually deserted Wembley and missing so much of the traditional ceremony and atmosphere, but the joy of victory was still relished by Arteta and his players and rightly so. And when the celebrations end, Arsenal will know with even more certainty what their summer priority must be, even above any acquisitions. Arsenal must find a way to keep Aubameyang. Their cause is helped by being able to offer him European football, albeit the Europa League rather than the Champions League. He is quite simply a talent that gives Arsenal another dimension of danger. He is a match-winner - and in this instance, an FA Cup final winner. This video can not be played Aubameyang drops...then lifts the FA Cup It all started so well for Chelsea and Lampard as they dominated the opening phases at Wembley and led through Pulisic's goal. The momentum changed after the first-half drinks break as Chelsea were undone by their own injuries, Arsenal's vast improvement and the dismissal of Kovacic. Chelsea lost the experience of Azpilicueta and the thrilling talent of Pulisic, who actually injured his hamstring as he raced in on goal with a very good chance, and were then fighting an uphill battle. They tried to regain that earlier supremacy but were hit by that brilliant goal from Aubameyang and the sending off of Kovacic. The Croatia international was shown a second yellow card for a challenge with Xhaka that raised questions as to whether it was actually a foul before referee Anthony Taylor eventually produced the red card. It more or less signalled the end of Chelsea's hopes. Lampard's first season, which has contained so much promise, concludes with a place in next season's Champions League but not a trophy. There has been much to admire from Chelsea as Lampard has mixed youth and experience but there is a defensive frailty he must address, having added to his attacking resources with the exciting addition of Timo Werner. Those defensive weaknesses were clear as Aubameyang preyed on them in deadly fashion. As they trooped to collect their losers' medals, Chelsea and Lampard will reflect on a day when little went right after that opening five minutes. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang once again showed his value to Arsenal as he inspired them to their first major trophy since 2017 Mikel Arteta has become the first person to both captain and manage Arsenal to victory in an FA Cup final. Chelsea have lost three of their past 10 FA Cup final matches, with all three defeats coming against Arsenal. The Gunners have won each of their past seven FA Cup final appearances since 2002 - no team has had a longer run of successive final triumphs in the competition. Arteta is the first Arsenal manager to win a major trophy in their first season in charge of the club since George Graham in 1986-87. There was just one shot on target in the whole of the second half, which was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's winning goal. Since his debut for Arsenal in February 2018, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 70 goals in all competitions, more than any other Premier League player in that time. Christian Pulisic's opener was the first FA Cup final goal scored by an American player. Mateo Kovacic became the sixth player to be sent off in an FA Cup final, with the last two of them being Chelsea players (Victor Moses was dismissed, also against Arsenal, in 2017). Willy Caballero (38 years 308 days) became the oldest player to play for Chelsea in an FA Cup final, while substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi (19 years 268 days) became the youngest to play in the showpiece for the Blues.

New homes to get 'automatic' planning permission,"New homes and hospitals will be granted ""automatic"" permission to be built as part of sweeping planning reforms in England, the housing secretary says. Robert Jenrick announced a ""permission in principle"" will be given to developments on land designated ""for renewal"" to speed-up building. It comes after the PM pledged Â£5bn to ""build, build, build"" to help soften the economic impact of coronavirus. Shelter has warned against any reforms that lead to ""bad-quality"" housing. The homeless charity has said 280,000 homes received permission in England between 2011 and 2016 but were never built. Writing inthe Sunday Telegraph,external, Mr Jenrick said that, under the new rules, land will be designated in one of three categories: for growth, for renewal and for protection. And he insisted: ""We are cutting red tape, but not standards."" However, James Jamieson, the chair of the Local Government Association, said the idea that planning was a barrier to house building was ""a myth"". ""Nine in 10 planning applications are approved by councils, while more than a million homes given planning permission in the last decade have not yet been built,"" he said. ""Only last week the government's own independent report warned of the worse quality of homes not delivered through the planning system. We urge the government to heed these warnings and not further sideline the planning process."" The changes being brought forward this week are expected to only impact England, as national planning policy is devolved to administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Where can I afford to live? Download your BBC guide to housing in the UK Lack of open spaces 'highlighted by pandemic' Mr Jenrick said that the country's ""outdated and cumbersome"" planning system had contributed to a generational divide between those who are homeowners and those who are not. And he claimed that, under the existing guidelines, it takes an average of five years for a ""standard housing development"" to go through the planning system. BBC Reality Check saidthere had been criticism in recent years of the amount of time it takes to get planning permission. But it also noted that many developers secure planning permission and then do not immediately build. In 2017-18, 382,997 applications were granted, which would be more than enough to meet the government target of 300,000 new homes a year. Tree-lined streets will be ""provided for in law"", Mr Jenrick pledged ""Land designated for growth will empower development - new homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices will be allowed automatically,"" Mr Jenrick said. However, he did not specify the criteria for designating land under these proposals. Areas of outstanding natural beauty and the green belt will be protected. ""I am completely overhauling the system so we can build more good quality, attractive and affordable homes faster - and more young families can finally have the key to their own home,"" Mr Jenrick added. He said the new plans will also focus on quality and design, drawing on inspiration from the idea of design codes and pattern books that built the picturesque city of Bath, model village of Bournville and wealthy district of Belgravia in London. Eco-friendly homes with new spaces and parks nearby would be built, he added, saying local authorities will move away from placing notices on lampposts towards an interactive online system. Housing campaigners have called for reforms to protect the quality of new homes The Federation of Master Builders, which represents small traders, has previously said construction output fell to historic lows due to the coronavirus pandemic and that streamlining planning applications would bring forward new developments. Mr Jenrick said the reforms would ""create thousands of new jobs, from bricklayers to architects"". In June, Boris Johnson vowed to ""build, build, build"" to help Britain bounce back from the pandemic, promising a Â£5bn package to build homes and infrastructure.

The secretary of state denied any link between the events, but accepted that his decision to approve the development was unlawful.

'We're at the limit of easing lockdown',"This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys, it will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have a vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Two weeks ago, Boris Johnson was setting out plansfor normality by Christmas. But since then the number of confirmed infections has started to creep up again. And the Office for National Statistics, which is regularly testing households in England, estimates there are around 4,200 new infections a day, compared with 2,800 a week ago. For the first time since May, we're having to deal with rising numbers of cases. This is not a return to the height of the epidemic in March, when there were an estimated 100,000 infections every day, but it is telling. Every restriction we ease increases the ability of the coronavirus to spread, and the government's scientific advisers have always warned there was not much wiggle room to lift restrictions and still suppress it. The uptick in infections is a warning that we are passing the limits of lifting lockdown. It is clear we are not a New Zealand,where life is almost back to normalafter their ""zero-Covid"" strategy. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, said: ""I think what we're seeing from the data from ONS, and other data, is that we have probably reached near the limit or the limits of what we can do in terms of opening up society. ""So what that means potentially is that if we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things."" School children are on their summer holidays at the moment, but we are just weeks away from the start of term. Schools are expected toreopen fully in England in Septemberand inScotland from 11 August. If the current rules are leading to an increase in cases, can we open schools as well? This has been the concern of scientists since lockdown started to lift. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Or if we want to open schools will we now have to close something else like pubs? Prof Whitty said these would be ""difficult trade-offs"" but it was important to be ""realistic"". ""The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong,"" Prof Whitty said. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, also known as Sage,has already said,externalgovernment may need to ""change measures at the end of the summer in order to be able to keep R below 1 whilst proceeding with the planned reopening of schools"". R is the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average, anything above 1 is growing epidemic. The fact that cases are rising in the height of summer is also a concern. Exactlywhat will happen come winter is uncertain, but experience with other viruses suggests coronavirus will also find it easier to spread. One government adviser told me ""we can get away with a lot in summer"" and that restrictions may needed to be tightened as the seasons turn anyway.

'It's make or break for our firm',"Gita Lavingia says she now cannot see 80% of her clients A decision on Friday to put lockdown easing on hold in England has caused confusion and dismay for businesses. The delay means that places such as casinos and bowling alleys, which had been due to open on 1 August, will have to wait at least two weeks more. Firms in the beauty sector, already angered about delays in being able to fully open, are stunned by the news. ""We're in absolute shock,"" Gita Lavingia, owner of Lavingia Beauty, Clapham, south London told the BBC. ""We literally found out this afternoon, with less than 24 hours' notice, and we have clients booked in for tomorrow."" Ms Lavingia says that 80% of her business is focused on facials. Because the treatments involve close contact with a customer's face, the continuation of restrictions means that her firm will have to cancel most of the bookings it has lined up. ""We lose Â£800 in revenue for each day we cannot fully-operate. And many of our therapists are self-employed, so they are earning nothing at all,"" she added. PM puts lockdown easing on hold in England Visiting people at home banned in parts of England  Ms Lavingia doesn't understand why beauty salons cannot be fully-operational: ""We've always been very careful with health and safety standards, which are crucial protocols in the beauty industry, and since the pandemic, now we have extra precautions in place."" She stressed that clients had provided feedback that they ""felt safe"" to return to the clinic, and therefore they should be allowed to do so. The beauty salon owner said she feels like there is a ""never-ending"" cloud hanging over her - Lavingia Beauty owes approximately Â£8,000 in rent since March, and there is an outstanding VAT bill on the horizon that will need to be dealt with at some point too. The anxiety that she and her staff feel affects the atmosphere at the salon, because clients come to relax and get away from their own troubles, and they can sense that not all is well under the surface. ""It's make or break for our business now - there's a big question mark about how long we can stay open for."" The move has come when many firms were ""starting to get back on their feet"", said the British Chambers of Commerce. Under current restrictions, beauty salons can do nails but not eyebrows BCC co-executive director Claire Walker said: ""While tackling the public health emergency must be the priority, these announcements - made at short notice - will be a hammer blow to business and consumer confidence at a time when many firms were just starting to get back on their feet. ""Business communities need as much clarity as possible from government if they are to plan ahead and rebuild their operations in the coming months."" The National Hair and Beauty Federation also reacted with dismay. Treatments on the face, which were excluded when beauty salons were allowed to reopen in England on 13 July, were due to be given the go-ahead from Saturday, but this has now been postponed. ""We are extremely disappointed that this last-minute decision has been made,"" the federation said. ""We will continue to push for financial support following this further setback."" The CBI said the news would be ""a real disappointment for some businesses"". ""But firms know that public safety comes first."" added the CBI's chief UK policy director, Matthew Fell. Both the BCC and the CBI called for extended support and targeted measures to help businesses affected. ""Businesses will continue to do what is necessary to avoid an infection spike,"" said the CBI's Mr Fell. ""Delayed reopening will unfortunately lead to even more financial pressure for some companies. So there may yet be a need for more direct support to shore up cash flow, including extended business rates relief."" UK Hospitality said the delay was ""devastating news"" for hospitality businesses and leisure venues that had hoped to be back in business this weekend. ""They have spent a lot of time and money, which they can ill afford to lose at the minute, getting ready to reopen. For those people who work in those sectors, the security of their jobs remains uncertain,"" said its chief executive, Kate Nicholls. ""We now need clear communication to ensure that consumer confidence is not damaged further. We are also going to need further support for those businesses that cannot reopen."" Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said the announcement would come as ""a massive blow to thousands of small firms, soon-to-be newlyweds, artists and sportspeople"". ""However, we were warned that restrictions will need to be responsive to any resurgence in transmissions,"" he added. ""What we absolutely have to avoid is a scenario where whole swathes of the small business community - not least those in the creative industries, tourism and leisure sectors - are wiped out entirely."" The news came ina briefing from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said planned reopening for 1 August would be delayed for at least a fortnight. That means venues such as casinos, bowling alleys and skating rinks must remain closed until 15 August. Indoor performances will also not resume and pilots of larger gatherings in sports venues and conference centres will not take place, while wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted. Separately, face coverings will be compulsory in more indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, such as museums and places of worship, from next weekend. They are already required in shops and indoor transport hubs. The prime minister said the rules for face coverings would become enforceable in law from 8 August.
