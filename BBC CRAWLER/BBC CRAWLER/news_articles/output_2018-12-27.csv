Musk tries to dismiss 'pedo' libel claim,"Vern Unsworth (R) helped bring top international cave rescuers to the mission, including Rob Harper (L) Elon Musk is seeking to dismiss a defamation claim by saying that ""over-the-top"" paedophilia claims he tweeted should not be taken seriously. He is being sued by Vern Unsworth, who aided the rescue of 12 boys from Thailand's Tham Luang caves. The two clashed over how to free the boys in an exchange that led to Tesla's chief calling Mr Unsworth ""pedo guy"". Mr Musk's lawyers said the ""insult"" had been made in response to Mr Unsworth's own disparaging remarks. Mr Unsworth is from St Albans, Hertfordshire, but now lives near Chiang Rai in Thailand. The ""vituperative"" exchange between Mr Musk and Mr Unsworth took place during frantic attempts to rescue the 12 boys and their coach from deep within the partially flooded caves in July 2018. Mr Unsworth helped recruit experienced UK cave divers, who were instrumental in freeing the boys. Mr Musk mobilised a group of Tesla engineers to help with the rescue effort and left behind a specially designed mini-submarine that he claimed could help transport the children out of the caves. The submarine was never used to free the boys. In an interview on CNN, Mr Unsworth ridiculed the submarine calling it a ""PR stunt"". Responding in a series of tweets, Mr Musk gave more details about how the submarine might work and posted the ""pedo"" comment. When quizzed for his response, Mr Unsworth said he was considering legal action. Mr Musk (R) alleged that British diver Mr Unsworth (L) had a ""child bride"" Soon after, Mr Musk apologised and deleted the offending tweets saying he had acted ""in anger"". He added: ""His actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologise."" But the row escalated after Mr Musk referenced his initial insult in a separate Twitter exchange. In this, he said it was ""strange"" that Mr Unsworth had not sued him over the allegation despite being offered free legal advice. Soon after, Mr Unsworth's lawyers posted a series of tweets criticising Mr Musk and his characterisation of their client. Documents prepared by Mr Musk's attorney said he responded to this via ""off the record"" emails to Buzzfeed journalists seeking comment in which he issued further ""insults"", some of which alleged Mr Unsworth had a ""child bride"". Despite being labelled as ""off the record"", the emails were published and led to the lodging of the defamation claim in a California court. Mr Musk wants the court to throw out the defamation claim because, his lawyers say, his comments were ""non-actionable opinion"". The legal team said the Tesla chief had never met Mr Unsworth so his comments had no ""factual basis"". Instead, the words were ""over-top-insults not driven by first-hand knowledge"". Mr Musk's lawyers argue at length that because the ""schoolyard spat"" blew up on Twitter, which they say is ""infamous for invective and hyperbole"", no-one could reasonably believe the comments were truthful. The fact that they were on social media served to underline how different they were from a proper press expose or criminal complaint, the lawyers add. Neither Mr Unsworth nor his own legal team have responded to requests for comment by the BBC. The first amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects free speech, makes defamation a challenging legal action to bring. A plaintiff - the person bringing the case - has to prove the statement made about them is false and that it has caused them material harm. However, the toughest hurdle is that if the person bringing the case is regarded as a public figure - and ""public figure"" is given a pretty wide interpretation - it has to be proved that the defendant acted maliciously. In other words, that the person making the statement knew it to be false and went on to make it. Another way of putting it would be that it must be proved that the defendant knowingly lied with the intention of harming the plaintiff. Is this super-fast tunnel the future of travel?

Stock markets resume downward slide,"US stock markets rallied late on Thursday to end in positive territory, continuing their roller coaster ride towards the end of the year. In Asia, most markets were following suit except Japan's Nikkei 225, which was down 0.5% in Friday morning trade. Markets have been volatile as global, political and economic uncertainty continues to haunt investors. The Dow Jones - which fell by more than 500 points or 1.8% earlier on Thursday - finished the trading day 1.1% up. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq also rallied by the end of the Thursday's trading day. The S&P 500 had fallen by 48 points or 2% at one point, while the Nasdaq also sank by more than 2% or 135.4 points. The earlier sell-off was sparked by weak US consumer confidence data for December. However, analysts had cautioned that volatile share price movements were exacerbated by thin holiday trading. Earlier, European markets slumped in their first post-Christmas trading session. London's FTSE 100 slid as the day progressed, ending 1.5% down, with UK shares at their lowest in over two years. Frankfurt's Dax was 2.8% lower, while the Cac 40 in Paris suffered a smaller fall, down just 1.1%. Concerns about US-China trade tensions also resurfaced, with reports saying US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order banning the use of Chinese technology. The US, Australia, Japan and New Zealand have restricted use of ZTE and Huawei equipment in 5G mobile networks, andthe UK is now considering doing the same. On 20 December, the US indicted two Chinese men accused of hacking into computer networks of Western companies and government agencies, and accused Beijing of cyber-spying.

Outcry over short-lived Instagram revamp,"Instagram regulars did not react positively to the horizontal scrolling test Instagram has apologised after a test feature was accidentally rolled out to millions of people using its app. The change meant moving through a feed had to be done by swiping horizontally rather than vertically. Almost as soon as the change was made, users took to Twitter to complain and demand the return of the familiar up-and-down scrolling method. The unwelcome update - which was likened to Tinder - was live for about an hour before it was rolled back. In a tweet,Instagram's head of product Adam Mosseri,externalsaid: ""Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated."" The change trended under the #instagramupdate hashtag on Twitter, accompanied by mostly negative comments. Many asked who had thought changing the scrolling direction would be a good idea. Several called on co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger - who quit earlier this year - to return. Some wondered if it was a way to stop people just scrolling endlessly through updates by making them tap and examine posts before moving on. Instagram user Elise Michelle called it: ""By far the worst update in Instagram history."" Soon after the backlash,Mr Mosseri tweeted,externalthat the change had been ""rolled back"". He added: ""If you're still seeing it you can simply restart your app and you should be good to go."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Student guilty of preparing act of terror,"Imran (left) meeting with Naa'imur Rahman, previously convicted A student who told an undercover MI5 officer he wanted to travel to fight in Libya has been found guilty of preparing an act of terrorism. Aqib Imran, 22, from Birmingham, was convicted after an Old Bailey retrial. During the trial, Imran denied having terrorist intentions, saying he had been sucked into a fantasy that began when he was attracted to a girl online. The jury heard the 22-year-old had educational difficulties and had left school with no GCSEs. His college had provided him with a dedicated assistance teacher to help him complete a course which would lead to work in social care. By the early Autumn of 2017 Imran, from Sparkbrook in Birmingham, had met another man, Naa'imur Rahman, online. Naa'imur Rahman: Convicted in August 2018 of plot to kill prime minister Rahman, 21, and originally from Walsall, had been radicalised by his uncle who was, by then, fighting with the Islamic State group in Syria. Prosecutors told the Old Bailey that Imran and his new friend Rahman began talking online to people whom they both thought were commanders from the Islamic State group. But the mysterious personas were in fact a series of undercover investigators, starting with one from the FBI and eventually officers from the UK's MI5. Both agencies have been increasingly deploying online ""role players"" to identify potentially violent suspects who are seeking to fight overseas or carry out acts of terrorism at home. Rahman told investigators he wanted to kill the prime minister - and he was convicted of that plot last August after an extraordinary undercover operation involving a fake bomb-maker. How a plan to attack Downing Street was foiled Aqib Imran was not part of Rahman's attack plan - but prosecutors say he wanted to travel to Libya to fight, or possibly Jordan with the aim of reaching Syria. They alleged he gathered cash for travel and discussed with one of the undercover officers how he would get hold of a fake passport. Prosecutors say Imran became involved in online extremism He also downloaded an infamous jihadi guidebook which gives tips to would-be fighters and travellers - and before his arrest Rahman had sent a video to his friend to act as an introduction to IS recruiters. But Imran's defence team told the Old Bailey that the student did nothing to further what amounted to a fantasy of a troubled young man. The jury heard Imran's interest in travelling had been sparked by an online crush on someone he only knew as ""Aisha"". This supposed woman - whom he never met - was purportedly in Denmark and they discussed travelling together to the Middle East. The trial heard no evidence about the real identity of Aisha - but she provided Imran with the initial contact who turned out to be an undercover investigator offering to help Imran get a fake passport. While he shared a picture of his current passport with an undercover investigator, Imran told his trial he never handed over any money for a forged document, despite having savings to do so, or sent pictures of himself required to create a fake. The jury heard that Imran then stopped communicating with the MI5 investigator - while his friend Rahman separately continued his own contact. Following Imran's first trial, a jury convicted him of possessing the jihadi manual - but were split on the more serious charge of preparing for an act of terrorism by intending to travel to overseas.

Man dies in 'devastating' explosion,"This video can not be played Police remain at the scene alongside workers from the gas board A man's body has been found in the wreckage of a house that was destroyed in an explosion. Neighbours said they were awoken by a ""loud bang"" when the blast occurred in Andover, Hampshire, at about 02:30 GMT. Photos from the scene of the collapse in Launcelot Close, off King Arthurs Way, appear to show the remains of a roof on top of a large pile of rubble. The body of a 48-year-old man was found at the scene. His next-of-kin have been informed. Following a search, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service (HFRS) said all other occupants had been accounted for. Residents in neighbouring properties were evacuated, the local council said. Local resident William Cooper said he was awoken by the explosion in the early hours. ""I looked out of the window and there was just loads of rubble,"" he added. He said only the ""skeleton of a house"" had been left following the explosion. A bathroom wall was blown away in the explosion The explosion happened in Launcelot Close, Andover, at about 02:30 GMT Gas firm SGN said its engineers joined the emergency services on site in the early hours of the morning. ""We understand an occupant in the property at the time of the explosion has died and our thoughts are with them and their family,"" it added in a statement. ""While it is too early to speculate as to what has happened, we're working closely with the emergency services to help identify the cause. ""In conjunction with the authorities, we're currently working to isolate gas supplies to property numbers one and two for safety."" Liam Robinson said he he was ""in shock"" Liam Robinson said he only avoided being at home overnight because he was in hospital with a broken hip. ""I'm still in shock. I came back from hospital and the next thing I knew my house was blown up,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be here right now if I hadn't broken my hip. I've got mixed emotions - I'm happy I wasn't in there."" Ch Insp Kory Thorne, of Hampshire Constabulary, said: ""This is a tragic incident in which a man has died, and we are working hard to find out what happened. ""This process will take some time and a cordon will remain in place in the coming days. He appealed for anyone who had witnessed to blast to come forward. An emergency cordon remains in place No-one else was inside the building at the time of the collapse Phil North, leader of Test Valley Borough Council, said: ""This is truly devastating and our thoughts are with all those affected."" He said the council had also been on the scene since the early hours and was helping to look after those residents who had been evacuated from their homes at a community facility. A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said fire crews had now left the scene. He said: ""We had the one fatality and other persons were soon accounted for.

Parking fees 'up at many hospitals',"Four in 10 NHS hospitals in England have increased car parking prices in the last year, new data suggests. A total of 124 of the 152 trusts running hospitals responded to Freedom of Information requests by the Press Association, with 53 saying prices had gone up for visitors or staff, or both. Some trusts had doubled the cost of certain stays for visitors in 2017-18. Several hospitals defended the charges, saying some or all of it goes back into patient care or maintaining car parks. But unions said some staff were having to pay ""through the nose"" to park at work. The PA analysis highlighted: A stay of four to 24 hours at Airedale NHS Foundation Trust in West Yorkshire now costing Â£8, up from Â£3.50, with a Â£5 fee for two to four hours, up from Â£3 An overhaul of charges at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital that has seen the cost of a five-hour stay more than double since October 2017 to Â£8 Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool's scrapping a Â£2 flat rate Lancashire Teaching Hospitals doubling the costs of a four-to-six hour stay to Â£6, while lowering the cost of a one-hour stay from Â£3 to Â£2.50 Frimley Health in Surrey being one of the highest earning trusts in England from parking, making Â£4.5m and raising costs in the last two financial years University Hospitals of Leicester making Â£4.4m from parking and increasing prices, with a two-hour stay for visitors up from Â£2.50 to Â£2.80 North Bristol Trust, which made Â£2.6m from visitor and staff and parking and hiked rates, with a stay of 20 minutes to two hours now costing Â£3.50, from Â£3 'Ridiculous' Paul Mulligan, from Horley, Surrey, says his son - then aged one - had an operation in July to remove his tonsils at Evelina London Children's Hospital. They were told not to travel by public transport in order to minimise the risk of infection and were instead directed to the hospital's car park. He said the car park had an uncapped hourly rate and that after staying two nights in hospital they had to pay Â£130 for parking. ""I understand the need to pay for parking but charging an uncapped hourly rate is ridiculous. ""In my opinion there should be a daily rate and an overnight rate for patients and family."" 'A rip-off' Frank Green, 75, from Aldershot, Hampshire, had 36 days of radiotherapy for prostate cancer at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, earlier this year. Parking charges at the hospital are capped for cancer patients but he says he still had to pay Â£144 during the course of his treatment. ""My attitude is there should be a fee but it shouldn't be a rip-off,"" he said. Parking tickets Helen Davies, from Hay-on-Wye, Powys, said she had to spend Â£275 on parking while visiting her mother at Hereford Hospital over a six-week period earlier this year. ""I had to drive. My mother was the absolute priority and I live 25 miles from the hospital,"" she said. She said her brother parked at a nearby supermarket as he refused to pay the parking fees. ""He got two parking tickets so he may as well have paid the fees,"" she added. Blood pressure A hospital registrar based in south-west England, who asked not to be named, said he paid between Â£300 and Â£400 a year to park at work. He has to rotate through hospitals as part of his contract, and says many are not served by public transport, ""especially when you work odd hours"". The charges also affected the health of his patients, he said: ""They often come in very stressed and the main reason they're stressed is because they're worried their time is going to run out in the car park if appointments are delayed."" ""Blood pressure results for my patients can often be unreliable because they're so stressed about parking,"" he added. Data published by NHS Digital in October shows NHS trusts made more than Â£226m from parking fees, including penalty fines, in the last financial year. Car park charges have been abolished in Wales and most of Scotland, and while they remain in England and Northern Ireland, there can be discounts for cancer and dialysis patients. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth described car parking charges in England as a tax on the sick, and reiterated Labour's pledge to abolish them in power. Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Judith Jolly said the charges were ""not the answer"" to financial pressures on hospitals. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said parking charges do generate revenue while hospital finances are ""under immense pressure"" but patients should not be ""effectively charged for being ill"". Unison's head of health Sara Gorton said many hospital employees - including shift workers - have little option but to ""pay through the nose simply to park at work"". ""If the government put more money into the health service, charges could be scrapped,"" she added. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We have made it very clear that patients, their families and our hardworking staff should not be subjected to unfair parking charges. ""NHS trusts are responsible for these charges and ensuring revenue goes back into frontline services, and we want to see trusts coming up with options that put staff, patients and their families first.""

Met Police chief warns over no-deal Brexit,"The UK will leave Europol after Brexit and will not be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme The public could be put at risk if the UK leaves the EU in March without an official agreement, the UK's most senior police officer has said. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said a no-deal exit would threaten access to EU-wide criminal databases and make it harder to extradite people from abroad. She told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed. Parliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it. EU reveals no-deal Brexit plans Brexit: A really simple guide UK 'can't keep European Arrest Warrant' UK 'ramps up' no-deal Brexit planning The prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc. After Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects. The agreement on future relations,externalcommits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation. Please upgrade your browser The priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome. Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of ""legal instruments"" which would have to be replaced after its exit. While she hoped the two sides would end up with ""something very similar"", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be ""very difficult to do short term"". ""We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can. ""That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit. She also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary. ""We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,"" she said. ""But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time."" Ms Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK ""crashing out"" of the EU. But campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be ""mutually beneficial"" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them. The organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was ""very confident"" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left. Knife crime in London 'levelled off' ""Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,"" its director Rebecca Ryan said. The Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities. ""The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this. In the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers. She said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a ""serious crime"" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would ""undoubtedly face a prison sentence"".

French firm to control Gatwick AirportFrance's Vinci is to buy 50.01% of the UK's second-busiest airport for ÃÂ£2.9bn.Business,"A majority stake in Gatwick Airport is to be sold to French operator Vinci Airports for Â£2.9bn. Vinci Airports, part of infrastructure group Vinci, will buy 50.01% of the UK's second-busiest airport. The other 49.99% will be managed by current owners Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). The airport was closed in the run-up to Christmas afterreports of drone sightings, in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind. Flights were grounded and about 140,000 passengers affected over three days during the incident. In 2016, Gatwick's expansion plans weredealt a blowwhen the government rejected its proposal for a new second runway while giving the go-ahead for Heathrow to build a third runway. Gatwick was acquired by a GIP-led consortium in 2009. More than 45 million passengers travel through Gatwick each year, flying to 230 destinations in 70 countries, according toits website,external. The deal would make Gatwick the largest airport in Vinci's network, which will grow to 46 airports in 12 countries - with a total traffic of about 228 million passengers a year, according to the company. It follows Vinci's takeover of Airports Worldwide's portfolio earlier this year, which included Belfast International and stakes in 12 airports across the US. Commenting on recent disruption at Gatwick, Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports, said he had ""every confidence"" in the teams currently in place. ""We will of course work with the airport operational team and the existing shareholders to make Gatwick as resilient as it can be in the face of these new risks,"" he added. Before Christmas, Gatwick was in the public eye for all the wrong reasons. It  was brought to a standstill and around 1,000 flights were cancelled due to apparent drone activity. But the fact remains, London's second airport is potentially a lucrative asset. It handles more than 45 million passengers every year and makes hundreds of millions of pounds in profit. Vinci says it also offers ""significant potential for growth"". The question is, where will that growth come from? Gatwick is already operating at a high level of efficiency, squeezing the maximum number of landings and takeoffs from its single runway. Its proposal to build a second runway was rejected by the government in 2016. But it has a back-up idea. Earlier this year,it set out a ""masterplan"" for the future- which suggested that an emergency standby runway could be expanded and brought into daily use, to increase capacity. That would certainly be a controversial move - but if it succeeded, there could be major benefits for Vinci. So perhaps the French firm thinks it's worth a gamble. US-based GIP said it expected the transaction to be completed ""by the middle of next year"". The executive team at Gatwick, including chief executive Stewart Wingate, is to be unchanged.

Flights rerouted as volcano alert raised,"There are still fears that another eruption could happen The alert level for Indonesia's Anak Krakatau volcano has been raised to the second-highest level possible, after a series of eruptions. All flights around the volcano have been rerouted and a 5km (three-mile) exclusion zone has also been imposed. Indonesia's disaster management agency (BNPB) said the alert level had been raised from level two to three because of the increased volcanic activity. Last Saturday, the volcano triggered a tsunami which killed hundreds. ""The volcanic activity of Anak Krakatau continues to increase,""said BNPB in a press statement, citing data from the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia.,external ""The danger zone [has been] extended from 2km to 5km... people and tourists are prohibited from carrying out activities within a 5km radius."" This video can not be played Yuni was forced to run from the water Air traffic control agency AirNav Indonesia said it was closing flight routes because the volcanic ash Krakatau was spewing meant the situation was on ""red alert"". An AirNav operations manager told the BBC that between 20 and 25 flights were affected, including some international flights to and from Australia, Singapore and the Middle East. He said that the disruption was likely to be minimal, although passengers may experience longer journeys and aircraft may need more fuel because of the diversions. Authorities say that Anak Krakatau has become increasingly active with what are known as Strombolian eruptions - short-lived, explosive blasts of lava - being emitted. 'I lost my five-year-old to the tsunami' BNPB has now imposed a 5km exclusion zone around the volcano, which rises from the sea in the Sunda Straits between Java and Sumatra. Nobody is believed to be inside that danger zone, but residents that live on both sides of the strait are being told to stay away from beaches due to fears of another tsunami. Strong winds are carrying thin volcanic ash spewed by the volcano to neighbouring areas, but authorities have stressed this is ""not dangerous"" and are advising residents to wear masks and goggles. The volcano has been rumbling on and off since July but has been particularly active since last week. The agency adds that there may be a new crater hole under the sea and that explosions are ongoing, with eruption sounds heard several times a minute. On Saturday, vast waves engulfed coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java leaving at least 430 dead and more than 150 missing. It destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations. At least 16,000 people still remain displaced and rescue workers are struggling to reach remote areas of the country that have been hit by the tsunami. Thousands of people are living in temporary shelters like mosques of schools, with dozens sleeping on the floor. A state of emergency will stay in place until 4 January. Thousands have been displaced and are living at makeshift shelters According to some evacuees, clean water, fresh clothes and blankets are in short supply. Aid is only starting to just reach the town of Sumur that was cut off by the tsunami, with volunteers having to piece together makeshift bridges out of concrete blocks to reach the area, reports say. A volcanologist explains Indonesia eruption images How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis It is believed that volcanic activity from Anak Krakatau set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves. Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim. In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.

Musk tries to dismiss Thai libel claim,"Vern Unsworth (R) helped bring top international cave rescuers to the mission, including Rob Harper (L) Elon Musk is seeking to dismiss a defamation claim by saying that ""over-the-top"" paedophilia claims he tweeted should not be taken seriously. He is being sued by Vern Unsworth, who aided the rescue of 12 boys from Thailand's Tham Luang caves. The two clashed over how to free the boys in an exchange that led to Tesla's chief calling Mr Unsworth ""pedo guy"". Mr Musk's lawyers said the ""insult"" had been made in response to Mr Unsworth's own disparaging remarks. Mr Unsworth is from St Albans, Hertfordshire, but now lives near Chiang Rai in Thailand. The ""vituperative"" exchange between Mr Musk and Mr Unsworth took place during frantic attempts to rescue the 12 boys and their coach from deep within the partially flooded caves in July 2018. Mr Unsworth helped recruit experienced UK cave divers, who were instrumental in freeing the boys. Mr Musk mobilised a group of Tesla engineers to help with the rescue effort and left behind a specially designed mini-submarine that he claimed could help transport the children out of the caves. The submarine was never used to free the boys. In an interview on CNN, Mr Unsworth ridiculed the submarine calling it a ""PR stunt"". Responding in a series of tweets, Mr Musk gave more details about how the submarine might work and posted the ""pedo"" comment. When quizzed for his response, Mr Unsworth said he was considering legal action. Mr Musk (R) alleged that British diver Mr Unsworth (L) had a ""child bride"" Soon after, Mr Musk apologised and deleted the offending tweets saying he had acted ""in anger"". He added: ""His actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologise."" But the row escalated after Mr Musk referenced his initial insult in a separate Twitter exchange. In this, he said it was ""strange"" that Mr Unsworth had not sued him over the allegation despite being offered free legal advice. Soon after, Mr Unsworth's lawyers posted a series of tweets criticising Mr Musk and his characterisation of their client. Documents prepared by Mr Musk's attorney said he responded to this via ""off the record"" emails to Buzzfeed journalists seeking comment in which he issued further ""insults"", some of which alleged Mr Unsworth had a ""child bride"". Despite being labelled as ""off the record"", the emails were published and led to the lodging of the defamation claim in a California court. Mr Musk wants the court to throw out the defamation claim because, his lawyers say, his comments were ""non-actionable opinion"". The legal team said the Tesla chief had never met Mr Unsworth so his comments had no ""factual basis"". Instead, the words were ""over-top-insults not driven by first-hand knowledge"". Mr Musk's lawyers argue at length that because the ""schoolyard spat"" blew up on Twitter, which they say is ""infamous for invective and hyperbole"", no-one could reasonably believe the comments were truthful. The fact that they were on social media served to underline how different they were from a proper press expose or criminal complaint, the lawyers add. Neither Mr Unsworth nor his own legal team have responded to requests for comment by the BBC. The first amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects free speech, makes defamation a challenging legal action to bring. A plaintiff - the person bringing the case - has to prove the statement made about them is false and that it has caused them material harm. However, the toughest hurdle is that if the person bringing the case is regarded as a public figure - and ""public figure"" is given a pretty wide interpretation - it has to be proved that the defendant acted maliciously. In other words, that the person making the statement knew it to be false and went on to make it. Another way of putting it would be that it must be proved that the defendant knowingly lied with the intention of harming the plaintiff. Is this super-fast tunnel the future of travel?

Backpacker who broke neck arrives in UK,"Sophie Wilson was in hospital in Thailand for almost a month A backpacker who broke her neck diving into a swimming pool in Thailand is back in the UK, thanks to people donating more than Â£67,000. The money has gone towards Sophie Wilson's hospital bills and a medical flight from Thailand. Insurance company Insure and Go refused to pay out as they said she had acted in a way which put herself at risk. Medics do not know whether the 24-year-old, from Shepshed, Leicestershire, will be able to walk again. Miss Wilson landed at Heathrow on Wednesday and was then taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Her sister Georgina Wilson said: ""She's feeling so much more positive and happy about being back in the UK and there are no issues with the language barrier. ""She's still making good progress every day, so she's getting more and more strength in her arms and hands but there's still no movement from the chest down at the moment."" Sophie Wilson was only a week into her solo trip around the world Sophie Wilson is expected to be in Nottingham for four or five weeks before being moved to a hospital in Sheffield, where she will spend at least six months. ""They've said there's a chance she may not walk,"" said her sister. ""We've got to play it by ear and take every day as it comes."" The former coffee shop worker had set off on a six-month trip as part of her lifelong dream to travel the world, and had been in Thailand for only a week when she had the accident on 1 December. She thought the pool was deeper than it was and did not see a sign warning that diving was not allowed. Miss Wilson received treatment at a hospital in Chiang Mai and had about 10 hours of surgery. Before leaving Thailand she wrote on Facebook: ""I really am truly amazed by everything that everyone has done for me."" Miss Wilson's spinal cord became compressed when she dived into the pool Insure and Go said in a statement: ""We do understand that people go on holiday to have fun and enjoy themselves, but we are not able to cover circumstances where the customer has acted in a way that puts themselves at risk. ""This is clearly stated in the policy terms and conditions."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

The change is contained in a government consultation aimed at further reducing the plastic used by consumers and could come into effect in January 2020. Smaller retailers, who are exempt from the current levy, supply an estimated 3.6 billion single-use bags annually. Schools in England are also being told to eliminate unnecessary plastic. Education Secretary Damian Hinds is urging school leaders to replace items such as plastic straws, bottles and food packaging with sustainable alternatives by 2022. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic In August,Theresa May promised there would be a consultationon changes to the plastic bag levy. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""We want to do even more to protect our precious planet and today's announcement will accelerate further behaviour change and build on the success of the existing charge."" Since the 5p fee was introduced in 2015 for retailers with at least 250 employees, an estimated 15 billion bags have been taken out of circulation. Trade bodies representing about 40,000 small retailers have launched a voluntary approach to a 5p charge, but this accounts for less than one-fifth of companies likely to be affected by the proposed changes. by Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst The government wavered for years before imposing a plastic bag tax for England - but the result of the policy eventually introduced is crystal clear: taxes change behaviour. People who previously thought nothing of carting home their supermarket shopping in half a dozen flimsy plastic bags seem appalled by the prospect of a 30p charge, and dig into their handbags for nylon bags instead. A similar shift in behaviour will surely be seen now in local stores, although the change may be less marked because people tend to buy smaller quantities from corner shops, so may be willing to pay an extra 10p for convenience. It's also possible that these convenience store bags disproportionately harm the environment because they're used by people picking up snacks while visiting beauty spots or beaches. The announcement of a consultation on an increased charge is part of a broader move towards environmental taxation - an issue which can easily cause governments trouble if they don't protect the poorestfrom the impact of the taxes. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all retailers - including smaller shops - already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags. The Marine Conservation Society says the levies have had an impact on reducing plastic waste on beaches and in the sea. Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go?

While retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money consumers pay for plastic bags, they are expected to give it to good causes.

French firm to control Gatwick Airport,"A majority stake in Gatwick Airport is to be sold to French operator Vinci Airports for Â£2.9bn. Vinci Airports, part of infrastructure group Vinci, will buy 50.01% of the UK's second-busiest airport. The other 49.99% will be managed by current owners Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). The airport was closed in the run-up to Christmas afterreports of drone sightings, in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind. Flights were grounded and about 140,000 passengers affected over three days during the incident. In 2016, Gatwick's expansion plans weredealt a blowwhen the government rejected its proposal for a new second runway while giving the go-ahead for Heathrow to build a third runway. Gatwick was acquired by a GIP-led consortium in 2009. More than 45 million passengers travel through Gatwick each year, flying to 230 destinations in 70 countries, according toits website,external. The deal would make Gatwick the largest airport in Vinci's network, which will grow to 46 airports in 12 countries - with a total traffic of about 228 million passengers a year, according to the company. It follows Vinci's takeover of Airports Worldwide's portfolio earlier this year, which included Belfast International and stakes in 12 airports across the US. Commenting on recent disruption at Gatwick, Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports, said he had ""every confidence"" in the teams currently in place. ""We will of course work with the airport operational team and the existing shareholders to make Gatwick as resilient as it can be in the face of these new risks,"" he added. Before Christmas, Gatwick was in the public eye for all the wrong reasons. It  was brought to a standstill and around 1,000 flights were cancelled due to apparent drone activity. But the fact remains, London's second airport is potentially a lucrative asset. It handles more than 45 million passengers every year and makes hundreds of millions of pounds in profit. Vinci says it also offers ""significant potential for growth"". The question is, where will that growth come from? Gatwick is already operating at a high level of efficiency, squeezing the maximum number of landings and takeoffs from its single runway. Its proposal to build a second runway was rejected by the government in 2016. But it has a back-up idea. Earlier this year,it set out a ""masterplan"" for the future- which suggested that an emergency standby runway could be expanded and brought into daily use, to increase capacity. That would certainly be a controversial move - but if it succeeded, there could be major benefits for Vinci. So perhaps the French firm thinks it's worth a gamble. US-based GIP said it expected the transaction to be completed ""by the middle of next year"". The executive team at Gatwick, including chief executive Stewart Wingate, is to be unchanged.

Tech got 'darker and more muddy' in 2018,"Margrethe Vestager ordered Google to pay a record-sized fine this year Data abuse has ""darkened"" technology's potential, the EU's Competition Commissioner has warned. In an interview for the BBC's Today programme, Margrethe Vestager criticised the tech giants for misusing data and failing to respect citizens' rights. New EU rules governing what could be done with data provided some protection, she said. But she added that the need for more concerted action was becoming pressing. ""Over these 12 months our relationship with tech has both been darker and more muddy because it becomes increasingly clear that all the bright and shiny positive potentials of tech are at the risk of being darkened by forced misuse of data, manipulation, supervision, no respect of the citizen, no respect of individual rights,"" she told Martha Lane Fox who carried out the interview. ""There is an increasing awareness of the fact that we really need to do something and to do that together."" Baroness Lane-Fox, who is a board member of Twitter, is guest editor of this morning's Today radio programme on BBC Radio 4. Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho co-founded Lastminute.com before becoming a crossbench peer The past year's scandals have included: Facebook having to apologise for letting 87 million users' details be harvested, many of which were obtained by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Twitter, Facebook and YouTube facing up to evidence that their platforms had been used by Russia and others to manipulate voters in the West the EU fining Google a record â¬4.3bn ($5bn; Â£3.9bn) for using Android to illegally defend its dominance in search The tech firms' actions had changed views about how the industry could influence people and society, said Ms Vestager. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation,which came into force in May 2018, gave people new privacy rights and more control over their data, but more work was needed, said Ms Vestager. The European Commission is also looking into Amazon's business practices The civil service was now talking about ways to force tech firms to be more ""transparent"" about what they did with data gleaned from people's uploads, shares and views, she added. But Ms Vestager described herself as being positive about the future. ""One thing I do hope over the next 10 years is that we get a much more... transparent way of dealing with data and giving access to data,"" she said. ""I tend to be an optimist by choice. I think it's a moral obligation because pessimists don't seem to get anything done."" Google hit with record â¬4.3bn Android fine Google appeals against â¬4.3bn Android fine EU 'looking into' Amazon's use of data Facebook's data-sharing deals exposed But failure to act, Ms Vestager cautioned, could lead to situation in which one or two massive firms dominated use of our personal data. Baroness Lane-Fox asked if this meant that the commission would take concrete steps to break up monopolies or tackle markets where dominance stifled competition. Commissioner Vestager responded that while dismantling companies had served Brussels well in the past, the speed at which changes occurred in the tech sector made it a less appropriate response. Instead, she said, the commission might look at how larger firms got access to data and resources in a bid to limit their power. Regarding Brexit, Ms Vestager noted that European competition authorities had become stronger by working together. But she added that the UK had ""clever skilled people with a very strong dedication"" to making sure the market served consumers.

Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem,"Marine life is facing ""irreparable damage"" from the millions of tonnes of plastic waste which ends up in the oceans each year, the United Nations has warned. ""This is a planetary crisis... we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean,"" UN oceans chief Lisa Svenssontold the BBC. But how does this happen, where is most at risk and what damage does this plastic actually do? Plastic as we know it has only really existed for the last 60-70 years, but in that time it has transformed everything from clothing, cooking and catering, to product design, engineering and retailing. One of the great advantages of many types of plastic is that they're designed to last - for a very long time. And nearly all the plastic ever created still exists in some form today. In July a paper published in the journal Science Advances by industrial ecologist Dr Roland Geyer, from the University of California in Santa Barbara, and colleagues,calculated the total volume of all plastic ever produced at 8.3bn tonnes. Of this, some 6.3bn tonnes is now waste - and 79% of that is in landfill or the natural environment. This vast amount of waste has been driven by modern life, where plastic is used for many throwaway or ""single use"" items, from drinks bottles and nappies to cutlery and cotton buds. Drinks bottles are one the most common types of plastic waste. Some 480bn plastic bottles were sold globally in 2016 - that's a million bottles per minute. Of these, 110bn were made by drinks giant Coca Cola. Some countries are considering moves to reduce consumption. Proposals in the UK includedeposit-return schemes, and the improvement offree-drinking water supplies in major cities, including London. It's likely that about 10m tonnes of plastic currently ends up in the oceans each year. In 2010 scientists from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the University of Georgia in Athens estimated the figure as 8m tonnes, and forecast that to rise to 9.1m tonnes by 2015. The same study,published in the journal Science in 2015,external, surveyed 192 coastal countries contributing to ocean plastic waste, and found that Asian nations were 13 of the 20 biggest contributors. China was top of the list of countries mismanaging plastic waste, but the US also featured in the top 20 and contributed a higher rate of waste per person. Plastic waste accumulates in areas of the ocean where winds create swirling circular currents, known as gyres, which suck in any floating debris. There are five gyres around the globe, but the best known is probably the North Pacific gyre. More on this topic: Blue Planet II advisers feel 'shame and anger' at extent of plastic Images of a global problem All the BBC's news on plastic pollution It is estimated debris takes about six years to reach the centre of the North Pacific gyre from the coast of the US, and about a year from Japan. All five gyres have higher concentrations of plastic rubbish than other parts of the oceans. They are made up of tiny fragments of plastic, which appear to hang suspended below the surface - a phenomenon that has led it to being described as plastic soup. And the hard-wearing qualities of most plastics means that some items can take hundreds of years to biodegrade. However, there are moves to clean up the North Pacific gyre. An operation led by a non-profit organisationOcean Cleanup,externalis due to begin in 2018. The Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100m stretch of beach surveyed during their recent Great British Beach Clean Up. That was a 10% increase on last year. Rubbish from food and drink constituted at least 20% of all litter collected,the MCS reported.,external The origin of a lot of the litter is difficult to trace, but the public contributes about 30%. ""Sewage-related debris"", or items flushed down toilets that should have been put in the bin, amounted to some 8.5%. For sea birds and larger marine creatures like turtles, dolphins and seals, the danger comes from being entangled in plastic bags and other debris, or mistaking plastic for food. Turtles cannot distinguish between plastic bags and jellyfish, which can be part of their diet. Plastic bags, once consumed, cause internal blockages and usually result in death. Larger pieces of plastic can also damage the digestive systems of sea birds and whales, and can be potentially fatal. Over time, plastic waste slowly degrades and breaks down into tiny micro-fragments which are also causing scientists concern. A recent survey by Plymouth University found that plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish. This can result in malnutrition or starvation for the fish, and lead to plastic ingestion in humans too. The effect on humans of eating fish containing plastic is still largely unknown. But in 2016 the European Food Safety Authority warned of an increased risk to human health and food safety ""given the potential for micro-plastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish"".

Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go?,"Prime Minister Theresa May has raised the possibility of increasing the plastic bag charge in Englandfrom 5p to 10p. Large retailers in England have been legally required to charge 5p for all single-use plastic carrier bags since October 2015. Smaller businesses can also choose to apply the charge. Similar 5p schemes operate in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Since the charge was brought in, plastic bag usage has plummeted. In 2014, more than 7.6 billion plastic bags were given to customers by major supermarkets in England. That has since fallen by more than 80%. According to the government, it ""expects"" retailers to donate proceeds from plastic bag sales to good causes - but it's not compulsory. Before donating, retailers are allowed to deduct ""reasonable costs"" to accommodate the plastic bag charge - such as introducing a new till system or retraining staff. It's then up to the individual retailer to decide which causes to support. In the past financial year, over Â£51m was donated - that's based on agovernment survey of 249 retailers,external. That's lower than the previous year - when Â£66.5m was donated. The drop is is not surprising given that fewer plastic bags were sold. In fact, some retailers didn't respond to the survey because they had stopped selling plastic bags altogether. Seven charts that sum up the plastic pollution problem Plastic bag charge: 5p levy could be extended in England All you need to know about the 5p charge While the vast majority of retailers chose to donate their plastic bag revenue - in line with government expectations - some chose to keep the money instead. Fourteen of the 249 retailers held on to Â£1,000 or more of their plastic bag sales. That'saccording to a spreadsheet,externalpublished by the Department for Environment for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Poundworld - which has sincegone into administration- retained the most plastic bag revenue, at just over Â£454,000. A note in the spreadsheet says it was still ""finalising its charity strategy"". Some retailers gave specific reasons for not donating. For example, one organisation pointed out it was a charity - and so it felt it was appropriate to keep the money. Another said it would make its donation in the ""near future"". Update: This piece has been amended to reflect Defra's revision of their figures. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Ethnic minorities face ÃÂ£3.2bn 'pay penalty',"Britain's black and ethnic minority workers face a ""pay penalty"" and earn less than white colleagues in the same jobs, according to a research group. A report from the Resolution Foundation says overall the 1.9m BAME workers are paid about Â£3.2bn less than their white counterparts every year. It used data from a survey of 100,000 people over 10 years. The government says it is planning measures to help employers tackle ethnic disparities in the workplace. The Resolution Foundation report calls on the government to follow itsinitiative requiring companies with more than 250 employees to publish gender pay gaps,externalhighlighting the different treatment of male and female employees by doing the same according to ethnic background. It noted that BAME workers have long earned less, on average, than white male workers, due in part due to differences in qualification levels and the types of jobs they do. But the foundation said its ""pay penalty"" calculation took into account factors including industry sector, occupations, contract types, education level and degree attainment of individual workers. The foundation's research says the biggest impact was on black male graduates, who were paid 17%, or Â£3.90 an hour, less compared to their white peers. Pakistani and Bangladeshi male graduates earned an average of 12% less an hour, while among female graduates, black women were said to face a pay penalty of Â£1.62 an hour, or 9%. Among non-graduates, Pakistani and Bangladeshi men were reported to be the worst affected. The research said they earned Â£1.91 an hour, or 14%, less than white colleagues, with black male non-graduates Â£1.31 an hour, or 9%, worse off. Kathleen Henehan, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""A record number of young BAME workers have degrees, and a record number are in work. ""However, despite this welcome progress, many... face significant disadvantages in the workplace."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it supported the mandatory reporting of staff recruitment, retention and promotion by ethnicity. A government spokesperson said ""diversity is good for businesses"" and it is committed to ensuring the workplace ""works for everyone"". They added: ""We've introduced new laws to help companies ensure the make-up of their boards and senior management is representative of their workforces and we're currently consulting on proposals for mandatory ethnicity pay reporting as part of a series of measures to help employers tackle ethnic disparities in the workplace.""

Cracked Sydney tower in second evacuation,"A crack in the building's wall caused residents to evacuate on Monday. Hundreds of people have been told to leave a Sydney tower block for a second time, after a crack appeared in its walls on Monday. Many residents of the 38-storey Opal Tower had moved back in, after the alarm was first raised when loud noises were heard and a crack was discovered. The company that built the tower said it remained ""structurally sound"" and the relocation was just a precaution. It says this will allow engineers and investigators to work around the clock. The builder, Icon, said that no residents were in danger, but this would help them repair the site in the quickest time possible without further disruption to residents. The investigation was expected to take up to 10 days and Icon said it would provide all accommodation. Some residents complained about having to leave their apartments for a second time Angry residents complained about being forced to leave their apartments. ""I think no one can trust [them] because they forced people to go back to their property and today they're standing in front of us [to] say everyone has to leave the building,"" said one. Another said: ""We're a bit frustrated. We were planning on spending the New Year here with family and friends. That's actually one of the reasons why we moved into this building three months ago."" All tower inhabitants have been told to leave Authorities had previously said 51 of the tower's 392 units were affected and the newly completed building in Sydney Olympic Park was declared safe for a majority of residents to return. As many as 3,000 people were evacuated on Monday, after an internal support wall failed on the 10th floor of the building, according to police. Icon confirmed that a pre-cast concrete panel had cracked in the building. A team of engineers from Icon and the building's developer Ecove have been assessing the building, which was only completed earlier this year. On Wednesday, the New South Wales government said it was also investigating the building's structural integrity and that of neighbouring residential towers. Local news outlets have published pictures of the building damage, showing loose plaster and crumbling walls. Engineers earlier said the high-rise tower had moved up to 2mm. However, Ecove has defended the building's ""high quality"", which it said was above the industry standard.

Frenchman aims to cross Atlantic in a barrelJean Jacques Savin hopes ocean currents alone will propel him from the Canaries to the Caribbean.Europe,"Jean-Jacques Savin spent months constructing the barrel in a shipyard in south-west France A Frenchman has set off to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a barrel-shaped orange capsule, using ocean currents alone to propel him. Jean-Jacques Savin, 71, left El Hierro in Spain's Canary Islands and hopes to reach the Caribbean in as little as three months. His reinforced capsule contains a sleeping bunk, kitchen and storage. He will drop markers along the way to help oceanographers study Atlantic currents. Updates on the journey are being posted on a Facebook page,externaland the latest message said the barrel was ""behaving well"". In a telephone interview with AFP news agency, he said: ""The weather is great. I've got a swell of one metre (3ft) and I'm moving at 2-3km/h... I've got favourable winds forecast until Sunday."" The barrel is designed to withstand the constant battering of the waves Mr Savin is a former military paratrooper and has also worked as a park ranger and a pilot. He believes ocean currents alone will carry his resin-coated plywood vessel about 4,500km (2,800 miles) to the Caribbean. The barrel is 3m long and 2.10m wide with six square metres of living space. There is a porthole in the floor through which Mr Savin can watch passing fish. The capsule has been built to resist waves and potential attacks by orca whales. A solar panel generates power for communications and GPS positioning. His budget of â¬60,000 (Â£54,000; $68,000) was largely raised through crowdfunding.

Trump makes surprise visit to forces in Iraq,"This video can not be played US President Donald Trump: 'We're no longer the suckers, folks' US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have made an unannounced Christmas visit to US troops in Iraq. They travelled there ""late on Christmas night"" to thank troops for ""their service, their success and their sacrifice"", the White House said. Mr Trump said the US had no plans to pull out of Iraq. The trip came days after Defence Secretary Jim Mattis quit over divisions about strategy in the region. The US still has some 5,000 troops in Iraq to support the government in its fight against what remains of the Islamic State (IS) group. Trump brings forward Mattis departure US envoy quits over Trump Syria pullout Trump's foreign policy worries allies However, a planned meeting between Mr Trump and Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi was cancelled. Mr Mahdi's office said it was because of disagreements on how to conduct the meeting. A phone call between the two leaders was held instead and the White House said Mr Mahdi had accepted an invitation to visit Washington. Mr Trump, his wife and National Security Adviser John Bolton travelled on Air Force One to al-Asad airbase, west of the capital Baghdad, to meet military personnel in the base's canteen. It was his first visit to the region. During the visit he got a standing ovation from troops as he entered a dining hall and walked around greeting them, posing for selfies and signing autographs. He said the reason for the visit was to personally thank them for helping to defeat IS, adding: ""Two years ago when I became president they were a very dominant group, today they're not so dominant any more.

The president told the soldiers he had secured a 10% wage increase for them, after learning their pay had been stagnant for ""more than 10 years"". In fact armed forces personnel have received a pay rise in each of the past 10 years. The increase for 2019, approved by the president in August, will be 2.6%. Mr Trump had planned to spend Christmas at his private golf club in Florida, but stayed behind in Washington because of the current partial government shutdown. Mr Trump stopped at a base in Germany where he posed for pictures with soldiers The visit to Iraq lasted about three hours. On the flight back, the president's plane refuelled at Ramstein Air Base in Germany and Mr Trump used the brief stopover to meet troops stationed there. ""We're no longer the suckers, folks,"" he told American service personnel. ""We're respected again as a nation."" This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? Mr Trump said the US could use Iraq as a forward base if it ""wanted to do something in Syria"", Reuters news agency reports. He defended his decision to withdraw US troops from Syria during the visit, saying: ""A lot of people are going to come around to my way of thinking. ""I made it clear from the beginning that our mission in Syria was to strip Isis [another name for IS] of its military strongholds. ""Eight years ago, we went there for three months and we never left. Now, we're doing it right and we're going to finish it off."" President Trump and his wife met military personnel at the al-Asad airbase, west of Baghdad Mr Trump also spoke of his conversations with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan which are believed to have influenced his decision to pull US forces out of Syria. ""I will tell you that I've had some very good talks with President Erdogan who wants to knock them [IS] out also and he'll do it. And others will do it too,"" Mr Trump said. ""We are in their region. They should be sharing the burden of costs and they're not."" He said there would be no delays in the withdrawal and added that the US could not ""continue to be the policeman of the world"". President Trump told service personnel in Iraq he wanted thank them for their work ""It's not fair when the burden is all on us, the United States,"" he said. ""We don't want to be taken advantage of any more by countries that use us and use our incredible military to protect them. They don't pay for it, and they're going to have to."" The president also said that security considerations had prevented him from visiting US troops in the region several weeks ago. Mr Trump announced the decision to pull US troops out of Syria last week. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week However, important allies including senior Republicans and foreign powers have disputed the claim that IS is defeated in Syria and say the US withdrawal could lead to a resurgence. In his resignation letter, Gen Mattis said he did not share Mr Trump's views. One of the top US diplomats in the fight against IS, Brett McGurk, also resigned early. He reportedly described Mr Trump's decision as a ""reversal of policy"" that ""left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered"". A Kurdish-led alliance, the Syria Democratic Forces, has also warned that IS could recover. US troops have helped rid much of Syria's north-east of the jihadist group, but pockets of fighters remain.

France drops probe into 1994 Rwanda attack,"The plane carrying Mr Habyarimana was shot down by a missile in April 1994, triggering the Rwandan genocide French judges have dropped a long-running investigation into the shooting down of a plane carrying the former Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana. His death in 1994 was a trigger of the genocide. A French inquiry began four years later at the request of relatives of the French crew members who died. A judge accused Tutsi rebels, led by the current president, Paul Kagame, of the attack; arrest warrants were issued for a number of people close to him. The charges were dropped on 21 December, a judicial source said on Wednesday. French prosecutors had recommended in October the charges be dismissed because of insufficient evidence against the suspects. Rwanda: How the genocide happened Rwanda: 100 days of slaughter Lawyers for Habyarimana's widow, Agathe, have told the AFP news agency the plaintiffs in the case would appeal against the decision. ""We have to interpret this decision by French judges as a form of resignation faced with a political context which prosecutors did not know how to fight,"" lawyer Philippe Meilhac said. ""Rwandan authorities have never sought to help bring the truth to light."" Mr Habyarimana - a Hutu backed by France - was on his way back to Rwanda when his plane was shot down The plane carrying Habyarimana was shot down by a missile in April 1994, triggering the Rwandan genocide in which more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died. Habyarimana - a Hutu who had signed a peace deal with Tutsi rebels - was flying into the capital, Kigali, with his Burundian counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira when a missile brought the plane down, killing all on board. The enquiry was launched in 1998, at the request of relatives of the pilot, who was French. The probe was a major source of tension between France and Rwanda. It was initially conducted by a prominent judge, Jean-Louis BruguiÃ¨re, who concluded that Mr Kagame - who led the RPF rebels in 1994 - had ordered the attack. In 2006, Mr BruguiÃ¨re issued arrest warrants against several aides of President Kagame. The Rwandan government described the enquiry as a politically motivated and accused France - which had supported the previous Hutu regime - of continuing to support those who had carried out the genocide. Relations between the two countries later improved. In 2012, a report by the French judge who succeeded Mr BruguiÃ¨re cast doubt on the idea that the rebels had shot down the plane, and suggested that Hutu extremists were likely to have been responsible. An inquiry by Mr Kagame's government said the missile that brought down the jet had been fired from an army camp controlled by Hutus. â¢1994:France sends troops to Rwanda; Rwanda later accuses France of protecting genocide suspects â¢2006:French judge accuses Tutsis including President Paul Kagame of the 1994 Habyarimana killing; Rwanda breaks diplomatic ties â¢2009:Rwanda joins Commonwealth; restores diplomatic ties with France â¢2010:French President Nicolas Sarkozy visits Rwanda, admits France made mistakes in 1994 â¢2011:Mr Kagame visits Paris, says it is time to leave history behind France keeps Rwanda archives secret Rwanda warns of 'showdown' with France France opens Rwanda genocide archive Rwanda's 100 days of slaughter France pulls out of Rwanda memorial France to release genocide suspect New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E 'Where do I go?'

Ethnic workers face Â£3.2bn 'pay penalty',"Britain's black and ethnic minority workers face a ""pay penalty"" and earn less than white colleagues in the same jobs, according to a research group. A report from the Resolution Foundation says overall the 1.9m BAME workers are paid about Â£3.2bn less than their white counterparts every year. It used data from a survey of 100,000 people over 10 years. The government says it is planning measures to help employers tackle ethnic disparities in the workplace. The Resolution Foundation report calls on the government to follow itsinitiative requiring companies with more than 250 employees to publish gender pay gaps,externalhighlighting the different treatment of male and female employees by doing the same according to ethnic background. It noted that BAME workers have long earned less, on average, than white male workers, due in part due to differences in qualification levels and the types of jobs they do. But the foundation said its ""pay penalty"" calculation took into account factors including industry sector, occupations, contract types, education level and degree attainment of individual workers. The foundation's research says the biggest impact was on black male graduates, who were paid 17%, or Â£3.90 an hour, less compared to their white peers. Pakistani and Bangladeshi male graduates earned an average of 12% less an hour, while among female graduates, black women were said to face a pay penalty of Â£1.62 an hour, or 9%. Among non-graduates, Pakistani and Bangladeshi men were reported to be the worst affected. The research said they earned Â£1.91 an hour, or 14%, less than white colleagues, with black male non-graduates Â£1.31 an hour, or 9%, worse off. Kathleen Henehan, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""A record number of young BAME workers have degrees, and a record number are in work. ""However, despite this welcome progress, many... face significant disadvantages in the workplace."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it supported the mandatory reporting of staff recruitment, retention and promotion by ethnicity. A government spokesperson said ""diversity is good for businesses"" and it is committed to ensuring the workplace ""works for everyone"". They added: ""We've introduced new laws to help companies ensure the make-up of their boards and senior management is representative of their workforces and we're currently consulting on proposals for mandatory ethnicity pay reporting as part of a series of measures to help employers tackle ethnic disparities in the workplace.""

"Worker broke back in Tesco 'hit and run'Police are investigating after a car drove into ""several people"" following a suspected theft.","This video can not be played Two people were injured outside the Tesco store A supermarket worker broke her back when a car drove into her and others outside the store, her colleague said. A blue Citroen C3 hit pedestrians before driving away from the Tesco car park in Rickmansworth on Sunday. Police said a woman was taken to Watford General Hospital with serious injuries while a man was treated for slight injuries. A fundraising page set up to support the victim has already raised nearly four times its target.

Police are still trying to find the vehicle and its occupants and confirmed no-one had been arrested. Julia Matthews, a colleague and friend of the injured woman, set up the fundraising page. She said: ""She shouldn't have had this happen to her ever, but especially not just before Christmas. ""She should be at home with her family, with her partner and her child enjoying the holiday."" The car had its rear windscreen smashed as it tried to leave a Tesco car park Ms Matthews added she hoped the money would help her colleague to enjoy Christmas when she was allowed to go back home. ""I've created this for all those who have asked for a way to help, to help bring some positivity and love into her life when it has been shattered by selfish criminals,"" she added. More than Â£800 had been pledged by 14:00 on Boxing Day. Officers said the driver and a passenger had been involved in an ""incident"" inside the store in Harefield Road moments before.

Why was I left on a hillside to die?,"In the summer of 1937 a nine-month-old girl was hidden, with her hands tied, in a blackberry bush in southern England. She was found by sheer chance by a family of holidaymakers. Now 80, Anthea Ring has spent most of her life wondering why she was left to die and who her parents were. Thanks to a leap forward in genetic genealogy she finally has some answers. Jane Dodd was tired. The 11-year-old was walking over the South Downs with her family on a bright August day. Ahead were her parents Arthur and Margaret and her older sister Elizabeth. Every year they travelled from south London for a fortnight's holiday in Worthing. Her father would insist on an invigorating walk in the afternoons. It was still hot, even at 6pm. There was no shade up here, just grassland, gorse and blackberry bushes. Suddenly her mother stopped. ""There's a baby up here,"" she said. Her father turned around. ""Of course there isn't, there's no-one up here,"" he said. ""I haven't had five children and not know what a baby sounds like,"" her mother replied. The family started searching through the scrubland. Minutes later they found a blonde child hidden deep in a blackberry bush. She was wearing a pink dress and looked about one year old. She had scratches and insect bites. Her hands were tied tightly in front of her. The Dodd family on a trip to Worthing, around the time they found the baby girl Nine years later, Anthea Ring was playing with her friend, Peter, on the road outside her Surrey home.  But an argument began and she threatened to go and complain to her mother. ""She's not your mother, you're adopted,"" he replied. Shocked, Anthea ran home and that evening her parents sat her down for a talk. ""They told me I was left on the doorstep of Worthing Hospital when I was a newborn baby,"" Anthea says. ""They had lost a daughter, Veronica, three years before, and decided to adopt me."" Anthea was very excited by the news. Adopted children were usually the heroines in books she devoured about Swiss chalet schools. ""I remember thinking I could tell my friends at school the next day,"" she says. ""It didn't cross my mind to think about who my birth parents were. I was obviously so secure."" She was doted on by her parents, sleeping in a warm back bedroom in winter and a cool front bedroom in summer. Her adoptive father, Douglas Shannan, worked for the Ministry of Food and Anthea remembers going on trips with him to inspect egg-grading stations. ""He was a very kind man, I loved going out with him,"" she says. Anthea found out she was adopted from a friend on her street She describes her mother Margaret as warm and friendly but quite nervous due to the loss of her first daughter. Margaret was intelligent but hadn't been able to follow her sister to Girton College, Cambridge, as the family couldn't afford it. Margaret wanted Anthea to train as a teacher but she wanted to get a job at the first opportunity. At 15 she went to work for the Bourne and Hollingsworth department store in Oxford Street. A few years later she trained to be a nurse in Bath, where she met her future husband Francis. Two children, Jonathan and Christine, followed. One day in 1961, Anthea took baby pictures of Christine over to her parents' house. They said she was the spitting image of Anthea as a baby. ""Then my father said to my mother, 'You'll have to show her now Peggy,' and she went upstairs,"" Anthea recalls. Margaret returned with a newspaper clipping, with a picture of a baby. Anthea asked who it was. ""It's you,"" her mother replied. The police logbook shows Mac (Adamson) assigned to Anthea's case Anthea learned she had been discovered by Arthur Dodd on a hillside near Worthing on 26 August 1937. Scotland Yard had launched an attempted murder investigation and made a nationwide appeal for information, but never discovered how she came to be there or who her parents were. Margaret wrote to the hospital offering her a home, after reading about her case in the newspaper. Several other people offered to take Anthea, including a Belgian diplomat, but the Shannans were chosen because they had experience raising a child - Veronica, who had been knocked over by a car when she was seven. ""My mother said that when they walked in to the ward I came to the end of the cot and put my arms out,"" Anthea says. ""They paid the juvenile court 11 shillings and sixpence and took me home to Surrey."" After receiving this shocking news, Anthea went home and cried. She told her husband but they decided not to tell their children and she put it to the back of her mind. Anthea with her two eldest children, Jonathan and Christine Decades passed, and Anthea's children had children of their own. Her grandson, Aaron, was also a spitting image of Anthea as a baby and it made her wonder once again who she was. In 1994 she joined a group called Norcap, which helped adopted adults find out more about their past. A member of the group suggested she write to the police in Worthing to see if they had any records. And even though 57 years had passed, the Police Superintendent for West Sussex was able to put her in touch with a retired policeman who had worked the case. He was known as Mac. ""He told me he'd been on crowd control in Worthing that day as they'd had a famous film star at the cinema. He got called back after I was found and was put on door-to-door enquiries,"" Anthea says. ""He said he'd carried my photo in his wallet for years and would produce it if he thought someone might know me, but no-one ever did."" Mac was convinced Anthea was not a local child, as it would have been impossible to keep such a secret in a small community. He thought she could have been brought on the train from London. Their meeting was reported in the local paper, after Mac told the local retired policeman's association about it. The wider press got wind of the story and Anthea was once again the focus of national news. Weeks later she received a letter simply addressed to Anthea, with the name of a local TV show she had featured on. It was from Elizabeth Dodd - the eldest daughter of the family who had found her on the Downs. Jane and Elizabeth around the time they found baby Anthea ""She said I'd ruined her holiday all those years ago because she had wanted her parents to adopt me and they wouldn't,"" Anthea says. Elizabeth told her the family had been returning from a walk when her mother had heard her cries. They had taken her to the nearest house but it didn't have a phone so they carried her on to the big farmhouse in the village of Sompting. ""They were having a tennis party and passed me around the dining room,"" Anthea says. ""One of the farmer's daughters called the police and I was taken to hospital."" Elizabeth has since died, but her younger sister Jane, now 92, still remembers that day. She says the family was walking along the side of Cissbury Ring when her mother heard Anthea's cries. ""My mother and sister did everything while I held my father's hand,"" she says. ""That night I was very frightened as I thought we'd taken someone's baby and they would be cross with us."" Jane, 92, with Anthea, 80. They first met on the South Downs when Jane was 11 and Anthea was a baby She remembers that her parents called the hospital the next day and were told the baby had been called Ann. Anthea also received a letter from Betty, a nurse who had looked after her at Worthing Hospital. ""Apparently I was put in a cot in the sister's office. Betty realised I needed a name when she handed over at the end of her shift. She called me Ann, as it was her favourite name,"" Anthea says. Anthea stayed at Worthing Hospital for six months while the police investigated. Her only injuries were to the skin of her wrists, where she had been bound. ""Apparently the ward sister used to take me out in a pram and walk up and down the front. I've always loved the sound of seagulls,"" Anthea says. Anthea with two doctors from Worthing Hospital Although Anthea now knew far more about how she was found and cared for, she was no closer to finding her parents. Her only clue was Mac's hunch that she had come from London. There were no further breakthroughs until 2012, when Anthea, then 75, decided to take a DNA test. This revealed her ethnicity was 92% Irish and matched her with some distant cousins in America and Ireland. One cousin called Joan, living in North Carolina, asked relatives in her extended family tree to take tests. This revealed Joan was linked to Anthea through her father's maternal side. They came from County Mayo in Ireland. ""I met Joan in 2013. She was the first blood relative I had ever met so it was quite something,"" Anthea says. Two years later she matched with a woman who worked at Dublin University, called Ann. Ann didn't match with Joan, which suggested she was from the other side of Anthea's family. Ann's family came from County Galway. By this time Anthea had joined online communities for adoptees and foundlings and in April 2016 she was contacted by genetic genealogist Julia Bell, who offered to help. Julia and Anthea sift through the records Bell had managed to track down her own American GI grandfather using DNA and genealogical research. She had then started helping other people look for their relatives in her spare time. ""Knowing who her family was changed my mother's life,"" Bell says. ""I believe everyone deserves to know who they really are."" Anthea and Bell met at Paddington Station, where Anthea told her everything she had found out up to that point. Bell encouraged Anthea to take some further DNA tests with different companies, knowing that millions more people had joined DNA databases since Anthea tested in 2012. This provided further distant cousin matches. ""We then used genealogy to build trees to find possible common ancestors and then brought the lines down,"" Bell says. ""It was a lot of work because families could have 12 children and there was a lot of intermarriage. This could make people seem like closer matches than they actually were."" After months of work with the help of genealogist Angie Bush, Bell had narrowed down the search. She was confident one parent was a Coyne from County Galway and the other was an O'Donnell from County Mayo. She was considering the seven daughters of a John O'Donnell when things began to fall into place. ""I was looking at the youngest daughter, Ellen O'Donnell, who was born in 1911,"" she says. Irish amateur historian Catherine Corless had told Bell that Ellen's official name would be a Saint's name - and baptismal records revealed this was Helena. Then came the eureka moment. ""Earlier on I had ordered records of illegitimate births in England and Ireland in 1936. I had come across an unmarried mother called Lena O'Donnell but dismissed it. ""Suddenly I thought: 'Of course, Lena could be Helena!'"" Corless found out Lena O'Donnell had got married in Ireland in 1945, seven years after Anthea had been found, and had given birth to four more children. She tracked down one of the sons who agreed to have a DNA test. In April 2017 the test confirmed Bell's hunch. He was Anthea's half-brother. ""I was sitting in the garden in the sun when Julia rang,"" Anthea says. ""She told me my birth mother was Lena O'Donnell. I was delighted."" Anthea's birth certificate revealed she was born on 20 November 1936, just five days after the date her parents picked for her birthday. Her birth name was Mary Veronica. Lena had been moving between digs in Cricklewood when Anthea was born at St Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington. She gave her occupation as a machine operator at a telephone factory. She was taken in by a charity for unmarried mothers called the Home for Guardian Angels after leaving hospital on 7 December. However, she didn't stay long. A baptismal record from 18 December reveals Lena moved with her baby to another home called Devon Nook in Chiswick. This Roman Catholic home was unusual for the time as it encouraged the mothers to look after their babies and to keep them if they could. It's the last known record of Lena O'Donnell until she appears on an electoral roll in 1939 back in Cricklewood. Mary Veronica O'Donnell disappears altogether. ""What happened after Lena left Devon Nook?"" Bell asks, rhetorically. ""I don't think she was the one who abandoned Anthea. I think she did a brave thing and decided to try and keep the baby."" Lena O'Donnell was staying at Devon Nook when Anthea was baptised at four weeks old Had Lena wanted to abandon her baby there were easier ways to do it in a big city. An article in the Daily Herald from 28 August 1937 reported 12 abandoned babies were lying in London hospitals. ""They have all been found in the last 10 weeks in railway carriages, churches, station waiting rooms, public parks and on the doorsteps of private houses."" A search for the mothers of 15 recently abandoned children had only succeeded in two cases, it added. So how did Anthea end up on the South Downs? One theory is that Lena left Anthea with a foster mother while she went out to work. Newspaper reports from the time reveal some foster mothers offered to get children in their care adopted for a fee. They would then sell the child to a couple or another broker. An article from 1932 in the Gloucester Citizen, said the traffic in babies was ""becoming one of the greater evils of London"". A director of the National Children Adoption Association is quoted as saying: ""Americans are often willing to pay a high price for fair-headed babies, especially with curls. They call them the pure Anglo-Saxon typeâ¦ At present they are bought and sold more easily than motor cars."" It's possible an exchange of the fair-haired Anthea had been planned near Worthing, and that it somehow went wrong on the day. ""I may never know what happened to me but I've come to terms with it,"" Anthea says. A bridleway leading down from Cissbury Ring, near where Anthea was left At that point her father had still not been identified, but Bell had narrowed down the search to six brothers. Four of them - Michael, Martin, Patrick and Phillip Coyne - had been working as labourers in London in 1936. Martin's daughter agreed to be tested and the results revealed she was a first cousin. This confirmed one of the other three would be Anthea's father. Michael's granddaughter Anne Marie was tested and the result also ruled Michael out. This left just Patrick and Phillip, but as neither had direct descendants the only thing that could prove paternity would be a sample of their DNA - hard to find years after their death. However, Anthea was also in touch with a first cousin called Dot, who was the daughter of one of Patrick and Phillip's sisters. ""I was telling Dot about the problem when she said: 'Well I've still got letters that Patrick sent me,'"" Anthea says. The letters, still in their original stamped envelopes, had been sent from England to the US about 30 years earlier. Bell approached David Nicholson of Living DNA. He said his company could use a recently developed forensic test to capture Patrick's DNA from the saliva left when he licked the stamps and envelope. Last year they took a sample of Anthea's saliva and compared it to small sections cut from the letters. David Nicholson reveals the results of the DNA test to Anthea and Julia Bell The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded to use. However on the fourth, Nicholson said ""we hit on more than enough DNA"". The test, which Nicholson says has ""a degree of accuracy acceptable in UK courts"", proved Patrick Coyne was Anthea's biological father. ""I was so happy as I'd been looking for my father for 29 years,"" Anthea says. Anthea isn't currently in contact with her mother's relatives, although she says her half-brother who took the DNA test ""wishes me well"". However, she has enjoyed getting to know her father's side of the family. ""They told me Patrick was a very lively man, the life and soul of the party,"" Anthea says. ""We don't know if Patrick ever knew about me. He never married and once told Dot it was because he liked his independence and didn't want to be tied down."" Now 80 and living near Bath, Anthea says she is grateful to both Lena and Patrick for the DNA she inherited from them, as she is pretty healthy for someone of her age. But her long journey to learn about her origins hasn't changed how she remembers her adoptive parents. Last summer she had a family party with her children, grandchildren and cousins.
