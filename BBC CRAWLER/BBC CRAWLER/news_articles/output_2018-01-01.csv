"More than 11,000 homes empty for 10 yearsAmid a homelessness crisis, the findings are a ""national scandal"", Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable says.5m6 minutes agoUK","More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for 10 years or more, research by the Liberal Democrats has found. The figures, from 276 local councils, show there are more than 216,000 homes across the country which have been empty for six months or more. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable called it a ""national scandal"", at a time when ""the homelessness crisis is worsening"". The number of empty homes is down a third since 2010, the government said. Durham had the most empty homes (6,500) followed by Leeds (5,724), Bradford (4,144), Cornwall (3,273) and Liverpool (3,093). Empty homes spike in London commuter belt Couple on how Â£1 house in Stoke-on-Trent changed their lives 'Blight' of 23,000 properties in Wales The data - obtained through a Freedom of Information request - also reveals only one in 13 councils is making use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders. EDMOs allow councils in England and Wales to take over residential properties that have been empty for six months or more. Just 19 of the 247 councils in England and Wales that responded (the powers do not apply in Scotland) had used an EDMO in the past five years. Councils did return 23,000 empty homes back into use. Meanwhile homelessness in the UK is getting worse. In December, a committee of MPs found more than78,000 families were living in temporary accommodationin England. The number of people sleeping on the streets had increased by 134% since 2011. Mr Cable has called on the government to review the current system ""which is clearly not working"". ""Councils need to be given the powers and resources to bring empty homes back into use,"" he said. ""This must form part of a wider package to tackle the housing crisis, including building more homes on unused public sector land and clamping down on land-banking."" The Department for Communities and Local Government pointed out that powers had been given to councils to bring empty homes back into use. ""At the same time, we're implementing the major changes to law and investing over Â£1bn to 2020 to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping,"" a spokesman added. Reality Check: Who is homeless?

"Beachgoers' crafty bid to avoid booze banThe new-year revellers built a sand island to put them in ""international waters"", according to locals.8h8 hours agoAsia","The New Year revellers enjoyed a drink on the sand island they built in an apparent attempt to circumvent a public drinking ban A group of New Zealanders has constructed a sand island in coastal waters, seemingly in a creative attempt to avoid a ban on drinking in public places. The group built the structure at low tide in the Tairua estuary on the Coromandel peninsula on Sunday afternoon, reports said. They then installed a picnic table and ice box for drinks. Locals joked that they were in ""international waters"" and thus exempt from an official liquor ban. The group drank into the night on New Year's Eve,external, watching the fireworks, reported New Zealand website stuff.co.nz - and the construction was still intact on Monday morning. A ban on public drinking is in force in Coromandel over the New Year period and those violating the ban face a fine of $250 (Â£130; US$180) or arrest. But authorities seemed to be taking the initiative in light-hearted spirit. ""That's creative thinking - if I had known [about it] I probably would have joined them,"" said local police commander Inspector John Kelly when told about the sand island. The island was still intact on New Year's Day The images were posted ina local Facebook group, Tairua ChitChat,external, by David Saunders. Mr Saunders told the BBC: ""It was great to see some Kiwis having a bit of fun."" But a well-known community organiser Noddy Watts said the ban was not working and was simply resulting in swathes of arrests. He said the police were ""dealing with drunk teens"". ""That's not what they are there for.That's what parents are there for,"" he said,external, according to the New Zealand Herald. ""The police and St John were getting frustrated with the result and said it has to change,"" said Mr Watts according to the New Zealand Herald.

Palestinian girl charged after slap video,"This video can not be played Ahed Tamimi was arrested after the video went viral. Israeli authorities have charged a Palestinian teenager with assault after a video of her hitting and pushing Israeli soldiers went viral. Ahed Tamimi, 16, and her cousin were filmed in a confrontation with the soldiers that was widely shared by Palestinians on social media. She faces 12 charges including aggravated assault and throwing stones. But the family say they were involved in legitimate resistance during protests in the occupied West Bank. Israel's military says the soldiers were preventing Palestinians from throwing stones at nearby motorists. The video, filmed on 15 December, shows a group of women including Tamini shouting at, hitting and kicking two heavily-armed Israeli soldiers. It was widely circulated online, and many Palestinians have hailed Tamimi as a hero of the resistance to Israeli occupation. Palestinians recall envoy to US Trump Jerusalem move sparks Israeli-Palestinian clashes Why settlement issue is so difficult On Sunday, her cousin, Nour Tamimi, was charged with assault and disturbing soldiers from carrying out their duties. Her mother, who filmed the video and posted it on Facebook, has also been charged. At the time of her arrest,Ahed's father said soldiers had fired tear gas,externaland broken windows at the family's house. Bassem Tamimi, a prominent activist, added that Ahed's 15-year-old cousin, Mohammed, had also been hit in the face with a rubber bullet fired by Israeli soldiers. Mohammed was reportedly wounded during a weekly protest in the village of Nabi Salih,externalwhere the Israeli military said more than 200 Palestinians threw stones. ""Several Palestinians entered a nearby home and continued throwing rocks at soldiers from inside the home with its occupants' consent,"" the military said. ""Forces removed the rioters from the home and remained standing in the entrance in order to prevent further entry. Later, several Palestinian women came out to face the soldiers in order to incite provocation."" Ahed Tamimi appeared at a military court at the Israeli-run Ofer prison in the West Bank The military said an investigation had determined that an infantry company commander was one of the two soldiers shown being confronted in the video, and that he had ""conducted himself professionally by not responding in kind"". In the video, the girl identified as Ahed can be heard telling the soldiers to leave the entrance to the home. When they do not move, she punches and kicks the soldiers. A second girl and a woman also push and kick the soldiers later in the video. Last month, Mr Tamimi told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharonth thatthe incident in the video took place after the soldiers ""entered the grounds of the house,external, started throwing gas grenades around and broke the house's windows"". ""Their conduct may seem humane at that instance, but I don't think their general conduct that day was humane. I'm proud of my daughter and what she did"", he said. Two years ago, Ahed Tamimi was in a video which went viral in whichshe was seen biting the hand of an Israeli soldier,externalholding a Palestinian boy who the army said had been throwing stones. Palestinian activists praised her actions, while many in Israel accused her family of using her as a propaganda tool.

Hollywood women launch abuse campaign,"Television producer Shonda Rhimes and actresses Natalie Portman and America Ferrera are among the supporters More than 300 actresses, writers and directors have launched a project to help fight sexual harassment in the film industry and other workplaces. The initiative, which is called Time's Up, was announced via a full-page advert printed in the New York Times. The Hollywood project is described as a ""unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere"". It comes in the wake of sexual abuse allegations by high-profile actresses against film producer Harvey Weinstein. The campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, has already raised more than $13m (Â£9.6m) of its $15m target. The money raised will be used to fund legal support,externalfor both female and male victims of sexual harassment at work. The project is aimed primarily at those who are unable to meet the payments to defend themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses. In a ""solidarity letter"" published on its website,Time's Up says the ""struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard"" must end,external, adding: ""Time's up on this impenetrable monopoly."" The letter, which is aimed at ""every woman... who has had to fend off sexual advances"", goes on to say that such harassment can often continue because ""perpetrators and employers never face any consequences"". Exploring the casting couch culture of LA The photographer telling women's sexual harassment stories How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Who are Time's ""silence breakers""? Harvey Weinstein scandal: Who has accused him of what? It also calls for ""gender inequality and the imbalance of power"" to be addressed, stressing the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay. In December, Time magazine named ""the Silence Breakers"" - women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its ""Person of the Year"" for 2017. Last year also saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment. The term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity. Between October and December 2017, the hashtag was used on Twitter and Facebook more than six million times.

'Hundreds' escape Boko Haram captivity,"The army released pictures of some of those it said were former Boko Haram captives The Nigerian army says more than 700 people held by Boko Haram militants in the north-east of the country have escaped captivity. An army spokesperson, Col Timothy Antigha, said they had fled several islands in Lake Chad and arrived in the town of Monguno, in Borno state. There has been no independent verification of the army's claim. A BBC correspondent says the escapes are likely to have happened over a period of time, not in one go. The military says a recent armed forces operation, Deep Punch II, has weakened Boko Haram. In his New Year address, President Muhammadu Buhari said the group had been ""beaten"". Chronicling a Boko Haram kidnapping 'A Boko Haram commander's wife persuaded me to escape with her' Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamist group? In a post on the HQ Nigerian Army Facebook page, Col Antigha said the 700 comprised ""farmers, fishermen and members of their families who were hitherto held by Boko Haram terrorists as farm workers"". He said the recent operation ""was targeted at destroying Boko Haram infrastructure and logistics; such as communication centres, fabrication yards, bomb making equipment, vehicles and other means of sustenance"". The army described the escaped captives as farmers, fishermen and their families and said they were held for their labour ""The ensuing collapse of their command structure and means of survival have therefore triggered the abandonment of the islands and escape of the abductees,"" he wrote. Col Antigha said the escapees were being profiled to ensure there were no militants hidden among them. He also said two women among the escaped captives had given birth safely at a military holding facility. Over eight years, Boko Haram's campaign of Islamist violence has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced some 2.6 million. Despite the authorities' insistence that the group has been vanquished, in recent months Boko Haram fighters have stepped up their attacks on military and civilian targets. Who are Boko Haram?

"High wind warning for coastal communitiesSouthern Scotland could be affected by gales with gusts of 60-70mph, perhaps 80mph on the west coast.4h4 hours agoSouth Scotland","Forecasters have warned about the risk to coastal communities The Met Office has issued ayellow warningof strong winds expected on Tuesday. Parts of Scotland are likely to be affected, particularly the south of the country. Forecasters said that, when combined with high tides, some western coastal communities could experience large waves and spray. There is also a ""small chance"" of injuries and danger to life from large waves and beach material. The Met Office said power cuts and disruption to other services, such as mobile phones, may occur. There is a small chance of transport disruption or cancellation of public transport. The warning states: ""A deepening area of low pressure is expected to track northeastwards across the northern half of the UK. ""This will most likely bring a spell of very strong winds to Northern Ireland later Tuesday, which will then move northeastwards across parts of southern Scotland and Northern England before clearing into the North Sea early on Wednesday. ""There is however still a lot of uncertainty over the exact track that the low pressure will take and hence where precisely the strongest winds will be.

UK 'faces build-up of plastic waste',"This video can not be played A new ban on most foreign waste in China could impact recycling in the UK. The UK's recycling industry says it doesn't know how to cope with a Chinese ban on imports of plastic waste. Britain has been shipping up to 500,000 tonnes of plastic for recycling in China every year, but now the trade has been stopped. At the moment the UK cannot deal with much of that waste, says the UK Recycling Association. Its chief executive, Simon Ellin, told the BBC he had no idea how the problem would be solved in the short term. ""It's a huge blow for us... a game-changer for our industry,"" he said. ""We've relied on China so long for our wasteâ¦ 55% of paper, 25% plus of plastics. ""We simply don't have the markets in the UK. It's going to mean big changes in our industry."" China has introduced the ban from this month on ""foreign garbage"" as part of a move to upgrade its industries. Other Asian nations will take some of the plastic, but there will still be a lot left. Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Simple ways to cut back on plastic Curb 'devastating' waste MPs say Environment Secretary Michael Gove has admitted that he was slow to spot the problem coming. The UK organisation Recoup, which recycles plastics, said the imports ban would lead to stock-piling of plastic waste and a move towards incineration and landfill. Peter Fleming, from the Local Government Association, told the BBC: ""Clearly there's a part to play for incineration but not all parts of the country have incinerators. ""It's a challenge - but mostly in the short termâ¦ and we will cope. In the longer term we need a much more intelligent waste strategy."" Any move towards burning more plastic waste, though, would be met with fierce resistance from environmental groups. Louise Edge, from Greenpeace, told the BBC: ""The government has got us into this mess by continually putting off decisions and passing the buck. ""Incineration is the wrong answer - it's a high-carbon non-renewable form of generating electricity. It also creates toxic chemicals and heavy metals. ""If you build incinerators it creates a market for the next 20 years for single-use plastics, which is the very thing we need to be reducing right now."" The government is consulting with industry over a tax on single-use plastics and a deposit scheme for bottles. Mr Gove told the BBC his long-term goals were to reduce the amount of plastic in the economy overall, reduce the number of different plastics, simplify local authority rules so people can easily judge what's recyclable and what isn't as well as increase the rate of recycling. The UK must, he said, ""stop off-shoring its dirt"". The Commons Environmental Audit Committee said Britain should introduce a sliding scale tax on plastic packaging with the hardest to recycle being charge most and the easiest to recycle being charged least. There is broad agreement over much of that agenda, but it is not yet clear how the UK will achieve that long-term goal - or how it will solve its short-term China crisis.

Murder arrest over Finsbury Park death,"The body of Iuliana Tudos was discovered near the sports ground in Finsbury Park A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a woman who went missing on Christmas Eve. Iuliana Tudos, 22, was found by a member of the public in a disused building inside Finsbury Park, London, on December 27. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the abdomen and a head injury. The 31-year-old man was arrested earlier at an address in Dalston, east London. Pub worker Ms Tudos, who police said was of Russian and Greek origin, was last seen as she headed for a bus home from Camden. She had planned to meet friends in Enfield, north London, where she was due to spend Christmas Day, but never arrived. Det Chief Supt Des Fahy said extra officers had been deployed for reassurance. ""We understand that the local community might have concerns, but I want to reassure people that incidents of this nature are incredibly rare,"" he said. ""By all accounts, Iuliana was a bubbly lively girl enjoying a fun life in London when she was tragically taken from her loved ones. Our hearts go out to them."" A crowdfunding appeal to raise money to cover Ms Tudos' funeral has so far raised more than Â£15,000.

New protests as Iran plays down unrest,"This video can not be played Footage shows improvised roadblocks and street fires Protests in Iran continued late into Monday, despite the president saying that the unrest ""is nothing"". Anti-government chanting and burning cars were reported on the fifth day of unrest, while police said an officer was killed in a central city and others wounded. At least 13 people are believed to have died in the clashes so far. President Hassan Rouhani said protests were an ""opportunity, not a threat"" but vowed to crack down on ""lawbreakers"". The US meanwhile stepped up support for the protesters' ""bold resistance"". The protests began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad, initially against price rises and corruption but now with wider anti-government sentiment. US warns Iran: The world is watching Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs Who is Hassan Rouhani? Reports from Monday's events spoke of a heavy police presence in the capital. The Mehr news agency reported a taxi being set alight. Police had used tear gas and water cannon the previous evening to quell a rally in Tehran's Engheleb Square. State media were also quoting a police spokesman as saying that shots had been fired at police in Najafabad, near Isfahan in central Iran, killing one officer and wounding three. Reuters news agency reported that a police station in the town of Qahderijan was partly set on fire amid clashes between security forces and protesters trying to occupy the building. Unconfirmed reports suggested several casualties, it added. Social media postings spoke of fresh protests in Birjand in the east, Kermanshah in the west and Shadegan in the far south-west. This video can not be played Video from the town of Dorud shows a crowd carrying what appears to be a wounded man Initially, state TV said that 10 people had been killed overnight on Sunday, but by Monday evening that figure had been raised to 13 by a regional governor: Six died after shots were fired in the western town of Tuyserkan, 300km (185 miles) south-west of Tehran Later, Hamadan province's governor told the ISNA agency that another three people had also been killed in the city Two people died in the south-western town of Izeh, an official said Two died in clashes in Dorud in Lorestan province Two people also died in earlier violence. In a statement on the presidency website, Mr Rouhani sought to play down the violence. He said: ""This is nothing. Criticism and protest are an opportunity not a threat."" But he also vowed to act against ""rioters and lawbreakers"". Hassan Rouhani has sent out messages both tough and conciliatory ""Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and people's wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution,"" he said. A later tweet appeared more conciliatory, saying that the government needed to pay attention to people's demands on livelihood issues and corruption. Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has taken a tough line, warning anti-government protesters they will face the nation's ""iron fist"" if political unrest continues. The IRGC is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. Correspondents say it would be a significant escalation were they to become officially involved in policing the protests. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli-Larijani on Monday called for a crackdown on ""rioters"" and ""vandals"". ""Some individuals are exploiting the situation. This is wrong,"" he said. Up to 400 people are reported to have been arrested in recent days. President Donald Trump stepped his war of words with Iran's leaders on Monday, posting a tweet saying the ""great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food and freedom"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He added in capital letters ""TIME FOR CHANGE!"" Vice-President Mike Pence took an even stronger tone. He tweeted: ""The bold and growing resistance of the Iranian people today gives hope and faith to all who struggle for freedom and against tyranny. We must not and we will not let them down."" He spoke of the ""shameful mistake"" of not supporting previous Iranian protesters. The Green Movement in 2009 saw millions of protesters dispute the election victory of incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The protests were brutally suppressed, with at least 30 people killed and thousands arrested. The latest US approach has infuriated Iran. Mr Rouhani described the US president as an ""enemy of the Iranian nation from the top of his head to his very toes"". The EU, meanwhile, called on Iran to guarantee its citizens' right to peaceful protest, saying it had been in touch with Iranian authorities and was monitoring the situation. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that ""the UK is watching events in Iran closely"". ""We believe that there should be meaningful debate about the legitimate and important issues the protesters are raising and we look to the Iranian authorities to permit this"", he said. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian There is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. Protests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime. They have spread to small towns throughout the country and have the potential to grow in size. But there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. Some protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else. BBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities.

Arena car park fire 'ferocious',"This video can not be played Sue Wright and her husband, former England footballer Mark Wright, describe escaping A witness has described watching a ""ferocious"" blaze which destroyed about 1,400 cars break out in front of her. It engulfed the multi-storey car park in King's Dock- next to the Liverpool Echo Arena - on New Year's Eve. The venue was forced to cancel the Liverpool International Horse Show and hundreds were left stranded overnight. No casualties were reported. The fire chief said a sprinkler system could have stopped the fire, which began accidentally, from spreading. Sue Wright had been attending the horse show with her husband, former England footballer Mark Wright. She said she saw an old Land Rover - thought by firefighters to be the source of the blaze - with its engine on fire. ""The flames were just shooting out of the engine and coming past the tyres,"" she said. The blaze at King's Dock is thought to have started accidentally ""It looked like a ball of fire on the front of the car and it was producing a lot of smoke. ""We just left everything in the car - handbags, telephone, cash - and just went. ""I saw one car on fire but it was clear it was ferocious and spreading."" About 1,400 cars were destroyed in the fire Mrs Wright took a photo as the flames took hold Dan Stephens, of Merseyside Fire and Rescue, said the flames spread very quickly. ""I believe a sprinkler system would certainly have suppressed the fire,"" he said. ""It would definitely have limited the spread and given us a much better opportunity to put the fire out before it spread to the extent it did."" A sprinkler system could have suppressed the flames, fire bosses say Sue Wright said her family's minibus was a ""write-off"" Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said there were lessons to be learned. ""If there's things we can do to make the car parks more safer then that is exactly what we will do,"" he said. Liverpool City Council opened a reception centre at Lifestyles Gym for those unable to get home or needing temporary shelter. Others were offered accommodation or lifts by fellow show-goers or locals. Jan Clarke, from Adelaide in Australia, spent the night in the centre with daughters Kaitlyn Bolton, 27, and Shelly, 22 after they were evacuated from a block of flats near the arena. She said the first sign of the fire was smoke and the sound of explosions from across the dock. ""We thought it was firecrackers,"" she said. Those with vehicles in the car park have been told to contact their insurance company Jan Clarke and her daughters Kaitlyn and Shelly Bolton were evacuated from a nearby block of flats The family took shelter at a nearby McDonald's, where they watched the fire develop. ""All we could see was the smoke,"" Ms Clarke said. ""We could see the smoke getting darker and darker and we heard multiple explosions."" Ms Clarke, who celebrates her 60th birthday on Tuesday, praised the help and advice they were given by emergency services and was hopeful of a return to the flat. She said Shelly, who suffers from epilepsy, had left her medication behind and had missed two doses. ""Everyone here was fabulous, I couldn't fault them,"" she added. Sean and Alison Lightning were walking back to their car when they smelled burning plastic Sean and Alison Lightning, from Northwood, near Shropshire, were walking towards the arena to see the show when they detected the smell of ""burning plastic"" in the air. ""It was surreal,"" he said. ""I said 'knowing our luck it'll be the venue' and it was."" The couple had left their phones inside Mr Lightning's Nissan pick-up truck, but were helped to contact family by strangers and found temporary accommodation. ""People in the street were helping us, ringing our family and leaving messages,"" he added. Emergency services are still at the scene of the blaze No animals were hurt in the blaze and four dogs were rescued from a car on the top floor of the car park earlier. Daniel Delsart, a French show jumper, was supposed to be competing in the show on Sunday evening but ended up helping to evacuate some of the horses. He said: ""I rushed in with a few other riders and officials to pull out the last few horses in the multi-storey. ""The smoke was getting worse and worse and the horses were pretty alarmed with all the fire engine sirens and bangs from cars exploding."" Later smoke began to engulf the stables and he helped to move the horses again as it was getting difficult to breathe. ""The scale of the fire, it was crazy. It's like something that you see on TV but you never think it's possible."" Daniel Delsart had travelled to compete in the show but ended up helping to move horses The flames spread ""very quickly"" The fire service was first called at about 16:40 GMT on New Year's Eve. Crews remain at the scene to continue investigations into the cause of the fire and are guarding against the risk of the building collapsing. All vehicles in the 1,600-capacity car park were destroyed, Merseyside Police said. Those with vehicles in the car park have been told to contact their insurance company quoting reference number 650 of 31 December. This video can not be played Witness Olly Harrison said he heard bangs and explosions as he was turned away from the arena A spokeswoman for the Echo Arena said the horse show was cancelled and that ""all people and horses are safe and secure"". The four-day event was due to finish with Sunday evening's show, where around 4,000 people were expected. How ex-England footballer and wife fled fire.

'Ten dead' in latest Iran protests,"This video can not be played Footage shows improvised roadblocks and street fires Ten people have been killed overnight in anti-government protests sweeping Iran, according to state TV. ""In the events of last night, unfortunately a total of about 10 people were killed in several cities,"" it said. At least 12 people have now died since protests began on Thursday. On Monday, President Hassan Rouhani said the protests and criticism were an opportunity, not a threat. He said the country should work together to fix its economic problems. He said: ""Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and people's wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution."" Mr Rouhani had previously said that citizens were free to protest, but not violently. US President Donald Trump continued his war of words with Iran's leaders on Monday, posting a tweet saying the ""great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food and freedom"". Six of those killed died after shots were fired in the western town of Tuyserkan, 300km (185 miles) south-west of Tehran. An official in the south-western town of Izeh said two people had died there. The other two people were reportedly killed in clashes in Dorud in Lorestan province. Police also used tear gas and water cannon overnight to quell a rally in Tehran's Engheleb Square. Demonstrations were also reported in Kermanshah and Khorramabad in the west, Shahinshahr in the north-west and in the northern city of Zanjan.

Four men die in New Year stabbings,"A 17-year old boy was murdered in Norwood Road, Tulse Hill Four young men were killed in stabbing incidents in London amid New Year celebrations, the Met Police has said. Three were stabbed on New Year's Eve and a fourth in the early hours of New Year's Day in unrelated incidents. Another young man stabbed on New Year's Day is in a critical condition in hospital. Five men have been arrested over the death of an 18-year-old in Larmans Road, Enfield. No other arrests have been made. In the other attacks, a 20-year-old man was fatally stabbed in Memorial Avenue, West Ham, and a 17-year-old boy was killed in Norwood Road, Tulse Hill, on New Year's Eve. Early on New Year's Day, a 20-year-old man was fatally wounded in Bartholomew Court, Old Street. A second man in his 20s suffered critical stab injuries in the same incident. The fatalities in the final hours of 2017 took the number of people stabbed to death in the capital last year to 80, the Met said. Police have appealed for witnesses to the stabbings Commander Neil Jerome said: ""I am grateful to Londoners and visitors to the capital who co-operated with police to enable the vast majority of people to enjoy New Year's Eve. ""However, there were small groups who chose to engage in disorder and violence, and whose actions have had utterly tragic consequences.

Beachgoers' crafty bid to avoid booze ban,"The New Year revellers enjoyed a drink on the sand island they built in an apparent attempt to circumvent a public drinking ban A group of New Zealanders has constructed a sand island in coastal waters, seemingly in a creative attempt to avoid a ban on drinking in public places. The group built the structure at low tide in the Tairua estuary on the Coromandel peninsula on Sunday afternoon, reports said. They then installed a picnic table and ice box for drinks. Locals joked that they were in ""international waters"" and thus exempt from an official liquor ban. The group drank into the night on New Year's Eve,external, watching the fireworks, reported New Zealand website stuff.co.nz - and the construction was still intact on Monday morning. A ban on public drinking is in force in Coromandel over the New Year period and those violating the ban face a fine of $250 (Â£130; US$180) or arrest. But authorities seemed to be taking the initiative in light-hearted spirit. ""That's creative thinking - if I had known [about it] I probably would have joined them,"" said local police commander Inspector John Kelly when told about the sand island. The island was still intact on New Year's Day The images were posted ina local Facebook group, Tairua ChitChat,external, by David Saunders. Mr Saunders told the BBC: ""It was great to see some Kiwis having a bit of fun."" But a well-known community organiser Noddy Watts said the ban was not working and was simply resulting in swathes of arrests. He said the police were ""dealing with drunk teens"". ""That's not what they are there for.That's what parents are there for,"" he said,external, according to the New Zealand Herald. ""The police and St John were getting frustrated with the result and said it has to change,"" said Mr Watts according to the New Zealand Herald.

High wind warning for coastal communities,"Forecasters have warned about the risk to coastal communities The Met Office has issued ayellow warningof strong winds expected on Tuesday. Parts of Scotland are likely to be affected, particularly the south of the country. Forecasters said that, when combined with high tides, some western coastal communities could experience large waves and spray. There is also a ""small chance"" of injuries and danger to life from large waves and beach material. The Met Office said power cuts and disruption to other services, such as mobile phones, may occur. There is a small chance of transport disruption or cancellation of public transport. The warning states: ""A deepening area of low pressure is expected to track northeastwards across the northern half of the UK. ""This will most likely bring a spell of very strong winds to Northern Ireland later Tuesday, which will then move northeastwards across parts of southern Scotland and Northern England before clearing into the North Sea early on Wednesday. ""There is however still a lot of uncertainty over the exact track that the low pressure will take and hence where precisely the strongest winds will be. ""Gales with gusts of 60 to 70 mph are likely, whilst some western coastal areas have a chance of seeing gusts of 80 mph.""

"Nuclear button is on my desk, says Kim","Residents of South Korea watched the speech from the North's leader North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has said a nuclear launch button is ""always on my table"" and warned the US it will never be able to start a war. In a televised new year speech, he said the entire US was within range of North Korean nuclear weapons, adding: ""This is reality, not a threat."" But he also offered a potential olive branch to South Korea, suggesting he was ""open to dialogue"". He said the North may send a team to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. When asked by reporters to respond to Mr Kim's latest threats, US President Donald Trump said, ""We'll see, we'll see"". He was speaking at the sidelines of New Year's Eve celebrations at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Where is the US-North Korean war of words heading? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? North Korea has come under increased criticism and sanctions over the past year because of its nuclear weapons programme and repeated testing of conventional missiles. This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC It claims to have a fully deployable nuclear weapon, though there is still some international scepticism about its true capacity to carry out such an attack. In his speech, Mr Kim re-emphasised his focus on the weapons programme, but implied the country still has a few stages left to go before achieving its ambitions. North Korea must ""mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and speed up their deployment"", he said. He also said they would not use their weapons unless they felt that peace was threatened. While his language against the US remained tough, Mr Kim did not employ his typically antagonistic tone when speaking about his neighbours in South Korea. ""The year 2018 is a significant year for both the North and the South, with the North marking the 70th anniversary of its birth and the South hosting the Winter Olympics. Pyongyang's seasonal ice festival includes an ice sculpture of an intercontinental ballistic missile ""We should melt the frozen North-South relations, thus adorning this meaningful year as a year to be specially recorded in the history of the nation,"" he said. A spokesperson for the South Korean president said their office had ""always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea at anytime and anywhere"". ""We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula."" How North Korea could tip the balance North Korea crisis in 300 words What we know about the new missile Youngshik Daniel Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies, told the BBC that addressing the South was a marked change from the norm for Mr Kim. ""North Korea usually ignores South Korea, maintaining the position that as a 'nuclear power' it will deal with the US on its own,"" said Mr Bong. ""It appears that by engaging the South, he hopes to create an estrangement between South Korea and the US."" The analyst also said that Mr Kim could be seeking to improve ties to offer some respite from the growing economic pressures from the recent UN sanctions. Mr Kim also said he would also consider sending a delegation to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February - a gesture which South Korea has previously suggested would be welcome. ""North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people and we wish the Games will be a success,"" he said. ""Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility."" Can sports and diplomacy mix on the ice with the presence of North Korea's figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik? The president of the PyeongChang Games' organising committee, Lee Hee-beom, told South Korea's news agency Yonhap he was delighted to hear of the potential participation. ""[The committee] enthusiastically welcomes it. It's like a New Year's gift,"" he said. The only two North Korean athletes who qualified for the Games are figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik. Although the North has missed the official deadline to confirm their participation, the skaters could still compete with an invitation by the International Olympic Committee. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in last month suggested delaying an annual joint military drill with US troops until after the Games. The North usually denounces any such exercises as a rehearsal for war. Robert Kelly, a political science professor at South Korea's Pusan National University, told the BBC that the Winter Olympics statement was ""a smart move from North Korea"" as it positioned Mr Kim's regime as moving towards its neighbours while the US was seeking to isolate it.

Archbishop praises compassion shown in 2017Justin Welby said terror attacks and the Grenfell tragedy were met with heroism from emergency workers.6h6 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played ""Communities came together"" The Archbishop of Canterbury has praised the compassion shown by communities responding to terror attacks and tragedy in 2017. In his new year message, Justin Welby said attacks in London and Manchester, and the Grenfell Tower fire, were met with heroism from the emergency teams. He also used his message to ask whether the darkness or light of human kindness would define the year ahead. He was speaking from London Ambulance Service headquarters in Waterloo. The Anglican leader recalled the desperation and sorrow he felt when he visited Grenfell Tower in west London as it burned. He also highlighted the plight of people who were ""struggling to find work or relying on food banks"" and those who were bereaved, or coping with poor mental health or physical illness. ""When things feel unrelentingly difficult, there are often questions which hang in the air: Is there any light at all? Does anyone care?"" he said. The archbishop said people showed their resilience after attacks He cited a passage from the Bible's Gospel of John: ""The light shone in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it."" That light was in the ""resilience of Borough Market"" which was back up and running 10 days after a terror attack in June, in the faces of the hundreds of Grenfell volunteers and in the heroism of the emergency workers, he said. ""So often in 2017 the depth of suffering was matched by a depth of compassion as communities came together,"" he added.

Recreational cannabis legal in California,"California legalised cannabis for medical use in 1996, but is now permitting recreational use by adults California has become the largest state in the US to legalise recreational cannabis use. As of 1 January 2018, adults aged over 21 can possess up to an ounce (28 grams) of the drug and can grow up to six marijuana plants at home. Opponents say the law will lead to more driving under the influence of the drug and introduce young people to drug use. But business is eyeing what could be an industry worth tens of billions of dollars in the next few years. Californians voted in favour of Proposition 64 legalising cannabis 14 months ago, in a poll that took place alongside the US presidential vote. Since then, a complicated patchwork of taxes and regulations has been drawn up to govern sales of the drug. Critics say the red tape will discourage consumers, growers and retailers from leaving the state's vast black market and only a few dozen shops have so far been approved to open. The cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have yet to sanction any recreational marijuana outlets. ""The first year, two years are going to be a mess,"" as cities agree their own regulations and supply and demand is established, Troy Dayton told AFP news agency. He is the CEO of Arcview, a company that analyses the global cannabis market. He predicted there could be ""crazy fluctuation in price over the first year or two"". Cannabis: Promise, risk and controversy Cannabis and vaping more popular than smoking among US teens The cops and politicians joining Canada's cannabis business Nonetheless, the potential rewards are huge in the US's wealthiest and most populous state. In 1996, California was the first state to legalise marijuana for medicinal use. The market for medical marijuana products has already led to a surge in the range of available products But Arcview estimates the illegal cannabis market is currently worth an annual $5.1bn (Â£3.8bn) and once legalised could be worth $5.8bn by 2021. Legal buyers in the newly created ""adult use"" market will also now have to pay state, sales and municipal taxes which it is estimated will generate $1bn per year. They will be prohibited from consuming the drug in public places, with 1,000 feet (300m) of a school or while driving.

Archbishop praises compassion shown in 2017,"This video can not be played ""Communities came together"" The Archbishop of Canterbury has praised the compassion shown by communities responding to terror attacks and tragedy in 2017. In his new year message, Justin Welby said attacks in London and Manchester, and the Grenfell Tower fire, were met with heroism from the emergency teams. He also used his message to ask whether the darkness or light of human kindness would define the year ahead. He was speaking from London Ambulance Service headquarters in Waterloo. The Anglican leader recalled the desperation and sorrow he felt when he visited Grenfell Tower in west London as it burned. He also highlighted the plight of people who were ""struggling to find work or relying on food banks"" and those who were bereaved, or coping with poor mental health or physical illness. ""When things feel unrelentingly difficult, there are often questions which hang in the air: Is there any light at all? Does anyone care?"" he said. The archbishop said people showed their resilience after attacks He cited a passage from the Bible's Gospel of John: ""The light shone in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it."" That light was in the ""resilience of Borough Market"" which was back up and running 10 days after a terror attack in June, in the faces of the hundreds of Grenfell volunteers and in the heroism of the emergency workers, he said. ""So often in 2017 the depth of suffering was matched by a depth of compassion as communities came together,"" he added.

"Arena car park fire 'ferocious'A witness describes seeing a ""ball of fire"" as the blaze at the multi-storey car park took hold.11m11 minutes agoLiverpool","This video can not be played Sue Wright and her husband, former England footballer Mark Wright, describe escaping A witness has described watching a ""ferocious"" blaze which destroyed about 1,400 cars break out in front of her. It engulfed the multi-storey car park in King's Dock- next to the Liverpool Echo Arena - on New Year's Eve. The venue was forced to cancel the Liverpool International Horse Show and hundreds were left stranded overnight. No casualties were reported. The fire chief said a sprinkler system could have stopped the fire, which began accidentally, from spreading. Sue Wright had been attending the horse show with her husband, former England footballer Mark Wright. She said she saw an old Land Rover - thought by firefighters to be the source of the blaze - with its engine on fire. ""The flames were just shooting out of the engine and coming past the tyres,"" she said. The blaze at King's Dock is thought to have started accidentally ""It looked like a ball of fire on the front of the car and it was producing a lot of smoke. ""We just left everything in the car - handbags, telephone, cash - and just went. ""I saw one car on fire but it was clear it was ferocious and spreading."" About 1,400 cars were destroyed in the fire Mrs Wright took a photo as the flames took hold Dan Stephens, of Merseyside Fire and Rescue, said the flames spread very quickly. ""I believe a sprinkler system would certainly have suppressed the fire,"" he said. ""It would definitely have limited the spread and given us a much better opportunity to put the fire out before it spread to the extent it did."" A sprinkler system could have suppressed the flames, fire bosses say Sue Wright said her family's minibus was a ""write-off"" Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said there were lessons to be learned. ""If there's things we can do to make the car parks more safer then that is exactly what we will do,"" he said. Liverpool City Council opened a reception centre at Lifestyles Gym for those unable to get home or needing temporary shelter. Others were offered accommodation or lifts by fellow show-goers or locals. Jan Clarke, from Adelaide in Australia, spent the night in the centre with daughters Kaitlyn Bolton, 27, and Shelly, 22 after they were evacuated from a block of flats near the arena. She said the first sign of the fire was smoke and the sound of explosions from across the dock. ""We thought it was firecrackers,"" she said. Those with vehicles in the car park have been told to contact their insurance company Jan Clarke and her daughters Kaitlyn and Shelly Bolton were evacuated from a nearby block of flats The family took shelter at a nearby McDonald's, where they watched the fire develop. ""All we could see was the smoke,"" Ms Clarke said. ""We could see the smoke getting darker and darker and we heard multiple explosions."" Ms Clarke, who celebrates her 60th birthday on Tuesday, praised the help and advice they were given by emergency services and was hopeful of a return to the flat. She said Shelly, who suffers from epilepsy, had left her medication behind and had missed two doses. ""Everyone here was fabulous, I couldn't fault them,"" she added. Sean and Alison Lightning were walking back to their car when they smelled burning plastic Sean and Alison Lightning, from Northwood, near Shropshire, were walking towards the arena to see the show when they detected the smell of ""burning plastic"" in the air. ""It was surreal,"" he said. ""I said 'knowing our luck it'll be the venue' and it was."" The couple had left their phones inside Mr Lightning's Nissan pick-up truck, but were helped to contact family by strangers and found temporary accommodation. ""People in the street were helping us, ringing our family and leaving messages,"" he added. Emergency services are still at the scene of the blaze No animals were hurt in the blaze and four dogs were rescued from a car on the top floor of the car park earlier. Daniel Delsart, a French show jumper, was supposed to be competing in the show on Sunday evening but ended up helping to evacuate some of the horses. He said: ""I rushed in with a few other riders and officials to pull out the last few horses in the multi-storey. ""The smoke was getting worse and worse and the horses were pretty alarmed with all the fire engine sirens and bangs from cars exploding."" Later smoke began to engulf the stables and he helped to move the horses again as it was getting difficult to breathe. ""The scale of the fire, it was crazy. It's like something that you see on TV but you never think it's possible."" Daniel Delsart had travelled to compete in the show but ended up helping to move horses The flames spread ""very quickly"" The fire service was first called at about 16:40 GMT on New Year's Eve. Crews remain at the scene to continue investigations into the cause of the fire and are guarding against the risk of the building collapsing. All vehicles in the 1,600-capacity car park were destroyed, Merseyside Police said. Those with vehicles in the car park have been told to contact their insurance company quoting reference number 650 of 31 December. This video can not be played Witness Olly Harrison said he heard bangs and explosions as he was turned away from the arena A spokeswoman for the Echo Arena said the horse show was cancelled and that ""all people and horses are safe and secure"".

Hague court 'could not prevent' suicide,"This video can not be played Slobodan Praljak drank a small vial of liquid after his prison sentence was upheld The UN court in the Hague says it could not have prevented a war criminal from taking poison and killing himself. Gambian judge Hassan Jallow said that without specific intelligence, no measures would have guaranteed the poison was detected. Bosnian Croat war criminal Slobodan Praljak died after taking potassium cyanide when his prison sentence was upheld. A Dutch police inquiry into possible criminal activity is continuing. Judge Jallow - who was appointed by the tribunal to investigate Praljak's death - saidit was unclear how or when the convicted man came into possession of the potassium cyanide,external. Even if UN staff had received information about it, he said, the 200-300mg of powder - equivalent to a single tablet - ""could easily have remained undetected even through the most intrusive searches of persons, cells, and other areas"". Limitations on intrusive searches and the screening equipment available to staff also meant poison would be hard to detect, Judge Jallow said. He made recommendations for search regimes and also proposed a 30-minute delay on the broadcast of court judgements. However he said there were no gaps or flaws in the overall treatment of detainees and did not propose any changes to regulations. How did war criminal manage to smuggle poison? Exploring the corridors of the Hague tribunal Praljak drank from a vial after his 20-year term for committing war crimes in Bosnia in the 1990s had been upheld at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Seconds after hearing his appeal had been lost, the former general declared: ""Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal. I am rejecting the court ruling."" The 72-year-old then drank from a small brown-glass bottle and announced: ""I have taken poison."" This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen: 'Why I testified against Praljak' The confirmation rulings against Praljak and five other defendants brought an end to more than 20 years of work by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Balkans war: a brief guide What now for victims? Praljak was convicted in 2013 of crimes against humanity, committed while commanding Bosnian Croat forces. Though allies against the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 civil war, Bosnian Croats and Muslims also fought each other for a period of 11 months, with the city of Mostar seeing some of the fiercest fighting.

US tourists die in Costa Rica plane crash,"The crash happened in a mountainous area Twelve people have been killed in a plane crash in western Costa Rica, officials say. Ten of the victims were US citizens, along with the Costa Rican pilot and co-pilot. Local media said five victims came from a single family. The Nature Air single-propeller Cessna 208 Caravan was travelling from the capital San JosÃ© to the resort of Punta Islita, the CRhoy website reported. There were no survivors. It was unclear what caused the crash. On board the plane were two families from the US: Mitchell Weiss, his wife, Leslie Weiss, and their two children, Hannah and Ari Weiss from St Petersburg, Florida; and Bruce and Irene Steinberg from Scarsdale, New York, and their three children, Zachary, William and Matthew. The tenth passenger was a woman whom Costa Rican authorities have identified as 33-year-old Amanda Geissler. The pilot was Juan Manuel Retana and the co-pilot was Emma Ramos, both from Costa Rica. The incident happened in a mountainous area near Bejuco in Guanacaste province. Costa Rica's President Luis Guillermo SolÃ­s confirmed the deaths in a statement published online, saying his government ""deeply regrets"" the fatalities. His predecessor, former President Laura Chinchilla, tweeted that one of the crew members, Juan Manuel Retana, was her cousin. ""A death has interrupted our family celebration. Our beloved cousin died as part of the crew of the plane that crashed in Guanacaste. Courage to his children and siblings and may he rest in peace. You will stay in our hearts dear #Juanmanuel Retana"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two more Iranians die as protests go on,"This video can not be played Footage shows improvised roadblocks and street fires Ten people have been killed overnight in anti-government protests sweeping Iran, according to state TV. ""In the events of last night, unfortunately a total of about 10 people were killed in several cities,"" it said. At least 12 people have now died since protests began on Thursday. On Monday, President Hassan Rouhani said the protests and criticism were an opportunity, not a threat. He said the country should work together to fix its economic problems. He said: ""Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and people's wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution."" Mr Rouhani had previously said that citizens were free to protest, but not violently. US President Donald Trump continued his war of words with Iran's leaders on Monday, posting a tweet saying the ""great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food and freedom"". Six of those killed died after shots were fired in the western town of Tuyserkan, 300km (185 miles) south-west of Tehran. An official in the south-western town of Izeh said two people had died there. The other two people were reportedly killed in clashes in Dorud in Lorestan province. Police also used tear gas and water cannon overnight to quell a rally in Tehran's Engheleb Square. Demonstrations were also reported in Kermanshah and Khorramabad in the west, Shahinshahr in the north-west and in the northern city of Zanjan. This video can not be played Video from the town of Dorud shows a crowd carrying what appears to be a wounded man State TV said armed protesters had tried to take over some police stations and military bases, but faced serious resistance from security forces. The demonstrations, which erupted on Thursday in Iran's second city of Mashhad, are the biggest show of dissent seen since the huge rallies of the Green Movement were brutally suppressed in 2009. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli-Larijani called for a crackdown on ""rioters"" and ""vandals"" on Monday, according to state television. ""Some individuals are exploiting the situation. This is wrong,"" he said. US warns Iran: The world is watching Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs Who is Hassan Rouhani? Mr Rouhani has acknowledged popular grievances, though he warned that the government would show ""no tolerance for those who damage public properties, violate public order and create unrest in the society"". On Monday he said on Twitter that the government needed to pay attention to people's demands on livelihood issues and corruption. Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) warned anti-government protesters would face the nation's ""iron fist"" if political unrest continued. The IRGC is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. Correspondents say it would be a significant escalation were they to become officially involved in policing the protests. Up to 400 people are reported to have been arrested in recent days, including 200 in Tehran on Saturday night. And authorities continue to sporadically suspend social media websites they fear will be used to organise protests, including Telegram and Instagram. State media have now begun broadcasting some footage on the protests, though focuses on young men attacking banks and vehicles or burning the Iranian flag, reported AFP news agency. On Sunday police used water cannon to disperse protesters at a major intersection, as captured in a video obtained by BBC Persian. Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian There is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. Protests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime. They have spread to small towns throughout the country and have the potential to grow in size. But there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. Some protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else. BBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities. Mr Rouhani described the US president as an ""enemy of the Iranian nation from the top of his head to his very toes"". He said the ""man who today in America wants to sympathise with our people has forgotten that a few months ago he called the nation of Iran terrorist"". Mr Trump has sent various tweets criticising Iran's leaders since the protests began. He said Iranians were ""finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism"". His tweet on Monday said in capital letters ""TIME FOR CHANGE!""

UK boss and family killed in seaplane crash,"Richard Cousins was known at work for his humanity and no-nonsense style, the company chairman said Tributes have been paid to the UK family killed in a seaplane crash near Sydney on New Year's Eve. Colleagues of Richard Cousins, 58, chief executive of one of the world's largest catering companies, Compass Group, described his ""great humanity"". He died alongside his fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, 48, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, and his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, a campaigner. Australian pilot Gareth Morgan, who also died, was known as ""a gentle guy"". All six died when the seaplane - which belonged to a firm running sightseeing tours - plunged into a river 30 miles (50km) north of Sydney. The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were reportedly flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay on New Year's Eve. The crash happened in Hawkesbury River, near the suburb of Cowan, at about 15:10 local time (04:10 GMT) on Sunday, police said. The cause is not yet known and investigators say it could be many months before they can piece together events. Emma and Heather Bowden were on holiday in Australia when the crash happened William Cousins was head of press for campaign group Open Britain Ed Cousins studied at the University of St Andrews Richard Cousins had been chief executive of the FTSE 100 firm Compass Group in Surrey since 2006 - and had been due to retire in September. Compass chairman Paul Walsh said the firm was ""deeply shocked and saddened"". ""It has been a great privilege to know Richard personally and to work with him for the last few years,"" he said. ""Richard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain's leading companies."" Mr Cousins, a huge cricket fan, was a regular visitor to the Kia Oval in Kennington. His son, William Cousins, was head of press for Open Britain, which campaigns against a hard Brexit. The group's chairman Roland Rudd said he was ""an extraordinary young man who took deep pride in his work"" and would be ""missed beyond words"". Labour MP Chuka Umunna described William as ""an absolute pleasure to work with, utterly dedicated to the cause, dynamic and full of enthusiasm"". ""He went about things with great heart and humour,"" he added. Fellow Labour MP Chris Leslie tweeted that William was an ""exceptionally talented head of press"" who would be deeply missed. Arts editor Ms Bowden, who worked at OK! magazine for 15 years, was the ""Grace Kelly"" of the office, according to former editor-in-chief Lisa Byrne. She was regal, serene, well-educated and could stay calm under pressure, she said. Family friend Jan Gleeson said Ms Bowden was ""a beautiful and positive person"" who ""spread light and happiness among her friends and family"". Her daughter Heather, who was a great friend to Ms Gleeson's son, was ""funny, lovely and always a pleasure to be with"", she said. ""Richard was a lovely, lovely man and together they were all finding the happiness she had so long deserved,"" she added. Edward Cousins had recently graduated from St Andrews University, where he was president of the university's Mixed Martial Arts Club. Friend Alex Brinkman said on Facebook that Ed's ""sense of humour and bright personality"" made training that much better, and he ""embodied what it meant to be a martial artist"". Pilot Gareth Morgan was described as ""a gentle guy"" The single-engine aircraft belonged to sightseeing flight company Sydney Seaplanes, which offers scenic flights over local tourist attractions. Aaron Shaw, chief executive of the firm, described Mr Morgan, the pilot, as a ""gentle guy"". ""Ringing his parents today was one of the worst calls I've had to make in my life,"" he said. He added that all flights had been suspended. This video can not be played Police divers attended the scene of the crash Investigators are trying to establish the sequence of events that led to the accident The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said the sequence of events leading up to the accident was not yet understood. Eyewitnesses said the aircraft turned sharply to the right shortly after taking off. The plane then crashed into the river and sank rapidly, ATSB said. One eyewitness told a radio station he had watched from a houseboat as the plane nosedived. He said he had dived in and tried unsuccessfully to open the fuselage door because the plane was sinking so quickly. Police divers were flown to the scene and all six bodies were recovered on Sunday evening. The UK Foreign Office said consular officials were in contact with local authorities and staff were ""ready to provide consular assistance"".

Germany to enforce hate speech law,"Facebook is one of the social media companies affected by NetzDG Germany is set to start enforcing a law that demands social media sites move quickly to remove hate speech, fake news and illegal material. Sites that do not remove ""obviously illegal"" posts could face fines of up to 50m euro (Â£44.3m). The law gives the networks 24 hours to act after they have been told about law-breaking material. Social networks and media sites with more than two million members will fall under the law's provisions. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube will be the law's main focus but it is also likely to be applied to Reddit, Tumblr and Russian social network VK. Other sites such as Vimeo and Flickr could also be caught up in its provisions. The Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (NetzDG) law was passed at the end of June 2017 and came into force in early October. The social networks were given until the end of 2017 to prepare themselves for the arrival of NetzDG. The call to police social media sites more effectively arose after several high-profile cases in which fake news and racist material was being spread via the German arms of prominent social media firms. Germany's justice ministry said it would make forms available on its site, which concerned citizens could use to report content that violates NetzDG or has not been taken down in time. As well as forcing social media firms to act quickly, NetzDG requires them to put in place a comprehensive complaints structure so that posts can quickly be reported to staff. Twitter recently updated the guidelines it follows when tackling hate speech Most material will have to be removed within 24 hours but networks will have a week to act on ""complex cases"". Facebook has reportedly recruited several hundred staff in Germany to deal with reports about content that breaks the NetzDG and to do a better job of monitoring what people post. The law has been controversial in Germany with some saying it could lead to inadvertent censorship or curtail free speech. The German law is the most extreme example of efforts by governments and regulators to rein in social media firms. Many of them have come under much greater scrutiny this year as information about how they are used to spread propaganda and other sensitive material has come to light. In the UK, politicians have been sharply critical of social sites, calling them a ""disgrace"" and saying they were ""shamefully far"" from doing a good job of policing hate speech and other offensive content. The European Commission also published guidelines calling on social media sites to act faster to spot and remove hateful content.

China enters 2018 with ivory ban in force,"An estimated 30,000 African elephants are killed by poachers every year China has long been one of the world's biggest markets for ivory, but as of 2018 all trade in ivory and ivory products in the country is illegal. The move is being hailed as a major development in efforts to protect the world's elephant population. Wildlife campaigners believe 30,000 African elephants are killed by poachers every year. State media said there had already been a 65% decline in the price of raw ivory over the past year. There had also been an 80% decline in seizures of ivory entering China, said Xinhua. The ban was announced last yearand came into effect on Sunday, the last day of 2017. This video can not be played The facts and figures behind China's ivory trade Sixty-seven official factories and shops dealing in ivory had already been closed by March 2017, said Xinhua, and the remaining 105 were to have shut down by Sunday. ""From now on, if a merchant tells you 'this is a state-approved ivory dealer'... he is duping you and knowingly violating the law,"" the forestry ministry said on its Weibo microblog. Xinhua said ""one of the largest ever public awareness campaigns"" had been carried out in the run-up to the ban, with support from celebrities including superstar basketball player Yao Ming. The war on elephants Can China's ivory trade ban save elephants? The country that brought its elephants back from the brink Laos is 'fastest growing' ivory market The World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) said it was ""delighted to see the doors of the world's largest ivory market close"". ""This is a significant step that should prove to be a huge boost to elephant protection efforts in Africa,""said WWF's Africa director Fred Kumah in a blog post.,external Celebrities including basketball player Yao Ming have fronted anti-ivory campaigns in China ""However as the world commends China's leadership in a region rife with illegal wildlife trade, I can't help but be reminded of the enormity of the task that lies ahead, both in China and Africa."" Mr Kumah said while there was a lot of public support for the ban in China, there was still a lack of awareness that it had come in to force, and he urged continuing education. WildAid CEO Peter Knights said this was ""the greatest single step toward reducing elephant poaching"". ""We can start 2018 hopeful that elephants will be safer now that China has banned commercial ivory sales,"" he said.,external China says there is general public support for a ban on ivory trading However, there is concern that Hong Kong is not covered by the new laws. It is a major ivory trading hub, with most customers believed to be mainland Chinese. The territory is in the process of bringing in its own total ban. China had already banned sales of ivory acquired after 1975, under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). But critics have long said allowing other ivory products to be sold openly drives up demand for the status symbol and allows illegal trade to flourish. The international trade in ivory was banned in 1990. Can China's ivory trade ban save elephants?

Tourists die in Costa Rica plane crash,"The crash happened in a mountainous area Twelve people have been killed in a plane crash in western Costa Rica, officials say. Ten of the victims were US citizens, along with the Costa Rican pilot and co-pilot. Local media said five victims came from a single family. The Nature Air single-propeller Cessna 208 Caravan was travelling from the capital San JosÃ© to the resort of Punta Islita, the CRhoy website reported. There were no survivors. It was unclear what caused the crash. On board the plane were two families from the US: Mitchell Weiss, his wife, Leslie Weiss, and their two children, Hannah and Ari Weiss from St Petersburg, Florida; and Bruce and Irene Steinberg from Scarsdale, New York, and their three children, Zachary, William and Matthew. The tenth passenger was a woman whom Costa Rican authorities have identified as 33-year-old Amanda Geissler. The pilot was Juan Manuel Retana and the co-pilot was Emma Ramos, both from Costa Rica. The incident happened in a mountainous area near Bejuco in Guanacaste province. Costa Rica's President Luis Guillermo SolÃ­s confirmed the deaths in a statement published online, saying his government ""deeply regrets"" the fatalities. His predecessor, former President Laura Chinchilla, tweeted that one of the crew members, Juan Manuel Retana, was her cousin. ""A death has interrupted our family celebration. Our beloved cousin died as part of the crew of the plane that crashed in Guanacaste. Courage to his children and siblings and may he rest in peace. You will stay in our hearts dear #Juanmanuel Retana"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
