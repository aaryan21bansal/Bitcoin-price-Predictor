Three dead amid Australia's massive bushfires,"The fires have driven thousands of people out of their homes At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by a weekend of bushfires in Australia. On Sunday, the fire emergency's third day, more than 100 blazes were still burning across New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the military could be called upon to support the 1,300 firefighters working in the two states. Hundreds of civilians have also volunteered to help in affected areas. Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' ""My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families,"" Mr Morrison added. Officials warn that extreme weather conditions could fuel more fires in the week, including near Sydney. In Queensland, thousands of people spent the night in evacuation centres while officials assessed whether it was safe for them to return home. Fire officials in NSW have confirmed that more than 150 homes have been destroyed. Although cooler weather on Saturday night provided some reprieve, it is feared that high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds forecast from the middle of the week will fuel further fires that officials will be unable to contain. Officials say they are likely to issue extreme fire warnings for large swathes of the NSW coast on Tuesday, with areas around Sydney thought to be particularly at risk. This video can not be played ""Unprecedented"" bushfires turn skies orange ""Under these conditions, these fires will spread quickly and threaten homes and lives,"" NSW Rural Fire Service said in a statement. ""These conditions will be as bad, if not worse, than those experienced on Friday as they will be across a much broader area including large population centres like Sydney."" While clearing affected areas on Friday, fire crews discovered the body of one victim in a burned out car near Glen Innes, about 550km (340 miles) north of Sydney. In the same town on the same day, a woman was found suffering from severe burns. She was rushed to hospital but died shortly afterwards. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, said on Sunday that the town's residents were traumatised. ""The fire was as high as 20 foot [6m] and raging with 80 kilometres per hour [50 mph] winds,"" she told Australian broadcaster ABC. ""It was absolutely horrific for the people that were impacted."" About 1,000 firefighters have been tackling the blazes across New South Wales Water-bombing helicopters have been deployed to the site of the fires On Saturday, NSW police confirmed that a third person had died after a body was found in a burnt-out home near Taree, a town about 300km north of Sydney. Police said the home belonged to a woman aged 63, but that they wouldn't be able to confirm their identity until a post-mortem had been carried out. In NSW, the worst-hit state, crews have fought hundreds of fires since last month, when two people died while trying to protect their home. Earlier this month, a blaze burned though 2,000 hectares of bush which contained a koala sanctuary.Hundreds of the animals were feared to have died. Rains lashed NSW earlier this week, providing much relief to farmers. But the storms were not nearly enough to end the long-running drought. Authorities in the state warn that many fires will continue to burn unless there is more rain. ""We just cannot overstate the profound impact that the drought is having on fire behaviour,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Farmers - Australia's 'unlikely' climate activists Living with the strain of a devastating drought Water-bombing aircraft are often flying long distances because of the difficulty of accessing water in dry areas. In some cases authorities have drilled bores to keep up with demand. ""We've very mindful of the scarcity of water and how precious it is, but the reality is we can't do firefighting without water,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Strong northerly winds shrouded Sydney in smoke from the bushfires The haze obscured the city's most famous landmarks Australia's fire season risks growing longer and more intense due to climate change, according to scientists. Authorities said they were concerned about the severity of the fires ahead of its hottest months, a year afterthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record. This video can not be played Why Australia bushfires are now ""hotter and more intense"" Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively. The bureau'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Even if global temperatures are contained to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels - a limit set out in the landmark Paris accord, agreed by 188 nations in 2015 -scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal. Last year,a UN report said Australia was falling short in efforts to cut its CO2 emissions. Have you been affected by the bushfires? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

UK's credit rating 'could be downgraded',"The UK's credit rating could be downgraded, according to ratings agency Moody's, which says Brexit has caused ""paralysis in policy-making"". It has changed the outlook on the UK's current rating - which is a marker of how likely it is to pay back its debts - from ""stable"" to ""negative"". Moody's also criticised the general election promises to raise spending with ""no clear plan"" to finance it. The UK is currently rated Aa2 - the third highest grade. Credit ratings agencies grade countries and institutions by their credit-worthiness. That in turn can affect the amount that it costs countries to borrow money. Moody'sstripped Britain of its top-notch AAArating in 2013, beforedowngrading it again in 2017. All the major political parties havecommitted to ramping up borrowingas part of their general election campaigning. They have said this is to take advantage of low interest rates. Moody's change in outlook suggests this could alter in the future. Jane Sydenham, from Rathbone Investment Management, said: ""The vast spending plans announced this week make the UK look a higher risk prospect from an international debt investors point of view."" Moody's said its concern was that the UK's debt level could rise as a result. ""In the current political climate, Moody's sees no meaningful pressure for debt-reducing fiscal policies,"" it said. Jane Foley, from Rabobank, said to borrow more - without increasing debt levels - you need to see economic growth which is ""a big ask when global growth is slowing and when UK investment has been chased away by political uncertainty"". By BBC business reporter Katie Prescott Following the financial crisis the credit ratings agencies were discredited for giving gold-plated ratings to companies that later collapsed. The last time that the UK's rating was downgraded, in 2017, there was little impact on borrowing costs. We are still in the ""A"" band of countries, even if no longer on a par with Germany. So for some in the City, these reports can be easily dismissed. ""It just tells us stuff we already know,"" one investor told me. But the language and timing of this (long-scheduled) report are sobering, coming as it has when politicians are looking to splash out, making big promises about the future of the UK's public services. It ends by saying a downgrade would happen if policy-makers don't have a credible strategy to cut debt. And cutting debt doesn't seem to be on anyone's manifesto. The Moody's report said ""deep divisions within society and the political landscape"" underpin its decision because they are reducing the UK's ability to make policy decisions. It said even if a deal was struck with the European Union over Brexit, that uncertainty over the future of trade is unlikely to diminish. However, the agency said it has decided to hold the UK's current rating because it still saw positives in the economy such as a broad range of economic activity, a sound monetary policy framework and a highly flexible labour market. The Conservative Party said: ""This election is about ending paralysis in Parliament and delivering certainty on Brexit, and our commitment to produce a robust, costed manifesto."" The Labour Party said the biggest dangers to the UK economy were the Conservative Party's ""Brexit deal and stubborn refusal to prepare for the climate emergency"".

Indian top court gives Ayodhya holy site to Hindus,"This video can not be played The BBC's Vikas Pandey explains the historic Supreme Court verdict in Ayodhya holy site dispute The disputed holy site of Ayodhya in northern India should be given to Hindus who want a temple built there, the country's Supreme Court has ruled. The case, which has been bitterly contested for decades by Hindus and Muslims, centres on the ownership of the land in Uttar Pradesh state. Muslims would get another plot of land to construct a mosque, the court said. Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram. Muslims say they have worshipped there for generations. Ayodhya verdict: The man who represented a Hindu God The complex history of India's Ayodhya holy site At the centre of the row is the 16th Century Babri mosque which was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people. In the unanimous verdict, the court said that a report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) provided evidence that the remains of a building ""that was not Islamic"" was beneath the structure of the demolished Babri mosque. The court said that, given all the evidence presented, it had determined that the disputed land should be given to Hindus for a temple to Lord Ram, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque. It then directed the federal government to set up a trust to manage and oversee the construction of the temple. However, the court added that the demolition of the Babri mosque was against the rule of law. Despite warnings by authorities not to celebrate the verdict, BBC correspondents in court say they heard chants of ""Jai Shree Ram"" (Hail Lord Ram) outside as the judgement was pronounced. ""It's a very balanced judgement and it is a victory for people of India,"" a lawyer for one of the Hindu parties told reporters soon after. Initially, a representative for the Muslim litigants said they were not satisfied and would decide whether to ask for a review after they had read the whole judgement. However, the main group of litigants has now said that it will not appeal against the verdict. Outside the court, the situation has been largely calm. Hundreds of people were detained in Ayodhya on Friday ahead of the verdict, amid fears of violence. Thousands of police officers have also been deployed in the city, while shops and colleges have been shut until Monday. The government issued an order banning the publication of images of the destruction of the Babri mosque. Social media platforms are being monitored for inflammatory content, with police even replying to tweets and asking users to delete them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacted to the verdict on Twitter and said that it should not be seen as a ""win or loss for anybody"". Allow Twitter content?

What was arguably one of the world's most contentious property dispute has finally come to an end. The dispute over the plot has polarised, frustrated and exhausted India. The reason is that this is not a humdrum civil matter. It was touched by faith (Hindus believe the plot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, a revered deity) violence (the demolition of the mosque in 1992) and subterfuge (idols of Lord Ram were placed in the mosque surreptitiously in 1949). Saturday's unanimous judgement by the five most senior judges of the court will hopefully lead to some reconciliation that the country badly needs. The verdict showed ""judicial craftsmanship and statesmanship where the letter of the law was adhered to, but the relief was moulded, taking into account the ground realities,"" lawyer Sanjay Hegde told me. The judges appear to have gone by the evidence laid before it. ""They have applied a plaster. Let's not reopen the wounds,"" Mr Hegde added. Will the verdict lead to a closure of past animosities and help close India's deepening religious fissures? Only time will tell. For the moment, India's main communities need to avoid triumphalism - because eventually there are no victors and vanquished, in what is essentially a contestation of faith. Many Hindus believe the Babri Masjid was actually constructed on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders in the 16th Century. Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols. The two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site. Since then, there have been calls to build a temple on the spot where the mosque once stood. Hinduism is India's majority religion and is thought to be more than 4,000 years old. India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century. Ever since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP first came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions. The call for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya has grown particularly loud, and has mostly come from MPs, ministers and leaders from the BJP since it took office. Restrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by the majority Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of a number of people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle. An uninhibited display of muscular Hindu nationalism in other areas has also contributed to religious tension. Most recently, the country's home minister Amit Shah said he would remove ""illegal migrants"" - understood to be Muslim - from the country through a government scheme that was used recently in the north-eastern state of Assam.

Conservatives pledge to boost GP numbers,"The Tories say they will deliver 6,000 more doctors in general practice in England by 2024-25 to increase patient appointments, if they win the election. They claim they will reach that target through additional doctors working and training in surgeries, international recruitment and better retention. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a previous Tory pledge to recruit 5,000 GPs by 2020 had not been met. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS."" He said despite theConservatives' previous promise of more general practitioners made in 2015, GP numbers have declined. Labour has said it wants to expand GP training places from 3,500 to 5,000 a year to ease the burden on GPs. A really simple guide to the election,external The clock is ticking: How to register to vote What's the price tag on an election? The Conservatives say their plan would see the current tally of 3,538 GPs in training every year rise by about 500 each year over the next four years. And recruiting more GPs from overseas while improving efforts to retain current staff would lead to a total of 6,000 more doctors than there are now, they claim. But it is not yet clear how this will be achieved. In 2015, the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, pledged to have 5,000 more GPs working in the NHS in England by 2020. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock acknowledgedGP numbers had in fact decreased since 2015. He said: ""It's true the number of GPs was falling when I became health secretary [in July 2018]. ""The numbers are now rising but I want them to go much further."" Previously the Department of Health said one of the challenges it faces in growing GP numbers is airise in those taking early retirement and part-time working. Richard Murray, chief executive of health think tank the Kings Fund, said the announcement only goes part of the way to solving this ""vicious cycle"" of hiring and retention. ""The outflow from General Practice is the problem the government's facing. ""They're not succeeding in retaining, particularly older GPs, and younger GPs wanting to work part-time."" The party has also promised to recruit 6,000 more NHS nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists to work in surgeries. And it plans to modernise systems for booking appointments and ensure all patients have the choice of a consultation on the phone, on Skype or online. With more than 300 million appointments every year in England, the Conservatives forecast 15% more being created as a result of these plans. The party said it plans to invest Â£2.5bn in the project over four years in addition to the Â£20.5bn of extra NHS funding pledged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Dr Richard Vautrey, from the British Medical Association, said: ""We wait with some trepidation to see if this latest promise can deliver. ""The lack of detail as to exactly how all these promises will be made good, particularly with no firm commitment for full reform of the ridiculous pension taxation system, means it remains to be seen whether these long overdue and very necessary improvements will be achieved."" This video can not be played ""You can't get an appointment"" - patients and staff at one GPs' practice Waiting times for a GP appointment have become the national conversation - the words of the chair of the Royal College of GPs. Doctors say they are working flat out but are struggling to keep up with rising patient demand and filling vacant posts in general practice is increasingly difficult. So how much difference will the Conservative plans make if they are re-elected? Funding extra training places will result in more doctors going into general practice. But half the 6,000 additional doctors promised by 2024 are assumed to come from international recruitment and better retention of existing staff, neither of which has been easy in recent years. Some GPs have retired early because of tax bills associated with their pensions, an issue which has not yet been fully resolved. Achieving that 6,000 total looks a big ask. As the government discovered, setting a target of 5,000 by 2020 was one thing, but achieving it another matter altogether. The announcement comes afterthe party promised to make it easier for doctors and nurses from abroad to work in the UK after Brexit, by creating an NHS visa. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government recognised GPs were under increasing pressure and require funding ""to help everyone get the care they need"". He said extra appointments in GP surgeries would be created ""with the sort of easy online booking that we expect in other areas of our lives"". Have waits for GP appointments got longer? More patients 'struggling to reach GP on phone' Missed GP appointments 'cost NHS Â£216m' Speaking at the Labour party conference, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""You can't trust the Tories with our NHS. ""They always make election promises which they fail to deliver on. ""Tory ministers promised us 5,000 extra GPs but in fact we have lost 1,600 GPs under the Tories."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said GPs were working flat out to try to keep up with rising demand while there was a shortage of doctors and other staff. She said urgent action was needed to support GPs ""grappling with unmanageable workloads"", adding that they go above and beyond for patients, often to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing.

Opposition parties pledge extra childcare support,"Both Labour and the Lib Dems have pledged extra money to support the parents of young children. Labour vowed to spend Â£1bn on opening 1,000 new early years centres in England, saying they would get parents back to work and help children achieve. The Lib Dems are promising working families subsidised care for children from the age of nine months. Lib Dem education spokesperson Layla Moran said the Â£14.6bn policy was ""an investment in the country's future"". The Conservatives say they are already ""investing record amounts in high-quality childcare"". Childcare providers have expressed scepticism at the lack of funding details and warned of an ""electoral arms race"" on childcare promises. Children's centre closures 'as high as 1,000' Sure Start 'big benefits' but face closure Your 30-hour free childcare questions On a visit to Leeds with shadow Labour education secretary Angela Rayner, Mr Corbyn will promise to open a new generation of Sure Start centres, which provide health, welfare and education services for pre-school children. Ms Rayner said she was proud of the policy, since she went to a Sure Start centre when she had her son at the age of 16 that she said taught her to ""love and nurture and read to my child"". ""My mum couldn't read or write and didn't know that cuddling and giving love to your child is really important,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Sure Start really changed the life chances for my children and I'll be forever grateful for that."" Labour's Angela Rayner said she benefitted from a Sure Start centre Asked whether all parents, regardless of income, should be offered help from Sure Start centres, she said they were about more than a household's financial situation. ""I'm talking about not having the basic understanding of how to nurture a young child and any parent can be put in that situation."" She said the UK could afford to invest more in support for young children. ""We can't afford not to do it because we know that anything we try to do after the early years is playing catch up,"" she said. Giving parents more free childcare would help them back to work and support the economy, she added. According to a report from the Sutton Trust last year, up to 1,000 Sure Start centres have closed in the past decade, with funding pressures being blamed. Labour says it will ""reverse the cuts"" in the centres which were originally launched when Tony Blair was prime minister. An analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies earlier this year said Sure Start had made a positive impact, with evidence that the health advice had ""significantly reduced"" the numbers of children being admitted to hospital. But the financial think tank said it had been a story of a ""fast roll-out followed by deep spending cuts"", with spending peaking at Â£1.8bn in 2010 and then being cut to Â£600m by 2017-18. The IFS puts the number of closures at about 500 sites - half the Sutton Trust estimate. Labour has also restated its commitment to providing 30 hours-a-week of childcare for all two-to-four-year-olds, as part of its overall Â£4.5bn childcare package. Mr Corbyn said opening a Sure Start centre in ""every community"" would ""unlock the potential of every child"". He said: ""Parents are struggling to afford the childcare support they need, while many children are going hungry and growing up homeless."" The Liberal Democrats are unveiling their own childcare plans - offering 35 hours a week of care for all parents of two-to-four-year-olds. This would be available for working parents from when their children are nine months old. The Lib Dems say this will be funded by ""fair tax changes"", which they say means ""making sure that big businesses pay their share"". The party's education spokesperson said investing in childcare was ""an investment in the country's future"". ""It doesn't just help in terms of high early years provision making school children school ready, but also in closing that gender pay gap, which is incredibly important."" Ms Moran told the Today programme the total cost of the policy was Â£14.6bn, which was ""fully costed"" as part of her party's manifesto. ""It's going to be an expensive policy we've been very upfront about that,"" she said. ""The true cost to child care providers of doing this is more than has been provided."" Layla Moran said providing extra funding for childcare was ""an investment in the country's future"" At present working parents of three- and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 30 hours' free childcare a week - and the Conservatives say they have increased the funding and quality of childcare provision while in government. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed Labour's promise for new Sure Start centres. But he raised concerns about funding the promises - and whether there would be adequate levels of payments for nurseries and childcare providers. ""This is a positive policy for the thousands of parents struggling to afford childcare - but the lack of detail on how it will be funded will strike fear into the hearts of many providers. ""We currently have a funding shortfall in the early years of two-thirds of a billion pounds. That shortfall, which has led to thousands of provider closures, is a direct result of an ongoing electoral arms race between political parties to entice parents with 'free childcare' without thinking through how it will be paid for. ""It has meant that very few parents receive truly 'free' childcare and has ultimately pushed up prices for non-funded hours."" A really simple guide What's the price tag on an election?

Tory peer accuses Hancock of 'whitesplaining',"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been accused of ""whitesplaining"" by Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi after he said others in the party took a ""more balanced approach"" on Islamophobia than her. Baroness Warsi has repeatedly criticised the party's response to Islamophobia in its own ranks. On Friday, Boris Johnson appeared to rule out an independent inquiry specifically into Islamophobia. He said the party would hold a ""general investigation into prejudice"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Mr Hancock said the Tories needed to hold an inquiry on Islamophobia within the party. But he added: ""Well look, I like Sayeeda [Warsi], she has a particular view on this. There are others who take a more balanced approach,"" he said. Asked if he was saying she was ""unbalanced"", Mr Hancock replied: ""No, I'm certainly not saying that. I have an enormous amount of respect for Sayeeda but she does take a particular view."" Baroness Warsi was the first Muslim woman to sit round the cabinet table He added: ""There needs to be an inquiry of course but, of course, you should look into all kinds of prejudice. ""I think that this is something that any responsible party always needs to be on the look-out for."" Baroness Warsi, the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister, responded with a tweet saying she was ""glad"" to have colleagues like the health secretary to educate her on the issue after working in race relations for 30 years. ""Thousand apologies sir,"" the former Tory chairwoman added. Tories 'will order Islamophobia inquiry' Government rejects Islamophobia definition Tory members suspended over Islamophobic posts The Conservative Party has come under pressure to open itself up to an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following incidents highlighted to the party and in the media. In September,a number of party members were suspendedafter the BBC highlighted more than 20 cases of Islamophobic material being posted or endorsed online. The incidents ranged from individuals ""liking"" anti-Muslim pictures or statements on one or two occasions, to regular Islamophobic posts by people who said they were members of the Conservative Party.

On one occasion, a Conservative councillor responded to a tweet in March, writing: ""Islam and slavery are partners in crime."" Speaking to Channel 4 News on Saturday evening, Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's comments suggesting a broader investigation showed the party was still not taking the issue of Islamophobia seriously. She called for him to be an ""anti-racist"" and ""take all forms of racism seriously"". ""We've quite rightly been calling out the Labour Party for the allegations of racism within their ranks... we seem to be able to take our opponents to task, and yet we singularly fail to deal with the Islamophobia and racism in our own backyard,"" she said. Asked whether she could urge her fellow British Muslims to vote Conservative, Baroness Warsi said: ""I would say that the climate for British Muslims within the Conservative Party is hostile. ""I think that the climate that has been created in the country because of the Conservative leadership is hostile for British Muslims."" In June, during a BBC debate as part of the Tory leadership contest, candidate Sajid Javid, now the chancellor, asked other candidates to agree to open up the Conservatives to an external investigation into Islamophobia within its ranks.

Bolivian police join anti-government protests,"This video can not be played Watch how police took part in Bolivia's anti-government protests on Saturday Police have joined protests in several Bolivian cities over the disputed re-election of President Evo Morales. Mr Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, accuses opponents of trying to depose him. But the country's defence minister said there were no plans to send the military to quell the police ""mutiny"". There have been 17 days of deadly protests against Mr Morales, who is accused of rigging last month's election to secure a fourth term. Mr Morales - Latin America's longest-serving leader - denies any wrongdoing and says he will not resign. Demonstrations on Friday were the first to include large numbers of police, though the scale was unclear. Initial reports indicate uniformed officers joined protesters in La Paz, Sucre, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, PotosÃ­ and Oruro. Several uniformed police officers were pictured waving flags and signs on the roofs of police stations Speaking to local media, several uniformed officers called on Mr Morales to resign, and said they would stop him from turning Bolivia into a dictatorship like his allies in Cuba and Venezuela. There were also reports of police leaving the streets of La Paz and returning to their station buildings. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide In a tweet, President Morales denounced the protests as an ""attack on the rule of law"". Defence Minister Javier Zabaleta, speaking with state television, called for calm and said he was confident police would ""continue to fulfil their constitutional job to safeguard the people"". Bolivia has been rattled by protests, strikes and road blocks since the country held a presidential election on 20 October. At least three people have died during clashes.The mayor of a small town was also attacked by protesters earlier this week, who dragged her through the streets barefoot, covered her in red paint and forcibly cut her hair. Carlos Mesa came second in the presidential race, and is calling for a re-election Tensions first flared on the night of the presidential election after the results count was inexplicably paused for 24 hours. The final result gave Mr Morales slightly more than the 10-percentage-point lead he needed to win outright in the first round of the race. The Organization of American States (OAS) is conducting an audit of the votes, and results are expected to be published next week. But Carlos Mesa - the candidate who finished second - has spoken out against the audit, saying that his party was not consulted. A former president himself, he asked Bolivia's congress on Friday to pass an emergency bill to prepare for new elections. Bolivian police protest against Morales.

"Conservatives pledge to boost GP numbersThe party says it will deliver 6,000 more GPs in England by 2025, despite missing a previous target.HealthOpposition parties pledge extra childcare supportJeremy Corbyn pledges Â£1bn to open new Sure Starts, while Lib Dems offer childcare from nine months.Family & Education","The Tories say they will deliver 6,000 more doctors in general practice in England by 2024-25 to increase patient appointments, if they win the election. They claim they will reach that target through additional doctors working and training in surgeries, international recruitment and better retention. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a previous Tory pledge to recruit 5,000 GPs by 2020 had not been met. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS."" He said despite theConservatives' previous promise of more general practitioners made in 2015, GP numbers have declined. Labour has said it wants to expand GP training places from 3,500 to 5,000 a year to ease the burden on GPs. A really simple guide to the election,external The clock is ticking: How to register to vote What's the price tag on an election? The Conservatives say their plan would see the current tally of 3,538 GPs in training every year rise by about 500 each year over the next four years. And recruiting more GPs from overseas while improving efforts to retain current staff would lead to a total of 6,000 more doctors than there are now, they claim. But it is not yet clear how this will be achieved. In 2015, the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, pledged to have 5,000 more GPs working in the NHS in England by 2020. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock acknowledgedGP numbers had in fact decreased since 2015. He said: ""It's true the number of GPs was falling when I became health secretary [in July 2018]. ""The numbers are now rising but I want them to go much further."" Previously the Department of Health said one of the challenges it faces in growing GP numbers is airise in those taking early retirement and part-time working. Richard Murray, chief executive of health think tank the Kings Fund, said the announcement only goes part of the way to solving this ""vicious cycle"" of hiring and retention. ""The outflow from General Practice is the problem the government's facing. ""They're not succeeding in retaining, particularly older GPs, and younger GPs wanting to work part-time."" The party has also promised to recruit 6,000 more NHS nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists to work in surgeries. And it plans to modernise systems for booking appointments and ensure all patients have the choice of a consultation on the phone, on Skype or online. With more than 300 million appointments every year in England, the Conservatives forecast 15% more being created as a result of these plans. The party said it plans to invest Â£2.5bn in the project over four years in addition to the Â£20.5bn of extra NHS funding pledged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Dr Richard Vautrey, from the British Medical Association, said: ""We wait with some trepidation to see if this latest promise can deliver. ""The lack of detail as to exactly how all these promises will be made good, particularly with no firm commitment for full reform of the ridiculous pension taxation system, means it remains to be seen whether these long overdue and very necessary improvements will be achieved."" This video can not be played ""You can't get an appointment"" - patients and staff at one GPs' practice Waiting times for a GP appointment have become the national conversation - the words of the chair of the Royal College of GPs. Doctors say they are working flat out but are struggling to keep up with rising patient demand and filling vacant posts in general practice is increasingly difficult. So how much difference will the Conservative plans make if they are re-elected? Funding extra training places will result in more doctors going into general practice. But half the 6,000 additional doctors promised by 2024 are assumed to come from international recruitment and better retention of existing staff, neither of which has been easy in recent years. Some GPs have retired early because of tax bills associated with their pensions, an issue which has not yet been fully resolved. Achieving that 6,000 total looks a big ask. As the government discovered, setting a target of 5,000 by 2020 was one thing, but achieving it another matter altogether. The announcement comes afterthe party promised to make it easier for doctors and nurses from abroad to work in the UK after Brexit, by creating an NHS visa. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government recognised GPs were under increasing pressure and require funding ""to help everyone get the care they need"". He said extra appointments in GP surgeries would be created ""with the sort of easy online booking that we expect in other areas of our lives"". Have waits for GP appointments got longer? More patients 'struggling to reach GP on phone' Missed GP appointments 'cost NHS Â£216m' Speaking at the Labour party conference, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""You can't trust the Tories with our NHS. ""They always make election promises which they fail to deliver on. ""Tory ministers promised us 5,000 extra GPs but in fact we have lost 1,600 GPs under the Tories."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said GPs were working flat out to try to keep up with rising demand while there was a shortage of doctors and other staff. She said urgent action was needed to support GPs ""grappling with unmanageable workloads"", adding that they go above and beyond for patients, often to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing.

"Opposition parties pledge extra childcare supportJeremy Corbyn pledges Â£1bn to open new Sure Starts, while Lib Dems offer childcare from nine months.Family & Education","Both Labour and the Lib Dems have pledged extra money to support the parents of young children. Labour vowed to spend Â£1bn on opening 1,000 new early years centres in England, saying they would get parents back to work and help children achieve. The Lib Dems are promising working families subsidised care for children from the age of nine months. Lib Dem education spokesperson Layla Moran said the Â£14.6bn policy was ""an investment in the country's future"". The Conservatives say they are already ""investing record amounts in high-quality childcare"". Childcare providers have expressed scepticism at the lack of funding details and warned of an ""electoral arms race"" on childcare promises. Children's centre closures 'as high as 1,000' Sure Start 'big benefits' but face closure Your 30-hour free childcare questions On a visit to Leeds with shadow Labour education secretary Angela Rayner, Mr Corbyn will promise to open a new generation of Sure Start centres, which provide health, welfare and education services for pre-school children. Ms Rayner said she was proud of the policy, since she went to a Sure Start centre when she had her son at the age of 16 that she said taught her to ""love and nurture and read to my child"". ""My mum couldn't read or write and didn't know that cuddling and giving love to your child is really important,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Sure Start really changed the life chances for my children and I'll be forever grateful for that."" Labour's Angela Rayner said she benefitted from a Sure Start centre Asked whether all parents, regardless of income, should be offered help from Sure Start centres, she said they were about more than a household's financial situation. ""I'm talking about not having the basic understanding of how to nurture a young child and any parent can be put in that situation."" She said the UK could afford to invest more in support for young children. ""We can't afford not to do it because we know that anything we try to do after the early years is playing catch up,"" she said. Giving parents more free childcare would help them back to work and support the economy, she added. According to a report from the Sutton Trust last year, up to 1,000 Sure Start centres have closed in the past decade, with funding pressures being blamed. Labour says it will ""reverse the cuts"" in the centres which were originally launched when Tony Blair was prime minister. An analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies earlier this year said Sure Start had made a positive impact, with evidence that the health advice had ""significantly reduced"" the numbers of children being admitted to hospital. But the financial think tank said it had been a story of a ""fast roll-out followed by deep spending cuts"", with spending peaking at Â£1.8bn in 2010 and then being cut to Â£600m by 2017-18. The IFS puts the number of closures at about 500 sites - half the Sutton Trust estimate. Labour has also restated its commitment to providing 30 hours-a-week of childcare for all two-to-four-year-olds, as part of its overall Â£4.5bn childcare package. Mr Corbyn said opening a Sure Start centre in ""every community"" would ""unlock the potential of every child"". He said: ""Parents are struggling to afford the childcare support they need, while many children are going hungry and growing up homeless."" The Liberal Democrats are unveiling their own childcare plans - offering 35 hours a week of care for all parents of two-to-four-year-olds. This would be available for working parents from when their children are nine months old. The Lib Dems say this will be funded by ""fair tax changes"", which they say means ""making sure that big businesses pay their share"". The party's education spokesperson said investing in childcare was ""an investment in the country's future"". ""It doesn't just help in terms of high early years provision making school children school ready, but also in closing that gender pay gap, which is incredibly important."" Ms Moran told the Today programme the total cost of the policy was Â£14.6bn, which was ""fully costed"" as part of her party's manifesto. ""It's going to be an expensive policy we've been very upfront about that,"" she said. ""The true cost to child care providers of doing this is more than has been provided."" Layla Moran said providing extra funding for childcare was ""an investment in the country's future"" At present working parents of three- and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 30 hours' free childcare a week - and the Conservatives say they have increased the funding and quality of childcare provision while in government. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed Labour's promise for new Sure Start centres. But he raised concerns about funding the promises - and whether there would be adequate levels of payments for nurseries and childcare providers. ""This is a positive policy for the thousands of parents struggling to afford childcare - but the lack of detail on how it will be funded will strike fear into the hearts of many providers. ""We currently have a funding shortfall in the early years of two-thirds of a billion pounds. That shortfall, which has led to thousands of provider closures, is a direct result of an ongoing electoral arms race between political parties to entice parents with 'free childcare' without thinking through how it will be paid for. ""It has meant that very few parents receive truly 'free' childcare and has ultimately pushed up prices for non-funded hours."" A really simple guide What's the price tag on an election?

Two cases of deadly diphtheria infection detected,"Diphtheria vaccination programmes protect most people in the UK Two people are being treated in Scotland for the potentially deadly diphtheria infection. NHS Lothian has confirmed the two cases are related and both patients are thought to be in hospital in Edinburgh. The health board said those involved had recently returned from overseas. Public health experts said the likelihood of any additional cases was very small, as most people were protected by immunisation given in childhood. In Lothian, 98% of children are vaccinated against diphtheria by the age of 24 months. Alison McCallum, director of public health for NHS Lothian, said:  ""All close contacts of these patients have been identified, contacted and followed up in line with nationally agreed guidelines. ""We encourage people travelling abroad to visitFit for Travel,externalwhere they can access information on how to stay safe and healthy abroad, as well as destination specific health advice."" The diphtheria infection is spread by coughs and sneezes and can prove potentially fatal Diphtheria is a highly contagious and potentially fatal infection that can affect the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin. It can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure and paralysis. The infection is spread by coughs and sneezes, or by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothes or bedding with an infected person. It is rare in the UK, because babies and children are routinely vaccinated against it. There is a small risk of catching the disease while travelling in some parts of the world.

Severe warnings remain as flood death woman named,"Annie Hall's family said: âWe are in great shock and grieving"" A woman swept to her death by a flooded river was Derbyshire's former High Sheriff Annie Hall, police have said. Her body was pulled from the River Derwent near Matlock on Friday, as persistent rain caused floods acrossYorkshire and the Midlands. Derbyshire Chief Constable Peter Goodman said he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the death of his friend. Seven severe flood warnings - deemed a threat to life - remain in place on the River Don in South Yorkshire. Flooding has caused evacuations and travel disruption, with trains still not running in parts of the East Midlands. In a statement, Mrs Hall's family said: ""We are in great shock and grieving."" This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater Services are cancelled on the Matlock-Derby-Nottingham route and diversions are in place between Derby and Chesterfield, adding about 30 minutes to journeys. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it had declared a major incident on Friday night, and said it had carried out more than 160 rescues over 24 hours. Deputy chief fire officer Alex Johnson advised people to ""keep themselves safe, help each other and don't drive into floodwater"". Residents from 12 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, are still unable to return home after a mudslide on Thursday led to 35 properties being evacuated. The River Derwent burst its banks in Derby city centre In Derby city centre, officials considered a city-wide evacuation as authorities saw the River Derwent swell to record levels of 3.35m (11ft). The bus station was temporarily evacuated on Friday evening, and some major roads remain flooded. In Worksop, Nottinghamshire, water levels are receding after 200 homes and businesses were evacuated on Thursday evening. Bassetlaw District Council said it had closed its emergency rest centre as everyone who had left their homes were with friends and relatives. The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, hit its highest recorded level at just over 6.3m (21ft), higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham People continued to be rescued from flood-hit towns and cities on Friday. One man told the BBC he carried children from his gym in Rotherham through flooded streets. ""The whole of the gym was completely flooded in water,"" said Neil Wilson. ""We had to wade through water to get children to the cars so they could get home with their parents."" In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding?

Her body was pulled from the River Derwent near Matlock on Friday, as persistent rain caused floods acrossYorkshire and the Midlands. Derbyshire Chief Constable Peter Goodman said he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the death of his friend. Seven severe flood warnings - deemed a threat to life - remain in place on the River Don in South Yorkshire. Flooding has caused evacuations and travel disruption, with trains still not running in parts of the East Midlands. In a statement, Mrs Hall's family said: ""We are in great shock and grieving."" This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater Services are cancelled on the Matlock-Derby-Nottingham route and diversions are in place between Derby and Chesterfield, adding about 30 minutes to journeys. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it had declared a major incident on Friday night, and said it had carried out more than 160 rescues over 24 hours. Deputy chief fire officer Alex Johnson advised people to ""keep themselves safe, help each other and don't drive into floodwater"". Residents from 12 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, are still unable to return home after a mudslide on Thursday led to 35 properties being evacuated. The River Derwent burst its banks in Derby city centre In Derby city centre, officials considered a city-wide evacuation as authorities saw the River Derwent swell to record levels of 3.35m (11ft). The bus station was temporarily evacuated on Friday evening, and some major roads remain flooded. In Worksop, Nottinghamshire, water levels are receding after 200 homes and businesses were evacuated on Thursday evening. Bassetlaw District Council said it had closed its emergency rest centre as everyone who had left their homes were with friends and relatives. The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, hit its highest recorded level at just over 6.3m (21ft), higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham People continued to be rescued from flood-hit towns and cities on Friday. One man told the BBC he carried children from his gym in Rotherham through flooded streets. ""The whole of the gym was completely flooded in water,"" said Neil Wilson. ""We had to wade through water to get children to the cars so they could get home with their parents."" In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding?

Reporter Richard Cadey said some residents were ""angry and frustrated"" at Doncaster Council - claiming it had not been providing sandbags early enough to prevent properties from flooding. A rest facility has been set up by the council at the Salvation Army centre in the town. Flooding has caused disruption in the region since Thursday evening,when dozens of shoppers were left stranded in the Meadowhall Shopping Centreafter torrential downpours. Sheffield has had 84mm of rain over the past 36 hours, which is the near the average monthly rainfall for Yorkshire.

He said the town could expect ""extra help from the government"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited flood-hit Conisbrough, near Doncaster, on Saturday and warned the UK could expect more extreme weather due to climate change. ""Obviously we need much better flood management and prevention schemes,"" he said.

"War veteran meets son of comrade after pleaThe 98-year-old from Aberdeen enlisted at 16 and hoped to find others with similar experiences.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","Jimmy Johnstone, left, had an emotional meeting with Sandy Petrie A former soldier aged 98 who survived World War Two and five years as a prisoner has met the son of one of his former comrades after making an appeal. Jimmy Johnstone, who lives in Aberdeen, was 16 when he enlisted in 1937. He was captured by German troops in northern France after the battle for Saint-Valery-en-Caux in 1940. After a successful public appeal in August, Mr Johnstone has now met the 73-year-old son of one of the men he tried to escape with. Sandy Petrie spoke of his father Bert Petrie, who died 10 years ago aged 86. Survivor of World War Two seeking other veterans Mr Johnstone worked with the Scottish War Blinded charity in the hope any of his fellow prisoners or their families could get in touch. The surrendered 51st Highland Division soldiers had to travel hundreds of miles to camps in Germany, via Belgium and the Netherlands. Jimmy Johnstone signed up as a teenager Mr Johnstone described meeting his comrade's son as ""very emotional"". He said: ""We talked about Bert and life in the PoW camps. I spoke about when we met. This was while we were waiting to go into the cooler (solitary) after one of my escapes. ""I told Sandy what a brave man his dad was. He stood up to the German guards and refused to work until they got more food. ""The German guard held him at gunpoint but he didn't give in and they got more food. I admired Bert for that."" Bert Petrie died 10 years ago Mr Petrie, also of Aberdeen, said: ""When I heard about the appeal on the radio, I quickly recognised it was my father being referred to and I was very, very interested to hear the story. ""They were some of the same stories my father had told me. I felt I would like to meet this chap, and to meet him for my father's sake too as I know he would have wanted to meet Jimmy."" He said his father would have been ""delighted"" about the meeting. Mr Petrie said: ""It was very touching to hear him refer to my father. He mentioned him quite emotionally. ""I have the greatest respect for Jimmy and the men and women of his generation, sadly a dwindling group. They saved our civilisation and way of life. It was a privilege to have met him."" Veteran Mr Johnstone added: ""It is really important that as we approach Remembrance Day we remember all men who fought in all battles, those that survived and those who died."" Any survivors of the events Mr Johnstone experienced, or other relatives willing to speak to him, are asked to contact the charity on0800 035 6409.

Acid attack victim tells of 'worst day of my life',"Teresa Townsley was attacked as she answered the door in Captain's Road in Edinburgh The victim of a doorstep acid attack said she has been scarred for life and rarely steps out of the house as she appealed for information one year on. Teresa Townsley, 38, had corrosive liquid thrown at her when she opened the door of her Edinburgh home to a hooded man on 9 November 2018. He is described as being in his early 20s and fled the scene in a stolen car. Ms Townsley said her burns meant it was hard to look in the mirror and urged anyone with information to call police. The attack happened on Captains Road in the south east of the city at about 20:40 while Ms Townsley was at home with her young children. Police said the attacker fled the scene in a grey Ford Fiesta She has since moved away from Edinburgh, but said in a statement on the anniversary of the attack: ""It was the worst day of my life and today is the second worst as it brings it all back. ""Fortunately I have a new partner who is being tremendously supportive and I have my kids to keep me going. ""But, day to day it is still hard, it is hard just to go out of the house, to look in the mirror. Most of the time I am confined to the house."" Ms Townsley pleaded for anyone who knows anything to come forward. She added: ""I am scarred for life and coming forward with information could prevent someone else suffering as I have. ""It may even prevent someone losing their life."" The suspect is described as being about 5ft 11in, slim and was wearing a dark tracksuit, a grey top with the hood pulled up. He was also wearing dark gloves and trainers with light reflective sections. His face was covered. The Fiesta had false number plates showing the registration number BN65 LFV The man left the scene in a stolen grey Ford Fiesta with false number plates showing the registration number BN65 LFV. The car was seen at about 21:45 travelling north in Drum Street with its lights off. It then went down Gilmerton Road, into Glenallan Drive and was driven into Inch Park where it was set on fire. Two men were seen to run off towards Glenallan Drive. Det Insp Jonathan Pleasance said: ""The attacker targeted Teresa at her front door while her young children were just a few feet away. ""This serious assault resulted in life-changing injuries and also shocked the local community. ""If you recognise the man described or saw the car, before or after the attack, please contact police immediately. ""I am confident that there are people in the Gilmerton area who have information that can assist the inquiry and I would urge them to come forward.""

The UFO sighting investigated by the police,"This video can not be played The man who said he was attacked by a UFO When forestry worker Robert Taylor reported seeing an alien spaceship in woods near Livingston 40 years ago it made headlines around the world. The Dechmont Woods incident is unusual among reported UFO sightings in that it was investigated by the police. They treated the rips to Mr Taylor's trousers as evidence of an assault but could never quite work out what had happened to him. In his testimony to the police, the 61-year-old described how he saw a 30ft-high ""dome-shaped"" object in a clearing in the forest near the West Lothian new town on 9 November 1979. He told how two-spiked spheres then rolled out towards him and, as he passed out, he was aware of being grabbed on either side of his legs. Mr Taylor woke up in a dishevelled state 20 minutes later. An artist's impression was drawn of the craft Mr Taylor described Mr Taylor, who died in 2007, was a respected war hero and teetotal churchgoer. No-one doubted that he was sincere in what he believed he had seen and throughout the rest of his life he never deviated from his story. He told the police he had been working alone checking fences and gates at Dechmont Woods at 10:30 when he came across the spaceship in a clearing. Robert Taylor gives a talk to members of the British UFO Society in Dechmont Woods After the spiked objects rushed out and tried to grab hold of him, all he could remember was a strong smell of burning. When he came to, the clearing was empty, apart from a pattern of deep regular marks on the ground. He went to his van but was so shaken he drove it into a ditch and had to stagger home in ""a dazed condition"". When he got to his house he told his wife Mary he had been attacked by a ""spaceship thing"". Because Mr Taylor was in such a state, the police were called and officers found themselves inquiring into an assault on a forester by alien beings. Det Con Ian Wark, the scene of crime investigator, arrived at the clearing to find a large gathering of police officers were already there. He told the BBC he saw strange marks on the ground. There were about 32 holes, which were about 3.5 inches in diameter, as well as marks similar to those made by the type of caterpillar tracks often fitted on bulldozers. The officer went to Mr Taylor's employer, Livingston Development Corporation, to see if the machinery they had could solve the mystery. ""After examining every piece of machinery they had up there, we did not find anything to match,"" he said. The police officer said that the unusual marks on the ground were only to be found in the clearing where Mr Taylor had experienced his reported close encounter. ""These marks just arrived,"" Det Con Wark said. ""They did not come from anywhere or go anywhere. They just arrived as though a helicopter or something had landed from the sky."" The police report from the time said the marks on the ground indicated an ""object of several tons had stood there but there was nothing to show that it had been driven or towed away"". PC William Douglas wrote: ""There appeared to be no rational explanation for these marks."" There is now a UFO trail to the site of the Dechmont incident As part of the police investigation, Mr Taylor's ripped trousers were sent for forensic examination but this was many years before modern DNA techniques so analysis concentrated on how the damage had been done. Police forensics said the trousers seemed to have been damaged by something hooking them and moving up. The trousers are now in the possession of Malcolm Robinson, a Ufologist who has been investigating such cases since the Dechmont incident. He said they were police-issue blue serge trousers and the type of rips in them did not happen by getting snagged as Mr Taylor crawled away on the ground. Mr Robinson, who has given lectures on the incident across the UK, Holland, France and the USA and written a book on the subject, said it was one of the most incredible cases in the world. He said it was one of very few hardcore cases that defied any explanation. There are many theories about what actually happened to Mr Taylor. These include everything from hallucinatory berries to blackball lightning and a mirage of the planet Venus. A medical explanation could lie in an epileptic seizure being suffered by Mr Taylor but there was no evidence of this gathered at the time. In her police statement, his wife Mary said Mr Taylor had no history of mental illness but had contracted meningitis 14 years earlier. Mr Taylor continued to stick to his story throughout his life She said the treatment was successful although in July of that year he had suffered a series of headaches and was admitted to the City Hospital in Edinburgh. In his statement, Mr Taylor said that after the UFO incident he was examined by the local doctor who called at his house. The doctor suggested he should go to nearby Bangour Hospital for a check-up and x-ray. After waiting for two hours at the hospital he got fed up and left without being examined. Det Con Wark said he could go along with the theory about the epileptic fit. ""But what about the marks on the ground?"" he said. The former police officer cannot bring himself to say he believes Mr Taylor saw an alien spaceship. ""I'd have to see it myself to believe it,"" he said. But he said he interviewed Mr Taylor three times and he never changed his story. ""He believed what he saw and there was no way he would make that up,"" Det Con Wark said. Forty years on the Dechmont incident has passed into legend. Last year a UFO trail opened which takes people to the spot where a new town forestry foreman claims he saw an alien spaceship.

"Conservatives pledge to boost GP numbersThe party says it will deliver 6,000 more GPs in England by 2025, despite missing a previous target.Health","The Tories say they will deliver 6,000 more doctors in general practice in England by 2024-25 to increase patient appointments, if they win the election. They claim they will reach that target through additional doctors working and training in surgeries, international recruitment and better retention. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a previous Tory pledge to recruit 5,000 GPs by 2020 had not been met. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS."" He said despite theConservatives' previous promise of more general practitioners made in 2015, GP numbers have declined. Labour has said it wants to expand GP training places from 3,500 to 5,000 a year to ease the burden on GPs. A really simple guide to the election,external The clock is ticking: How to register to vote What's the price tag on an election? The Conservatives say their plan would see the current tally of 3,538 GPs in training every year rise by about 500 each year over the next four years. And recruiting more GPs from overseas while improving efforts to retain current staff would lead to a total of 6,000 more doctors than there are now, they claim. But it is not yet clear how this will be achieved. In 2015, the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, pledged to have 5,000 more GPs working in the NHS in England by 2020. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock acknowledgedGP numbers had in fact decreased since 2015. He said: ""It's true the number of GPs was falling when I became health secretary [in July 2018]. ""The numbers are now rising but I want them to go much further."" Previously the Department of Health said one of the challenges it faces in growing GP numbers is airise in those taking early retirement and part-time working. Richard Murray, chief executive of health think tank the Kings Fund, said the announcement only goes part of the way to solving this ""vicious cycle"" of hiring and retention. ""The outflow from General Practice is the problem the government's facing. ""They're not succeeding in retaining, particularly older GPs, and younger GPs wanting to work part-time."" The party has also promised to recruit 6,000 more NHS nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists to work in surgeries. And it plans to modernise systems for booking appointments and ensure all patients have the choice of a consultation on the phone, on Skype or online. With more than 300 million appointments every year in England, the Conservatives forecast 15% more being created as a result of these plans. The party said it plans to invest Â£2.5bn in the project over four years in addition to the Â£20.5bn of extra NHS funding pledged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Dr Richard Vautrey, from the British Medical Association, said: ""We wait with some trepidation to see if this latest promise can deliver. ""The lack of detail as to exactly how all these promises will be made good, particularly with no firm commitment for full reform of the ridiculous pension taxation system, means it remains to be seen whether these long overdue and very necessary improvements will be achieved."" This video can not be played ""You can't get an appointment"" - patients and staff at one GPs' practice Waiting times for a GP appointment have become the national conversation - the words of the chair of the Royal College of GPs. Doctors say they are working flat out but are struggling to keep up with rising patient demand and filling vacant posts in general practice is increasingly difficult. So how much difference will the Conservative plans make if they are re-elected? Funding extra training places will result in more doctors going into general practice. But half the 6,000 additional doctors promised by 2024 are assumed to come from international recruitment and better retention of existing staff, neither of which has been easy in recent years. Some GPs have retired early because of tax bills associated with their pensions, an issue which has not yet been fully resolved. Achieving that 6,000 total looks a big ask. As the government discovered, setting a target of 5,000 by 2020 was one thing, but achieving it another matter altogether. The announcement comes afterthe party promised to make it easier for doctors and nurses from abroad to work in the UK after Brexit, by creating an NHS visa. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government recognised GPs were under increasing pressure and require funding ""to help everyone get the care they need"". He said extra appointments in GP surgeries would be created ""with the sort of easy online booking that we expect in other areas of our lives"". Have waits for GP appointments got longer? More patients 'struggling to reach GP on phone' Missed GP appointments 'cost NHS Â£216m' Speaking at the Labour party conference, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""You can't trust the Tories with our NHS. ""They always make election promises which they fail to deliver on. ""Tory ministers promised us 5,000 extra GPs but in fact we have lost 1,600 GPs under the Tories."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said GPs were working flat out to try to keep up with rising demand while there was a shortage of doctors and other staff. She said urgent action was needed to support GPs ""grappling with unmanageable workloads"", adding that they go above and beyond for patients, often to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing.

Hotels in collapsed investment scheme up for saleOver a thousand people are thought to have invested Â£80m in companies owned by Gavin Woodhouse.Wales,"Administrators removed Gavin Woodhouse as a Northern Powerhouse Developments director Hotels at the centre of a collapsed ""Ponzi-type"" investment scheme are being put on the market in the hope of finding buyers before Christmas. Over a thousand people are thought to have invested about Â£80m in companies owned by Gavin Woodhouse. Hotels in Llandudno and Pembrokeshire are among those put up for sale by administrators who took over Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD) in July. Mr Woodhouse's solicitors said he would comment after legal proceedings ended. Administrators Duff and Phelps have removed him as a director of NPD. Investors have been told by the administrators that Land Registry documents relating to their purchases are effectively worthless and that the hotels owned by NPD are being marketed on a ""vacant possession"" basis. Those taking part in the investment schemes handed over cash for hotel rooms, ""off plan"" care home rooms and yet-to-be-built lodges onthe proposed Afan Valley Adventure Resort in south Wales. They expected an annual return of 10% on their investment and the opportunity to sell it back at a 25% profit after a decade. Administrator Phil Duffy told the BBC that investors' interests in the hotels were being set aside by a judge in order to market the hotels. They are inviting bids from potential buyers, to be received by 15 November. Any money raised from the sales will be distributed among investors according to how much they had invested. Ponzi schemes: A brief history,external 'Life savings lost' fears Extra time granted to save Â£200m resort project Investors said that they were told that their money was ring-fenced or protected against problems the company might have faced with its other investment schemes. But the administrator said it appears that it was run as a collective investment scheme - where hotel investors' cash was pooled with cash from other investment schemes under the NPD banner. Collective Investment schemes are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), but the regulator said it did not authorise the NPD firms to run such a scheme. Mr Duffy told the BBC: ""The definition of a Ponzi-scheme is larger than expected returnsâ¦ new investors' monies obtained to pay out old investors, and those two flags are evident in this. ""Of the Â£80m of investor money, they probably brought about Â£25m worth of hotels, but then they've spent Â£40m-Â£50m on lawyers, agents, money outside the group which we've now started to pull back in."" About Â£7m worth of payments were so far unaccounted for and administrators were investigating where this had gone, added Mr Duffy. The Â£200m Afan Valley Adventure Resort was one of the investment schemes on offer The FCA said offering investments in property is not regulated by them. However, if property investments were then being structured as collective investment schemes, the operating firm did need FCA authorisation, and ""certain minimum disclosure obligations"". ""It is a criminal offence to operate a collective investment scheme without FCA authorisation,"" said an FCA official. ""We are unable to comment on Northern Powerhouse Developments other than to say that it was not authorised by the FCA."" Duff and Phelps are also investigating the high rates of commission paid to property agents involved in marketing the schemes. It comes as law firm Penningtons Manches Cooper has launched a class action case against a number of the solicitors' firms which did conveyancing work for investors. Many were recommended by Northern Powerhouse Developments and fees waived if investors used them. David Niven, a partner in Pennington's leading the class action, said it was one of the biggest collapsed property schemes of its type that they had come across. ""To date we've been approached by over 300 investors who have lost money in the NPD schemes - with claims totalling around Â£30m and more coming in every day,"" said Mr Niven. ""Some of the legal work I've seen is very, very poor, probably because of the volume of cases being churned through these companies. ""They gave lip service to warning their clients, but these weren't designed to scare people off and huge numbers of people proceeded with the investments."" The Solicitors Regulation Authority has issued several warnings to solicitors' firms in the past about these type of investment schemes and the need to adequately warn clients of the risks involved.

He did receive a return on his investments for a couple of years, but these dried up in late 2018 and he said he was Â£73,500 out of pocket. ""I'm gutted, I feel stupid, hurt, angry,"" said Mr Thomas, a retired financial advisor. ""It was all very plausibleâ¦ very sophisticatedâ¦ a lot of highly-educated people were taken in. ""It's a life-changing sum of money to lose, you work a long time to build that up. ""It's just gut-wrenching to think that somebody's taken that money from us, and our family in the future are going to miss out on it."" Administrator Phil Duffy said it has estimated that about Â£6bn in funds had gone into similar investment schemes in the UK - some of which have already gone into insolvency. ""There are lots of overseas investors and these type of schemes are damaging the UK brand for investment,"" he said. ""The perception outside the UK is that investing in the UK is very safe, especially in property, and that's been damaged.""

Has the National Gallery discovered a new Leonardo? âââââ,"The boss of the National Gallery is a tall, physically imposing man with big bushy eyebrows and an easy charm, who, like all good museum directors, has an academic's mind and an impresario's spirit. His name is Gabriele Finaldi. Dr Finaldi is a moderniser whose mantra appears to be not so much out with the old and in with the new, but more, stick with the old and think anew. Like a chef serving up yesterday's fish dish as a fresh-n-spicy kedgeree, he is keen to re-contextualise his Old Masters in zesty combinations. And so, the 20th Century British painter David Bomberg will soon be seen alongside Botticelli and Michelangelo, and, as from this weekend, the gallery's Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece, The Virgin of the Rocks, is to be found below stairs as the only painting in a four-room ""immersive"" exhibition. The National Gallery's painting of Leonardo da Vinci's The Virgin of the Rocks (1506-8) is second version of the picture It is a bold move: a Â£1m punt to test the public's appetite for an art ""experience"" at the National Gallery, in which the celebrated artwork on view is one you can normally see for free but now have to pay between Â£16 - Â£20 for the privilege. The idea of an experiential art presentation full of digital embellishments has worked elsewhere. There's a popular Van Gogh ""immersive experience"" currently doing the rounds, in which huge projections of the Dutchman's iconic images are slapped over interior walls and ceilings like emulsion paint. Even the normally straight-laced Louvre in Paris has jumped on the digital bandwagon with Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass, a seven-minute virtual reality trip in and around the world's most famous painting. One art critic told me that it was so effective in making you feel like you were standing on a rocky precipice that she felt like she was clinging on for dear life. Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass is the Louvre's first virtual reality experience, and is part of the Paris museum's Leonardo da Vinci exhibition There's nothing so dramatic in the National Gallery's Leonardo Experience. In fact, the first room is so bland I thought it was the exhibition shop awaiting a delivery. The lighting is bog standard, the sound of water on rocks no more convincing than the leaky tap in the gents, and the two curving walls of metal boxes containing Leonardo quotes (mirrored, of course) are about as inviting as a dip in the North Sea in December. The opening room creates a landscape with metal boxes of the artist's images and quotes It leads to a central space from which the three remaining rooms are accessed. They are much better. The first is an atmospheric recreation of the gallery's conservation studios (any misconception that it's a mock-up of Leonardo's workplace is banished by the angle-poise lamps), in which we are to learn something new about the old master. The central slideshow projection reveals what the curators discovered after using the latest technology to find out what lay beneath the surface of the painting. An audio commentary relayed through speakers supplements the photos, explaining each stage, and how the National Gallery's The Virgin of the Rocks differs from the earlier version Leonardo produced, which now hangs in the Louvre. A recreation of one of the National Gallery's conservation studios, where research was done on the painting Leonardo da Vinci's first version of The Virgin of the Rocks (1483-1486) is in the Louvre in Paris As layer-after-layer of the painting is peeled back, ceiling projections and art studio ephemera add to the sense of theatre in the darkened room. And then comes the big moment: hidden under the finished picture lies a markedly different composition. The subject is the same, The Virgin and Christ Child in a rocky landscape, but the cast of supporting characters and their positioning is not. The gallery has only recently found this out, and is now presenting its research for all to see in this themed room, which is unquestionably immersive and impressive, although at the expense of narrative detail. You are left with more questions than answers. I'm all for being entertained, but I want to be educated as well. Scientific research at the National Gallery led to the discovery of this drawing underneath The Virgin of the Rocks The same imbalance is evident in the room dedicated to exploring Leonardo's approach to light and shadow. Three off-white objects are placed in separate small black boxes with lighting you can manipulate in order to play with the chiaroscuro (starkly contrasted light and shade) effects for which Leonardo was famous. They are fine but underwhelming, more so if you've queued a long time to have a go. And once again, there's precious little information to deepen knowledge. The final room suffers from the same problem. We don't get to hear the full story of the church in Milan for which the painting was commissioned. Nor how the building came to be destroyed along with the altarpiece containing Leonardo's painting. Instead, there are evocative projections and mood-enhancing music drawing you towards the star attraction of the show: a digital recreation of the altar with the gallery's The Virgin of the Rocks centre stage. 59 Productions, which created the show, has set the painting in a digitally produced altarpiece This is the ultimate test of the exhibition. Is the experience of seeing this masterpiece enhanced or diminished by having graphics animating continuously on either side of it? The answer is, it is ruined. You can't possibly give it the attention it deserves with so much to distract your gaze. Nor can you see it very well unless you are standing in one spot directly in front of the painting. Look at it from any other angle and the light reflection from the digital projectors glint on its surface like a full moon. They would be better off replacing it with a digital version, which it looks like anyway in this installation, and leave the real thing upstairs in the main collection galleries for visitors to enjoy for free. The Leonardo Experience is a miss, but it's not a million miles away from being a hit. I don't think it's a cynical ploy to woo the Instagram crowd or to make a quick buck (although both would be welcome I'd imagine), but a sincere attempt by all involved to use contemporary technology to increase understanding and appreciation of art. This show is a step along the way, a wholehearted experiment of sorts for which Dr Finaldi and his team should be congratulated. There is bound to be an element of trial and error, there always is when breaking new ground. You only have to look beneath the surface of a Leonardo da Vinci painting to know that.

Indian top court gives Ayodhya holy site to HindusThe land dispute has been bitterly contested by Hindus and Muslims for decades.,"This video can not be played The BBC's Vikas Pandey explains the historic Supreme Court verdict in Ayodhya holy site dispute The disputed holy site of Ayodhya in northern India should be given to Hindus who want a temple built there, the country's Supreme Court has ruled. The case, which has been bitterly contested for decades by Hindus and Muslims, centres on the ownership of the land in Uttar Pradesh state. Muslims would get another plot of land to construct a mosque, the court said. Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram. Muslims say they have worshipped there for generations. Ayodhya verdict: The man who represented a Hindu God The complex history of India's Ayodhya holy site At the centre of the row is the 16th Century Babri mosque which was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people. In the unanimous verdict, the court said that a report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) provided evidence that the remains of a building ""that was not Islamic"" was beneath the structure of the demolished Babri mosque. The court said that, given all the evidence presented, it had determined that the disputed land should be given to Hindus for a temple to Lord Ram, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque. It then directed the federal government to set up a trust to manage and oversee the construction of the temple. However, the court added that the demolition of the Babri mosque was against the rule of law. Despite warnings by authorities not to celebrate the verdict, BBC correspondents in court say they heard chants of ""Jai Shree Ram"" (Hail Lord Ram) outside as the judgement was pronounced. ""It's a very balanced judgement and it is a victory for people of India,"" a lawyer for one of the Hindu parties told reporters soon after. Initially, a representative for the Muslim litigants said they were not satisfied and would decide whether to ask for a review after they had read the whole judgement. However, the main group of litigants has now said that it will not appeal against the verdict. Outside the court, the situation has been largely calm. Hundreds of people were detained in Ayodhya on Friday ahead of the verdict, amid fears of violence. Thousands of police officers have also been deployed in the city, while shops and colleges have been shut until Monday. The government issued an order banning the publication of images of the destruction of the Babri mosque. Social media platforms are being monitored for inflammatory content, with police even replying to tweets and asking users to delete them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacted to the verdict on Twitter and said that it should not be seen as a ""win or loss for anybody"". Allow Twitter content?

What was arguably one of the world's most contentious property dispute has finally come to an end. The dispute over the plot has polarised, frustrated and exhausted India. The reason is that this is not a humdrum civil matter. It was touched by faith (Hindus believe the plot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, a revered deity) violence (the demolition of the mosque in 1992) and subterfuge (idols of Lord Ram were placed in the mosque surreptitiously in 1949). Saturday's unanimous judgement by the five most senior judges of the court will hopefully lead to some reconciliation that the country badly needs. The verdict showed ""judicial craftsmanship and statesmanship where the letter of the law was adhered to, but the relief was moulded, taking into account the ground realities,"" lawyer Sanjay Hegde told me. The judges appear to have gone by the evidence laid before it. ""They have applied a plaster. Let's not reopen the wounds,"" Mr Hegde added. Will the verdict lead to a closure of past animosities and help close India's deepening religious fissures? Only time will tell. For the moment, India's main communities need to avoid triumphalism - because eventually there are no victors and vanquished, in what is essentially a contestation of faith. Many Hindus believe the Babri Masjid was actually constructed on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders in the 16th Century. Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols. The two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site. Since then, there have been calls to build a temple on the spot where the mosque once stood. Hinduism is India's majority religion and is thought to be more than 4,000 years old. India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century. Ever since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP first came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions. The call for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya has grown particularly loud, and has mostly come from MPs, ministers and leaders from the BJP since it took office. Restrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by the majority Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of a number of people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle. An uninhibited display of muscular Hindu nationalism in other areas has also contributed to religious tension. Most recently, the country's home minister Amit Shah said he would remove ""illegal migrants"" - understood to be Muslim - from the country through a government scheme that was used recently in the north-eastern state of Assam.

'Unprecedented' Australian bushfires kill two,"The fires have driven thousands of people out of their homes At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by a weekend of bushfires in Australia. On Sunday, the fire emergency's third day, more than 100 blazes were still burning across New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the military could be called upon to support the 1,300 firefighters working in the two states. Hundreds of civilians have also volunteered to help in affected areas. Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' ""My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families,"" Mr Morrison added. Officials warn that extreme weather conditions could fuel more fires in the week, including near Sydney. In Queensland, thousands of people spent the night in evacuation centres while officials assessed whether it was safe for them to return home. Fire officials in NSW have confirmed that more than 150 homes have been destroyed. Although cooler weather on Saturday night provided some reprieve, it is feared that high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds forecast from the middle of the week will fuel further fires that officials will be unable to contain. Officials say they are likely to issue extreme fire warnings for large swathes of the NSW coast on Tuesday, with areas around Sydney thought to be particularly at risk. This video can not be played ""Unprecedented"" bushfires turn skies orange ""Under these conditions, these fires will spread quickly and threaten homes and lives,"" NSW Rural Fire Service said in a statement. ""These conditions will be as bad, if not worse, than those experienced on Friday as they will be across a much broader area including large population centres like Sydney."" While clearing affected areas on Friday, fire crews discovered the body of one victim in a burned out car near Glen Innes, about 550km (340 miles) north of Sydney. In the same town on the same day, a woman was found suffering from severe burns. She was rushed to hospital but died shortly afterwards. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, said on Sunday that the town's residents were traumatised. ""The fire was as high as 20 foot [6m] and raging with 80 kilometres per hour [50 mph] winds,"" she told Australian broadcaster ABC. ""It was absolutely horrific for the people that were impacted."" About 1,000 firefighters have been tackling the blazes across New South Wales Water-bombing helicopters have been deployed to the site of the fires On Saturday, NSW police confirmed that a third person had died after a body was found in a burnt-out home near Taree, a town about 300km north of Sydney. Police said the home belonged to a woman aged 63, but that they wouldn't be able to confirm their identity until a post-mortem had been carried out. In NSW, the worst-hit state, crews have fought hundreds of fires since last month, when two people died while trying to protect their home. Earlier this month, a blaze burned though 2,000 hectares of bush which contained a koala sanctuary.Hundreds of the animals were feared to have died. Rains lashed NSW earlier this week, providing much relief to farmers. But the storms were not nearly enough to end the long-running drought. Authorities in the state warn that many fires will continue to burn unless there is more rain. ""We just cannot overstate the profound impact that the drought is having on fire behaviour,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Farmers - Australia's 'unlikely' climate activists Living with the strain of a devastating drought Water-bombing aircraft are often flying long distances because of the difficulty of accessing water in dry areas. In some cases authorities have drilled bores to keep up with demand. ""We've very mindful of the scarcity of water and how precious it is, but the reality is we can't do firefighting without water,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Strong northerly winds shrouded Sydney in smoke from the bushfires The haze obscured the city's most famous landmarks Australia's fire season risks growing longer and more intense due to climate change, according to scientists. Authorities said they were concerned about the severity of the fires ahead of its hottest months, a year afterthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record. This video can not be played Why Australia bushfires are now ""hotter and more intense"" Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively. The bureau'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Even if global temperatures are contained to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels - a limit set out in the landmark Paris accord, agreed by 188 nations in 2015 -scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal.

"'No wall too high to be broken down', says Merkel","People placed roses on a remaining portion of the Berlin Wall during a ceremony on Saturday German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned against taking democracy for granted, at a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall's fall. ""No wall that keeps people out and restricts freedom is so high... that it cannot be broken down,"" she added. The wall had separated Soviet-controlled East Berlin and capitalist West Berlin during the Cold War. Its fall in 1989 was seen as a victory for liberal democracy, and led to Germany's reunification a year later. This video can not be played Fireworks at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate formed part of the anniversary celebrations However, Mrs Merkel warned on Saturday that ""the values on which Europe is founded - freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human rights - they are anything but self-evident and they have to be revitalised and defended time and time again"". ""We stand stripped of any excuses and are required to do our part of freedom and democracy,"" she added in a ceremony at the Berlin Wall memorial. The story of Tunnel 29 How 1989 reshaped the modern world Fall of Berlin Wall was 'worst night of my life' There has been a rise in the far-right in many European countries, while the governments of EU countries such as Poland and Hungary have been accused of undermining the rule of law. This video can not be played Mrs Merkel placed a candle at the memorial site The Berlin Wall fell during the revolutions of 1989 in central and eastern Europe, in which several Soviet-imposed communist regimes were toppled following protests and political movements. Speaking on Saturday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier paid tribute to Germany's neighbours, saying: ""Without the courage of the will to freedom of the Poles and Hungarians, the Czechs and Slovaks, the peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe and Germany's reunification would not have been possible."" However, he added that ""liberal democracy is being challenged and questioned"", while foreign minister Heiko Maas said: ""Power is shifting away from Europe, authoritarian models are on the rise, the United States is increasingly looking inwards"". The presidents of Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic attended the ceremony US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was not at the ceremony, but visited Berlin earlier this week. During a speech on Friday, he warned that ""freedom is never guaranteed"". He criticised the human rights records of the Russian and Chinese governments, and said: ""Today, authoritarianism is once again rising."" Saturday was also the anniversary of the Kristallnacht - the night of broken glass - when thousands of Jewish homes, synagogues and businesses were attacked in Nazi Germany and Austria in 1938. About 200 people joined a far-right protest in Bielefeld in northwest Germany in support of a Holocaust denier, while thousands of anti-fascist and left-wing groups held a counter protest,local media reported,external. This video can not be played How the BBC reported on the dramatic collapse of the Berlin Wall After World War Two, Europe was split between what was then the Soviet Union, and its Western allies.

Germany was divided - with the eastern part occupied by the Soviets, and the west controlled by the US, UK and France. The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 - to stop people leaving East Berlin for West Berlin. During the 1989 revolutions, several Soviet-imposed communist regimes in Eastern Europe were toppled as people demanded independence or greater freedoms. A series of mass protests in East Germany - and a mistaken announcement by a government spokesman - led to large crowds gathering at the border. Border guards eventually opened the barriers - leading to thousands rushing through, and breaking the wall with hammers and pickaxes.

'Unprecedented' Australian bushfires kill twoOfficials say the number of casualties could rise after more than 150 homes are destroyed.Australia,"The fires have driven thousands of people out of their homes At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by a weekend of bushfires in Australia. On Sunday, the fire emergency's third day, more than 100 blazes were still burning across New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the military could be called upon to support the 1,300 firefighters working in the two states. Hundreds of civilians have also volunteered to help in affected areas. Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' ""My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families,"" Mr Morrison added. Officials warn that extreme weather conditions could fuel more fires in the week, including near Sydney. In Queensland, thousands of people spent the night in evacuation centres while officials assessed whether it was safe for them to return home. Fire officials in NSW have confirmed that more than 150 homes have been destroyed. Although cooler weather on Saturday night provided some reprieve, it is feared that high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds forecast from the middle of the week will fuel further fires that officials will be unable to contain. Officials say they are likely to issue extreme fire warnings for large swathes of the NSW coast on Tuesday, with areas around Sydney thought to be particularly at risk. This video can not be played ""Unprecedented"" bushfires turn skies orange ""Under these conditions, these fires will spread quickly and threaten homes and lives,"" NSW Rural Fire Service said in a statement. ""These conditions will be as bad, if not worse, than those experienced on Friday as they will be across a much broader area including large population centres like Sydney."" While clearing affected areas on Friday, fire crews discovered the body of one victim in a burned out car near Glen Innes, about 550km (340 miles) north of Sydney. In the same town on the same day, a woman was found suffering from severe burns. She was rushed to hospital but died shortly afterwards. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, said on Sunday that the town's residents were traumatised. ""The fire was as high as 20 foot [6m] and raging with 80 kilometres per hour [50 mph] winds,"" she told Australian broadcaster ABC. ""It was absolutely horrific for the people that were impacted."" About 1,000 firefighters have been tackling the blazes across New South Wales Water-bombing helicopters have been deployed to the site of the fires On Saturday, NSW police confirmed that a third person had died after a body was found in a burnt-out home near Taree, a town about 300km north of Sydney. Police said the home belonged to a woman aged 63, but that they wouldn't be able to confirm their identity until a post-mortem had been carried out. In NSW, the worst-hit state, crews have fought hundreds of fires since last month, when two people died while trying to protect their home. Earlier this month, a blaze burned though 2,000 hectares of bush which contained a koala sanctuary.Hundreds of the animals were feared to have died. Rains lashed NSW earlier this week, providing much relief to farmers. But the storms were not nearly enough to end the long-running drought. Authorities in the state warn that many fires will continue to burn unless there is more rain. ""We just cannot overstate the profound impact that the drought is having on fire behaviour,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Farmers - Australia's 'unlikely' climate activists Living with the strain of a devastating drought Water-bombing aircraft are often flying long distances because of the difficulty of accessing water in dry areas. In some cases authorities have drilled bores to keep up with demand. ""We've very mindful of the scarcity of water and how precious it is, but the reality is we can't do firefighting without water,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Strong northerly winds shrouded Sydney in smoke from the bushfires The haze obscured the city's most famous landmarks Australia's fire season risks growing longer and more intense due to climate change, according to scientists. Authorities said they were concerned about the severity of the fires ahead of its hottest months, a year afterthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record. This video can not be played Why Australia bushfires are now ""hotter and more intense"" Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively. The bureau'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Even if global temperatures are contained to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels - a limit set out in the landmark Paris accord, agreed by 188 nations in 2015 -scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal. Last year,a UN report said Australia was falling short in efforts to cut its CO2 emissions. Have you been affected by the bushfires? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Stars 'wage peace' in 24-hour Remembrance showMiranda Richardson and Toby Jones will take part in a marathon performance for Remembrance Sunday.Entertainment & Arts,"Miranda Richardson and Toby Jones will read parts of the 237,000-word script A non-stop 24-hour performance will see actors including Toby Jones and Miranda Richardson speak the words of 100 peace workers for Remembrance Sunday. 24 Hours of Peace has been created from interviews with community and charity workers, ex-Armed Forces personnel, religious leaders and former neo-Nazis. It will be staged at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester from 11:02 GMT on Sunday. The 24 professional actors also include Julie Hesmondhalgh and Liz Carr. Left-right: Liz Carr, Don Warrington and Julie Hesmondhalgh Hesmondhalgh is known for Broadchurch and Coronation Street, while Carr stars in Silent Witness. Don Warrington (Death In Paradise), Mina Anwar (The Thin Blue Line), Maggie Steed (EastEnders), Adjoa Andoh (Casualty) and Steffan Rhodri (Gavin & Stacey) will also take part, joined by a 24-strong community ensemble. The marathon show has been put together by Neil Bartlett, former artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith theatre, who has spent three years interviewing people involved in working towards peace. ""I asked them all the simple question - what does this day, when we're supposed to be reflecting on war and peace, what does this day mean to you? ""And out of those 100 completely different answers, I've created the text of this show."" Bartlett travelled the UK interviewing figures including Nigel Bromage, who joined the far right at 15 and now helps people who want to leave; three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Scilla Elworthy; Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief negotiator in Northern Ireland; and ""honour"" abuse campaigner Jasvinder Sanghera. He spoke to 16 former members of the Armed Forces; ex-IRA member Patrick Magee and Jo Berry, the daughter of one of his victims; an imam in Rochdale and a priest in Salford; an aid worker with experience in Somalia, South Sudan and Syria; and a community safety officer in Blackpool. His 100 interviewees represent the 100 years since the first Armistice Day. Neil Bartlett has volunteered to do the 03:30 shift himself ""I've come out of it with hope,"" he says. ""If we want to choose peace - by which I mean reconciliation, de-escalation, negotiation - we already have all the tools and all the expertise in this country. ""If we want to know how to start solving the problems we face - whether that's catastrophic rises in hate crime figures to foreign policy questions to disarmament questions - we have the thinking, we have the thinkers, we have a century of experience. There is every reason for hope, if only we would ask the right people."" The performance will begin after Sunday's two minutes' silence. It will be free to watch live, with people invited to pop in during their shopping, on the way back from a night out or on their way to work on Monday. It will also be broadcast live on the radio on Resonance FM. Most of the performers will make a few appearances throughout the 24 hours. Hesmondhalgh, for example, is scheduled for two stints on Sunday evening before doing the 05:30 slot and then returning at 10:00. Bartlett has put himself in for 03:30-04:30. ""I felt if I was going to call on both some of my very distinguished friends in the business, I had to be able to say to them, I'm doing the graveyard shift,"" he says. While his 237,000-word script is all about peace, he says he is not trying to shift the focus of Remembrance Day and the two minutes' silence from the commemoration of those who have died in conflicts. He says he wants to ask whether it is ""meant to be like Groundhog Day, that we always return to the same point"". The silence was ""always conceived of as a hinge moment"", he believes. ""Some people say that's why it's two minutes - one minute to look back and one minute to look forward. ""Life stops. We reflect. Do we then go back to where we were and pretend those two minutes never happened, or do those two minutes change us in some way? Do they charge us to do something different?""

"Tory peer accuses Hancock of 'whitesplaining'The health secretary says others take a ""more balanced approach"" on Islamophobia than Baroness Warsi.UK Politics","Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been accused of ""whitesplaining"" by Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi after he said others in the party took a ""more balanced approach"" on Islamophobia than her. Baroness Warsi has repeatedly criticised the party's response to Islamophobia in its own ranks. On Friday, Boris Johnson appeared to rule out an independent inquiry specifically into Islamophobia. He said the party would hold a ""general investigation into prejudice"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Mr Hancock said the Tories needed to hold an inquiry on Islamophobia within the party. But he added: ""Well look, I like Sayeeda [Warsi], she has a particular view on this. There are others who take a more balanced approach,"" he said. Asked if he was saying she was ""unbalanced"", Mr Hancock replied: ""No, I'm certainly not saying that. I have an enormous amount of respect for Sayeeda but she does take a particular view."" Baroness Warsi was the first Muslim woman to sit round the cabinet table He added: ""There needs to be an inquiry of course but, of course, you should look into all kinds of prejudice. ""I think that this is something that any responsible party always needs to be on the look-out for."" Baroness Warsi, the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister, responded with a tweet saying she was ""glad"" to have colleagues like the health secretary to educate her on the issue after working in race relations for 30 years. ""Thousand apologies sir,"" the former Tory chairwoman added. Tories 'will order Islamophobia inquiry' Government rejects Islamophobia definition Tory members suspended over Islamophobic posts The Conservative Party has come under pressure to open itself up to an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following incidents highlighted to the party and in the media. In September,a number of party members were suspendedafter the BBC highlighted more than 20 cases of Islamophobic material being posted or endorsed online. The incidents ranged from individuals ""liking"" anti-Muslim pictures or statements on one or two occasions, to regular Islamophobic posts by people who said they were members of the Conservative Party.

On one occasion, a Conservative councillor responded to a tweet in March, writing: ""Islam and slavery are partners in crime."" Speaking to Channel 4 News on Saturday evening, Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's comments suggesting a broader investigation showed the party was still not taking the issue of Islamophobia seriously. She called for him to be an ""anti-racist"" and ""take all forms of racism seriously"". ""We've quite rightly been calling out the Labour Party for the allegations of racism within their ranks... we seem to be able to take our opponents to task, and yet we singularly fail to deal with the Islamophobia and racism in our own backyard,"" she said. Asked whether she could urge her fellow British Muslims to vote Conservative, Baroness Warsi said: ""I would say that the climate for British Muslims within the Conservative Party is hostile. ""I think that the climate that has been created in the country because of the Conservative leadership is hostile for British Muslims."" In June, during a BBC debate as part of the Tory leadership contest, candidate Sajid Javid, now the chancellor, asked other candidates to agree to open up the Conservatives to an external investigation into Islamophobia within its ranks.

Protestors call for assembly to be renamed Senedd,"Protestors gathered on the steps of the assembly building in Cardiff Bay About 100 people have joined a protest calling for the Welsh Assembly to be renamed Senedd. Last month assembly members voted to replace the title with a bilingual name, calling it both Senedd Cymru and the Welsh Parliament. The idea of the Welsh-only title Senedd was rejected, but there will be another vote next week. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""unique"" name had already ""captured people's imagination"". The protest was held after more than 30 famous names - including actor Michael Sheen, singer Cerys Matthews and rugby referee Nigel Owens - signed a letter to AMs calling on them to back the name Senedd. Welsh assembly name: 'Senedd' backed by Sheen and stars AMs back new bilingual name for Welsh Assembly Tensions over Welsh Assembly name change ""We have cwtch and cariad - great [Welsh-language] words,"" said Mr Price, who joined the rally on the steps of the assembly building - also known as the Senedd - in Cardiff Bay. ""If you get in a taxi in Cardiff, the driver will know where the Senedd is. ""It's captured people's imagination, and like the DÃ¡il [in Ireland] and Bundestag [in Germany], it can put us on the map internationally."" The Plaid Cymru leader said he wanted democracy in Wales to be ""original"", not following ""bad habits"" from Westminster, but ""creating something unique with our own word"". Several speakers addressed the gathering organised by Welsh language campaigners The protest was organised by Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, the Welsh Language Society. Chairwoman Bethan Ruth said campaigners wanted to send a clear message to politicians that they want a monolingual name. ""I think it's quite patronising to say people who don't speak Welsh don't understand what the Senedd is,"" she said. ""We see so many ways the language brings us together - the national anthem is in the medium of Welsh."" Assembly members will vote again on the proposal on Wednesday.

"Two cases of deadly diphtheria infection detectedNHS Lothian has confirmed two related cases of the disease and say infection protocols are in place.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","Diphtheria vaccination programmes protect most people in the UK Two people are being treated in Scotland for the potentially deadly diphtheria infection. NHS Lothian has confirmed the two cases are related and both patients are thought to be in hospital in Edinburgh. The health board said those involved had recently returned from overseas. Public health experts said the likelihood of any additional cases was very small, as most people were protected by immunisation given in childhood. In Lothian, 98% of children are vaccinated against diphtheria by the age of 24 months. Alison McCallum, director of public health for NHS Lothian, said:  ""All close contacts of these patients have been identified, contacted and followed up in line with nationally agreed guidelines.

The diphtheria infection is spread by coughs and sneezes and can prove potentially fatal Diphtheria is a highly contagious and potentially fatal infection that can affect the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin. It can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure and paralysis. The infection is spread by coughs and sneezes, or by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothes or bedding with an infected person. It is rare in the UK, because babies and children are routinely vaccinated against it. There is a small risk of catching the disease while travelling in some parts of the world.

"Inmate claims he completed life sentence by dyingHe argued he should be free because his heart briefly stopped, but Iowa judges are not convinced.US & Canada","Benjamin Schreiber, not pictured, is serving a life sentence for bludgeoning a man to death in 1996. A court in the US has refused to release a convict who argued that he had completed his life sentence when he briefly ""died"". Benjamin Schreiber, 66, was sentenced to life without parole in Iowa for bludgeoning a man to death in 1996. He said his sentence ended when his heart stopped during a medical emergency four years ago, even though he was revived. But judges said Schreiber's bid - while original - was ""unpersuasive"". They said that he was ""unlikely"" to be dead, as he had signed his own legal documents in the case. Prisoner who dressed up as daughter to escape found dead Man who stole $50 to be freed after 36 years in prison Half of US adults 'have had close family member jailed' In 2015, Schreiber developed septic poisoning as a result of kidney stones. He had to be resuscitated by doctors in hospital, but fully recovered and was returned to prison. In Schreiber's claim, filed last year, he said that he had been resuscitated against his will, and that his brief ""death"" meant that his life sentence had technically ended. The district court ruled against Schreiber - a decision his lawyer took to the state's court of appeal. On Wednesday, the appeals court upheld the lower court's ruling. It added that his sentence would not end until a medical examiner formally declared him dead.

Severe flood warnings in place after downpours,"This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater Severe flood warnings and rail cancellations remain in areas of England flooded after a month's worth of rain fell in a single day. Derbyshire and South Yorkshire have been worst hit by the floods, whichclaimed the life of one womanswept away in a river near Matlock. Seven severe flood warnings - deemed a threat to life - remain on the River Don in South Yorkshire. Meanwhile, trains are not running in parts of the East Midlands. Services are cancelled on the Matlock-Derby-Nottingham route and diversions are in place between Derby and Chesterfield, adding about 30 minutes to journeys. The River Derwent burst its banks in Derby city centre South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it had declared a major incident on Friday night and firefighters had rescued more than 40 people from the Fishlake area, near Doncaster. Deputy Chief Fire Officer Alex Johnson advised people to ""keep themselves safe, help each other and don't drive into flood water"". Water sports enthusiast and teacher Mark Ibbotson, from Doncaster, said he, along with his 13-year-old son Logan, had rescued more than 30 people - including two babies - from a number of streets in Bentley where homes have been hit by flooding.

Volunteers are helping with the clear-up at Belper Town Football Club A clear-up is under way at Belper Town Football Club after it was flooded on Friday afternoon. Director of football Andy Carter said he was confident things would be back to normal by the club's next home game in a week. In Worksop, Nottinghamshire, water levels are receding after 200 homes and businesses were evacuated on Thursday evening. Bassetlaw District Council said it had closed its emergency rest centre as everyone who had left their homes were with friends and relatives. An evacuation was ordered when part of a cliff gave way on Thursday Residents from 12 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, are still unable to return home after a mudslide on Thursdayled to 35 properties being evacuated. Emergency work to secure a cliff at the former Berry Hill Quarry site is due to start later. The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, hit its highest recorded level at just over 6.3m (21ft), higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham People continued to be rescued from flood-hit towns and cities on Friday. One man told the BBC he carried children from his gym in Rotherham, wading through water that had submerged the streets outside. ""The whole of the gym was completely flooded in water,"" said Neil Wilson. ""We had to wade through water to get children to the cars so they could get home with their parents. ""The way the car park is it's a bit deeper, so when we were carrying kids to the car it was coming up above our knees."" But there was better news overnight into Saturday as the torrential downpours abated. Met Office meteorologist Steven Keates said: ""I think the most important thing is that the areas which have been affected by floods should avoid rain and get some respite."" Children and pets were carried to safety as people evacuated their homes in Doncaster Matlock clothes shop owner Kirsty Gilbert said flooding had ruined a significant amount of her stock. ""We've lost everything that was on the floor - shoes and handbags,"" she said. ""Nearly every business in Matlock has been affected in some way."" Kirsty Gilbert said she arrived at her shop to find shoes floating around On Friday, the floods claimed the life of a woman who was swept into the River Derwent at Rowsley in Derbyshire. Her body was found about two miles away in Darley Dale. She was named earlieras Derbyshire's former High Sherriff Annie Hall. Every time there's serious flooding, questions are asked about why it was allowed to happen. One simple answer is governments of all parties have been accused of not spending enough on protection. You can build walls along river banks and many places have been guarded this way but such 'hard defences' are expensive and obtrusive. An alternative is to employ what are known as soft defences. These include encouraging farmers to manage their land in ways that let fields hold back floodwater. Driveways and car parks can be surfaced with materials that allow it to reach the soil underneath. Another option is to make homes more resilient - fitting exterior doors with waterproof plastic panels, sealing the ground floor and raising fuse boxes. In some ways the country has become better prepared for flooding but lessons are not always learned and the misery for many keeps being repeated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Matlock on Friday and said: ""People have been moved out of their homes and probably hundreds of businesses have seen damage to their properties. ""We stand ready to help in any way that we can."" On the cause of the flooding, he added: ""We are seeing more and more serious flooding - perhaps because of building, almost certainly because of climate change. ""We need to prepare and we need to be investing in those defences."" Have you been affected by flooding? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Stars 'wage peace' in 24-hour Remembrance show,"Miranda Richardson and Toby Jones will read parts of the 237,000-word script A non-stop 24-hour performance will see actors including Toby Jones and Miranda Richardson speak the words of 100 peace workers for Remembrance Sunday. 24 Hours of Peace has been created from interviews with community and charity workers, ex-Armed Forces personnel, religious leaders and former neo-Nazis. It will be staged at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester from 11:02 GMT on Sunday. The 24 professional actors also include Julie Hesmondhalgh and Liz Carr. Left-right: Liz Carr, Don Warrington and Julie Hesmondhalgh Hesmondhalgh is known for Broadchurch and Coronation Street, while Carr stars in Silent Witness. Don Warrington (Death In Paradise), Mina Anwar (The Thin Blue Line), Maggie Steed (EastEnders), Adjoa Andoh (Casualty) and Steffan Rhodri (Gavin & Stacey) will also take part, joined by a 24-strong community ensemble. The marathon show has been put together by Neil Bartlett, former artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith theatre, who has spent three years interviewing people involved in working towards peace. ""I asked them all the simple question - what does this day, when we're supposed to be reflecting on war and peace, what does this day mean to you? ""And out of those 100 completely different answers, I've created the text of this show."" Bartlett travelled the UK interviewing figures including Nigel Bromage, who joined the far right at 15 and now helps people who want to leave; three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Scilla Elworthy; Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief negotiator in Northern Ireland; and ""honour"" abuse campaigner Jasvinder Sanghera. He spoke to 16 former members of the Armed Forces; ex-IRA member Patrick Magee and Jo Berry, the daughter of one of his victims; an imam in Rochdale and a priest in Salford; an aid worker with experience in Somalia, South Sudan and Syria; and a community safety officer in Blackpool. His 100 interviewees represent the 100 years since the first Armistice Day. Neil Bartlett has volunteered to do the 03:30 shift himself ""I've come out of it with hope,"" he says. ""If we want to choose peace - by which I mean reconciliation, de-escalation, negotiation - we already have all the tools and all the expertise in this country. ""If we want to know how to start solving the problems we face - whether that's catastrophic rises in hate crime figures to foreign policy questions to disarmament questions - we have the thinking, we have the thinkers, we have a century of experience. There is every reason for hope, if only we would ask the right people."" The performance will begin after Sunday's two minutes' silence. It will be free to watch live, with people invited to pop in during their shopping, on the way back from a night out or on their way to work on Monday. It will also be broadcast live on the radio on Resonance FM. Most of the performers will make a few appearances throughout the 24 hours. Hesmondhalgh, for example, is scheduled for two stints on Sunday evening before doing the 05:30 slot and then returning at 10:00. Bartlett has put himself in for 03:30-04:30. ""I felt if I was going to call on both some of my very distinguished friends in the business, I had to be able to say to them, I'm doing the graveyard shift,"" he says. While his 237,000-word script is all about peace, he says he is not trying to shift the focus of Remembrance Day and the two minutes' silence from the commemoration of those who have died in conflicts. He says he wants to ask whether it is ""meant to be like Groundhog Day, that we always return to the same point"". The silence was ""always conceived of as a hinge moment"", he believes. ""Some people say that's why it's two minutes - one minute to look back and one minute to look forward. ""Life stops. We reflect. Do we then go back to where we were and pretend those two minutes never happened, or do those two minutes change us in some way? Do they charge us to do something different?""

War veteran meets son of comrade after plea,"Jimmy Johnstone, left, had an emotional meeting with Sandy Petrie A former soldier aged 98 who survived World War Two and five years as a prisoner has met the son of one of his former comrades after making an appeal. Jimmy Johnstone, who lives in Aberdeen, was 16 when he enlisted in 1937. He was captured by German troops in northern France after the battle for Saint-Valery-en-Caux in 1940. After a successful public appeal in August, Mr Johnstone has now met the 73-year-old son of one of the men he tried to escape with. Sandy Petrie spoke of his father Bert Petrie, who died 10 years ago aged 86. Survivor of World War Two seeking other veterans Mr Johnstone worked with the Scottish War Blinded charity in the hope any of his fellow prisoners or their families could get in touch. The surrendered 51st Highland Division soldiers had to travel hundreds of miles to camps in Germany, via Belgium and the Netherlands. Jimmy Johnstone signed up as a teenager Mr Johnstone described meeting his comrade's son as ""very emotional"". He said: ""We talked about Bert and life in the PoW camps. I spoke about when we met. This was while we were waiting to go into the cooler (solitary) after one of my escapes. ""I told Sandy what a brave man his dad was. He stood up to the German guards and refused to work until they got more food. ""The German guard held him at gunpoint but he didn't give in and they got more food. I admired Bert for that."" Bert Petrie died 10 years ago Mr Petrie, also of Aberdeen, said: ""When I heard about the appeal on the radio, I quickly recognised it was my father being referred to and I was very, very interested to hear the story. ""They were some of the same stories my father had told me. I felt I would like to meet this chap, and to meet him for my father's sake too as I know he would have wanted to meet Jimmy."" He said his father would have been ""delighted"" about the meeting. Mr Petrie said: ""It was very touching to hear him refer to my father. He mentioned him quite emotionally. ""I have the greatest respect for Jimmy and the men and women of his generation, sadly a dwindling group. They saved our civilisation and way of life. It was a privilege to have met him."" Veteran Mr Johnstone added: ""It is really important that as we approach Remembrance Day we remember all men who fought in all battles, those that survived and those who died."" Any survivors of the events Mr Johnstone experienced, or other relatives willing to speak to him, are asked to contact the charity on0800 035 6409.

Michael Bloomberg signals run for US presidency,"Michael Bloomberg submitted his papers in Alabama on Friday Billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has signalled he will join the race to secure the Democratic Party's nomination for US president. He has filed paperwork ahead of a deadline for the Democratic primary election in Alabama. The move is a necessary step to join the race to be the party's candidate to take on President Donald Trump in next year's election. Mr Bloomberg, 77, has not formally confirmed his candidacy. However, spokesman Jason Schechter told US media that an announcement ""could come as early as next week"". This video can not be played ""Little"" Michael Bloomberg will hurt Biden - Trump The businessman is said to be concerned the current Democratic contenders would not pose a strong enough challenge to Mr Trump in 2020. He will be entering a crowded field as one of 17 candidates hoping to be chosen as the Democratic nominee. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the frontrunner, followed by senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The tycoon had strongly hinted that he would run, with his adviser Howard Wolfson releasing a statement on Thursday evening saying they wanted to ""ensure that Trump is defeated"" in the election next year. ""But Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of [Democratic] candidates is not well positioned to do that,"" he added. This video can not be played Bloomberg to BBC in 2018: 'I'd like to make a difference' His comments came after months of debate over wealth inequality in the US, with Mr Sanders and Ms Warren announcing plans for steep tax rises for billionaires. Unveiling his tax proposals in September,Mr Sanders said: ""Billionaires should not exist."",external Mr Bloomberg is estimated to be worth $52bn. On Friday, President Trump taunted Mr Bloomberg by saying there was ""nobody I'd rather run against than little Michael"". Mr Bloomberg filed his papers in Alabama later the same day. Mr Bloomberg is said to be fully aware such a belated entry to the race presents challenges in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where other Democratic contenders have been campaigning for months. The Bloomberg team reportedly sees a possible pathway through the so-called Super Tuesday contests in March, when 14 states - including California, Alabama and Colorado - will vote on a single day for their preferred White House nominee. Mr Bloomberg considered running for the White House as an independent candidate in both 2008 and 2016. In March of this year he had said he would not join the 2020 race. Mr Bloomberg and Mr Trump, pictured here playing golf in 2007, were once friendly Mr Bloomberg's advisers are reportedly preparing the paperwork for other states with nearing deadlines. Both Arkansas and New Hampshire require candidates to file by next week. State-by-state votes, known as primaries and caucuses, will be held from February next year to pick a Democratic White House nominee. The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts Who will take on Trump in 2020? The key issues for 2020 Democrats The eventual winner will be crowned at the party convention in Wisconsin in July. He or she is expected to face President Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November. Mr Biden told media on Friday that he had ""no problem"" with Mr Bloomberg joining the Democratic field. ""Michael is a solid guy,"" Mr Biden said. ""Let's see where it goes."" Ms Warrenwelcomed Mr Bloomberg to the race on Twitter,external, linking to her own campaign website and suggesting the former mayor take a look for potential policy plans. In tweet seemingly directed at Mr Bloomberg,Mr Sanders wrote:  ""The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared."",external Some recent opinion polls have suggested that Ms Warren and Mr Sanders - who are more politically liberal than Mr Biden - might face an uphill battle against Mr Trump. The Republican National Committee said in a statement that the billionaire's prospective entry ""underscores the weak Democrat field"". Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, and Elizabeth Warren are currently leading the field of Democratic candidates Mr Bloomberg was a Wall Street banker before going on to create the financial publishing empire that bears his name. His net worth is $52bn (Â£40bn), according to Forbes. This is 17 times more than Mr Trump's (estimated at $3.1bn). Are US billionaires really going to pay more tax? He staged a successful campaign for New York mayor in 2001, remaining in office for three consecutive terms until 2013. A philanthropist, he has donated millions of dollars to educational, medical and other causes. Analysis - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Why is he contemplating a run for the highest political job in the land just a few months after announcing he would watch 2020 from the sidelines? Here are a few theories: Because he thinks he can win Because he wants to shape the debate Because he can afford to The top one is the obvious response. Mr Bloomberg has plenty of pollsters and political strategists at his disposal, and is reported to be a very data-driven businessman. It doesn't take an advanced degree in quantitative analysis, however, to realise that the Democratic field, even at this (relatively) late date, is still in flux. There are four candidates at or near the top of early state and national primary polls - Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. All of them have their strengths, of course, but all of them also have obvious weaknesses. Read Anthony's piece in full Originally a Democrat, Mr Bloomberg became a Republican to mount his campaign for New York mayor in 2001. Now regarded as a moderate Democrat, he rejoined the party only last year. Michael Bloomberg has highlighted climate change and gun control as key issues Mr Bloomberg has liberal views on issues such as climate change, gun control, immigration and abortion rights. He was credited this week with helping Democrats win control of Virginia's legislature, after his gun-control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety injected $2.5m into the state's election. But Mr Bloomberg is more conservative on topics like the economy and policing. As mayor, he defended the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy, which critics say disproportionately targeted African Americans and Hispanics. At city hall, Mr Bloomberg banned supersize sodas to prevent obesity, but was overruled by the state's Supreme Court.

Inmate claims he completed life sentence by dying,"Benjamin Schreiber, not pictured, is serving a life sentence for bludgeoning a man to death in 1996. A court in the US has refused to release a convict who argued that he had completed his life sentence when he briefly ""died"". Benjamin Schreiber, 66, was sentenced to life without parole in Iowa for bludgeoning a man to death in 1996. He said his sentence ended when his heart stopped during a medical emergency four years ago, even though he was revived. But judges said Schreiber's bid - while original - was ""unpersuasive"". They said that he was ""unlikely"" to be dead, as he had signed his own legal documents in the case. Prisoner who dressed up as daughter to escape found dead Man who stole $50 to be freed after 36 years in prison Half of US adults 'have had close family member jailed' In 2015, Schreiber developed septic poisoning as a result of kidney stones. He had to be resuscitated by doctors in hospital, but fully recovered and was returned to prison. In Schreiber's claim, filed last year, he said that he had been resuscitated against his will, and that his brief ""death"" meant that his life sentence had technically ended. The district court ruled against Schreiber - a decision his lawyer took to the state's court of appeal. On Wednesday, the appeals court upheld the lower court's ruling.

Brazilian ex-President Lula released from jail,"This video can not be played Lula walked free to an adoring welcome Former Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has been freed after more than 18 months in prison. The left-wing former leader, known as Lula, was greeted with rapturous applause from crowds of supporters as he walked out of the jail on Friday. He was held in a prison in the city of Curitiba on corruption charges. A judge ordered his release after a Supreme Court ruling that defendants should only be imprisoned if they have exhausted their appeal options. Lula: Saint or sinner? A quick guide to Brazil's scandals The 74-year-old ex-president, who led Brazil between 2003 and 2010, is seen as a leftist icon in the country. As he left the prison, he pumped his fist in the air as a victory sign. ""I didn't think that today I could be here talking to men and women that during 580 days shouted good morning, good afternoon or goodnight, no matter if it was raining or 40 degrees [Celsius],"" he told the crowds. Lula, pictured next to his girlfriend Rosangela da Silva, told the crowd he would establish his innocence He also promised to prove his innocence, before hitting out at the ""rotten side of the judicial system"", which he accused of ""working to criminalise the left"". Lula was favourite to win last year's presidential election but was imprisoned after being implicated in a major corruption scandal. The race was won instead by far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro. Criticising Mr Bolsonaro's economic policies, Lula vowed to keep fighting for impoverished Brazilians. ""People are hungrier, they have no jobs, people work for Uber or delivering pizzas on a bike,"" he added, specifically criticising insecure work and the gig economy. After Lula's release, President Bolsonaro said the ex-president was ""momentarily free, but guilty"". He asked supporters on Twitter ""not to give ammunition to the scoundrel"". Lula will be barred from standing for office because of his criminal record. He has consistently denied all the accusations against him and claims they are politically motivated. ""Our judicial battle continues, our focus is to get the legal case nullified,"" his lawyer Cristiano Zanin said. For Lula's supporters, this feels like vindication - he's a politician who stirs emotions and those who back him feel that this has been a political witch-hunt from the very beginning. There's no guarantee Lula will remain free forever - he may not win the appeals that are left - and he's also been accused of corruption in other cases which he will have to face justice for. But with Lula now free, it will strengthen the left in Brazil - and harden the right. President Bolsonaro doesn't hide his disdain for Lula and millions of people agree - the anger towards Lula and the Workers Party is what propelled Mr Bolsonaro to power in the first place. Justices voted to reinterpret the country's penal code in a decision issued on Thursday. It overturns a three-year-old rule which mandated immediate prison time for convicted criminals after they lost their first appeal. Brazil's corruption scandal, known as Operation Car Wash, initially centred on the state-run oil company Petrobras, but subsequently billions of dollars of bribes were uncovered - and dozens of high-profile business leaders and politicians were jailed. The mandatory imprisonment rule was seen as helping prosecutors secure convictions and unravel the scandal by encouraging suspects to negotiate plea deals. But critics claimed it violated Brazil's constitution, which states that no one can be deprived of their liberty without due process of law. This video can not be played Lula spoke to the BBC from prison earlier this year Lula was jailed in 2018 after being sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, later reduced to eight years and 10 months, for receiving a beachside apartment from an engineering company implicated in the Car Wash investigation. Earlier this year, he was sentenced to another 12 years after being found guilty of accepting bribes in the form of renovation work at a country house from construction companies.

"Tories pledge to train 500 more GPs every yearBut a previous Conservative pledge to recruit an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020 is not close to being met.Health","The Tories say they will deliver 6,000 more doctors in general practice in England by 2024-25 to increase patient appointments, if they win the election. They claim they will reach that target through additional doctors working and training in surgeries, international recruitment and better retention. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a previous Tory pledge to recruit 5,000 GPs by 2020 had not been met. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS."" He said despite theConservatives' previous promise of more general practitioners made in 2015, GP numbers have declined. Labour has said it wants to expand GP training places from 3,500 to 5,000 a year to ease the burden on GPs. A really simple guide to the election,external The clock is ticking: How to register to vote What's the price tag on an election? The Conservatives say their plan would see the current tally of 3,538 GPs in training every year rise by about 500 each year over the next four years. And recruiting more GPs from overseas while improving efforts to retain current staff would lead to a total of 6,000 more doctors than there are now, they claim. But it is not yet clear how this will be achieved. In 2015, the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, pledged to have 5,000 more GPs working in the NHS in England by 2020. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock acknowledgedGP numbers had in fact decreased since 2015. He said: ""It's true the number of GPs was falling when I became health secretary [in July 2018]. ""The numbers are now rising but I want them to go much further."" Previously the Department of Health said one of the challenges it faces in growing GP numbers is airise in those taking early retirement and part-time working. Richard Murray, chief executive of health think tank the Kings Fund, said the announcement only goes part of the way to solving this ""vicious cycle"" of hiring and retention. ""The outflow from General Practice is the problem the government's facing. ""They're not succeeding in retaining, particularly older GPs, and younger GPs wanting to work part-time."" The party has also promised to recruit 6,000 more NHS nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists to work in surgeries. And it plans to modernise systems for booking appointments and ensure all patients have the choice of a consultation on the phone, on Skype or online. With more than 300 million appointments every year in England, the Conservatives forecast 15% more being created as a result of these plans. The party said it plans to invest Â£2.5bn in the project over four years in addition to the Â£20.5bn of extra NHS funding pledged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Dr Richard Vautrey, from the British Medical Association, said: ""We wait with some trepidation to see if this latest promise can deliver. ""The lack of detail as to exactly how all these promises will be made good, particularly with no firm commitment for full reform of the ridiculous pension taxation system, means it remains to be seen whether these long overdue and very necessary improvements will be achieved."" This video can not be played ""You can't get an appointment"" - patients and staff at one GPs' practice Waiting times for a GP appointment have become the national conversation - the words of the chair of the Royal College of GPs. Doctors say they are working flat out but are struggling to keep up with rising patient demand and filling vacant posts in general practice is increasingly difficult. So how much difference will the Conservative plans make if they are re-elected? Funding extra training places will result in more doctors going into general practice. But half the 6,000 additional doctors promised by 2024 are assumed to come from international recruitment and better retention of existing staff, neither of which has been easy in recent years. Some GPs have retired early because of tax bills associated with their pensions, an issue which has not yet been fully resolved. Achieving that 6,000 total looks a big ask. As the government discovered, setting a target of 5,000 by 2020 was one thing, but achieving it another matter altogether. The announcement comes afterthe party promised to make it easier for doctors and nurses from abroad to work in the UK after Brexit, by creating an NHS visa. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government recognised GPs were under increasing pressure and require funding ""to help everyone get the care they need"". He said extra appointments in GP surgeries would be created ""with the sort of easy online booking that we expect in other areas of our lives"". Have waits for GP appointments got longer?

Brazilian ex-President Lula released from jailHe was greeted by supporters outside the prison where he was held on corruption charges.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Lula walked free to an adoring welcome Former Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has been freed after more than 18 months in prison. The left-wing former leader, known as Lula, was greeted with rapturous applause from crowds of supporters as he walked out of the jail on Friday. He was held in a prison in the city of Curitiba on corruption charges. A judge ordered his release after a Supreme Court ruling that defendants should only be imprisoned if they have exhausted their appeal options. Lula: Saint or sinner? A quick guide to Brazil's scandals The 74-year-old ex-president, who led Brazil between 2003 and 2010, is seen as a leftist icon in the country. As he left the prison, he pumped his fist in the air as a victory sign. ""I didn't think that today I could be here talking to men and women that during 580 days shouted good morning, good afternoon or goodnight, no matter if it was raining or 40 degrees [Celsius],"" he told the crowds. Lula, pictured next to his girlfriend Rosangela da Silva, told the crowd he would establish his innocence He also promised to prove his innocence, before hitting out at the ""rotten side of the judicial system"", which he accused of ""working to criminalise the left"". Lula was favourite to win last year's presidential election but was imprisoned after being implicated in a major corruption scandal. The race was won instead by far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro. Criticising Mr Bolsonaro's economic policies, Lula vowed to keep fighting for impoverished Brazilians. ""People are hungrier, they have no jobs, people work for Uber or delivering pizzas on a bike,"" he added, specifically criticising insecure work and the gig economy. After Lula's release, President Bolsonaro said the ex-president was ""momentarily free, but guilty"". He asked supporters on Twitter ""not to give ammunition to the scoundrel"". Lula will be barred from standing for office because of his criminal record. He has consistently denied all the accusations against him and claims they are politically motivated. ""Our judicial battle continues, our focus is to get the legal case nullified,"" his lawyer Cristiano Zanin said. For Lula's supporters, this feels like vindication - he's a politician who stirs emotions and those who back him feel that this has been a political witch-hunt from the very beginning. There's no guarantee Lula will remain free forever - he may not win the appeals that are left - and he's also been accused of corruption in other cases which he will have to face justice for. But with Lula now free, it will strengthen the left in Brazil - and harden the right. President Bolsonaro doesn't hide his disdain for Lula and millions of people agree - the anger towards Lula and the Workers Party is what propelled Mr Bolsonaro to power in the first place. Justices voted to reinterpret the country's penal code in a decision issued on Thursday. It overturns a three-year-old rule which mandated immediate prison time for convicted criminals after they lost their first appeal. Brazil's corruption scandal, known as Operation Car Wash, initially centred on the state-run oil company Petrobras, but subsequently billions of dollars of bribes were uncovered - and dozens of high-profile business leaders and politicians were jailed. The mandatory imprisonment rule was seen as helping prosecutors secure convictions and unravel the scandal by encouraging suspects to negotiate plea deals. But critics claimed it violated Brazil's constitution, which states that no one can be deprived of their liberty without due process of law. This video can not be played Lula spoke to the BBC from prison earlier this year Lula was jailed in 2018 after being sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, later reduced to eight years and 10 months, for receiving a beachside apartment from an engineering company implicated in the Car Wash investigation. Earlier this year, he was sentenced to another 12 years after being found guilty of accepting bribes in the form of renovation work at a country house from construction companies.

Tories pledge to train 500 more GPs every year,"The Tories say they will deliver 6,000 more doctors in general practice in England by 2024-25 to increase patient appointments, if they win the election. They claim they will reach that target through additional doctors working and training in surgeries, international recruitment and better retention. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a previous Tory pledge to recruit 5,000 GPs by 2020 had not been met. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS."" He said despite theConservatives' previous promise of more general practitioners made in 2015, GP numbers have declined. Labour has said it wants to expand GP training places from 3,500 to 5,000 a year to ease the burden on GPs.

Hotels in collapsed investment scheme up for sale,"Administrators removed Gavin Woodhouse as a Northern Powerhouse Developments director Hotels at the centre of a collapsed ""Ponzi-type"" investment scheme are being put on the market in the hope of finding buyers before Christmas. Over a thousand people are thought to have invested about Â£80m in companies owned by Gavin Woodhouse. Hotels in Llandudno and Pembrokeshire are among those put up for sale by administrators who took over Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD) in July. Mr Woodhouse's solicitors said he would comment after legal proceedings ended. Administrators Duff and Phelps have removed him as a director of NPD. Investors have been told by the administrators that Land Registry documents relating to their purchases are effectively worthless and that the hotels owned by NPD are being marketed on a ""vacant possession"" basis. Those taking part in the investment schemes handed over cash for hotel rooms, ""off plan"" care home rooms and yet-to-be-built lodges onthe proposed Afan Valley Adventure Resort in south Wales. They expected an annual return of 10% on their investment and the opportunity to sell it back at a 25% profit after a decade. Administrator Phil Duffy told the BBC that investors' interests in the hotels were being set aside by a judge in order to market the hotels. They are inviting bids from potential buyers, to be received by 15 November. Any money raised from the sales will be distributed among investors according to how much they had invested. Ponzi schemes: A brief history,external 'Life savings lost' fears Extra time granted to save Â£200m resort project Investors said that they were told that their money was ring-fenced or protected against problems the company might have faced with its other investment schemes. But the administrator said it appears that it was run as a collective investment scheme - where hotel investors' cash was pooled with cash from other investment schemes under the NPD banner. Collective Investment schemes are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), but the regulator said it did not authorise the NPD firms to run such a scheme. Mr Duffy told the BBC: ""The definition of a Ponzi-scheme is larger than expected returnsâ¦ new investors' monies obtained to pay out old investors, and those two flags are evident in this. ""Of the Â£80m of investor money, they probably brought about Â£25m worth of hotels, but then they've spent Â£40m-Â£50m on lawyers, agents, money outside the group which we've now started to pull back in."" About Â£7m worth of payments were so far unaccounted for and administrators were investigating where this had gone, added Mr Duffy. The Â£200m Afan Valley Adventure Resort was one of the investment schemes on offer The FCA said offering investments in property is not regulated by them. However, if property investments were then being structured as collective investment schemes, the operating firm did need FCA authorisation, and ""certain minimum disclosure obligations"". ""It is a criminal offence to operate a collective investment scheme without FCA authorisation,"" said an FCA official. ""We are unable to comment on Northern Powerhouse Developments other than to say that it was not authorised by the FCA."" Duff and Phelps are also investigating the high rates of commission paid to property agents involved in marketing the schemes. It comes as law firm Penningtons Manches Cooper has launched a class action case against a number of the solicitors' firms which did conveyancing work for investors. Many were recommended by Northern Powerhouse Developments and fees waived if investors used them. David Niven, a partner in Pennington's leading the class action, said it was one of the biggest collapsed property schemes of its type that they had come across. ""To date we've been approached by over 300 investors who have lost money in the NPD schemes - with claims totalling around Â£30m and more coming in every day,"" said Mr Niven. ""Some of the legal work I've seen is very, very poor, probably because of the volume of cases being churned through these companies. ""They gave lip service to warning their clients, but these weren't designed to scare people off and huge numbers of people proceeded with the investments."" The Solicitors Regulation Authority has issued several warnings to solicitors' firms in the past about these type of investment schemes and the need to adequately warn clients of the risks involved. This video can not be played ""Hard to feel positive"" amid hotel administrations Gary Thomas, from Flintshire in north east Wales, bought two rooms at the Queen's Hotel in the Welsh seaside resort of Llandudno - investing in a second room after being assured that his initial investment was protected by ring-fencing. He did receive a return on his investments for a couple of years, but these dried up in late 2018 and he said he was Â£73,500 out of pocket. ""I'm gutted, I feel stupid, hurt, angry,"" said Mr Thomas, a retired financial advisor. ""It was all very plausibleâ¦ very sophisticatedâ¦ a lot of highly-educated people were taken in. ""It's a life-changing sum of money to lose, you work a long time to build that up. ""It's just gut-wrenching to think that somebody's taken that money from us, and our family in the future are going to miss out on it."" Administrator Phil Duffy said it has estimated that about Â£6bn in funds had gone into similar investment schemes in the UK - some of which have already gone into insolvency. ""There are lots of overseas investors and these type of schemes are damaging the UK brand for investment,"" he said. ""The perception outside the UK is that investing in the UK is very safe, especially in property, and that's been damaged.""

Indian top court gives Ayodhya holy site to HindusThe land dispute has been bitterly contested by Hindus and Muslims for decades.India,"This video can not be played The BBC's Vikas Pandey explains the historic Supreme Court verdict in Ayodhya holy site dispute The disputed holy site of Ayodhya in northern India should be given to Hindus who want a temple built there, the country's Supreme Court has ruled. The case, which has been bitterly contested for decades by Hindus and Muslims, centres on the ownership of the land in Uttar Pradesh state. Muslims would get another plot of land to construct a mosque, the court said. Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram. Muslims say they have worshipped there for generations. Ayodhya verdict: The man who represented a Hindu God The complex history of India's Ayodhya holy site At the centre of the row is the 16th Century Babri mosque which was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people. In the unanimous verdict, the court said that a report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) provided evidence that the remains of a building ""that was not Islamic"" was beneath the structure of the demolished Babri mosque. The court said that, given all the evidence presented, it had determined that the disputed land should be given to Hindus for a temple to Lord Ram, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque. It then directed the federal government to set up a trust to manage and oversee the construction of the temple. However, the court added that the demolition of the Babri mosque was against the rule of law. Despite warnings by authorities not to celebrate the verdict, BBC correspondents in court say they heard chants of ""Jai Shree Ram"" (Hail Lord Ram) outside as the judgement was pronounced. ""It's a very balanced judgement and it is a victory for people of India,"" a lawyer for one of the Hindu parties told reporters soon after. Initially, a representative for the Muslim litigants said they were not satisfied and would decide whether to ask for a review after they had read the whole judgement. However, the main group of litigants has now said that it will not appeal against the verdict. Outside the court, the situation has been largely calm. Hundreds of people were detained in Ayodhya on Friday ahead of the verdict, amid fears of violence. Thousands of police officers have also been deployed in the city, while shops and colleges have been shut until Monday. The government issued an order banning the publication of images of the destruction of the Babri mosque. Social media platforms are being monitored for inflammatory content, with police even replying to tweets and asking users to delete them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacted to the verdict on Twitter and said that it should not be seen as a ""win or loss for anybody"". Allow Twitter content?

What was arguably one of the world's most contentious property dispute has finally come to an end. The dispute over the plot has polarised, frustrated and exhausted India. The reason is that this is not a humdrum civil matter. It was touched by faith (Hindus believe the plot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, a revered deity) violence (the demolition of the mosque in 1992) and subterfuge (idols of Lord Ram were placed in the mosque surreptitiously in 1949). Saturday's unanimous judgement by the five most senior judges of the court will hopefully lead to some reconciliation that the country badly needs. The verdict showed ""judicial craftsmanship and statesmanship where the letter of the law was adhered to, but the relief was moulded, taking into account the ground realities,"" lawyer Sanjay Hegde told me. The judges appear to have gone by the evidence laid before it. ""They have applied a plaster. Let's not reopen the wounds,"" Mr Hegde added. Will the verdict lead to a closure of past animosities and help close India's deepening religious fissures? Only time will tell. For the moment, India's main communities need to avoid triumphalism - because eventually there are no victors and vanquished, in what is essentially a contestation of faith. Many Hindus believe the Babri Masjid was actually constructed on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders in the 16th Century. Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols. The two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site. Since then, there have been calls to build a temple on the spot where the mosque once stood. Hinduism is India's majority religion and is thought to be more than 4,000 years old. India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century. Ever since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP first came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions. The call for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya has grown particularly loud, and has mostly come from MPs, ministers and leaders from the BJP since it took office. Restrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by the majority Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of a number of people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle. An uninhibited display of muscular Hindu nationalism in other areas has also contributed to religious tension. Most recently, the country's home minister Amit Shah said he would remove ""illegal migrants"" - understood to be Muslim - from the country through a government scheme that was used recently in the north-eastern state of Assam.

Indian Supreme Court ruling on Ayodhya dispute,"Indian media have gathered outside the Supreme Court in Delhi for the verdict India's Supreme Court is due to make a long-awaited ruling on a disputed religious site in the northern holy city of Ayodhya. Hindus and Muslims have for decades been bitterly divided over the 16th Century Babri mosque site. The judges' decision is due shortly and is said to be unanimous. Officials have appealed for calm, and thousands of police and paramilitary troops have been deployed in the city in Uttar Pradesh state. Hundreds of people were detained on Friday amid fears of violence. The court case centres on the ownership of the land and has been dragging on in the Supreme Court for years. Hindus believe that the site of the mosque is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram, and they want to build a temple there. Muslims, however, say they have worshipped there for generations. Schools and colleges in the area have been closed and all roads leading to the site have been blocked by police. Government departments say they have also made preparations to deal with any violence. Security officials have deployed more than 5,000 officers in Ayodhya ""Each and every security officer is committed to prevent minor skirmishes or large-scale riots after the court delivers its verdict,"" said one senior home ministry official, who declined to be named. ""State governments have identified several schools to set up temporary jails if the need arises."" On Twitter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm and urged everyone to respect the verdict. ""Whatever the verdict... it won't be anybody's win or loss,"" he said. ""My appeal to the people of India is that our priority is to ensure the verdict strengthens the values of peace, equality and goodwill of our country."" At the centre of the row is the 16th Century mosque that was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people. Many Hindus believe that the Babri Masjid was constructed on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders. Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols. Over the decades since, the two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site. Since then, there have been calls to build a temple on the spot where the mosque once stood. Hinduism is India's majority religion and is thought to be more than 4,000 years old. India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century. The long and complicated property dispute has been dragging on in various courts for more than a century. This particular case is being fought between three main parties - two Hindu groups and the Muslim Waqf Board, which is responsible for the maintenance of Islamic properties in India. The Hindu litigants are the Hindu Mahasabha, a right-wing political party, and the Nirmohi Akhara, which is a sect of Hindu monks. Hindus regard the site in Ayodhya as the birthplace of Lord Ram They filed a title dispute in the Allahabad High Court in 2002, a decade after the mosque was demolished. A verdict in that case was pronounced in September 2010 - it determined that the 2.77 acres of the disputed land would be divided equally into three parts. The court ruled that the site should be split, with the Muslim community getting control of a third, Hindus another third and the Nirmohi Akhara sect the remainder. Control of the main disputed section, where the mosque once stood, was given to Hindus. The judgement also made three key observations. It affirmed the disputed spot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, that the Babri Masjid was built after the demolition of a Hindu temple, and that the mosque was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam. The Supreme Court suspended this ruling in 2011 after both Hindu and Muslim groups appealed against it.

Rain relents but chaos continues after floods,"This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater Severe flood warnings and rail cancellations remain in areas of England flooded after a month's worth of rain fell in a single day. Derbyshire and South Yorkshire have been worst hit by the floods, whichclaimed the life of one womanswept away in a river near Matlock. Seven severe flood warnings - deemed a threat to life - remain on the River Don in South Yorkshire. Meanwhile, trains are not running in parts of the East Midlands. Services are cancelled on the Matlock-Derby-Nottingham route and diversions are in place between Derby and Chesterfield, adding about 30 minutes to journeys. The River Derwent burst its banks in Derby city centre South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it had declared a major incident on Friday night and firefighters had rescued more than 40 people from the Fishlake area, near Doncaster. Deputy Chief Fire Officer Alex Johnson advised people to ""keep themselves safe, help each other and don't drive into flood water"". Water sports enthusiast and teacher Mark Ibbotson, from Doncaster, said he, along with his 13-year-old son Logan, had rescued more than 30 people - including two babies - from a number of streets in Bentley where homes have been hit by flooding. ""They keep shouting 'come and help me' and shouting from the windows, asking for help,"" said Mr Ibbotson. Logan said: ""Just to see them all suffering like this, it's been awful."" In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Dozens sleep at shopping centre amid floods Mr Ibbotson continued: ""There was an old couple... when we opened the door, the water was centimetres from pouring in. ""I lifted them in to the boat and later on the water had risen, and I just dread to think what they're going back to."" The teacher said he took his red inflatable boat to help with the rescue efforts in Bentley after his experiences of flooding in 2007. More than 40 people were rescued by firefighters in the Bentley area of Doncaster Chris Hart, from Thorne, near Doncaster, rescued his grandparents from Conyers Road in Bentley and said the flood water was ""pretty deep"", describing the scene  as ""chaos"". In Derby city centre, a number of properties were evacuated on Friday night after the River Derwent burst its banks and officials said a city-wide evacuation had been considered. Matt Lee, from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""All the partner agencies were in contact and had regular meetings to discuss the threat to Derby city that was a very real threat. ""We were very concerned we might have a city centre evacuation. ""Fortunately it [the River Derwent] didn't burst its banks to the extent we thought it would and disaster was averted."" The A52 - the main road route into Derby - remains closed westbound between the city and the M1 along with a handful of smaller roads in the county. Volunteers are helping with the clear-up at Belper Town Football Club A clear-up is under way at Belper Town Football Club after it was flooded on Friday afternoon. Director of football Andy Carter said he was confident things would be back to normal by the club's next home game in a week. In Worksop, Nottinghamshire, water levels are receding after 200 homes and businesses were evacuated on Thursday evening. Bassetlaw District Council said it had closed its emergency rest centre as everyone who had left their homes were with friends and relatives. An evacuation was ordered when part of a cliff gave way on Thursday Residents from 12 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, are still unable to return home after a mudslide on Thursdayled to 35 properties being evacuated. Emergency work to secure a cliff at the former Berry Hill Quarry site is due to start later. The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, hit its highest recorded level at just over 6.3m (21ft), higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham People continued to be rescued from flood-hit towns and cities on Friday. One man told the BBC he carried children from his gym in Rotherham, wading through water that had submerged the streets outside. ""The whole of the gym was completely flooded in water,"" said Neil Wilson. ""We had to wade through water to get children to the cars so they could get home with their parents. ""The way the car park is it's a bit deeper, so when we were carrying kids to the car it was coming up above our knees."" But there was better news overnight into Saturday as the torrential downpours abated. Met Office meteorologist Steven Keates said: ""I think the most important thing is that the areas which have been affected by floods should avoid rain and get some respite."" Children and pets were carried to safety as people evacuated their homes in Doncaster Matlock clothes shop owner Kirsty Gilbert said flooding had ruined a significant amount of her stock. ""We've lost everything that was on the floor - shoes and handbags,"" she said. ""Nearly every business in Matlock has been affected in some way."" Kirsty Gilbert said she arrived at her shop to find shoes floating around On Friday, the floods claimed the life of a woman who was swept into the River Derwent at Rowsley in Derbyshire. Her body was found about two miles away in Darley Dale. She was named earlieras Derbyshire's former High Sherriff Annie Hall. Every time there's serious flooding, questions are asked about why it was allowed to happen. One simple answer is governments of all parties have been accused of not spending enough on protection. You can build walls along river banks and many places have been guarded this way but such 'hard defences' are expensive and obtrusive. An alternative is to employ what are known as soft defences. These include encouraging farmers to manage their land in ways that let fields hold back floodwater. Driveways and car parks can be surfaced with materials that allow it to reach the soil underneath. Another option is to make homes more resilient - fitting exterior doors with waterproof plastic panels, sealing the ground floor and raising fuse boxes. In some ways the country has become better prepared for flooding but lessons are not always learned and the misery for many keeps being repeated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Matlock on Friday and said: ""People have been moved out of their homes and probably hundreds of businesses have seen damage to their properties. ""We stand ready to help in any way that we can."" On the cause of the flooding, he added: ""We are seeing more and more serious flooding - perhaps because of building, almost certainly because of climate change. ""We need to prepare and we need to be investing in those defences."" Have you been affected by flooding? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Who are the victims in the Essex lorry tragedy?The BBC speaks to friends and family of Vietnamese nationals who died in the Essex lorry tragedy.UK,"A relative lights an incense stick in front of a portrait of Bui Thi Nhung The names of 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex have been released by police. Many of their families had feared the worst ever since the bodies were discovered in the early hours of 23 October. The BBC has been speaking to friends and relatives of those who died about how they came to be the victims of the tragedy. This article will be updated as further information about the victims comes to light. The family of Pham Thi Tra Mysaid they paid Â£30,000 to people smugglersto get her to the UK. Miss Tra My, who was from Vietnam's Ha Tinh province, flew to China before travelling via France and Belgium, according to her brother. He told the BBC she first attempted to cross the border to the UK on 19 October but was caught and turned back. The last message the family received from her was at 22:30 BST on 22 October - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The texts, sent to her parents, read: ""I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed. ""I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."" Nguyen Dinh Luong, also from Ha Tinh, had been living in France but hoped to work in a nail salon in the UK. The last his father heard from him was in mid-October, explaining that the journey would cost Â£11,000. Vietnamese lorry death victims named Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families Vietnamese man's son feared dead in lorry incident Mr Thang was a father from Ha Tinh province. Among the youngest of the victims, Mr Hung was also from Ha Tinh. He wanted to join his parents who live in the UK, his brother told local media. His sister asked for help to find him in a Facebook post after the lorry was discovered. She wrote that he flew from Hanoi to Russia on 26 August, then to France on 6 October, but that the family lost contact when he went to the UK on 21 October. A friend who lives in Glasgow did not want to be identified, buttold the BBC he had been due to meet upwith Miss Tho - who was from Nghe An province - when she arrived in the UK. Her eyes are blurred in this image at the request of her family. Bui Thi Nhung left her job in a clothes shop in Nghe An province to travel to the UK using money that her friends had helped her raise. Once there Miss Nhung, who was also known as Anna, hoped to meet up with friends and family, and to work to pay off debt owed by her late father. She was the youngest of four siblings - and the most educated -her sister Bui Thi Loan told the BBC. The sisters had exchanged messages on Facebook on 21 October, when Miss Nhung said she was fine and ""in storage"". Originally from Nghe An province, Mr Nam had been working in Romania and planned to travel to the UK. His family did not want to be interviewed. Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26,borrowed thousands of poundswhen he was discharged from the military in order to get married and build a house. But with no work available in his hometown in Nghe An province, he went abroad to seek employment and repay his debts, leaving behind his wife and 18-month-old baby. Mr Tu paid smugglers the equivalent of around Â£4,960 in the hope of making it to the UK, according to AFP news agency. Le Van Ha left his heavily pregnant wife and young son behind in Nghe An province when he began his journey to the UK in June. He went insearch of better-paid work to repay moneythat his family had borrowed to build their house. His father, Le Minh Tuan, mortgaged two plots of land to fund the Â£20,000 journey. ""I don't know when we can ever pay it back. I'm an old man now, my health is poor, and I have to help bring up his children,"" he said. Less than two weeks before his body was found in Essex, Nguyen Van Hung was photographed with his cousin, Hoang Van Tiep, at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The music graduate had tricked his parents when he left Nghe An to join his cousin in France last year, leaving his passport at home and travelling on a different one. He found work in a kitchen but had spoken about how it was hard, and said he wanted to grow marijuana in the UK. Hoang Van Tiep, Nguyen Van Hung's cousin, left Nghe An province for France in 2017, funded by his mother, who borrowed money from banks and relatives to fund the trip. Once there, he worked illegally at a restaurant, his mother said. He was arrested multiple times and his passport was taken. On being threatened with deportation, he told his mother he wanted to travel to the UK. Having worked in his family's timber business, Mr Thai had often talked about leaving Nghe An province and going abroad. He told his family he was going to Germany for business, his mother told the BBC. But after several phone calls in the first few days, they stopped hearing from him. Mr Hung, who was from Thua Thien - Hue province, had been speaking to his family about trying to get to the UK in mid-October, according to his brother-in-law, Tom Wright, who is a US citizen but lives with his wife in Vietnam. Believing that he would have a better life in the UK, Mr Hung's mother agreed to pay the estimated $15,000 (Â£11,800). He was in regular contact with his family while travelling through Europe, sending a photo of himself and a friend in front of the Eiffel Tower. He told his mother that he would be boarding a truck and would contact her in a few days, once he had reached the UK - but he never did. Mr Du left his home in Ha Tinh province in June, staying in Germany for 15 days and France for three months, hisfather told Vietnamese media.,external The last his father heard from him was on 22 October, when he called to say he was about to leave for the UK.
