MPs to have Brexit vote by 12 March,"This video can not be played May: Brexit deal ""within grasp"" for 29 March MPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. Speaking as she travelled to an EU-Arab League summit in Egypt, Mrs May ruled out holding another so-called ""meaningful vote"" this week. But she said ""positive"" talks with the EU were ""still ongoing"" and leaving on 29 March was ""within our grasp"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of ""recklessly running down the clock"". In a tweet,external, he said the move was intended to ""force MPs to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal"". Labour, he said, would ""work with MPs across the Commons to prevent no deal, break the deadlock and build support for our alternative plan"". Brexit must not be frustrated, May vows Cabinet trio issue Brexit delay warning Brexit: A really simple guide A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame On the plane to Sharm el-Sheikh for a summit between EU and Arab league leaders, Mrs May said her team would be returning to the Belgian capital on Tuesday for further talks. ""As a result of that, we won't bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March,"" she added. Mrs May has already met European Council President Donald Tusk for talks after landing in Egypt and will meet other EU leaders on the fringes of the summit later. She said negotiations were continuing over the backstop - the controversial policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - after Parliament voted for her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to what is set out in her deal. It's true that playing for time is a powerful, if cynical, political strategy and the Labour Party - and lots of Conservatives too - are annoyed that Downing Street seems to be dragging its feet like this and won't give MPs a formal thumbs up or thumbs down vote for more than another fortnight. The prime minister naming the next vote day might do a little to calm the tempers of those in government who have been very publicly suggesting that strategy is madness. 12 March is at least, for them, before the next EU summit. It is not, as these things go, the final, final, moment. Reckless, many will suggest, but not a total kamikaze mission. But it won't stop the senior MPs Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, still pushing for a vote next week for their own bill that would force the government to delay Brexit if they don't have a deal in place by... guess when? 13 March. Oh look - the day AFTER Number 10's new deadline. Here, the date of 12 March suggests that the government is, as one source suggested, ""planning for every eventuality"". In other words - they think it's likely MPs might indeed vote this week to extend the process if a deal hasn't been done. Read Laura's blog Mrs May also rejected an accusation - made last week by MP Anna Soubry as she quit the Conservative Party - that she had a ""personal problem"" with immigration. ""I have consistently said that immigration has been good for this country,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""It's important that we have welcomed people coming to the country over the years - both people migrating to the UK for work purposes but also crucially those many refugees and asylum seekers."" This video can not be played Anna Soubry tells Newsnight's Kirsty Wark she was 'worried' the prime minister had a problem with immigration. And she also made clear that she wants to stay on in Number 10 after the first phase of Brexit finishes, despitehaving promised her MPsshe would not fight the next election. She said her job ""is not just about delivering Brexit"" and ""there is still a domestic agenda that I want to get on with."" Yvette Cooper called the latest delay ""utterly shambolic"",tweeting,external: ""Each time we get closer to cliff edge. How are businesses, public services and families supposed to plan in this chaos?"" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, alsocalled,externalthe delay ""unacceptable"". And the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, said it was ""unbelievable"" to leave the vote so close to the planned exit date. Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, MPs will get another chance to put forward a range of amendments to show what direction they want Brexit to take. Top of the list is the Cooper-Letwin amendment - and cabinet ministers Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gaukewrote in the Daily Mail,externalthat they would be forced to back it if the pro-Leave European Research Group (ERG) - made up of Tory backbenchers - stood in the way of the withdrawal deal being agreed ""in the next few days"". The ERG would then have ""no-one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit,"" the trio said. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has urged his cabinet colleagues against backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment, calling for ""unity"" behind the PM. This video can not be played Gove: âI will do everything I can to persuade colleagues to stay in government.â Labour is also likely to table an amendment on Wednesday, putting its own Brexit plan - one which backs a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its single market - to MPs. While it's likely to be rejected, the moment could still be significant. The party's conference last September bound the leadership to explore all remaining alternatives to the PM's Brexit plan, including a public vote, if it wasn't able to force a general election. Efforts to get an election have failed, so if Labour's own Brexit plan is defeated in the Commons, the only remaining option would be a new referendum. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that ""we are heading in that direction"", but ""there is still more play in the days ahead"". Mr Watson said the leadership was also looking at an amendment drawn up by two backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which would be tabled whenever the next meaningful vote is held. Under the terms of that amendment, Labour MPs would support the prime minister's Brexit deal in exchange for it then being put to a public vote. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warnedon Sunday that his government could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"", on which the border played a key part. He accused the UK government of wanting to change the backstop to ""placate a group in the Conservative Party who are insisting on moving the prime minister away from her own policies"", and reiterated that the EU would not re-open the withdrawal agreement. But he told Sky News they would try to ""provide reassurance and clarification for the British Parliament to allow them to ratify this deal"". Speaking from the summit on Sunday, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it ""would be good to postpone Brexit"" if the deal was not agreed by the beginning of March.

US to delay tariffs on Chinese goods,"President Donald Trump has said that the US and China are ""very very close"" to signing a trade agreement, potentially ending the long-running feud between the two countries. Mr Trump told US governors on Monday that both nations ""are going to have a signing summit"". ""Hopefully, we can get that completed. But we're getting very, very close,"" he said. It follows a decision to delay imposing further trade tariffs on Chinese goods. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Three things the US and China will never agree on What is a trade war? At the weekend, Mr Trump said both sides had made ""substantial progress"" in trade talks following a summit in Washington last week. The rise in import duties on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% was due to come into effect on 1 March. Instead, Mr Trump said the US is now planning a summit with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping at the US President's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. US shares rose on the decision to delay tariffs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 0.23% higher at 26,091.9. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also finished trading in positive territory. As he prepared to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam, Mr Trump also tweeted that a China trade deal was in ""advanced stages"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump's decision to delay tariff increases on $200bn (Â£153bn) worth of Chinese goods was seen as a sign that the two sides were moving ahead in settling their damaging trade war. Last week, Mr Trump noted progress in the latest round of negotiations in Washington, including an agreement on currency manipulation, though no details were disclosed. Sources toldCNBC,externalon Friday that China had committed to buying up to $1.2 trillion in US goods, but there had been no progress on the intellectual property issues. President Trump met China's Vice Premier Liu He on Friday Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said: ""We had anticipated such a delay and believe a handshake agreement in which China will promise to import more agricultural products, work towards a stable currency and reinforce intellectual property rights protection will be achieved in the coming weeks. ""However, we don't foresee a significant rollback of existing tariffs, and see underlying tensions regarding China's strategic ambitions, its industrial policy, technological transfers and 'verification and enforcement' mechanisms remaining in place."" Mr Trump initiated the trade war over complaints of unfair Chinese trading practices. That included accusing China of stealing intellectual property from American firms, forcing them to transfer technology to China. The US has imposed tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $267bn worth of Chinese products - which would see virtually all of Chinese imports into the US become subject to duties. The trade dispute has unnerved financial markets, risks raising costs for American companies and is adding pressure to aChinese economy that is already showing signs of strain. It has also stoked fears about the impact on the global economy. Last year, the International Monetary Fund warned the trade war between the US and China riskedmaking the world a ""poorer and more dangerous place"".

What does the new date tell us?,"The PM spoke to reporters on a plane to the EU-Arab League summit in Egypt and again when she arrived There's now another date for your Brexit diaries. Let's face it, many big days have come and gone. But in an opaque process, even the selection of dates tell us something of what's going on. And the prime minister'sannouncement todayof the next meaningful vote by 12 March tells us rather a lot about a game of chicken, a tango and a cunning wheeze. This will make sense soon, I promise. First off, MPs who are pushing the prime minister to rule out the idea of leaving the EU without a formal deal are already busy being professionally cross this afternoon that the government won't put its plan to Parliament to reject or approve this week. It's true that playing for time is a powerful, if cynical, political strategy and the Labour Party - and lots of Conservatives too - are annoyed that Downing Street seems to be dragging its feet like this and won't give MPs a formal thumbs up or thumbs down vote for more than another fortnight. That's even though we are still, of course, heading day by day closer to our departure date. MPs to have final Brexit vote by 12 March Theresa May: Brexit deal 'within grasp' for 29 March Brexit: A really simple guide The prime minister naming the next vote day might do a little to calm the tempers of those in government who have been very publicly suggesting that strategy is madness. 12 March is at least, for them, before the next EU summit. It is not, as these things go, the final, final, moment. Reckless, many will suggest, but not a total kamikaze mission. But it won't stop the senior MPs Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, still pushing for a vote next week for their own bill that would force the government to delay Brexit if they don't have a deal in place by... guess when? 13 March. Oh look - the day AFTER Number 10's new deadline. Here, the date of 12 March suggests that the government is, as one source suggested, ""planning for every eventuality"". In other words - they think it's likely MPs might indeed vote this week to extend the process if a deal hasn't been done. Ready for the cunning wheeze? The prime minister did not want to answer questions on the plane about what she would do in that circumstance. It's absolutely plain that she doesn't want to delay Brexit in any way. An extension, in her view, doesn't solve any of the dilemmas. But she has also never actually 100% said that she would never, ever, ever end up doing that. Simply, she can't, because Parliament might take the decision out of her hands, or the prospect of a defeat might force her to move. Indeed, a senior figure in government is convinced that Number 10 will find a way, if the votes are stacking up, of taking leaving without a deal off the table by implication, next week. They said it would be ""difficult to envisage her actually saying it"". Theresa May is not about to dance down Downing Street declaring that she would never take us out of the EU without a deal. But she might try to pre-empt a defeat in Parliament next week that would force her to do just that. The source suggests, if for example, the PM was to make a point about the executive's ""constitutional deference to the Commons"" that might just do the trick - avoid losing another Brexit vote but make it clear that if it's there is a majority in Parliament to stop us leaving without a deal when the meaningful vote come back, she would be bound by it. One cabinet minister tonight believes and hopes Number 10 is preparing for that kind of concession - ""that would be the clever thing to do"" - with the threat ever present of course that if she doesn't, she really may this time lose more ministers from her government. Of course that might bring Brexiteer fury raining down on her head, but Number 10 might find deferring to the Commons, a cute defence against those Eurosceptics who've argued for so long for Parliament to be sovereign. Mrs May with EU Council President Donald Tusk at the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh In other words - Theresa May does not want to countenance delaying Brexit, not for one moment. But she might find next week she has to, at least by implication, accept she might have no choice. And more cunningly (perhaps), because Number 10's new deadline is 12 March, she can carry on trying to tweak her Brexit deal at the same time. Love the idea or hate the idea, just as at home, EU leaders are now openly talking about such a delay because it is not, as Leo Varadkar said, ""not a game of chicken, we're not playing poker"". Sure, there is political brinksmanship, but on all sides, as our planned departure date comes nearer, the seriousness of the potential consequences come into sharper view. And if there were to be no deal, a 12 March vote would give the government a few weeks to rush through as many measures as they could to smooth out possible disruption. It would also, in theory, give the government a couple of weeks to theoretically have another go - a Meaningful Vote 3. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit video explainers: What is it all about? How the second vote goes will in large part depend on the concessions, tweaks or extra legal verbiage the prime minister manages to achieve. Remember the big problem is still the Irish backstop - the legal guarantee in the deal that there won't be a return to the hard border between Northern Ireland and the South. Brexiteers fear that if it were ever triggered the UK would be stuck in a close relationship with the EU forever. That's why therefore Number 10 and the attorney general are working on extra assurances to underline that it would be temporary. But of course, they need the EU to agree. But again the date tells us something about how this might unfold. 12 March is before the next planned summit with the other EU countries. Planning the vote for then suggests that Number 10 is working on a plan with Brussels' top brass that would be signed off theoretically, then they hope voted through Parliament, and then, in the words of one Number 10 source, ""rubber stamped"" by the final leaders' summit in March. This makes sense of the continued insistence from the EU side that the UK has to ""show a majority"", before the 27 will approve something. European Commission President Juncker spoke about Brexit as he arrived at the EU-Arab League summit on Sunday There's an emerging sense in Downing Street that the additional assurances to the backstop are likely to be agreed with President Jean-Claude Juncker, who said, arriving at the summit tonight, ""you need two to dance tango. I know how to dance, ok?"" The final deal therefore, that might be put to Parliament, might be conditional. Having been burnt before, EU leaders won't collectively put their names to it unless and until it's been agreed with the EU Commission, then approved by Parliament, then on their desk. As ever with Brexit, take this with a hefty dose of caveats. Any or all of the moves the prime minister might take will be met with heavy criticism from the many different tribes with skin in this game. Any or all may not come to pass. But the choice of 12 March does tell us more about where the prime minister might go next.

US and China extend trade talks,"Mr Trump said he thought a deal was ""more likely"" than not Chinese negotiators have agreed to extend their stay in Washington, as the US and China push to strike a trade deal. The decision was the latest sign that the two countries may be nearing an agreement, as they look for a way out of last year's punishing trade war. In a statement shared by the White House, Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed ""progress"" in the negotiations. US President Donald Trump also said a deal was ""more likely"" than not. ""The fact that they're willing to stay for quite a bit longer... that means something,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""I think there's a good chance that it happens."" The US and China placed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of the others' goods last year as they faced off on trade. The US had initially threatened to increase tariffs on $200bn worth of goods from 10% to 25% if the two sides could not agree a deal by 1 March. ButMr Trump has appeared more flexiblerecently, as negotiators meet in Washington for a fourth round of talks. The top negotiators from the two sides: Robert Lighthizer and Liu He On Friday, Mr Trump did not commit to extending the deadline, but he did note progress, including an agreement on currency manipulation, the details of which were not disclosed. He also said he may meet with Mr Xi in March at his Mar-A-Lago resort. Huawei has not been part of the discussions to date, he added. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Will the US and China finally agree a trade deal? China's Vice Premier Liu He, who has been leading the talks for the Chinese, said his team was ""ready"" for a deal. ""From China, we believe that it is very likely that it will happen,"" he said. Washington wants Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies and other support. China has offered to increase purchases of US goods, such as soybeans and semiconductors - a move that could reduce the US trade deficit, a focus for Mr Trump. However, the country is unlikely to embrace broader structural changes, which are seen by some internally as a way to contain its rise. On Friday, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has been leading talks for the US, warned that ""major hurdles"" remain before a final agreement can be signed.

Ireland 'not playing chicken' on backstop,"The taoiseach was speaking at a EU-Arab League joint summit in Egypt on Sunday The Republic of Ireland is ""not playing chicken"" with its stance on the Brexit backstop, Leo Varadkar has warned. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) was speaking in Egypt on Sunday as Theresa May attempts to seek changes to herrejected withdrawal agreement. He reiterated that his government would not accept a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit clause for the UK. ""We are not playing poker, we are just standing by our position which has been solid since day one,"" he said. Ireland and the EU: A special case What does Ireland do if there's no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""We are happy to discuss with the United Kingdom assurances that they may need to give them further confidence that the backstop - were it ever applied - will not be permanent,"" he told reporters at an EU-Arab League summit. His comments come as theprime minister announced that MPs will have a final vote on the Brexit deal on 12 March. The taoiseach said the announcement would have no impact on the position of the Republic of Ireland or the EU. Earlier, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney stated that his country could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"". However, he said Ireland could show more flexibility after a deal has been done. Mr Coveney told Sky News said that while the EU stands firm on not changing the withdrawal agreement On Friday, his governmentunveiled the major legislation it has prepared to manage a no-deal scenario. It covers a wide range of emergency measures that will be enacted if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Mrs May has ruled out a parliamentary vote on the deal before the end of February. She is trying to renegotiate the backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mr Coveney told Sky News said that while the EU stands firm on not changing the withdrawal agreement it is trying to ""provide reassurance and clarification for the British parliament to allow them to ratify this deal"". He said Brexit was ""not just about Westminster"". ""If Britain wants a deal you can't ask Ireland to compromise on something as fundamental as a peace process and relationships linked to the Good Friday Agreement in order to get a deal through,"" he said. Mr Coveney added that the government's position was ""about placating a group in the Conservative Party who are insisting on moving the prime minister away from her own policies"". ""The backstop was a British government construct as much as it was an EU and Irish government construct. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. ""This is about a shared responsibility,"" he added. He again reiterated the need for a guarantee to those in border counties that they will not face physical or security border infrastructure. ""Surely that not an unreasonable request."" The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March. However, the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time. Finding a solution for the Irish border is a major sticking pointing the Brexit talks Mrs May is expected to hold talks with European Council president Donald Tuskand other key EU figures in Egypt later during a summit between leaders of EU and Arab league countries. But Downing Street has played down hopes of a breakthrough on her Brexit deal being reached in Sharm el- Sheikh. The summit is the first between leaders of EU and Arab league countries and will focus on tackling concerns over security and migration, and boosting trade.

Venezuela defectors 'fear for families',"A number of defectors have spoken to the BBC Venezuelan soldiers who defected into Colombia on Saturday say they fear for the safety of their families under President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. Speaking exclusively to the BBC's Orla Guerin, one defector aged 23 says he is worried forces loyal to the president may ""lash out against my family"". ""But I think it was the best decision I could have made,"" he adds. More than 100 soldiers are said to have defected, most during deadly clashes over aid deliveries on Saturday. Tensions were high after President Maduro sent troops to block roads and bridges at the borders of neighbouring Brazil and Colombia, where food and medicine deliveries, organised by the US, were set to enter the country. What next for Venezuelaâs opposition? Venezuela crisis - in nine charts At various crossing points, Venezuelan security forces fired tear gas at volunteers and protesters burning outposts and throwing stones at soldiers and riot police. By Orla Guerin, BBC News, in Colombia near the Venezuelan border We met the deserters - male and female - one day after they laid down their weapons and left their posts.  They have found sanctuary in a Catholic church, with a discreet security presence outside. Some seemed to be in shock over the violent scenes this weekend when Venezuelan troops fired on their own people with teargas and rubber bullets. The parish priest who took them in told us many arrived battered and bruised. The deserters said they had fled because their homeland needed change, and their children needed food. After speaking on the phone to a loved one, one young officer wept openly. Most of those we met were foot soldiers. They said the top brass was still bound  - by corruption - to President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, and that he would fight to stay in power. But they said he had lost the rank and file who were putting their faith in the opposition leader, Juan GuaidÃ³. After agreeing to speak with the BBC on condition of anonymity, a group of Venezuelan deserters based in a church in CÃºcuta described what pushed them to leave President Maduro's armed forces. This video can not be played The moment Venezuelan troops crashed through border into Colombia ""There are many professional troops who want to do this. This will be a domino effect. This will have significant influence on the armed forces,"" one 29-year-old man said. ""The armed forces have broken down because of so many corrupt officers. ""The professional military is tired. We cannot remain slaves, we are freeing ourselves,"" he added. Who is buying Venezuela's oil? Genuine aid or a Trojan horse? Another defector, a woman, described the mood on Saturday as ""tense"", adding: ""I was thinking I could not harm my own people. ""My daughter is still in Venezuela and that is what hurts the most. But I did this for her. It's difficult because I don't know what they might do to her."" A third said he felt pain at seeing the Venezuelan people on the streets fighting for humanitarian aid. Demonstrators clashed with Venezuelan security forces at the borders of Colombia and Brazil ""I felt impotent and useless. I felt pain for everything happening,"" he said. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Maduro's ""days are numbered"" following the deadly events at the weekend. ""Picking exact days is difficult.

"Venezuela defectors 'fear for families'Defecting troops tell the BBC President Maduro's government may ""lash out"" at their loved ones.Latin America & Caribbean","A number of defectors have spoken to the BBC Venezuelan soldiers who defected into Colombia on Saturday say they fear for the safety of their families under President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. Speaking exclusively to the BBC's Orla Guerin, one defector aged 23 says he is worried forces loyal to the president may ""lash out against my family"". ""But I think it was the best decision I could have made,"" he adds. More than 100 soldiers are said to have defected, most during deadly clashes over aid deliveries on Saturday. Tensions were high after President Maduro sent troops to block roads and bridges at the borders of neighbouring Brazil and Colombia, where food and medicine deliveries, organised by the US, were set to enter the country. What next for Venezuelaâs opposition? Venezuela crisis - in nine charts At various crossing points, Venezuelan security forces fired tear gas at volunteers and protesters burning outposts and throwing stones at soldiers and riot police. By Orla Guerin, BBC News, in Colombia near the Venezuelan border We met the deserters - male and female - one day after they laid down their weapons and left their posts.  They have found sanctuary in a Catholic church, with a discreet security presence outside. Some seemed to be in shock over the violent scenes this weekend when Venezuelan troops fired on their own people with teargas and rubber bullets. The parish priest who took them in told us many arrived battered and bruised. The deserters said they had fled because their homeland needed change, and their children needed food. After speaking on the phone to a loved one, one young officer wept openly. Most of those we met were foot soldiers. They said the top brass was still bound  - by corruption - to President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, and that he would fight to stay in power. But they said he had lost the rank and file who were putting their faith in the opposition leader, Juan GuaidÃ³. After agreeing to speak with the BBC on condition of anonymity, a group of Venezuelan deserters based in a church in CÃºcuta described what pushed them to leave President Maduro's armed forces. This video can not be played The moment Venezuelan troops crashed through border into Colombia ""There are many professional troops who want to do this. This will be a domino effect. This will have significant influence on the armed forces,"" one 29-year-old man said. ""The armed forces have broken down because of so many corrupt officers. ""The professional military is tired. We cannot remain slaves, we are freeing ourselves,"" he added. Who is buying Venezuela's oil? Genuine aid or a Trojan horse? Another defector, a woman, described the mood on Saturday as ""tense"", adding: ""I was thinking I could not harm my own people. ""My daughter is still in Venezuela and that is what hurts the most. But I did this for her. It's difficult because I don't know what they might do to her."" A third said he felt pain at seeing the Venezuelan people on the streets fighting for humanitarian aid. Demonstrators clashed with Venezuelan security forces at the borders of Colombia and Brazil ""I felt impotent and useless. I felt pain for everything happening,"" he said. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Maduro's ""days are numbered"" following the deadly events at the weekend. ""Picking exact days is difficult. I'm confident that the Venezuelan people will ensure that Maduro's days are numbered,"" Mr Pompeo told CNN. At least two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro.

"Family of seven found after dinghy searchThey have been transferred to immigration officials for interview, the Home Office says.Kent","The Border Force operation could be seen from St Margaret's Bay A family of seven were found by police after an empty dinghy was spotted drifting off the coast of Kent, the Home Office has said. The group - a mother, father and five children - have been transferred to immigration officials for interview. The Home Office said the boat, seen off the coast at Kingsdown at about 04:20 GMT, was recovered a mile offshore.

Children to be taught about FGM harm,"Secondary school pupils in England will be taught about the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM) by 2020. The new guidelines, to be announced on Monday, form part of the introduction of compulsory relationships and sex education classes in secondary schools. The new guidance says secondary schools should address the physical and emotional damage caused by FGM. The practice was outlawed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2003 and in Scotland in 2005. FGM is the deliberate cutting or removal of a female's external genitalia. Lessons will also raise awareness of the support that is available, and ensure children know that FGM is against the law. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the reforms to relationships and sex education curriculum will ensure young people are taught about different forms of abuse and their rights under the law in an age-appropriate way. He said: ""We know that FGM can have a catastrophic effect on the lives of those affected, causing life-long physical and psychological damage. ""Everyone must do all they can to protect women and girls from this extreme form of gendered violence. ""There's a legislation aspect, and enforcement, but just as important is awareness and challenging assumptions - which is why we are making sure all pupils are given all the facts at secondary school."" FGM: What is female genital mutilation? Law to make FGM reporting mandatory Sex education compulsory in schools According to the NSPCC, there are an estimated 137,000 women and girls affected by FGM in England and Wales. Since July 2015, 296 Female Genital Mutilation Protection Orders have been made to safeguard people at risk. Nimco Ali, FGM campaigner and director of the charity Daughters of Eve, said: ""As a child I had no idea FGM was illegal, I just knew it was painful. It took me years to piece together what happened to me and why I felt the way I did about it. ""Had I been given the education now being introduced, I would have been able to support those in my family to understand, and prevent other girls from being cut."" The new reforms, which will be presented to Parliament, will include relationship education for primary age pupils, relationships and sex education (RSE) for all secondary pupils. Health education will also be taught to pupils of all ages in state-funded schools in England, including academies, grammar schools and free schools. Secondary school pupils will also be taught about other forms of honour-based abuse, as well as grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse as part of a strengthened curriculum. This video can not be played Itâs estimated one in 20 girls and women in the world have undergone some form of FGM Sex and relationship education is part of the curriculum in Wales, but it is not currently compulsory. The Welsh government are consulting on new guidance for schools on sexual education, which includes FGM. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Education requires each school to have its own written policy on how it will address the delivery of relationship and sexuality education (RSE). Whilst FGM is not currently in the curriculum, last year the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland launched an awareness campaign after the Belfast Trust identified 17 cases of FGM over a nine-month period, involving women aged 24 to 46. The curriculum in Scotland is non-statutory and decisions about which topics are included in the curriculum is a matter for schools and local authorities to decide, however new guidance on sex education was introduced in 2014. Although the practice is not covered as part of the curriculum, Scottish ministers published a consultation paper introducing a bill on FGM last year. What is FGM? Video, 00:01:56What is FGM?

Huawei Mate X smartphone folds face out,"This video can not be played WATCH: First look at Huawei's folding phone Huawei has revealed its first smartphone to feature a foldable screen, less than a week after its rival Samsung did the same. The rival handset-tablet hybrids have contrasting designs. Huawei's Mate X places its fold-out screen on the outside of the device, so that it covers the front and rear of the phone when closed. In both modes, the display is larger than Samsung's. Huawei's device is also flatter and thinner when shut. Samsung's Fold does not appear to fold flat when closed However, unlike Samsung's Galaxy Fold it does not have a second display on its reverse side. One analyst attending the launch event in Barcelona also remarked that a crease in the screen appeared to be visible. LG's 'foldable phone' breaks apart Nokia 9 uses five cameras to take a photo Microsoft's HoloLens 2 tracks eyes and hands Samsung reveals Galaxy Fold and S10 5G The Chinese company allowed attendees at the event to get a close look at the handset following its unveiling. Its South Korean competitor has yet to let outsiders to do so with the Galaxy Fold. ""Security concerns about Huawei's 5G kit are a shadow hanging over the whole of this year's Mobile World Congress,"" commented the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. ""But the firm was determined in a confident, even arrogant press conference to convey that it's now the leading innovator in smartphones."" The Mate X went on display to the media after being unveiled in Barcelona For comparison's sake, Huawei said: the Mate X's screen is 8in (20.3cm) when unfolded when closed, the Mate X's larger screen is 6.8in and the smaller one 6.6in - which makes both bigger than that of the iPhone XS Max when shut, the Mate X is 11mm (0.43in) thick the Samsung Galaxy Fold's main screen is 7.3in (18.5cm) when unfolded the Fold's other display is 4.6in the Fold measures 17mm (0.67in) thick at its widest point when closed Unlike the Fold, the Mate X does not place any of its cameras on the same side as its screen when unfolded. The Huawei Mate X's screen goes ""edge-to-edge"" across the device when open Instead they are placed on the flipside of the device on a strip that also features a fingerprint sensor. This runs down the side of the smaller of the two folded displays when closed and doubles up as a side-grip when open. This potentially places the Mate X at a disadvantage to the Fold, since it becomes impossible to use its unfolded screen to take selfies.

Huawei said the Mate X would come with one of its existing 5G modems and could download a one gigabyte movie in as little as three seconds if a fast enough connection was available. Like Samsung's device, it also features a battery on each of its two sides, but claims to be able to recharge more quickly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Both foldable phones are 5G-capable and are instantly distinctive from the smartphone designs of the last 10 years,"" commented Ian Fogg, an analyst at the mobile analytics company Opensignal. ""But 5G is arriving on regular designed smartphones too, at lower prices, and more quickly. ""Because of that, more people will experience the benefits of 5G this year than the novelty of an expanding smartphone display."" The Mate X has been priced to start at 2,299 euros ($2,600; Â£1996) and is due to go on sale from the middle of this year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That compares to the $1,980 figure quoted by Samsung, although once taxes are taken into account the gap should be smaller. Huawei's consumer devices chief Richard Yu acknowledged that the price was ""very expensive"" but said he hoped it would be reduced over time. There were claps and cheers as Richard Yu finally unveiled Huawei's latest masterpiece after three years in development - the folding phone. And the hits just kept on coming: its split-screen function, its dimensions - gleefully compared to those of the iPhone and Galaxy Fold - even a protective case got its own round of applause. However, the biggest gasps came right at the end - when he announced the price tag. At 2,299 euros, even the hardcore enthusiasts appeared to wince. Everybody who charged to the demonstration area afterwards was disappointed as the handsets remained frustratingly behind Perspex. Still, the Mate X has still done enough to secure its ""wow factor"" at MWC. But that price and Huawei's wider controversies threaten to act as a deterrent to even deep-pocketed early adopters. Two other Chinese companies have also unveiled new handsets ahead of Monday's start of the Mobile World Congress trade show. Oppo has showed off a handset with a 10x optical zoom. Oppo has yet to name its 10x zoom camera phone Unlike digital zooms, there is no loss of quality as the shot tightens in. The three cameras involved do not need to extend from the phone to achieve this. Instead, the device features a periscope-like system inside its chassis. This lets it range between focal lengths of 16mm and 160mm. The innovation builds on an earlier prototype, which was never put into production, that offered a 5x zoom. Allow Twitter content?

However, the design means the handset is by necessity thicker than most rivals. In addition, the company announced it would soon launch 5G handsets in Australia, Singapore, Switzerland and China. Xiaomi also held a press conference where it revealed its forthcoming flagship Mi 9 handset will cost 449 euros when it launches in Europe. Xiaomi expanded to the UK last year It features three rear cameras, one of which offers 48 megapixel resolution. In addition, the firm said it intended to launch a 5G handset - the Mi Mix 3 5G - costing 599 euros, which is likely to be one of the lowest-cost models to be compatible with next-generation networks.

Chelsea keeper refuses to be substituted,"Maurizio Sarri was preparing to bring on Willy Caballero Have you ever seen anything like it? A player refusing to go off - and his manager losing the plot. Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga resisted Maurizio Sarri's attempt to substitute him late in extra time of the Carabao Cup final, which left his manager seething on the touchline. Kepa had just been treated for cramp and, with the game at 0-0, Sarri was preparing to bring on reserve keeper Willy Caballero in his place before a penalty shootout. But after some furious finger-wagging and screams of ""NO!"", Sarri was forced to give in. Referee Jonathan Moss ran over to confirm whether Kepa was going off or not and Sarri, begrudgingly, backed down and then stormed off down the tunnel before quickly returning, leaving Caballero a bemused spectator. 'This was a painful, public indignity' - has Sarri been fatally undermined? Man City win Carabao Cup penalty shootout Arrizabalaga incident a misunderstanding - Sarri 'Kepa has completely undermined Sarri' Kepa went on to save Leroy Sane's spot-kick - prompting a fist pump from Sarri - but Raheem Sterling netted the winning penalty as Manchester City won the shootout 4-3 to lift the Carabao Cup for a second year in a row. Sarri didn't react at full-time and went straight off the pitch, while his players looked dejected in defeat. This video can not be played Kepa situation was big misunderstanding - Sarri Former Blues striker Chris Sutton described the scenes as ""mutiny at Chelsea"" and said Kepa ""should never play for the club again"". The incident comes after weeks of speculation surrounding Sarri's position as manager andconcerns over his style of play,the so-called ""Sarri-ball"". ""That should be his last performance in a Chelsea shirt,"" Sutton told BBC Radio 5 live. ""He's a disgrace. I've never seen anything like it. ""If I was Sarri I would walk. You cannot be undermined. Why weren't the players dragging Kepa off anyway? ""Kepa should be sacked, not Sarri. He's been undermined - it's the worst thing that can happen to a manager."" This video can not be played 'Kepa has completely undermined Maurizio Sarri' Former England and Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas said it is clear ""there's a lack of respect"" for the manager, but said Sarri showed ""a lack of class"" by storming off the pitch following defeat. ""His players have done him proud today,"" Jenas told BBC Radio 5 live. ""They are an inferior team to Manchester City now and they took them all the way. For him not to be congratulating the opposition or consoling his players shows a lack of class for me. ""The fact he went inside and was not out there with his players is one thing, but it has to be infuriating for one of your players to categorically tell you to 'do one' and say I'm staying on this pitch. ""This is a huge blemish. It all boils down to what is going on between Sarri and his players. That does not happen - there's a lack of respect somewhere along the line."" Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga goes down with cramp towards the end of extra time Reserve keeper Willy Caballero is ready to come on Kepa screams back at his manager and signifies he doesn't want to be taken off Maurizio Sarri (left) responds furiously to Kepa while his assistant Gianfranco Zola looks perplexed Referee Jonathan Moss joins in to ask Sarri whether he wants to bring off his keeper Chelsea defender David Luiz tries to calm Kepa down on the pitch Reserve keeper Caballero is left confused in the dugout, unsure whether the substitution is being made Sarri storms down the tunnel and the whistle is blown for the end of extra time Tony: What? Kepa on the transfer market tomorrow I think. Craig: Chelsea keeper has zero respect for the manager! Don't care who you are, if he wants you off he wants you off. Jonathan:Sounds like Sarri has lost the dressing room, the bench and his mind. Robert: Disgusting! Kepa has just publicly embarrassed Sarri in front of everyone. Total disgrace. Callum: I'm with Kepa there I don't think he should come off, he's played the full game so confidence is high, I don't agree with goalkeepers being subbed for penalty shootouts no matter how good they have been. Will: It doesn't matter whether Kepa could continue or not, the manager made a decision to take him off and that should be the end of that. You can't refuse to work for your boss in any other line of work, why should football be any different? Rob: Chelsea is broken from top to bottom. Player power has dominated that club for years. If Sarri leaves I would respect him so much. James: Player power over everyone else at a club has been building slowly for the past few years. This is a pivotal moment for the way football clubs are run.

Pope compares sex abuse to human sacrifice,"This video can not be played Pope Francis: Abusive priests 'become tools of Satan' Pope Francis has promised concrete action to tackle child sex abuse at the end of a Roman Catholic Church summit on paedophilia. Clergy guilty of abuse were ""tools of Satan"", the Pope said, pledging to face every case with ""utmost seriousness"". Child sex abuse, he said, reminded him of the ancient religious practice of child sacrifice in pagan rites. Bishops would now review and strengthen their guidelines to prevent abuse and punish perpetrators, he added. Pope admits clerical abuse of nuns including sexual slavery Child sexual abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know Pope Francis condemns child sex abuse and Church cover-ups The Pope spoke largely in general terms, but victims and survivors of abuse will call for detailed practical steps to be announced, says the BBC's Vatican correspondent, James Reynolds. ""I am reminded of the cruel religious practice, once widespread in certain cultures, of sacrificing human beings - frequently children - in pagan rites,"" he said at the end of a four-day summit held in the Vatican. ""The inhumanity of the worldwide phenomenon becomes even more serious and more scandalous in the Church, because it is in contrast with its moral authority and its ethical credibility. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) ""The consecrated person, chosen by God to guide souls to salvation, lets himself be subjugated by his own human frailty, or by his own illness, thus becoming a tool of Satan. In the abuses, we see the hand of evil that does not spare even the innocence of children."" He said victims would now be the priority and promised an end to cover-ups, saying all abusers would be brought to justice. How will Pope Francis deal with abuse in the Catholic Church? US ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick defrocked over abuse claims He also stressed child sexual abuse was a universal problem - ""a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies"". The unprecedented conference - called Protection of Minors in the Church - was attended by the heads of all national bishops' conferences from more than 130 countries. They were handed a roadmap of suggestions on how to handle abuse, such as drawing up mandatory codes of conduct for priests, training people to spot abuse and informing police. Those gathered at the Vatican also heard testimonies from victims - who mostly remained anonymous - telling stories of abuse and cover-up. One woman from Africa said she had been forced to have three abortions after being abused for years as a teenager by a priest who refused to use contraception. Another victim from Asia said he had been molested more than 100 times. When he was elected in 2013, he called for ""decisive action"" on the issue, but critics say he has not done enough to hold to account bishops who allegedly covered up abuse. This video can not be played Archbishop of Brisbane Mark Coleridge: ""Our credibility is shot to pieces"" Thousands of people are thought to have been abused by priests over many decades, and the Church has been accused of covering up crimes around the world. Survivors say new safeguarding protocols are needed to protect minors. Pope Francis is under serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to what is the most pressing crisis facing the modern Church - one which some say has left its moral authority in tatters.

Ireland labour to away win over ItalyIreland's defence of their Six Nations crown remains alive but only just after a laboured bonus-point 26-16 win over Italy.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Highlights: Ireland struggle to bonus-point victory over Italy Six Nations: Italy v Ireland Italy:(16) 16 Tries:Padovani, MorisiPens:Allan 2 Ireland:(12) 26 Tries:Roux, Stockdale, Earls, MurrayCons:Sexton, Murray 2 Ireland's defence of their Six Nations crown remains alive but only just after a laboured bonus-point win over Italy. Quinn Roux, Jacob Stockdale, Keith Earls and Conor Murray scored the tries as the champions held on for victory. Italy led at half-time with tries from Edoardo Padovani and Luca Morisi but were unable to score after the break. Replacement Ian McKinley missed a stoppage-time penalty as Italy could not even salvage the losing bonus point their efforts deserved. The win sends Ireland up to third place in the championship table but Joe Schmidt's side will now need a massive slice of luck to retain their title. Italy's run of Six Nations defeats stretches to 20 but head coach Conor O'Shea will take encouragement from a superb first-half display that left Ireland rattled at the break. Schmidt calls for improved performance Relive Italy v Ireland as it happened Latest Six Nations table This video can not be played Joe Schmidt 'frustrated' with lack of rhythm from Ireland Ireland fly-half Johnny Sexton stalked off the field in the dying minutes and swung a kick at a water bottle on a frustrating night for the holders. Needing to win by a large margin to boost their title credentials, Ireland went in search of tries from the off but were ultimately undone by their own handling and line-out inaccuracies. Italy threatened to produce a major scare as they came charging back from 3-12 behind to lead 16-12 at the break, but the tries by Earls and Murray at least insured the Grand Slam champions remain in contention with two rounds remaining. A composed start by Ireland and some poor discipline by the home side produced an early try for the visitors as the game started along predicted lines. Sexton kept the hosts pinned within their own half with a series of booming touch-finding kicks and the pressure eventually produced a try in the 12th minute. The Irish attack steadily retained possession and forced their way up to the Italy posts before Roux muscled over for his first Six Nations try. A jinking break by Earls almost delivered another try for replacement Andrew Conway just moments later before Tommaso Allan kicked Italy's first points. From the restart, Ireland pushed further clear when Michele Campagnaro fumbled and Stockdale pounced without hesitation and flashed over for a lightning-quick score. Somehow Morisi managed to get the ball down despite two last-ditch tackles Italy may have been without their captain Sergio Parisse but the returning Tito Tebaldi deputised as his side's main driving force and helped to wrestle away momentum from the visitors. The Benetton scrum-half, who had almost scrambled over for a try before Allan's first penalty, took a quick tap-and-go that surprised the Irish defence and dashed upfield before chipping over the advancing Rob Kearney only for Jordi Murphy to rescue Ireland at the foot of his own posts. Undaunted, Italy came again and when Ireland lost a line-out in their own half the hosts raided down the left through full-back Jayden Hayward before a delightful skip pass by Allan sent Padovani over for a superb score. The crowd were now in full voice and they were rewarded just before half-time when Tebaldi plucked the ball from Conor Murray's grasp and powered into Irish territory. The visitors desperately retreated to defend but Chris Farrell could not stop Morisi from barrelling over for a stunning score that sent the hosts into the dressing room with a four-point lead. Murray powered over to secure the bonus-point try Sexton could not get his kick-off to travel 10 metres at the start of the second half as the expected Irish fight back began with a whimper. Hooker Sean Cronin was brought off shortly afterwards when another of his line-out throws went astray as the visitors' frustration continued to build. Another relentless multi-phase attack was finally rewarded when Earls spotted a mismatch and danced inside Dean Budd and Tebaldi to regain Ireland's lead with Murray taking over the place-kicking duties to slot the conversion. Earls almost cut through for another score on the hour when a trademark set-piece attack sent the Munster wing through a narrow gap but he could not find the supporting Stockdale with his offload. Instead, Murray took on the responsibility for the bonus-point try as the scrum-half cajoled his pack forwards in a powerful maul before scooping up the ball and dotting down for the try. The champions still had 14 minutes remaining to try and chase points but instead it was Italy who came closest to scoring again only for Federico Ruzza to concede a penalty while camped on the Irish tryline. In his first Six Nations match as Ireland captain, Peter O'Mahony led by example when his side were in danger of a major upset Having won the first turnover for his team in the opening minutes the Ireland skipper came up with another important steal as Italy threatened to regain the lead during the second half. He may never be the biggest tackler or fastest in the loose but he always comes up with big plays at big moments. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt:""The bottom line is the win and the bonus point. We will go home happy with the points haul but not the performance. Credit to Italy, they made it very tough at the ruck area and put us under pressure. ""Our performance was summed up in the last play, where Jacob Stockdale does brilliantly to get out of our half but then we are one pass from scoring and it goes to ground. We have to be more accurate than that."" Ireland skipper Peter O'Mahony:""At half-time we spoke about how we needed to make the ball stick a bit more, a little bit more accuracy. We were nearly trying too hard at times and forcing things so we just had to go back to the things that work so well for us and get back to basics a little."" Italy head coach Conor O'Shea:""We talked about trying to play with ambition and intensity which we did, but we gifted Stockdale a try. We lost players and had second rows playing in the back row. We have to create a consistency to get to where we want but hopefully people will see this is not an Italy side that is going to roll over. Former Ireland flanker Chris Henry on BBC Radio Ulster:""We know with the quality of players Ireland have, they should have had a more convincing win. Johnny Sexton was frustrated with his performance and Italy should be proud of their performance. There is a lot to work on ahead of what is a big game now against France.""

Huawei Mate X smartphone folds face outHuawei unveils a foldable phone that has several advantages over Samsung's.Technology,"This video can not be played WATCH: First look at Huawei's folding phone Huawei has revealed its first smartphone to feature a foldable screen, less than a week after its rival Samsung did the same. The rival handset-tablet hybrids have contrasting designs. Huawei's Mate X places its fold-out screen on the outside of the device, so that it covers the front and rear of the phone when closed. In both modes, the display is larger than Samsung's. Huawei's device is also flatter and thinner when shut. Samsung's Fold does not appear to fold flat when closed However, unlike Samsung's Galaxy Fold it does not have a second display on its reverse side. One analyst attending the launch event in Barcelona also remarked that a crease in the screen appeared to be visible. LG's 'foldable phone' breaks apart Nokia 9 uses five cameras to take a photo Microsoft's HoloLens 2 tracks eyes and hands Samsung reveals Galaxy Fold and S10 5G The Chinese company allowed attendees at the event to get a close look at the handset following its unveiling. Its South Korean competitor has yet to let outsiders to do so with the Galaxy Fold. ""Security concerns about Huawei's 5G kit are a shadow hanging over the whole of this year's Mobile World Congress,"" commented the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. ""But the firm was determined in a confident, even arrogant press conference to convey that it's now the leading innovator in smartphones."" The Mate X went on display to the media after being unveiled in Barcelona For comparison's sake, Huawei said: the Mate X's screen is 8in (20.3cm) when unfolded when closed, the Mate X's larger screen is 6.8in and the smaller one 6.6in - which makes both bigger than that of the iPhone XS Max when shut, the Mate X is 11mm (0.43in) thick the Samsung Galaxy Fold's main screen is 7.3in (18.5cm) when unfolded the Fold's other display is 4.6in the Fold measures 17mm (0.67in) thick at its widest point when closed Unlike the Fold, the Mate X does not place any of its cameras on the same side as its screen when unfolded. The Huawei Mate X's screen goes ""edge-to-edge"" across the device when open Instead they are placed on the flipside of the device on a strip that also features a fingerprint sensor. This runs down the side of the smaller of the two folded displays when closed and doubles up as a side-grip when open. This potentially places the Mate X at a disadvantage to the Fold, since it becomes impossible to use its unfolded screen to take selfies. However, it is not yet clear whether this will be a serious consideration in practice. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, the Mate X's advantage is that it does not have a ""notch"" cut into its screen as a consequence. Huawei said the Mate X would come with one of its existing 5G modems and could download a one gigabyte movie in as little as three seconds if a fast enough connection was available. Like Samsung's device, it also features a battery on each of its two sides, but claims to be able to recharge more quickly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Both foldable phones are 5G-capable and are instantly distinctive from the smartphone designs of the last 10 years,"" commented Ian Fogg, an analyst at the mobile analytics company Opensignal. ""But 5G is arriving on regular designed smartphones too, at lower prices, and more quickly. ""Because of that, more people will experience the benefits of 5G this year than the novelty of an expanding smartphone display."" The Mate X has been priced to start at 2,299 euros ($2,600; Â£1996) and is due to go on sale from the middle of this year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That compares to the $1,980 figure quoted by Samsung, although once taxes are taken into account the gap should be smaller. Huawei's consumer devices chief Richard Yu acknowledged that the price was ""very expensive"" but said he hoped it would be reduced over time. There were claps and cheers as Richard Yu finally unveiled Huawei's latest masterpiece after three years in development - the folding phone. And the hits just kept on coming: its split-screen function, its dimensions - gleefully compared to those of the iPhone and Galaxy Fold - even a protective case got its own round of applause. However, the biggest gasps came right at the end - when he announced the price tag. At 2,299 euros, even the hardcore enthusiasts appeared to wince. Everybody who charged to the demonstration area afterwards was disappointed as the handsets remained frustratingly behind Perspex. Still, the Mate X has still done enough to secure its ""wow factor"" at MWC. But that price and Huawei's wider controversies threaten to act as a deterrent to even deep-pocketed early adopters. Two other Chinese companies have also unveiled new handsets ahead of Monday's start of the Mobile World Congress trade show. Oppo has showed off a handset with a 10x optical zoom. Oppo has yet to name its 10x zoom camera phone Unlike digital zooms, there is no loss of quality as the shot tightens in. The three cameras involved do not need to extend from the phone to achieve this. Instead, the device features a periscope-like system inside its chassis. This lets it range between focal lengths of 16mm and 160mm. The innovation builds on an earlier prototype, which was never put into production, that offered a 5x zoom. Allow Twitter content?

However, the design means the handset is by necessity thicker than most rivals. In addition, the company announced it would soon launch 5G handsets in Australia, Singapore, Switzerland and China. Xiaomi also held a press conference where it revealed its forthcoming flagship Mi 9 handset will cost 449 euros when it launches in Europe. Xiaomi expanded to the UK last year It features three rear cameras, one of which offers 48 megapixel resolution. In addition, the firm said it intended to launch a 5G handset - the Mi Mix 3 5G - costing 599 euros, which is likely to be one of the lowest-cost models to be compatible with next-generation networks.

Ireland labour to away win over Italy,"This video can not be played Highlights: Ireland struggle to bonus-point victory over Italy Six Nations: Italy v Ireland Italy:(16) 16 Tries:Padovani, MorisiPens:Allan 2 Ireland:(12) 26 Tries:Roux, Stockdale, Earls, MurrayCons:Sexton, Murray 2 Ireland's defence of their Six Nations crown remains alive but only just after a laboured bonus-point win over Italy. Quinn Roux, Jacob Stockdale, Keith Earls and Conor Murray scored the tries as the champions held on for victory. Italy led at half-time with tries from Edoardo Padovani and Luca Morisi but were unable to score after the break. Replacement Ian McKinley missed a stoppage-time penalty as Italy could not even salvage the losing bonus point their efforts deserved. The win sends Ireland up to third place in the championship table but Joe Schmidt's side will now need a massive slice of luck to retain their title. Italy's run of Six Nations defeats stretches to 20 but head coach Conor O'Shea will take encouragement from a superb first-half display that left Ireland rattled at the break. Schmidt calls for improved performance Relive Italy v Ireland as it happened Latest Six Nations table This video can not be played Joe Schmidt 'frustrated' with lack of rhythm from Ireland Ireland fly-half Johnny Sexton stalked off the field in the dying minutes and swung a kick at a water bottle on a frustrating night for the holders. Needing to win by a large margin to boost their title credentials, Ireland went in search of tries from the off but were ultimately undone by their own handling and line-out inaccuracies. Italy threatened to produce a major scare as they came charging back from 3-12 behind to lead 16-12 at the break, but the tries by Earls and Murray at least insured the Grand Slam champions remain in contention with two rounds remaining. A composed start by Ireland and some poor discipline by the home side produced an early try for the visitors as the game started along predicted lines. Sexton kept the hosts pinned within their own half with a series of booming touch-finding kicks and the pressure eventually produced a try in the 12th minute. The Irish attack steadily retained possession and forced their way up to the Italy posts before Roux muscled over for his first Six Nations try. A jinking break by Earls almost delivered another try for replacement Andrew Conway just moments later before Tommaso Allan kicked Italy's first points. From the restart, Ireland pushed further clear when Michele Campagnaro fumbled and Stockdale pounced without hesitation and flashed over for a lightning-quick score. Somehow Morisi managed to get the ball down despite two last-ditch tackles Italy may have been without their captain Sergio Parisse but the returning Tito Tebaldi deputised as his side's main driving force and helped to wrestle away momentum from the visitors. The Benetton scrum-half, who had almost scrambled over for a try before Allan's first penalty, took a quick tap-and-go that surprised the Irish defence and dashed upfield before chipping over the advancing Rob Kearney only for Jordi Murphy to rescue Ireland at the foot of his own posts. Undaunted, Italy came again and when Ireland lost a line-out in their own half the hosts raided down the left through full-back Jayden Hayward before a delightful skip pass by Allan sent Padovani over for a superb score. The crowd were now in full voice and they were rewarded just before half-time when Tebaldi plucked the ball from Conor Murray's grasp and powered into Irish territory. The visitors desperately retreated to defend but Chris Farrell could not stop Morisi from barrelling over for a stunning score that sent the hosts into the dressing room with a four-point lead. Murray powered over to secure the bonus-point try Sexton could not get his kick-off to travel 10 metres at the start of the second half as the expected Irish fight back began with a whimper. Hooker Sean Cronin was brought off shortly afterwards when another of his line-out throws went astray as the visitors' frustration continued to build. Another relentless multi-phase attack was finally rewarded when Earls spotted a mismatch and danced inside Dean Budd and Tebaldi to regain Ireland's lead with Murray taking over the place-kicking duties to slot the conversion. Earls almost cut through for another score on the hour when a trademark set-piece attack sent the Munster wing through a narrow gap but he could not find the supporting Stockdale with his offload. Instead, Murray took on the responsibility for the bonus-point try as the scrum-half cajoled his pack forwards in a powerful maul before scooping up the ball and dotting down for the try. The champions still had 14 minutes remaining to try and chase points but instead it was Italy who came closest to scoring again only for Federico Ruzza to concede a penalty while camped on the Irish tryline. In his first Six Nations match as Ireland captain, Peter O'Mahony led by example when his side were in danger of a major upset Having won the first turnover for his team in the opening minutes the Ireland skipper came up with another important steal as Italy threatened to regain the lead during the second half. He may never be the biggest tackler or fastest in the loose but he always comes up with big plays at big moments. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt:""The bottom line is the win and the bonus point.

""I have been since I heard the news."" Mr Palmer, from East Grinstead, East Sussex, and Mr Ferrieux, a French national, both 20, arrived in Australia in November. They had been in the Port Macquarie area since 17 February. A major search was launched late that night when their towels and car keys were found on the beach near Port Macquarie. Mr Palmer's mother said her son had been living his dream by visiting Australia, but it had ""only just started"". She told ABC News: ""I'm so incredibly proud of him. I love him so much.""

Six Nations: Italy v Ireland,"Champions Ireland beat Italy 26-16 at Rome's Olimpico Stadio Ireland secure bonus point to go third in Six Nations table Padovani & Morisi tries gave Italy shock half-time lead But Ireland's Earls & Murray scored tries in second half Roux and Stockdale scored first-half tries for visitors Italy have now lost their last 20 Six Nations matches Mike Henson FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Cian Murtagh's report is fresh off the laptop andonto the website. You don't have to wait long for the choicest cuts of this weekend's action. Rugby Special is in the pipeline, landing at 18:00 GMT on BBC Two and online. Highlights of the Women's Six Nations action from the weekend is on the same channel and the same website from 23:55 GMT. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt told ITV:""The bottom line is the win and the bonus point. We will go home happy with the points haul but not the performance. Credit to Italy, they made it very tough at the ruck area and they put us under pressure. ""Our performance was summed up in the last play, where Jacob Stockdale does brilliantly to get out of our half but then we are one pass from scoring and it goes to ground. We have to be more accurate than that. ""Johnny Sexton was taking a bit of a hammering out there and he got beaten up, but I'm sure he'll dust himself off."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Italy head coach Conor O'Shea told ITV:""We talked about trying to play with ambition and intensity which we did, but we gifted Jacob Stockdale a try. We lost players and had second rows playing in the back row. We have to create a consistency to get to where we want but hopefully people will see this is not an Italy side that is going to roll over. ""There might be a disparity in money and investment but you cannot buy heart. We showed heart and desire but it's another result and we have to dust ourselves down. It's a nice easy one away at Twickenham next and I want to see them play without fear. ""The players know we are doing the right things but we have to take what we do on the training field onto the pitch. There is a real belief in what we are doing but we know it's a mountain to climb."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland winger Jacob Stockdale told ITV:""We are happy to get the bonus point but it's frustrating we didn't put down as good a marker as we wanted to. ""If we knew what it was, we would fix it, but we have two wins out of three in this tournament and we are just focusing on the next game."" On his try:""It was a bit of a lucky one and the ball managed to sit for me but it was good to finish it off."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland captain Peter O'Mahony told ITV:""We knew how difficult it is to come to Rome. It's an incredibly physical battle and they are a super rugby team. They put us under the pump and we expected that. ""There is certainly stuff we can do better, and I know a lot is expected of us, but five points away from home is good because it is difficult to win on the road in the Six Nations. ""We needed a bit more accuracy in the second half and we were forcing a few things so we had to revert to our game plan and get through some phases. We need to improve on some of the good stuff and the things we need to get better at."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland cosying up to third in the Six Nations table. They will need England to fail to register a bonus point win over either Scotland or Italy though to wrest the title back to Dublin. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Chris HenryFormer Ireland flanker on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra We know with the quality of players Ireland have, they should have more of a convincing win over Italy, but it didn't happen. Johnny Sexton was frustrated with his performance and Italy should be proud of their performance. There is a lot to work on ahead of what is a big game now against France. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Cian MurtaghBBC Sport NI at Stadio Olimpico Ireland came to Rome
knowing they needed a big bonus-point win to keep their title hopes alive but
instead found themselves labouring to a 10-point win. The bonus point was
secured with 14 minutes to play but it was Italy that had the better chances to
score the final try of the game. Johnny Sexton kicking at
a water bottle as he trudged off probably summed up his side's performance. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Tony WardFormer Ireland fly-half on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Mission accomplished and it's five points achieved, which is what Ireland set out to do, but that was not impressive. We have to forget about Cardiff for the moment and we have to get ourselves right for that French game. Italy 16-26 Ireland A bonus-point win. The result that Ireland wanted. Possibly not the performance they were looking for... Italy 16-26 Ireland Jacob Stockdale pins his ears back and charges upfield, but his pass inside goes to ground and then forward... That's time. Italy 16-26 Ireland It drifts wide of the upright....and it is still in play! Italy 16-26 Ireland A penalty for Italy out wide and on the Ireland 22m. To kick for the bonus point from a tight angle? Or go for touch and a glorious try finale? Pragmatism wins. Leonardo Ghiraldini points to the sticks, under instruction from Conor O'Shea. Ian McKinley steps up... Italy 16-26 Ireland The clock is in the red. Italy are still running the ball in search of the score that would bring them a losing bonus point. Italy 16-26 Ireland An appreciative round of applause ripples around the Stadio Olimpico as Andrew Conway flicks the ball one-handed around his back to keep the pill in play. Delicious bit of showboatry. Italy 16-26 Ireland Tony WardFormer Ireland fly-half on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra There is something about Jack Carty that I really like. I'm not sure what was going on with Johnny Sexton when he was replaced because it's a huge moment for the young man. Italy 16-26 Ireland Connacht's Jack Carty comes on to make his Ireland debut in place of Johnny Sexton. Ireland's kingpin departs the pitch in a dirty old mood, chuntering to himself under his breath and kicking out at a water bottle in frustration, presumably at Ireland's disjointed performance. Italy 16-26 Ireland Playing out the dregs here, with Ireland in possession of the ball, but also the bonus point. Replacement scrum-half John Cooney is trying to inject some pace, cajoling more pace out of his one-out runners. And a knock-on brings the move to an end. #bbcrugby saidmadrid:come autumn,  Ireland will be ready and up and running to challenge in the world cup Italy 16-26 Ireland With the crowd baying and the line beckoning, Italy are stopped in their tracks by the referee's whistle. David Ruzza is pinged for hands in the ruck, trying to make amends the ball threatened to squirm back Ireland's way. Â© 2025 BBC.

Empty boat off Kent coast sparks search,"The Border Force operation could be seen from St Margaret's Bay A family of seven were found by police after an empty dinghy was spotted drifting off the coast of Kent, the Home Office has said. The group - a mother, father and five children - have been transferred to immigration officials for interview. The Home Office said the boat, seen off the coast at Kingsdown at about 04:20 GMT, was recovered a mile offshore. Four lifeboats were launched and the Coastguard helicopter was scrambled in an effort to locate it. The Border Force was ""confident"" the vessel had been used for a migrant crossing, the Home Office said. ""Today Border Force responded to an incident in Kingsdown, Kent, following reports of a boat in the Channel. ""Since the home secretary declared a major incident in December we have tripled the number of cutters operating in the Channel, agreed a joint action plan with France and increased activity out of the Joint Co-ordination and Information Centre in Calais."" The Home Office said the number of people trying to cross the Channel fell from about 250 in December to about 90 last month, adding that roughly half of the January attempts were intercepted in France before they could make it to British waters. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? Channel migrants declared major incident Who rescues migrants in the Channel? HM Coastguard said earlier that it helped Border Force officials in the search. The RNLI said an earlier report that a migrant had walked into Walmer lifeboat station was mistaken. A Border Force vessel was seen returning to Folkestone On 18 February,34 people - including men, women and children - were brought to shoreat Dover from a small boat discovered in the Channel.

Here's the match report. Read on for all of the reaction and how the extraordinary incident at the end of extra-time played out. Chris SuttonEx-Chelsea striker on BBC Radio 5 live Kepa should never play for Chelsea again. that should be his last performance in a Chelsea shirt. He's a disgrace. I've never seen anything like it. if I was Sarri I would walk. You cannot be undermined. Why weren't the players dragging Kepa off anyway? Kepa should be sacked, not Sarri. Chelsea ChelseamanagerMaurizio Sarrisays that extraordinary stand-off with keeperKepa Arrizabalagawas a ""misunderstanding"". Sarri also says the Spaniard will not be disciplined by the club. ""I misunderstood the problem and only realised the situation when the doctor arrived at the bench. ""It was a big misunderstanding because I understood the keeper had cramp and was unable to go to the penalties. But it was not cramp and could go to the penalties."" On why he walked off towards the tunnel:""I needed to return to be quiet. He [Kepa] understood that I asked for a change for his physical problem and he said I haven't a physical problem. And he was right. ""I realised after when the doctor arrived. I have talked to him [Kepa] but only to clarify because now I have understand the situation."" Have you ever seen anything like it? A player refusing to go off - and his manager losing the plot. Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga resisted Maurizio Sarri's attempt to substitute him late in extra-time of the Carabao Cup final, which left his manager seething on the touchline. Here's how it all unfolded What a night! I'm sure we haven't heard the last of this. A reminder that Chelsea play Tottenham on Wednesday... Chelsea ChelseamanagerMaurizio Sarrisays his future at Stamford Bridge is ""the same"" as it was before the match. The Italian insists he still has the backing of the players and retains authority in the dressing room. ""After this match I have to say that I'm sure of that because they played exactly what I asked. Today I am proud of the players,"" he said. Does this incident put his future under more doubt?""You have to ask the club. Here I am very happy and in the last three matches we are improving and have improved a lot. ""Today showed everyone we could be a very solid team because we conceded nothing to the opponents and to Manchester City that is not easy. I am happy with my players. ""I think the club would be proud of that performance too, because the performance was very good against, in my opinion, the best club in Europe."" Chelsea 0-0 Man City Chris SuttonEx-Chelsea striker on BBC Radio 5 live How will Willy Caballero feel after that? How can he train with Kepa again? How can Sarri stand in a dressing room and speak to that player again and expect him to listen to him? There's no way back for Kepa. Nothing to see here. Move right along... Allow Twitter content?

Pathetic behaviour from him. I'll back Sarri on this one because there is a massive lack of disrespect there. Amrul:If Sarri escapes this it would be because of Public sympathy. Kepa is now the villain of the piece at Stamford Bridge. Former Chelsea captain John Terry on Sky Sports:""He's protecting his player. Whether that hs been dealt with inside the dressing room, I don't know. Publicly that's his approach.""

He seemed to soften his stubbornness today with the lineup and the substitutions and the second half performance was brilliant... But then that Kepa incident happens and undermines everything and I wouldn't blame him for walking. Paul:As bad as Kepa behaved let's be honest, as a player he has more value as a commodity to Chelsea than sarri does as a manager. It's a club who've still won loads despite sacking managers. Sarri won't be missed, Kepa could play for a decade. Sarri will be one who goes. Maurizio Sarri is back-pedalling fast here. He is now saying that there is no problem between him and Kepa as he now understands that Kepa didnotneed to come off. It seems a bizarre stance to me... Chelsea ChelseaskipperCesar Azpilicuetastraight bats the only question we all want his answer to... On the incident between Kepa and Sarri:""I don't know what happened because I was on the other side of the pitch so I can't comment."" On Chelsea's performance:""Obviously we knew we had to fight very hard against a very strong team and to have chances to win the trophy we got to penalties and we are very disappointed. Now we have to recover because 120 minutes was very hard and we have another tough game in midweek. ""First of all we had a very good effort from everyone involved, we ran a lot and we fought a lot, but maybe it is true we lacked a bit with ball but we had chances as well."" On where Chelsea go from here:""We are used to competing in the biggest fixtures and fighting for trophies but we are frustrated because we have not showed consistency. ""Now we have to be focused and play for the Europa League and to qualify for the Champions Legaue so hoepfully everyone, we are ready for it."" Mauizio Sarri calls it all ""A big misunderstanding, Kepa was able to continue."" Chelsea 0-0 Man City Chris SuttonEx-Chelsea striker on BBC Radio 5 live In the heat of the moment there, in virtually any other team, the players would have dragged him off. What does that tell us about Chelsea at the moment? It's not just Kepa who has disrespected Sarri there, it's the Chelsea players. Here is Sarri... Maurizio Sarri has yet to face the media. Unsurprisingly. Chris SuttonEx-Chelsea striker on BBC Radio 5 live I've seen players disgruntled before and throw a boot or their shirt down when they're taken off but players know the rules. They abide by the decision and if you're going to have a row you have it in the dressing room. That is unprecedented, what we have seen today and Kepa has to go. The players didn't want anything to do with it - they should have dragged him off. Two of the four finals
     involving Manchester Cityâs Pep Guardiola as a manager to have gone to
     penalties have been against Chelsea, with Guardiola winning both (also

"Hanged schoolgirl's father 'let down'Adrian Cook says his daughter was let down by the authorities who ""didn't act when she spoke out"".Nottingham","Adrian Cook said he had not seen his daughter for two years before she died The father of a 13-year-old girl who was found hanged said the authorities ""let her down considerably"". Amber Peat left the Nottinghamshire home she shared with her mother and stepfather after a row. Her body was found three days later, on 2 June 2015. Assistant coroner Laurinda Bower said agencies missed 11 opportunities to prevent Amber's death. Her father Adrian Cook and his wife said those responsible for looking after Amber needed holding to account. The inquest heard Amber Peat complained to teachers about being punished and made to do chores The inquest at Nottingham Coroner's Court heard the opportunities missed by schools and agencies in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire could have resulted in a referral to social care. Mr Cook said: ""In my mind they let her down considerably. ""It's a personal fight for me. I'm standing for Amber. ""Amber wasn't the first and she certainly won't be the last. It's disgraceful."" Mr Cook said he last saw Amber in 2013 when he took her for a meal. He said he found out Amber, who lived in Mansfield, had gone missing when his wife saw something on Facebook. Amber's body was found close to her home three days after she was reported missing After the three-week inquest, Ms Bower said Amber's mother and stepfather, Kelly and Daniel Peat, had given ""very little, if any, consideration"" to her welfare. She also said she considered whether to return a conclusion of suicide but she could not be sure Amber intended to die. During the inquest, Mr and Mrs Peatsaid allegations about her enduring punishments and excessive chores were untrue. Mr Cook said he was not told when his daughter's surname was changed The coroner said the fact Amber saw Mr Cook only twice after her parents separated on Christmas Eve 2012 ""would, no doubt, have had an emotional impact on Amber and a destabilising effect on her life"". Mr Cook said the Peat family would often move around without him knowing and he was not told when his daughter's surname was changed. Amber's stepmother, Lynda Cook, who has been married to Mr Cook for four-and-a-half years but never met Amber, said they were not made aware of the problems the teenager was having. She said: ""Just because Amber's not here to say physically what happened; she told people and spoke to the right people, who should have protected her and done something about it. ""Anyone who was supposed to be looking after her needs bringing to account. Hopefully that will be done."" She added: ""The first time I saw her in the chapel of rest, I said to Amber, 'We'll get justice for you'. ""It's what she deserves.""

Huawei Mate X smartphone folds face outHuawei unveils a foldable phone that has several advantages over Samsung's.,"This video can not be played WATCH: First look at Huawei's folding phone Huawei has revealed its first smartphone to feature a foldable screen, less than a week after its rival Samsung did the same. The rival handset-tablet hybrids have contrasting designs. Huawei's Mate X places its fold-out screen on the outside of the device, so that it covers the front and rear of the phone when closed. In both modes, the display is larger than Samsung's. Huawei's device is also flatter and thinner when shut. Samsung's Fold does not appear to fold flat when closed However, unlike Samsung's Galaxy Fold it does not have a second display on its reverse side. One analyst attending the launch event in Barcelona also remarked that a crease in the screen appeared to be visible. LG's 'foldable phone' breaks apart Nokia 9 uses five cameras to take a photo Microsoft's HoloLens 2 tracks eyes and hands Samsung reveals Galaxy Fold and S10 5G The Chinese company allowed attendees at the event to get a close look at the handset following its unveiling. Its South Korean competitor has yet to let outsiders to do so with the Galaxy Fold. ""Security concerns about Huawei's 5G kit are a shadow hanging over the whole of this year's Mobile World Congress,"" commented the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. ""But the firm was determined in a confident, even arrogant press conference to convey that it's now the leading innovator in smartphones."" The Mate X went on display to the media after being unveiled in Barcelona For comparison's sake, Huawei said: the Mate X's screen is 8in (20.3cm) when unfolded when closed, the Mate X's larger screen is 6.8in and the smaller one 6.6in - which makes both bigger than that of the iPhone XS Max when shut, the Mate X is 11mm (0.43in) thick the Samsung Galaxy Fold's main screen is 7.3in (18.5cm) when unfolded the Fold's other display is 4.6in the Fold measures 17mm (0.67in) thick at its widest point when closed Unlike the Fold, the Mate X does not place any of its cameras on the same side as its screen when unfolded. The Huawei Mate X's screen goes ""edge-to-edge"" across the device when open Instead they are placed on the flipside of the device on a strip that also features a fingerprint sensor. This runs down the side of the smaller of the two folded displays when closed and doubles up as a side-grip when open. This potentially places the Mate X at a disadvantage to the Fold, since it becomes impossible to use its unfolded screen to take selfies. However, it is not yet clear whether this will be a serious consideration in practice. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, the Mate X's advantage is that it does not have a ""notch"" cut into its screen as a consequence. Huawei said the Mate X would come with one of its existing 5G modems and could download a one gigabyte movie in as little as three seconds if a fast enough connection was available. Like Samsung's device, it also features a battery on each of its two sides, but claims to be able to recharge more quickly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Both foldable phones are 5G-capable and are instantly distinctive from the smartphone designs of the last 10 years,"" commented Ian Fogg, an analyst at the mobile analytics company Opensignal. ""But 5G is arriving on regular designed smartphones too, at lower prices, and more quickly. ""Because of that, more people will experience the benefits of 5G this year than the novelty of an expanding smartphone display."" The Mate X has been priced to start at 2,299 euros ($2,600; Â£1996) and is due to go on sale from the middle of this year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That compares to the $1,980 figure quoted by Samsung, although once taxes are taken into account the gap should be smaller. Huawei's consumer devices chief Richard Yu acknowledged that the price was ""very expensive"" but said he hoped it would be reduced over time. There were claps and cheers as Richard Yu finally unveiled Huawei's latest masterpiece after three years in development - the folding phone. And the hits just kept on coming: its split-screen function, its dimensions - gleefully compared to those of the iPhone and Galaxy Fold - even a protective case got its own round of applause. However, the biggest gasps came right at the end - when he announced the price tag. At 2,299 euros, even the hardcore enthusiasts appeared to wince. Everybody who charged to the demonstration area afterwards was disappointed as the handsets remained frustratingly behind Perspex. Still, the Mate X has still done enough to secure its ""wow factor"" at MWC. But that price and Huawei's wider controversies threaten to act as a deterrent to even deep-pocketed early adopters. Two other Chinese companies have also unveiled new handsets ahead of Monday's start of the Mobile World Congress trade show. Oppo has showed off a handset with a 10x optical zoom. Oppo has yet to name its 10x zoom camera phone Unlike digital zooms, there is no loss of quality as the shot tightens in. The three cameras involved do not need to extend from the phone to achieve this. Instead, the device features a periscope-like system inside its chassis. This lets it range between focal lengths of 16mm and 160mm. The innovation builds on an earlier prototype, which was never put into production, that offered a 5x zoom. Allow Twitter content?

The Oscar film that almost had a different star,"Chris O'Dowd was originally set to star opposite Julianne Moore Richard E Grant may be one of Britain's big hopes at this year's Oscars - but his role almost went to someone else. Irish actor Chris O'Dowd was originally cast in Can You Ever Forgive Me? - one of the most prominent films in this year's awards season. But the role eventually went to Grant, whose performance scored him both critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. ""What a heartbreak,"" O'Dowd tells BBC News at the Oscar Wilde Awards. ""We were ready to go, it was myself and Julianne Moore, and we had moved to New York, and maybe two days before we started filming, there was some creative differences that I wasn't really involved in."" Richard E Grant and Melissa McCarthy are both nominated for Can You Ever Forgive Me? Those creative differences also saw the projectlose its original director,external, before Marielle Heller took over. Meanwhile, Melissa McCarthy replaced Moore, and is also in the running for an Oscar. ""I was surprised, that the film wasn't going ahead at the last minute,"" says O'Dowd. ""But Richard's performance in it is so wonderful, that it feels like it was kind of meant to be."" Which is a diplomatic way to look at it, but surely it's gutting when you see someone else having such success with a job that was originally yours? ""Totally!"" laughs O'Dowd. ""I know Richard a bit, we've worked together, and watching him go on this journey through the Oscars has been so intoxicating. ""But definitely I would've preferred if it was me!""

O'Dowd, who now lives in Los Angeles, has starred in films such as Bridesmaids, The Sapphires and Juliet, Naked - the new adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel of the same name. He was honoured at Thursday night's Oscar Wilde Awards - dubbed the Irish Oscars - one of the many ceremonies taking place in the days running up to Sunday's Academy Awards. Richard E Grant 'overwhelmed' by Oscar nomination All the build-up to the Oscars The Oscar Wildes are intended to champion relations between the US and Ireland, and the ceremony is hosted by JJ Abrams at his Bad Robot studios in Santa Monica. Abrams appeared at the party less than a week after completing filming for Star Wars: Episode IX, which is released this December, four years on from his last movie in the series. ""It's a far bigger movie [than The Force Awakens] in every way, so it was a much bigger challenge,"" the director says of the film, which coincidentally also stars Richard E Grant. ""Richard was someone who I met when I was in my 20s, I've been a fan of his for a long time, I'm so thrilled we finally got the chance to work together, and he was incredible. ""I can't wait for you to see him in this. Obviously he's got a nomination on Sunday, a very deserving nomination, I love the man."" Allow Twitter content?

One of this year's Oscar nominees who is considered a dead cert to win is Glenn Close, who is nominated for best actress for her role in The Wife. Lady Gaga and Olivia Colman were the favourites in that category at the beginning of awards season, but momentum turned in Close's favour after a win at the Golden Globes in January. ""You know the only pressure I feel is I've gotten so much incredible love from people, and I feel like a lot of people are rooting for me,"" Close tells BBC News. ""And the pressure I feel is that I don't want to letthemdown. But personally, I'm OK."" Close currently is the actress with the most Oscar nominations to her name without a win. This video can not be played The stars were out in force at the 'Irish Oscars' ""If I lose,"" she laughs, ""I'll still have that record."" The actress's first nomination was in 1982, when she received a best supporting actress nod for The World According to Garp. ""I remember when hearing about [the nomination], it was in the basement of the home where we were filming The Big Chill,"" she recalls. ""And somebody told me I was nominated for an Oscar, and I remember my absolute astonishment, it was so far out of my expectation."" 17 quirky facts about this year's Oscars What this Oscar winner did with his jet ski Oscars 2019: The nominees in full When receiving her Golden Globe Award last month, Close said on stage: ""I'm so honoured to be with my category sisters. And we've gotten to know each other a little bit so far and I can't wait to spend more time with you."" But they haven't seen quite as much of each other as they would've liked, Close explains. ""Unfortunately we never get to sit together at any of these events! So I guess the person I've gotten to know the most so far is Melissa McCarthy."" Indeed, McCarthy was tasked with presenting Close with an honour at the Oscar Wilde Awards, despite the pair being in competition for the real Oscar. But, McCarthy says: ""I never think of it that way. I never think that any of us are up against anybody else. ""I think it's such a kick to just be a part of this in any way, that I'm just glad I'm here,"" adds the actress, who was excited to be paying tribute to Close on stage later in the evening. ""[Close] said, 'Don't be too nice to me' and I said, 'I won't be!'

Harry and Meghan visit Morocco girls' school,"Harry and Meghan are on a three-day visit to north Africa The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have met young women in Morocco to show support for girls' education. The couple were welcomed to a boarding house in the village of Asni by the girls, who waved flags and sang songs. During the visit, the pregnant duchess was given a traditional Moroccan henna tattoo, which is intended to bring luck to her first child. Harry and Meghan, who flew from the capital Rabat by helicopter, areon a three-day visit to the country. The Duchess of Sussex had henna applied to her hand during the visit Samira Ouaadi, 17, who drew a floral pattern on Meghan's left hand and wrist with brown henna paste, said: ""It's tradition for pregnant women in Morocco to have a henna tattoo. We do it for major celebrations like getting married or having a baby."" The Duke and Duchess announced their pregnancy last October and the baby is expected at the end of April or early May. When the artwork was finished, the duchess said the design was ""really lovely"" and showed her husband. The couple's first official trip to the north African nation is aimed at strengthening links with the UK. The secondary school is run by a Moroccan group that provides classes for girls from rural areas whose families cannot afford their education.

Meghan and Harry walked along a line of students and touched their hearts each time they shook a pupil's hand. The duke asked one pupil ""is this the best school in Morocco?"" as they were led inside the boarding house. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent, in Morocco The photographers might have been there for the bump; the journalists to see the last royal visit before the baby is due.  But Harry and Meghan were there to show that a royal visit could have real purpose. So the focus was unremitting; from start to finish in the dusty mountain town of Asni, Harry and Meghan homed in on education and in particular opening it up to girls, and granting them opportunities that women have been denied. There was no pomp, little ceremony, not too many handshakes; they wanted to meet the teachers and students, to encourage them, to shine a spotlight on their work. A while ago a palace official told me that in 2019 we would start to see Meghan's influence and interests; they could not have been clearer today. Harry and Meghan are determined to do things differently. The couple visited classrooms, where most of the girls speak French. The duchess asked: ""Qu'est-ce que tu veux etre quand tu quittes l'ecole? - What do you want to be when you leave school?""

Corbyn must 'lead' on tackling anti-Semitism,"This video can not be played Tom Watson: ""I know that he (Jeremy Corbyn) will... share my horror"" Jeremy Corbyn must take a ""personal lead"" over claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, his deputy has said. Tom Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr that there was a ""crisis for the soul"" of the party, fearing more MPs might followthe nine who resigned this week. But he said with the situation being so ""grave"", Mr Corbyn understood he needed to make a ""personal intervention"". A Labour spokesman said the party takes all complaints about anti-Semitism ""extremely seriously"". Mr Watson said he had sent 50 such complaints to his leader this week. Latest MP to quit Labour 'ashamed' of party What does it feel like to quit a party? Labour defectors betrayed seats, says Thornberry A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The deputy leader's comments follow the resignations of nine Labour MPs -eight of which have joined The Independent Group. One its members, the former Labour MP Luciana Berger, was subjected to anti-Semitic abuse while a member of the party, Appearing on the Andrew Marr Show before Mr Watson, Ms Berger criticised the party's culture, saying: ""My values haven't changed. I am the same person. It is my party that has changed."" Luciana Berger quit the Labour Party on Monday over its handling of anti-Semitism Mr Watson said Ms Berger had been ""bullied out of the party by a small number of racist thugs"", and attempts to stamp out anti-Semitism so far had ""not been adequate"" and ""have not succeeded"". He said Mr Corbyn needed to ""rebuild that trust"" with the Jewish community across the country and it will be his ""test as leader"" to eradicate anti-Semitism from the party. ""Of course Jeremy [Corbyn] needs to understand that if we're going to be in No 10, he needs to change the Labour Party and there are things we need to do,"" he said. ""We've got to eradicate anti-Semitism, anti-Jewish racism in all its forms [and] for us to address that now, I think he needs to take a personal lead on examining those cases and if necessary, recommend it to our NEC (National Executive Committee) what needs to be done."" Mr Watson also criticised the language of shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who said those who resigned from her party had ""betrayed"" their seats and would be ""crushed"" if by-elections were held. She told a Labour rally in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, that she would rather die than join a new party. Mr Watson said he thought ""dying is a virtue that is over-rated"" and said it was ""incumbent on all of us to dial down the rhetoric"". After his appearance, a Labour Party spokesman said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms. ""All complaints about anti-Semitism are investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.""

LiveSix Nations: Italy v IrelandItaly host Ireland at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome - listen to BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and follow text updates and latest scores.BBC Sport,"Champions Ireland beat Italy 26-16 at Rome's Olimpico Stadio Ireland secure bonus point to go third in Six Nations table Padovani & Morisi tries gave Italy shock half-time lead But Ireland's Earls & Murray scored tries in second half Roux and Stockdale scored first-half tries for visitors Italy have now lost their last 20 Six Nations matches Mike Henson FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Cian Murtagh's report is fresh off the laptop andonto the website. You don't have to wait long for the choicest cuts of this weekend's action. Rugby Special is in the pipeline, landing at 18:00 GMT on BBC Two and online. Highlights of the Women's Six Nations action from the weekend is on the same channel and the same website from 23:55 GMT. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt told ITV:""The bottom line is the win and the bonus point. We will go home happy with the points haul but not the performance. Credit to Italy, they made it very tough at the ruck area and they put us under pressure. ""Our performance was summed up in the last play, where Jacob Stockdale does brilliantly to get out of our half but then we are one pass from scoring and it goes to ground. We have to be more accurate than that. ""Johnny Sexton was taking a bit of a hammering out there and he got beaten up, but I'm sure he'll dust himself off."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Italy head coach Conor O'Shea told ITV:""We talked about trying to play with ambition and intensity which we did, but we gifted Jacob Stockdale a try. We lost players and had second rows playing in the back row. We have to create a consistency to get to where we want but hopefully people will see this is not an Italy side that is going to roll over. ""There might be a disparity in money and investment but you cannot buy heart. We showed heart and desire but it's another result and we have to dust ourselves down. It's a nice easy one away at Twickenham next and I want to see them play without fear. ""The players know we are doing the right things but we have to take what we do on the training field onto the pitch. There is a real belief in what we are doing but we know it's a mountain to climb."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland winger Jacob Stockdale told ITV:""We are happy to get the bonus point but it's frustrating we didn't put down as good a marker as we wanted to. ""If we knew what it was, we would fix it, but we have two wins out of three in this tournament and we are just focusing on the next game."" On his try:""It was a bit of a lucky one and the ball managed to sit for me but it was good to finish it off."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland captain Peter O'Mahony told ITV:""We knew how difficult it is to come to Rome. It's an incredibly physical battle and they are a super rugby team. They put us under the pump and we expected that. ""There is certainly stuff we can do better, and I know a lot is expected of us, but five points away from home is good because it is difficult to win on the road in the Six Nations. ""We needed a bit more accuracy in the second half and we were forcing a few things so we had to revert to our game plan and get through some phases. We need to improve on some of the good stuff and the things we need to get better at."" FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Ireland cosying up to third in the Six Nations table. They will need England to fail to register a bonus point win over either Scotland or Italy though to wrest the title back to Dublin. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Chris HenryFormer Ireland flanker on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra We know with the quality of players Ireland have, they should have more of a convincing win over Italy, but it didn't happen. Johnny Sexton was frustrated with his performance and Italy should be proud of their performance. There is a lot to work on ahead of what is a big game now against France. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Cian MurtaghBBC Sport NI at Stadio Olimpico Ireland came to Rome
knowing they needed a big bonus-point win to keep their title hopes alive but
instead found themselves labouring to a 10-point win. The bonus point was
secured with 14 minutes to play but it was Italy that had the better chances to
score the final try of the game. Johnny Sexton kicking at
a water bottle as he trudged off probably summed up his side's performance. FT: Italy 16-26 Ireland Tony WardFormer Ireland fly-half on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Mission accomplished and it's five points achieved, which is what Ireland set out to do, but that was not impressive.

Italy 16-26 Ireland Connacht's Jack Carty comes on to make his Ireland debut in place of Johnny Sexton.

Ireland 'won't compromise peace process',"The taoiseach was speaking at a EU-Arab League joint summit in Egypt on Sunday The Republic of Ireland is ""not playing chicken"" with its stance on the Brexit backstop, Leo Varadkar has warned. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) was speaking in Egypt on Sunday as Theresa May attempts to seek changes to herrejected withdrawal agreement. He reiterated that his government would not accept a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit clause for the UK. ""We are not playing poker, we are just standing by our position which has been solid since day one,"" he said. Ireland and the EU: A special case What does Ireland do if there's no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""We are happy to discuss with the United Kingdom assurances that they may need to give them further confidence that the backstop - were it ever applied - will not be permanent,"" he told reporters at an EU-Arab League summit. His comments come as theprime minister announced that MPs will have a final vote on the Brexit deal on 12 March. The taoiseach said the announcement would have no impact on the position of the Republic of Ireland or the EU. Earlier, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney stated that his country could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"". However, he said Ireland could show more flexibility after a deal has been done. Mr Coveney told Sky News said that while the EU stands firm on not changing the withdrawal agreement On Friday, his governmentunveiled the major legislation it has prepared to manage a no-deal scenario. It covers a wide range of emergency measures that will be enacted if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Mrs May has ruled out a parliamentary vote on the deal before the end of February. She is trying to renegotiate the backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mr Coveney told Sky News said that while the EU stands firm on not changing the withdrawal agreement it is trying to ""provide reassurance and clarification for the British parliament to allow them to ratify this deal"". He said Brexit was ""not just about Westminster"". ""If Britain wants a deal you can't ask Ireland to compromise on something as fundamental as a peace process and relationships linked to the Good Friday Agreement in order to get a deal through,"" he said. Mr Coveney added that the government's position was ""about placating a group in the Conservative Party who are insisting on moving the prime minister away from her own policies"". ""The backstop was a British government construct as much as it was an EU and Irish government construct. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. ""This is about a shared responsibility,"" he added. He again reiterated the need for a guarantee to those in border counties that they will not face physical or security border infrastructure. ""Surely that not an unreasonable request."" The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March. However, the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time. Finding a solution for the Irish border is a major sticking pointing the Brexit talks Mrs May is expected to hold talks with European Council president Donald Tuskand other key EU figures in Egypt later during a summit between leaders of EU and Arab league countries. But Downing Street has played down hopes of a breakthrough on her Brexit deal being reached in Sharm el- Sheikh. The summit is the first between leaders of EU and Arab league countries and will focus on tackling concerns over security and migration, and boosting trade.

Cabinet trio's Brexit delay warning,"Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke Brexit should be delayed if Parliament does not approve a deal in the coming days, three cabinet ministers have warned publicly for the first time. Ahead of crucial votes in the Commons, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauketold the Daily Mail,externalthey would be prepared to defy Theresa May and vote for a delay. Downing Street said the trio's views on no deal were ""scarcely a secret"". Conservative Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen called on them to resign. ""They are rejecting government policy and they are threatening to vote against government policy next week,"" the MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""In that case, they should do the honourable thing and resign from the government immediately."" Number 10 said in a statement: ""The PM is working hard to ensure we get a deal with the EU that allows us to deliver on the result of the referendum. ""That is where the cabinet's energy should be focused."" Earlier, Mrs May's spokeswoman said the PM would have another ""period of engagement"" on Brexit at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt - including a meeting with European Council president Donald Tusk. The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March. But the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time. Brexit: A really simple guide May is warned dozens of Tories could rebel Lonely PM nears Article 50 endgame Hammond: 'No deal threat focusing minds' MPs are due to debate Brexit again next Wednesday and are expected to consider an amendment tabled by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour's Yvette Cooper. That would give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and prevent a no-deal situation if there is no agreement with the EU by the middle of March. Mr Clark, Ms Rudd and Mr Gauke argue if a deal is not endorsed by MPs imminently ""it would be better to seek to extend Article 50 and delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on March 29"". Mr Clark, the business secretary, along with Ms Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, and the justice secretary, Mr Gauke, said there had been ""months of uncertainty"". They wrote: ""It is time MPs recognised the need to get a deal, accepted that this is the only deal on offer, and supported it."" But they also warned Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) that Parliament will block the UK leaving without a deal, stating that if there is a delay ""they will have no-one to blame but themselves"". They said: ""Beyond the next few days, there simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation before March 29."" Their article comes after the BBC was told dozens of normally loyal Conservatives could back plans to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal if a reworked version of Mrs May's plan does not pass. Mark Francois, Tory MP and vice-chairman of the ERG, told the BBC that ""the prime minister will want to know why three members of her cabinet have decided to publicly decry government policy"" and added that he thought it was ""interesting that the chancellor has not signed the letter"". However Tory MP Nick Boles, who voted Remain but supports Mrs May's deal, said they were ""courageous and principled"" for speaking out to try to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Anna Soubry, who quit the Conservatives this week over Brexit to join the Independent Group, said the move was a sign of the ""complete chaos that's now existing at the top of government"". The MP, who supports another EU referendum, said the trio had to go to the press because ""they can't win the argument in a deeply divided cabinet"". Meanwhile, Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle are planning to put forward an amendment that would allow Mrs May's deal to pass in the Commons, as long as it is then put to the public in another vote. Mr Wilson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his amendment had the support of shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and he hoped to secure the backing of the rest of the Labour front bench. By Vicki Young, BBC chief political correspondent It is a pretty incredible intervention by these three cabinet ministers. Time and time again Theresa May has said the UK is leaving the EU on 29 March, in just five weeks' time. It's a very different message from these three. They've all made it very clear they wouldn't accept a no deal scenario. Now publicly, for the first time, they've said Brexit would have to be delayed if Parliament doesn't back a deal next week. In their article in the Daily Mail they've got a pretty stark warning to their colleagues. This is happening because, on Wednesday, there will be an attempt by MPs to seize control of that Brexit process. These three are suggesting that they will be prepared to resign in order to back that move. This is piling the pressure on Mrs May to get the changes to the deal, to bring it back early next week, but it's also piling the pressure on their colleagues to get behind the deal. Don't be in any doubt, what they are saying is not government policy.

Saturday's 13-mile event got under way at Craster with the finish line at Bamburgh. Mr Airey said: ""For a half marathon I never intended to do, I really enjoyed it. ""When Sophie took her own life and this opportunity, shall we say, fell to me to take her place it just seemed the right thing to do."" Sophie Airey had planned to participate in the half marathon He added: ""The last couple of miles coming up the beach I did start to think about Sophie being with me. ""It should have been her [running] rather than me, which was hard. She would've been very proud. ""I'm carrying Sophie with me. I have done right from the moment we found out she'd gone."" Mr Airey said raising awareness of suicide prevention charities such as Papyrus had been an important focus. ""If we can get more people to look at what Papyrus do then we can save lives.

"Supermarket health claims 'confusing'Retailers should be more transparent on food classification, say public health experts.Health","Supermarkets routinely brand vegan products as ""healthier"" Products high in salt and saturated fats are being marketed as healthy by leading supermarkets,BBC Radio 5 Live Investigateshas found. The British Dietetic Association said stores including Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's were being ""unhelpful"" and ""confusing"" customers. The Royal Society for Public Health called for an independent supermarket regulator. Supermarkets said they were committed to ""promoting healthy eating"". BBC researchers visited the top five supermarkets in the UK and found Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco were stocking products high in salt and saturated fat in sections marked ""healthier choices"" and ""healthy and diet meals"". Morrisons' ""healthier choices"" section contained a vegetarian steak slice with almost 10g of saturated fat - nearly half of the recommended maximum daily amount. The supermarket said the item ""provides customers with a red-meat free alternative"". Sainsbury's edamame, coconut and lemongrass falafel contained more than 6g of saturated fat per half pack - around a third of the recommended maximum daily amount - and was located in their ""healthier choices"" section. In Tesco's ""healthy and diet meals"" section, a ""lamb hotpot"" contained 8.5g of saturated fat, 45% of the recommended maximum daily amount. Registered nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed said she was ""quite shocked"" at some of the items being marketed as 'healthier choices'. She said: ""I'm not saying there's anything wrong with eating them or consuming them in moderation - but telling consumers these are healthier options is a bit misleading."" Nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed said the 'healthier choices' sections of supermarkets are misleading The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) said many products are being identified as ""healthy"" because they are vegetarian, vegan, free from certain ingredients, or have fewer calories. But, it said, many have high levels of fat, salt or sugar, and are highly processed. ""Supermarkets should be transparent about how they classify foods, and provide clear information about products,"" the RSPH added. ""There must be incentives and penalties for presenting clear and accurate information. ""Perhaps there is potential to have an independent supermarket regulator. It is important that the good work done so far on labelling is not undermined."" A British Dietetic Association (BDA) spokesperson said supermarkets had a ""duty of care"" to their customers. ""It is unhelpful and confusing to the consumer, and supermarkets should avoid doing this,"" they added. ""They should be promoting and educating people to buy foods that actually are healthy - not just marketed as being so."" Trading standards representatives said they would be speaking to supermarkets Morrisons' own brand lentil hotpot contained almost a third of the recommended maximum daily amount of salt - almost 2g - but was stocked in the ""healthier choices"" section. Smoked meat substitute slices marketed as healthy in Sainsbury's contained almost two grams of salt per four slices, making them more salty than seawater. Action on Salt, which campaigns for a reduction in the consumption of salt, said it was very time-consuming for shoppers to check every label to find a healthier option. ""Placing products in 'healthier choice' sections of supermarkets should ideally highlight products that are actually better for our health,"" it said. ""However, we've found that many of the vegetarian and vegan products in these sections of the supermarket can be high in salt, with some vegetarian burgers containing more salt than real beef burgers, meaning shoppers are being given a false sense of security. ""Supermarkets should have stronger criteria in place for products allowed to be displayed in their 'healthier choice' sections."" Dietitians say the mislabelling of foods in supermarkets is confusing Council trading standards officers enforce food safety laws that cover health and nutrition claims in individual supermarkets. Hertfordshire and West Yorkshire trading standards services - the principal trading standards partners for Tesco and Morrisons - toldBBC Radio 5 Live Investigatesthey will be making further enquiries with both supermarkets. Tesco said: ""We are sorry that some of our products were mistakenly included under the 'Healthy and Diet Meals' sign and are rectifying this immediately."" It added that all nutritional information is clearly listed on packaging. Sainsbury's said: ""Our range of healthier meals are currently stocked alongside our vegetarian and plant-based options. In some cases our signs were not updated to reflect this and we are putting this right."" It said it was committed to helping customers live ""healthier lives"". Morrisons said: ""Our 'Healthier Choices' section provides customers with the option to buy an item that is healthier than a product that meets a similar need. A 'Healthier Choices' cheese will be substantially lower in fat than ones we sell elsewhere but might still carry a red traffic light label."" 5 Live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live, 24 February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC Sounds Families 'struggle to afford healthy food' 'Simple swaps' for healthy meals Junk food 'still placed at tills' Call for price offers on healthy food Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours': Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Curtis defends Oscars amid 'chaos',"This video can not be played Jamie Lee Curtis on the ""moving machine"" that is the Oscars It's fair to say the Academy Awards have rowed back on just about every change they've tried to make to the Oscars ceremony this year. They wanted, for example, toannouncesome winners in the commercial breaks to save time. That idea didn't last. They wanted tointroducea new popular film category to recognise more mainstream movies. That idea didn't last. Put together with Kendrick Lamarpulling out of performing,externaland thelack of a host this year, it's understandable that the planning of this year's event hasbeen described,externalas chaotic. One Hollywood veteran, however, tells BBC News that things should be kept in perspective ahead of Sunday's ceremony. ""Chaos? It's just an awards show! Goodness me. Take it down a level,"" says Jamie Lee Curtis at the ICG Publicists Awards in Los Angeles. The 2019 Academy Awards take place this Sunday evening ""You know what, those were just some missteps, everybody's trying to figure out how to make these things shorter, a little more easy on the eyes. ""Obviously they made a couple of missteps but they've made somehuge strides in diversityand inclusivity, so you have to remember it's a moving machine, it's not something rigid. ""And they're trying some new things. It didn't go well, they're pulling it back, and they'll figure it out. But it's an awards show, let's put it into that category."" The Oscar film that almost had a different star 17 quirky facts about this year's Oscars Curtis was being honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the publicists' luncheon, which is organised annually by the International Cinematographers Guild. The actress, who starred in A Fish Called Wanda and several Halloween movies, used her speech at the event to highlight the important role played by both press and publicists in the entertainment industry. Ben Stiller and Curtis presented at last month's Golden Globe Awards ""I believe in the freedom of the press. I believe that you have the right to ask me whatever question you want to ask me... And it is a dance that we have been doing for a very long time,"" she told the audience. ""We figure it out, we dance together and it is a mutually beneficial dance because this is show business - this is show-off business. ""[Some stars] don't talk to the press until they have a movie coming out... they are fraudulent. The truth is this is the game - this is how it's played and I am proud to play it with you."" Curtis was one of several stars at the event keen to champion this often-overlooked area of the industry. ""You wouldn't know much about a film or the actors without a publicist,"" explains Sheryl Main, the co-chair of the awards. ""A great publicity team can make a difference, especially on a smaller film that doesn't have a big budget, maybe doesn't have a huge studio behind it."" Jon M Chu says Crazy Rich Asians would have struggled without a strong PR campaign Crazy Rich Asians is one recent film which benefitted hugely from a strong PR campaign, its director Jon M Chu acknowledges. ""We had a lot of trouble before the movie came out when testing the movie,"" he tells BBC News. ""A lot of people didn't know the book, some people who did know the book were sceptical of Hollywood. Other people thought the title wasn't for them. ""So our publicity team, our marketing team, everyone on the Warner Bros side, had to really get in the dirt and had to show the world what we were and what we stood for."" The team promoting the movie ensured its groundbreaking status was championed. What this Oscar winner did with his jet ski Oscars 2019: The nominees in full Crazy Rich Asians was the first Hollywood film in 25 years to feature an all-Asian principal cast, a fact manynews outlets started to pick up on,externalas the campaign progressed. ""One by one, it was a masterclass for me to witness how it became a must-see movie,"" says Chu, adding he is now working on a sequel. ""We are in the very beginning stages still. Throwing around a lot of ideas, a lot of good ideas, bad ideas, so we're trying to weed it out to find the best one, we won't make it unless it's great."" Michelle Yeoh said there was ""disappointment"" when the film didn't receive any Oscar nods One of the film's stars, Michelle Yeoh, describes the publicity campaign as ""one of the crucial, most important things"" in the success of the film. ""We're not under the Marvel banner, with the huge name, we didn't have a lot of big stars,"" she tells BBC News. ""So we pushed it in such a way that it captured the imagination of the audiences and it drew them and made them curious about the lifestyle, the culture, the songs, the food, the glamour."" But despite its box office success, Crazy Rich Asians failed to pick up any nominations at this year's Oscars. ""I guess there's always hope, you'd love that your film be nominated. Of course there's the disappointment when it's not, but when you think about it, everything really went against our movie,"" Yeoh says. ""Because it's a romantic comedy, it's an all-Asian cast, that's unheard of for 25 years, so can you imagine, for it to achieve the success that it already has done, is such a reward for us. ""It would have been the cherry on the cake if we'd had a nomination, but our publicity team had to work through so many hurdles just to get us where we are."" Chu priased Jordan Peele and Alfonso Cuaron for helping change the face of Hollywood It could have been a very different story if the Academy had pressed ahead with the popular film category - which almost certainly would've been one in which Crazy Rich Asians was recognised. But in spite of that, Chu thinks it was the right choice for the Academy to drop it. ""I'm a big fan of the classic Academy Award categories,"" he says. ""So I wasn't a huge fan of doing a popular film category, even if it meant maybe we'd get a better chance. I honestly didn't think we had any chance to be in the awards season, so this has all been very amazing to go through and live through."" Chu recalled the most bizarre moment of the awards season so far - which occurred at a gents toilets urinal last month. ""I went to the bathroom at the Golden Globes, and on my left was Alfonso Cuaron, and on my right was Jordan Peele, and I was like 'Oh, this is Hollywood now', and it was an amazing feeling. It was great to see how the face of Hollywood had changed."" 17 quirky facts about this year's Oscars The Oscar film that almost had a different star What this Oscar winner did with his jet ski Oscars 2019: Winners in full Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours': Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

The suspect, who reportedly warned he had a pistol, was killed when security forces stormed the plane after it made an emergency landing in Chittagong. All 148 passengers and crew on board the Biman Bangladesh Airlines Flight BG147 disembarked safely. It is not yet clear why the suspect may have attempted to hijack the plane. Army officials said the man, believed to be aged 25, was initially wounded when shots were fired on Sunday but died shortly afterwards, AFP news agency reports.

"Opposition call to oust Venezuelan leaderAmid bloody violence, the opposition leader asks other nations to consider ""all measures"".Latin America & Caribbean","Saturday saw deadly confrontations at border crossings as volunteers attempted to collect aid US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's ""days are numbered"" after deadly clashes over humanitarian aid. ""Picking exact days is difficult. I'm confident that the Venezuelan people will ensure that Maduro's days are numbered,"" Mr Pompeo told CNN. Two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro, who blocked aid deliveries. Self-declared interim President Juan GuaidÃ³ said Mr Maduro must resign. In pictures: Border clashes How the day unfolded Mr GuaidÃ³, who has been recognised as interim leader by more than 50 countries, has called on other nations to consider ""all measures"" to oust Mr Maduro after opposition-led efforts to bring in aid descended into clashes. He also said he would attend a meeting of mostly Latin American countries in Colombia on Monday, despite being under a travel ban imposed by Mr Maduro. US Vice-President Mike Pence will represent Washington at the talks in Bogota. A senior White House official said on Sunday that Mr Pence was planning to announce ""concrete steps"" and ""actions"" in addressing the crisis at the talks on Monday, Reuters news agency reported. Meanwhile, Colombia and Brazil said they would intensify pressure on Mr Maduro to relinquish power. US President Donald Trump has not ruled out an armed response to the Venezuela crisis. Venezuelan police prevented aid crossing the Simon Bolivar International Bridge Protesters at the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge on the border between Cucuta, Colombia, and Venezuela Separately on Sunday, a boat carrying US aid from Puerto Rico to Venezuela was forced to dock on the small Dutch territory island of CuraÃ§ao after it was intercepted by the Venezuelan navy off the northern coast, AFP news agency reports. The vessel was reportedly loaded with nine cargo containers filled with food and medicine. The supply ship that was forced to dock on the island of CuraÃ§ao Mr Maduro, who says he is the legitimate president and is backed by key economic allies including Russia, Cuba and China, has warned that deliveries of foreign aid would open the way for US military intervention. Mr GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim president last month, argues that alleged irregularities with the nation's 2018 election render Mr Maduro's leadership illegitimate. Venezuela's opposition had intended to peacefully bring aid trucks over the borders with Brazil and Colombia. Mr GuaidÃ³ had pledged that the aid would come into the country on Saturday. In response, Mr Maduro partly closed the country's borders. Venezuelans civilians attempted to cross in order to get to the stores of food and medicine, but the attempt quickly descended into bloody violence. Soldiers opened fire against civilians, using a mixture of live ammunition and rubber bullets. A demonstrator runs into barbed wire strung across a street in UreÃ±a Venezuela crisis - in nine charts At least two people including a 14-year-old boy were killed, human rights groups said. There were also reports that some aid stockpiled on the border had been burned. Mr Pompeo described the reports as ""sickening"". ""Our deepest sympathies to the families of those who have died due to these criminal acts,""he wrote on Twitter,external. ""We join their demand for justice."" This video can not be played Venezuela-Colombia border turns violent At least 60 soldiers had defected by late Saturday, according to Colombia's migration service, but most of the military appeared to still be loyal to Mr Maduro. Video footage showed Venezuelan soldiers crashing their armoured vehicles into the border with Colombia in order to defect. Another video posted on social mediaappeared to show four soldiers publicly denouncing the president and announcing their support for GuaidÃ³.,external This video can not be played The moment Venezuelan troops crashed through border into Colombia Mr GuaidÃ³ promised the defectors amnesty if they joined the ""right side of history"". Late on Saturday, Colombia's government estimated the number of injured at border crossings to be about 300. Amnesty International described the use of live ammunition by Venezuelan troops as a crime under international law. President Maduro has ignored international calls to hold new elections. He has accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of being an ""American pawn"" and an ""imperialist beggar"". As protests got under way at Venezuela's borders, Mr Maduro staged a rally in Caracas. ""Take your hands off Venezuela, Donald Trump,"" he told a cheering crowd. Venezuela crisis - in nine charts Genuine aid or a Trojan horse? US sending aid 'at GuaidÃ³'s request' The US is leading the international effort to pressure Mr Maduro, and has implemented a raft of financial sanctions against his government. The humanitarian aid stockpiled in Colombia and Brazil is at the centre of a stand-off between Mr Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³ that goes back to Mr Maduro's disputed re-election in 2018. For several years Venezuela has been in the grip of a political and economic crisis. An out-of-control inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items. More than three million people have fled Venezuela in recent years, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

The naked women adorning Britain's churches,"This sheela-na-gig at Oaksey in Wiltshire boasts ""pendulous breasts"" and a vulva ""extended almost to her ankles"" For hundreds of years carvings of naked women have sat provocatively on churches across Britain. But who created them - and why? Look at these, my child-bearing hips Look at these, my ruby red ruby lips... Sheela-na-gig, Sheela-na-gig You exhibitionist The year is 1992 and the singer-songwriter PJ Harvey is performing Sheela-Na-Gig, the most successful single from her critically acclaimed album Dry. But unless you're a fan of late 20th Century indie music, or an expert in Norman church architecture, there's every chance you've not been exposed to the sheela-na-gig - or have walked past one without even realising it. [This article contains some graphic imagery] Hidden in plain sight, these sculptures of squatting women pulling back their labia have for nearly a millennium sparked intrigue, shame and even anger. Often overlooked, or perhaps ignored, by vicars and congregations, the figures can be seen in dozens of British churches. The UK's ""poster girl for sheela-na-gigs"" can be found at the Church of St Mary and St David in Kilpeck, Herefordshire For the past 20 years John Harding, from the Sheela Na Gig Project, has covered thousands of miles tracking down sightings of them across the country. His obsession began following a visit to a church in Shropshire in 1998. After finding very little information online, he decided to post something himself and was inundated with possible sightings. ""They are not quite as rare as the yeti but they're not common,"" he says. ""You get pockets of them. In Shropshire they are all within about 10 miles of each other and they're all different - but they're all naked women, basically."" Ireland has the largest concentration of sheela-na-gigs, while in the UK there are about 60 known figures with ""more popping up all the time"", according to Mr Harding. ""Sheela is the Irish form of the Norman name Cecile, and 'gig' is actually English slang and it means a woman's bits,"" he explains. A sheela-na-gig was found face down in a Llandrindod Wells church's coal pile But why these stone carvings were displayed in Norman churches across Britain, Ireland, France and Spain has divided opinion. Some suggest the figures depict a pre-Christian deity, others that they are a fertility symbol or a protection against evil. Dr Barbara Freitag, author of Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma, believes they were made by local carvers for country churches to promote a successful birth. ""Generally sheelas are carved in the birthing position and are presented with their vulva in the desired physiological state before, during or after birth,"" she says. ""The emaciated upper half of these figures was meant to appease the dead mothers or grandmothers who were thought to bear a grudge against the newborn."" Two-time Mercury Prize winner Polly Jean Harvey drew inspiration from the sheela-na-gig for one of her best-loved songs For Georgia Rhoades, author of Decoding the Sheela-na-gig, the ""nude and bald"" women represent the Crone or Earth Goddess. ""They were pagan goddess figures, emblematic of the Earth Goddess who births us and takes us back into her at death,"" she explains. ""In some places, brides were required to look at and perhaps touch the sheela before weddings, which seems to suggest their role in fertility rites."" Mr Harding, however, thinksthe explicit church sculptures,externalwere meant to warn people against the sin of lust. ""Sheelas in this country are cartoonish and not very attractive generally, but in Ireland some are downright monstrous and scare the willies out of you."" He adds: ""There's one inHaverfordwest [in Pembrokeshire] in the cloisters, holding its dress up,external. ""The only people who would have seen it would have been clerics and monks, so it's obviously to do with sin."" The sheela at St Mary's in Easthorpe, Colchester, was deemed too obscene to remain at the church and was given to a museum In the UK the ""poster girl for sheela-na-gigs"" can be found on Kilpeck Church near Hereford, according to Mr Harding. However, it is the sheela at the parish church in the Wiltshire village of Oaksey, with her ""pendulous breasts"" and ""hugely exaggerated vulva"", which is his favourite. ""When you see the Oaksey sheela, most people's reaction is 'good God',"" he says. ""It's the most kind of in-your-face and it's the breasts as well - the Kilpeck sheela just has nipples, but here you've got all the womanly attributes."" Positioned next to the main door of the church, a small lead roof has been installed above the carving to protect it. Since starting the Sheela Na Gig Project as a hobby, John Harding has become so knowledgeable he was invited by Encyclopaedia Britannica to write the entry But not all congregations have been keen to embrace these X-rated sculptures. In the Essex village of Easthorpe, a sheela was deemed too obscene to keep and so was given to a museum after serving time in the vicarage garden rockery. Some have been found in rivers with ""marks of burning on them"", Mr Harding says, while others were removed, hidden or destroyed by red-faced clergyman and shocked churchgoers. In 2004, a topless figure which had been in a chapel in Buncton in West Sussex since the early 1100s was attacked, despite having ""no obvious genitals on display"". ""It wasn't a very well known one, it was an inoffensive thing,"" says Mr Harding. ""I put it up on the website and somebody went in at night and chiselled it off the wall."" A common reaction to seeing the sheela-na-gig at Oaksey in Wiltshire is ""good God"", according to Mr Harding And it's not just the full-frontal brashness of the sheela that has outraged sensibilities. Phallic figures found on the corbels [wall brackets] in churches are thought to have come under attack by the Victorians. ""In Kilpeck there are a number of corbels missing, and there's a story that an old chap said he was ordered by the vicar's wife to chop some of the corbels off,"" Mr Harding says. A male in a ""state of arousal"" can even be found alongside a female figure at one Wiltshire church, as Mr Harding explains. ""At St John in Devizes they're on the same piece of stone - a female exhibitionist showing her bits and a male figure which appears to be masturbating."" At the church of St Mary and St Andrew in Cambridgeshire, a sheela can be seen next to a naked male figure. ""You've got this animalistic man with this massive erection and this sheela na gig which is quite plump and fecund with her legs held apart and he's crawling towards her,"" he says. This pair, she with a ""clearly visible"" vulva and he clutching his damaged penis, were discovered at the church of St John in Devizes in 2006 In the roof of Avening Church in Gloucestershire an ""acrobatic type"" can be seen with his head between his legs and a penis in his mouth In Bristol, graphic artwork can be spotted in the 1,200 roof bosses [carved decorations] at St Mary Redcliffe. Among a number of exhibitionist figures there is a contortionist ""showing their bottom with all their other bits"", a naked couple, and a man with ""his trousers down - having a poo"". And if that wasn't enough to make a choirmaster blush, high in the roof beams of Avening Church in Gloucestershire an ""acrobatic type"" can be seen jutting out from the wall with his head between his legs and a penis in his mouth. ""Penis swallowers are basically a monstrous head swallowing their own penises,"" explains Mr Harding. ""Sometimes they're playing instruments and it looks very suggestive, but in Avening Church if it is bagpipes, he's not holding it. So it's fairly self-supporting, shall we say."" Princess Alice disaster: The Thames' 650 forgotten dead 'Why I chose to have my leg amputated' The warrior queen who 'achieved the incredible' For the Church of England, the presence of stone genitalia in places of worship is all part of the ""rich tradition of church decoration"" over the centuries. A sheela can be seen next to a naked male figure in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire ""As with other gargoyles and grotesques, it is sometimes surprising to modern eyes to encounter them in a religious context,"" a spokesman says. ""But they reflect the diversity of architectural ornament found on churches up and down the country."" And even though the experts might not think alike as to what purpose sheela-na-gigs served, many do agree on one thing. ""In this country a lot of them seem to be smiling and are quite cheerful-looking,"" says Mr Harding. Ms Rhoades agrees that many sheelas ""are clearly enjoying themselves"". ""My favourite is at Oaksey, where the sheela's vulva is extended almost to her ankles,"" she says. ""We don't know exactly what her message is, but she's joyous and it's clear where the message is coming from.""

How will the Oscars ceremony change this year?,"Queen and Adam Lambert will perform at this year's Oscars ceremony Every year, the public seem to be interested in everything to do with the Oscars. Except, that is, for the ceremony itself. This year's event takes place on Sunday night, but while most of us enjoy finding out who's won best actress or best picture, fewer people than ever have been actually tuning in to watch the telecast. Last year, the ceremony's live audience was thelowest in in Oscars history, averaging 26.5 million viewers, down from 32.9 million in 2017. The increased competition from streaming services will certainly have played a part - but it's also likely to be audience fatigue at how bloated the three-and-a-half hour ceremony has become. Beale Street wins big ahead of Oscars Oscars 2019: The nominees in full ""The first Oscars took less than 10 minutes,"" points out Scott Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter, ""which was obviously pre-television. ""Television came along, and networks paid a fortune for the Oscars, and as a result they expected a more complete kind of show. ""That meant no longer just handing out the awards but adding performance elements, so it became more telegenic, to include singing, dancing and comedy."" Comedians like Chris Rock, Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Kimmel haverecently hostedthe show to keep the audience entertained between awards and with an opening stand-up routine. Jimmy Kimmel, Ellen DeGeneres and Chris Rock have hosted the Oscars in recent years There are also traditionally five musical performances from the best original song nominees. But adding all these elements to the 24 categories means the telecast is just too long for some viewers to bear. Jamie Lee Curtis defends Oscars amid 'chaos' 17 quirky facts about this year's Oscars Consequently, the Academy had this year attempted to bring some changes to try and keep audiences tuning in - most significantly by shortening the length of the telecast to three hours. But they've since had to row back on nearly all their time-saving decisions due to pressure from the film industry. The Academy initially said that the winners of four of the categories would be announcedduring commercial breaks,external, with edited highlights being shown in the latter part of the telecast. The prizes for cinematography, film editing, live-action short and makeup and hairstyling would have been given out while the audience at home is grabbing extra TV snacks. But, suggests Feinberg: ""That would've been really risky. ""During commercials, when people at the ceremony know they're not live on the air, they run around and talk to people, go to the bathroom, be a little loud, and that could've come across as disrespectful to the winners who are getting their awards during that time."" Several high-profile figures in the film industry, including Spike Lee, Seth Rogen and Martin Scorsese, alsoobjected to the change. So the Academyreinstated the categories, and told its members last week: ""All awards will be presented without edits, in our traditional format."" Crazy Rich Asians may not have any nominations, but one of its stars Awkwafina has been enlisted as one of the category presenters With the same number of categories to get through, the biggest time-saver may end up being thelack of a host. AfterKevin Hart's departure, the Academy confirmed this year would instead just have a mixture of celebrities introducing individual categories. Jennifer Lopez, Whoopi Goldberg, Daniel Craig, Awkwafina and Tina Fey are among those who the Academy will be hoping keep viewers at home engaged. It means the opening monologue from the host will be skipped, also saving time, but it's unlikely the ceremony will launch straight into handing out awards. What this Oscar winner did with his jet ski 9 things we spotted in the Oscars class photo Karey Burke, the president of TV network ABC, which broadcasts the Oscars, saysthere is something special in the works,externalto launch the ceremony. ""We have a very exciting opener planned. We are not going to go straight into people thanking their agents,"" she said. There will also be atightening up of the rules,externalaround acceptance speeches. At the Academy's annual luncheon last month, nominees were told they'd have 90 seconds from the time their name is called until when their speech will need to be a concluded. ""It means you can hit the parties by 8:15,""Oscars producer Glenn Weiss pointed out,external. Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar are both nominated for best song this year Such changes might make the ceremony tighter, but those may not be the only things preventing viewers from tuning in. In his10-point plan to save the Oscars,externallast year, Piers Morgan suggested the Academy should ""slash the musical performances in half and get rid of the best song category"". But the Academy confirmed it wouldn't be cutting any of the songs - so this year's nominees, including Lady Gaga, will perform as normal. (They had initially flirted with the idea of only having a couple of the nominees perform, but this wasanother idea they quickly decided against,externalafter industry backlash.) The only absentee from the best song performances will be Kendrick Lamar - whodropped out earlier this week,externaldue to logistical issues. Not only will four of the best song nominees perform - but there will be a bonus musical performance Queen and Adam Lambert,the Academy announced last week,external. They're being included because one of the nominated films this year is the band's biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. Another of Morgan's suggestions was: ""Stop giving the best picture award to obscure films very few non-movie people actually see, like or understand."" Moonlight won best picture in 2017 despite its more muted box office success His last point referred to the number of small, arthouse films that have won in recent years at the expense of box office smashes. In 2017, for example, the hugely popular La La Land, which grossed $440m (Â£334m), lost out to Moonlight, which took less than a fifth of that - $65m (Â£49m). ""If you look at the numbers over the years, the ratings closely correlate to the popularity of the best picture nominees, because then people feel they have a rooting interest in the outcome,"" says Feinberg. ""Last year, it's not surprising the ratings took a hit because Three Billboards and The Shape of Water were not the films the audiences were going to in big numbers. The Oscar film that almost had a different star ""If they'd nominated something like Wonder Woman, I think the numbers probably would've been a little better. This year, they have a lot riding on Black Panther. ""It's important for ABC, the Academy, Disney, that Black Panther not be snubbed."" Black Panther's popularity is perhaps one of the reasons the Academy attempted to introduce a new category this year to recognise more box office hits. Black Panther won the top prize at the Screen Actors Guild awards last month Last August, it announced theintroduction of the popular film category, which Black Panther would not only have definitely been nominated for, but would most likely have also won. But this turned out to be another decision they would backtrack on - blaming the complications of introducing a new category so late in the year, when studios hadn't had time to prepare or target their promotional campaigns towards awards season. It also would've meant yet another category to get through on the night - and most agree the Academy certainly doesn't need any more of those. ""Over the years the number of categories at the Oscars has grown,"" says Feinberg, ""and it's much easier to add categories than it is to take them off the air. ""And that's because once a category is on the air, the people who would be affected by it don't want to lose that potential air time for their area of work."" Keeping the Oscars both short and entertaining is a surprisingly tall order in this day and age of short attention spans.

Why 56 black men are posing in hoodies,"Cephas Williams - number 34 - started the project Cephas Williams is tired of how people look at him when he wears his hoodie. ""I am a black man with a degree in architecture, and I find I am not taken seriously when I walk into a room full of strangers."" Cephas is now trying to change perceptions of black men through the use of photography. The 27-year-old is an entrepreneur from New Cross, south-east London, who works in the community. But he says people don't see him for the person he is - and are quick to judge and stereotype him. He is tired of what he calls the negative portrayal of black men within the media and the stigma attached to them in public. ""I may be sitting on a train and there's a spare seat next to me, and you see people looking to see if it's OK to sit next to me. And I have to gesture to let them know it is safe."" Cephas has started a campaign called 56 Black Men. Using social media as a platform, he posts striking headshots of black men in hoodies. These men are politicians, directors, teachers - all of them have positive life stories that are irrelevant to the attire they choose to wear. But the media very rarely tells those positive stories, he says, so the campaign ""serves as a reminder that for every black man you see represented doing something negative, there are 56 of us that aren't"". Cephas, who founded Drummer Boy Studios, says he wants to show young black boys they can be something other than an entertainer or a criminal. ""Everyone is talking about knife crime and gang culture and violence and that is not the majority of us. ""How is that going to change the trajectory or the options for young black boys who are looking at the media and seeing themselves in a negative light all the time? ""A lot of us have become what we have been portrayed to be and I have had enough."" Mandem project challenges stereotypes Young black men on stop and search The men in his campaign say the hoodie is the most demonised outfit, but Cephas talks of having to change his behaviour to make people feel more comfortable even if he's in a suit. ""It's not nice knowing that I intimidate people. It makes me feel uneasy. I'm an extremely nice person and when I know that people around me feel uncomfortable, I adjust."" Despite his qualifications and experience, he often feels he has to change his mannerisms and demeanour and speaks of putting on his ""white voice"" in meetings. He hopes that one day, his future children won't have to - and will be comfortable in the skin they have, the way they speak and the clothing they choose to wear - even if it is a hoodie. William Adoasi is number 42 on the list of 56. The entrepreneur from Peckham, south London, says the campaign is powerful ""because it tells the next generation that the majority out there, even those who may not come from ideal backgrounds - are doing great"". William Adoasi - number 42 - owns a successful watch company William, 28, owns watch company Vitae London which supports children in sub-Saharan Africa. In just two-and-a-half-years, it has sold products in more than 30 countries, gained Sir Richard Branson as an ambassador and provided more than 2,000 items of school uniform to kids in need. But he says this doesn't stop people clutching their purses or crossing the street when he passes by. ""We have accepted this as the norm, but it shouldn't be for the next generation, they should be comfortable in their own skin and shouldn't feel like they intimidate other people. ""I really hope that this is a call for action to the media to seek out role models. We can complain about the negative, but if the media don't provide the platform needed to see more positivity, you are facilitating the negative to continue."" David Lammy - number 55 - is a Labour MP Even one of the country's most high-profile black politicians says he isn't exempt from stereotypes. ""It's still too easy for people to fall into lazy impulses about what it means to be a black man in a hoodie,"" Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy says. ""I know so many black men doing great things, as postmen, nurses, city traders and fathers. But when these guys put on a hoodie, their success becomes almost invisible. ""I want to live in a society where I can put on a pair of sweatpants and a hoodie and be seen as who I am: not a thug or a brute, but just a guy going to the gym after a long day at work."" Cephas says he is tired of asking for change and hopes the campaign will shine the light on successful black men. ""So much damage has been caused because we have been shoehorned into an identity that does not reflect our full reality. ""I am taking the shoehorn out and showcasing a bagga man who are doing great things and - who look like me.""

'Incurable optimist' could die any day,"This video can not be played Amy-Claire shares what life is like with a terminal illness Agonising spasms strike Amy-Claire Davies several times a day, and any one of them could kill her. Born with an unknown genetic condition, she has to take more than 40 pills every day, lives in pain and needs round-the-clock care. But the 24-year-old, who was not expected to live past childhood, has chosen to dream of a bright future focussing on her family, friends, boyfriend and hobbies. ""Life is amazing,"" she said. She says she is part of a ""new generation"" of people who, despite being expected to die as children, are still alive well into adulthood thanks to medical advances. Amy-Claire lives life to the full despite needing round-the-clock care for her degenerative condition ""My world is full of love. I love mammy and daddy, and I love our dogs, I love my friends and family and I love bright clothes, films and books and music, I love unicorns, coffee and of course, I love my new boyfriend Blue,"" she added. ""I have hopes and dreams for an incredible future. All normal stuff - a house, job, family and above all else, happiness and love."" Amy-Claire's brain sends the wrong messages to the rest of her body, and any emotion such as feeling anxious, sad or happy can make her spasm. She fights for her life every time - struggling for every breath with her heart rate rising to a dangerous level. Amy-Claire's bowel does not work so she takes four sachets of a laxative every morning, and endures a daily colonic irrigation while singing along to Whigfield's Saturday Night. She has to take the drug fentanyl which would be fatal to most people. But she enjoys learning guitar, taking dance classes, yoga and the gym. She trained to swim at the London 2012 Paralympics, but ended up being too ill to compete. Amy-Claire, aged 10, when it was believed she had cerebral palsy Unlike most people in their 20s, Amy-Claire, who is from Swansea, has an end-of-life plan in place detailing exactly how she would like her death to be managed and details such as which songs she would like played at her funeral. ""I'd really like to trade my body in for a new model,"" she said. ""Constant agony sucks, nausea sucks. ""There's no cure and I literally live my life knowing each day could be my last."" Amy-Claire, who describes herself as a ""miracle baby"" as her parents were told they could not have children, was wrongly diagnosed with cerebral palsy as a child. But when she hit puberty, the spasms began. And at 15, doctors told Amy-Claire and her parents she could die at any time. When she was 15, doctors told Amy-Claire and her family she could die at any moment ""I don't ever remember not being ill,"" Amy-Claire said. ""My friends were growing up, dating and doing all sorts of cool stuff while I was going to a children's hospice... We prepared for the end."" She spent her teenage years in a whirlwind race to achieve 200 bucket list dreams. ""I'd never expected to grow up, then as I was daring to imagine a future everything changed,"" she said. ""I'll never forget the day. I was at home just before my 19th birthday. It was the day that I died."" A spasm had made Amy-Claire's heart stop. Her mother and then health workers spent eight hours resuscitating her. From then on she and her family were terrified it could happen again and Amy-Claire moved to a residential home in Cardiff for 24-hour care. Amy-Claire loves travelling and has been to Amsterdam twice After initially fixating on how long she had left, she says she accepts ""I've got as long as I've got"". ""When I have the really painful ones [spasms], literally my brain just goes 'I wanna die'. ""I'll just sit there and my brain just goes over and over and over 'I wanna die'. ""I think the hardest one especially for mum and dad is I'll say sometimes 'why won't you just let me die?'"" Amy-Claire says she has a constant battle against pain Due to her spasms, Amy-Claire has been left with post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, extreme anxiety and says she has been suicidal. ""I just got so tired from the constant battle but through therapy and a lot of love and support I'm battling on,"" she added. ""I'm a strong woman because I was raised by a strong woman."" For Amy-Claire, being alive is about making the most of every day. Her condition is incurable, but she chooses to be an optimist and dares to think about the future. Amy-Claire's story, The Incurable Optimist, is on BBC One Wales, on Monday 25 February at 22:40 GMT and on BBC iPlayer.

Hanged schoolgirl's father 'let down',"Adrian Cook said he had not seen his daughter for two years before she died The father of a 13-year-old girl who was found hanged said the authorities ""let her down considerably"". Amber Peat left the Nottinghamshire home she shared with her mother and stepfather after a row. Her body was found three days later, on 2 June 2015. Assistant coroner Laurinda Bower said agencies missed 11 opportunities to prevent Amber's death. Her father Adrian Cook and his wife said those responsible for looking after Amber needed holding to account. The inquest heard Amber Peat complained to teachers about being punished and made to do chores The inquest at Nottingham Coroner's Court heard the opportunities missed by schools and agencies in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire could have resulted in a referral to social care. Mr Cook said: ""In my mind they let her down considerably. ""It's a personal fight for me. I'm standing for Amber. ""Amber wasn't the first and she certainly won't be the last. It's disgraceful."" Mr Cook said he last saw Amber in 2013 when he took her for a meal. He said he found out Amber, who lived in Mansfield, had gone missing when his wife saw something on Facebook. Amber's body was found close to her home three days after she was reported missing After the three-week inquest, Ms Bower said Amber's mother and stepfather, Kelly and Daniel Peat, had given ""very little, if any, consideration"" to her welfare. She also said she considered whether to return a conclusion of suicide but she could not be sure Amber intended to die. During the inquest, Mr and Mrs Peatsaid allegations about her enduring punishments and excessive chores were untrue. Mr Cook said he was not told when his daughter's surname was changed The coroner said the fact Amber saw Mr Cook only twice after her parents separated on Christmas Eve 2012 ""would, no doubt, have had an emotional impact on Amber and a destabilising effect on her life"". Mr Cook said the Peat family would often move around without him knowing and he was not told when his daughter's surname was changed. Amber's stepmother, Lynda Cook, who has been married to Mr Cook for four-and-a-half years but never met Amber, said they were not made aware of the problems the teenager was having. She said: ""Just because Amber's not here to say physically what happened; she told people and spoke to the right people, who should have protected her and done something about it. ""Anyone who was supposed to be looking after her needs bringing to account. Hopefully that will be done."" She added: ""The first time I saw her in the chapel of rest, I said to Amber, 'We'll get justice for you'. ""It's what she deserves.""

Opposition call to oust Venezuelan leader,"Saturday saw deadly confrontations at border crossings as volunteers attempted to collect aid US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's ""days are numbered"" after deadly clashes over humanitarian aid. ""Picking exact days is difficult. I'm confident that the Venezuelan people will ensure that Maduro's days are numbered,"" Mr Pompeo told CNN. Two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro, who blocked aid deliveries. Self-declared interim President Juan GuaidÃ³ said Mr Maduro must resign. In pictures: Border clashes How the day unfolded Mr GuaidÃ³, who has been recognised as interim leader by more than 50 countries, has called on other nations to consider ""all measures"" to oust Mr Maduro after opposition-led efforts to bring in aid descended into clashes. He also said he would attend a meeting of mostly Latin American countries in Colombia on Monday, despite being under a travel ban imposed by Mr Maduro. US Vice-President Mike Pence will represent Washington at the talks in Bogota. A senior White House official said on Sunday that Mr Pence was planning to announce ""concrete steps"" and ""actions"" in addressing the crisis at the talks on Monday, Reuters news agency reported. Meanwhile, Colombia and Brazil said they would intensify pressure on Mr Maduro to relinquish power. US President Donald Trump has not ruled out an armed response to the Venezuela crisis. Venezuelan police prevented aid crossing the Simon Bolivar International Bridge Protesters at the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge on the border between Cucuta, Colombia, and Venezuela Separately on Sunday, a boat carrying US aid from Puerto Rico to Venezuela was forced to dock on the small Dutch territory island of CuraÃ§ao after it was intercepted by the Venezuelan navy off the northern coast, AFP news agency reports. The vessel was reportedly loaded with nine cargo containers filled with food and medicine. The supply ship that was forced to dock on the island of CuraÃ§ao Mr Maduro, who says he is the legitimate president and is backed by key economic allies including Russia, Cuba and China, has warned that deliveries of foreign aid would open the way for US military intervention. Mr GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim president last month, argues that alleged irregularities with the nation's 2018 election render Mr Maduro's leadership illegitimate. Venezuela's opposition had intended to peacefully bring aid trucks over the borders with Brazil and Colombia. Mr GuaidÃ³ had pledged that the aid would come into the country on Saturday. In response, Mr Maduro partly closed the country's borders. Venezuelans civilians attempted to cross in order to get to the stores of food and medicine, but the attempt quickly descended into bloody violence. Soldiers opened fire against civilians, using a mixture of live ammunition and rubber bullets. A demonstrator runs into barbed wire strung across a street in UreÃ±a Venezuela crisis - in nine charts At least two people including a 14-year-old boy were killed, human rights groups said. There were also reports that some aid stockpiled on the border had been burned. Mr Pompeo described the reports as ""sickening"". ""Our deepest sympathies to the families of those who have died due to these criminal acts,""he wrote on Twitter,external. ""We join their demand for justice."" This video can not be played Venezuela-Colombia border turns violent At least 60 soldiers had defected by late Saturday, according to Colombia's migration service, but most of the military appeared to still be loyal to Mr Maduro. Video footage showed Venezuelan soldiers crashing their armoured vehicles into the border with Colombia in order to defect. Another video posted on social mediaappeared to show four soldiers publicly denouncing the president and announcing their support for GuaidÃ³.,external This video can not be played The moment Venezuelan troops crashed through border into Colombia Mr GuaidÃ³ promised the defectors amnesty if they joined the ""right side of history"". Late on Saturday, Colombia's government estimated the number of injured at border crossings to be about 300. Amnesty International described the use of live ammunition by Venezuelan troops as a crime under international law. President Maduro has ignored international calls to hold new elections. He has accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of being an ""American pawn"" and an ""imperialist beggar"". As protests got under way at Venezuela's borders, Mr Maduro staged a rally in Caracas. ""Take your hands off Venezuela, Donald Trump,"" he told a cheering crowd. Venezuela crisis - in nine charts Genuine aid or a Trojan horse? US sending aid 'at GuaidÃ³'s request' The US is leading the international effort to pressure Mr Maduro, and has implemented a raft of financial sanctions against his government. The humanitarian aid stockpiled in Colombia and Brazil is at the centre of a stand-off between Mr Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³ that goes back to Mr Maduro's disputed re-election in 2018. For several years Venezuela has been in the grip of a political and economic crisis. An out-of-control inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items. More than three million people have fled Venezuela in recent years, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

Supermarket health claims 'confusing',"Supermarkets routinely brand vegan products as ""healthier"" Products high in salt and saturated fats are being marketed as healthy by leading supermarkets,BBC Radio 5 Live Investigateshas found. The British Dietetic Association said stores including Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's were being ""unhelpful"" and ""confusing"" customers. The Royal Society for Public Health called for an independent supermarket regulator. Supermarkets said they were committed to ""promoting healthy eating"". BBC researchers visited the top five supermarkets in the UK and found Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco were stocking products high in salt and saturated fat in sections marked ""healthier choices"" and ""healthy and diet meals"". Morrisons' ""healthier choices"" section contained a vegetarian steak slice with almost 10g of saturated fat - nearly half of the recommended maximum daily amount. The supermarket said the item ""provides customers with a red-meat free alternative"". Sainsbury's edamame, coconut and lemongrass falafel contained more than 6g of saturated fat per half pack - around a third of the recommended maximum daily amount - and was located in their ""healthier choices"" section. In Tesco's ""healthy and diet meals"" section, a ""lamb hotpot"" contained 8.5g of saturated fat, 45% of the recommended maximum daily amount. Registered nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed said she was ""quite shocked"" at some of the items being marketed as 'healthier choices'. She said: ""I'm not saying there's anything wrong with eating them or consuming them in moderation - but telling consumers these are healthier options is a bit misleading."" Nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed said the 'healthier choices' sections of supermarkets are misleading The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) said many products are being identified as ""healthy"" because they are vegetarian, vegan, free from certain ingredients, or have fewer calories. But, it said, many have high levels of fat, salt or sugar, and are highly processed. ""Supermarkets should be transparent about how they classify foods, and provide clear information about products,"" the RSPH added. ""There must be incentives and penalties for presenting clear and accurate information. ""Perhaps there is potential to have an independent supermarket regulator. It is important that the good work done so far on labelling is not undermined."" A British Dietetic Association (BDA) spokesperson said supermarkets had a ""duty of care"" to their customers. ""It is unhelpful and confusing to the consumer, and supermarkets should avoid doing this,"" they added. ""They should be promoting and educating people to buy foods that actually are healthy - not just marketed as being so."" Trading standards representatives said they would be speaking to supermarkets Morrisons' own brand lentil hotpot contained almost a third of the recommended maximum daily amount of salt - almost 2g - but was stocked in the ""healthier choices"" section. Smoked meat substitute slices marketed as healthy in Sainsbury's contained almost two grams of salt per four slices, making them more salty than seawater. Action on Salt, which campaigns for a reduction in the consumption of salt, said it was very time-consuming for shoppers to check every label to find a healthier option. ""Placing products in 'healthier choice' sections of supermarkets should ideally highlight products that are actually better for our health,"" it said. ""However, we've found that many of the vegetarian and vegan products in these sections of the supermarket can be high in salt, with some vegetarian burgers containing more salt than real beef burgers, meaning shoppers are being given a false sense of security. ""Supermarkets should have stronger criteria in place for products allowed to be displayed in their 'healthier choice' sections."" Dietitians say the mislabelling of foods in supermarkets is confusing Council trading standards officers enforce food safety laws that cover health and nutrition claims in individual supermarkets. Hertfordshire and West Yorkshire trading standards services - the principal trading standards partners for Tesco and Morrisons - toldBBC Radio 5 Live Investigatesthey will be making further enquiries with both supermarkets. Tesco said: ""We are sorry that some of our products were mistakenly included under the 'Healthy and Diet Meals' sign and are rectifying this immediately."" It added that all nutritional information is clearly listed on packaging. Sainsbury's said: ""Our range of healthier meals are currently stocked alongside our vegetarian and plant-based options. In some cases our signs were not updated to reflect this and we are putting this right."" It said it was committed to helping customers live ""healthier lives"". Morrisons said: ""Our 'Healthier Choices' section provides customers with the option to buy an item that is healthier than a product that meets a similar need. A 'Healthier Choices' cheese will be substantially lower in fat than ones we sell elsewhere but might still carry a red traffic light label."" 5 Live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live, 24 February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC Sounds Families 'struggle to afford healthy food' 'Simple swaps' for healthy meals Junk food 'still placed at tills' Call for price offers on healthy food Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours': Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Afghan civilian deaths 'at record high',"One of the leading causes of civilian deaths was suicide attacks - here in the capital, Kabul, in November More civilians were killed last year in Afghanistan than at any time since records have been kept, according to a new report from the UN. There were 3,804 civilian deaths in 2018, including 927 children, the highest recorded numbers in the country's long-running war. The Afghan war began after US forces led a campaign to overthrow the Taliban in the wake of 2001's 9/11 attacks. The report comes a day before the next round of talks to end the conflict. Is Afghanistan's 17-year war coming to an end? Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is expected to meet Taliban negotiators on Monday in Qatar. Taliban sources told the BBC that one of the group's co-founders is travelling to Qatar for the talks. Analysts said the involvement of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who served in several key roles within the Taliban, could improve chances of a deal being reached. In 2018 there was a spike in suicide attacks by ""anti-government elements"" as well as increased harm to civilians from aerial and search operations by pro-government forces, the report said. The year saw the highest number of civilian casualties ever recorded from suicide attacks and aerial operations,external, with more than 500 civilians killed by ""aerial operations for the first time on record"", the report noted. Ground engagements, mainly between pro-government forces and anti-government groups, also remained a leading cause of civilian casualties. This video can not be played The rockets date back to the Soviet war in Afghanistan in 1980s.

It is time to put an end to this human misery and tragedy,"" said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the top UN official in Afghanistan. ""The best way to halt the killings and maiming of civilians is to stop the fighting. That is why there is all the more need now to use all our efforts to bring about peace."" The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) recorded 10,993 civilian casualties (3,804 deaths and 7,189 injured), which it says represents a 5% increase in overall civilian casualties and an 11% increase in civilian deaths compared to 2017. Earlier this year, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said more than 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killed since he became leader in 2014 - a figure far higher than previously thought.

Gove warns ministers over Brexit delay,"This video can not be played May: Brexit deal ""within grasp"" for 29 March MPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. Speaking as she travelled to an EU-Arab League summit in Egypt, Mrs May ruled out holding another so-called ""meaningful vote"" this week. But she said ""positive"" talks with the EU were ""still ongoing"" and leaving on 29 March was ""within our grasp"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of ""recklessly running down the clock"". In a tweet,external, he said the move was intended to ""force MPs to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal"". Labour, he said, would ""work with MPs across the Commons to prevent no deal, break the deadlock and build support for our alternative plan"". Brexit must not be frustrated, May vows Cabinet trio issue Brexit delay warning Brexit: A really simple guide A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame On the plane to Sharm el-Sheikh for a summit between EU and Arab league leaders, Mrs May said her team would be returning to the Belgian capital on Tuesday for further talks. ""As a result of that, we won't bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March,"" she added. Mrs May has already met European Council President Donald Tusk for talks after landing in Egypt and will meet other EU leaders on the fringes of the summit later. She said negotiations were continuing over the backstop - the controversial policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - after Parliament voted for her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to what is set out in her deal. It's true that playing for time is a powerful, if cynical, political strategy and the Labour Party - and lots of Conservatives too - are annoyed that Downing Street seems to be dragging its feet like this and won't give MPs a formal thumbs up or thumbs down vote for more than another fortnight. The prime minister naming the next vote day might do a little to calm the tempers of those in government who have been very publicly suggesting that strategy is madness. 12 March is at least, for them, before the next EU summit. It is not, as these things go, the final, final, moment. Reckless, many will suggest, but not a total kamikaze mission. But it won't stop the senior MPs Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, still pushing for a vote next week for their own bill that would force the government to delay Brexit if they don't have a deal in place by... guess when? 13 March. Oh look - the day AFTER Number 10's new deadline. Here, the date of 12 March suggests that the government is, as one source suggested, ""planning for every eventuality"". In other words - they think it's likely MPs might indeed vote this week to extend the process if a deal hasn't been done. Read Laura's blog Mrs May also rejected an accusation - made last week by MP Anna Soubry as she quit the Conservative Party - that she had a ""personal problem"" with immigration. ""I have consistently said that immigration has been good for this country,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""It's important that we have welcomed people coming to the country over the years - both people migrating to the UK for work purposes but also crucially those many refugees and asylum seekers."" This video can not be played Anna Soubry tells Newsnight's Kirsty Wark she was 'worried' the prime minister had a problem with immigration. And she also made clear that she wants to stay on in Number 10 after the first phase of Brexit finishes, despitehaving promised her MPsshe would not fight the next election. She said her job ""is not just about delivering Brexit"" and ""there is still a domestic agenda that I want to get on with."" Yvette Cooper called the latest delay ""utterly shambolic"",tweeting,external: ""Each time we get closer to cliff edge. How are businesses, public services and families supposed to plan in this chaos?"" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, alsocalled,externalthe delay ""unacceptable"". And the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, said it was ""unbelievable"" to leave the vote so close to the planned exit date. Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, MPs will get another chance to put forward a range of amendments to show what direction they want Brexit to take. Top of the list is the Cooper-Letwin amendment - and cabinet ministers Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gaukewrote in the Daily Mail,externalthat they would be forced to back it if the pro-Leave European Research Group (ERG) - made up of Tory backbenchers - stood in the way of the withdrawal deal being agreed ""in the next few days"". The ERG would then have ""no-one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit,"" the trio said. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has urged his cabinet colleagues against backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment, calling for ""unity"" behind the PM. This video can not be played Gove: âI will do everything I can to persuade colleagues to stay in government.â Labour is also likely to table an amendment on Wednesday, putting its own Brexit plan - one which backs a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its single market - to MPs. While it's likely to be rejected, the moment could still be significant. The party's conference last September bound the leadership to explore all remaining alternatives to the PM's Brexit plan, including a public vote, if it wasn't able to force a general election. Efforts to get an election have failed, so if Labour's own Brexit plan is defeated in the Commons, the only remaining option would be a new referendum. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that ""we are heading in that direction"", but ""there is still more play in the days ahead"". Mr Watson said the leadership was also looking at an amendment drawn up by two backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which would be tabled whenever the next meaningful vote is held. Under the terms of that amendment, Labour MPs would support the prime minister's Brexit deal in exchange for it then being put to a public vote. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warnedon Sunday that his government could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"", on which the border played a key part. He accused the UK government of wanting to change the backstop to ""placate a group in the Conservative Party who are insisting on moving the prime minister away from her own policies"", and reiterated that the EU would not re-open the withdrawal agreement. But he told Sky News they would try to ""provide reassurance and clarification for the British Parliament to allow them to ratify this deal"". Speaking from the summit on Sunday, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it ""would be good to postpone Brexit"" if the deal was not agreed by the beginning of March.

"Pope compares sex abuse to human sacrificePope Francis condemns child sex abuse in strong terms, as he closes a Church summit on paedophilia.Europe","This video can not be played Pope Francis: Abusive priests 'become tools of Satan' Pope Francis has promised concrete action to tackle child sex abuse at the end of a Roman Catholic Church summit on paedophilia. Clergy guilty of abuse were ""tools of Satan"", the Pope said, pledging to face every case with ""utmost seriousness"". Child sex abuse, he said, reminded him of the ancient religious practice of child sacrifice in pagan rites. Bishops would now review and strengthen their guidelines to prevent abuse and punish perpetrators, he added. Pope admits clerical abuse of nuns including sexual slavery Child sexual abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know Pope Francis condemns child sex abuse and Church cover-ups The Pope spoke largely in general terms, but victims and survivors of abuse will call for detailed practical steps to be announced, says the BBC's Vatican correspondent, James Reynolds. ""I am reminded of the cruel religious practice, once widespread in certain cultures, of sacrificing human beings - frequently children - in pagan rites,"" he said at the end of a four-day summit held in the Vatican. ""The inhumanity of the worldwide phenomenon becomes even more serious and more scandalous in the Church, because it is in contrast with its moral authority and its ethical credibility. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) ""The consecrated person, chosen by God to guide souls to salvation, lets himself be subjugated by his own human frailty, or by his own illness, thus becoming a tool of Satan. In the abuses, we see the hand of evil that does not spare even the innocence of children."" He said victims would now be the priority and promised an end to cover-ups, saying all abusers would be brought to justice. How will Pope Francis deal with abuse in the Catholic Church? US ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick defrocked over abuse claims He also stressed child sexual abuse was a universal problem - ""a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies"". The unprecedented conference - called Protection of Minors in the Church - was attended by the heads of all national bishops' conferences from more than 130 countries. They were handed a roadmap of suggestions on how to handle abuse, such as drawing up mandatory codes of conduct for priests, training people to spot abuse and informing police. Those gathered at the Vatican also heard testimonies from victims - who mostly remained anonymous - telling stories of abuse and cover-up. One woman from Africa said she had been forced to have three abortions after being abused for years as a teenager by a priest who refused to use contraception. Another victim from Asia said he had been molested more than 100 times. When he was elected in 2013, he called for ""decisive action"" on the issue, but critics say he has not done enough to hold to account bishops who allegedly covered up abuse. This video can not be played Archbishop of Brisbane Mark Coleridge: ""Our credibility is shot to pieces"" Thousands of people are thought to have been abused by priests over many decades, and the Church has been accused of covering up crimes around the world. Survivors say new safeguarding protocols are needed to protect minors. Pope Francis is under serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to what is the most pressing crisis facing the modern Church - one which some say has left its moral authority in tatters.

Beale Street wins big ahead of Oscars,"Regina King and Barry Jenkins both won for If Beale Street Could Talk If Beale Street Could Talk was the big winner at Saturday's Independent Spirit Awards, winning three major prizes. It took home best feature - the top award at the ceremony - plus best director for Barry Jenkins and best supporting actress for Regina King. The Spirits honour low-budget films and are the final major awards season ceremony ahead of the Oscars on Sunday. Beale Street is Jenkins' first film since Moonlight, which won the best picture Oscar in 2017. Speaking to BBC News, the director said he was pleased about the steps forward the Academy has made, or tried to make, in recent years. The body behind the Oscars hasdiversified its membership, tried tointroduce a popular film categoryand attempted to make the ceremonyshorter and more entertaining. ""All this stuff with the popular film, I think all this stuff the Academy is undergoing is a period of extreme evolution, started by [former Academy president] Cheryl Boone Isaacs, there's some growing pains with that,"" Jenkins said. ""But I think this progress that began 5-10 years ago, if you really dig into it, is ongoing, and I think 5-10 years from now we'll look back and realise the Academy reshaped itself in some really amazing ways."" Jenkins posed with Alfonso Cuaron, whose film Roma won best international feature Awards season reaches its climax on Sunday night, with the Oscars taking place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Beale Street may not be nominated for best picture there, but its wins at the Spirits give Regina King some extra momentum as the frontrunner to win best supporting actress. Jenkins said Moonlight winning the top prize at the Oscars two years ago was invaluable in helping his follow-up get made. ""Winning best picture was crazy, but it afforded me a lot of opportunities,"" he said. How will the Oscars ceremony change this year? Jamie Lee Curtis defends Oscars amid 'chaos' ""So getting it funded was quite simple ultimately, but I think adapting such an interior text, that was the challenge."" Jenkins hasspoken before,externalabout the difficulties of translating non-linear format of the book, where the reader benefits from hearing the interior voices of the characters, to the big screen. Speaking about the writer of the novel, Jenkins said: ""I love James Baldwin, and I've always wanted to adapt my favourite author. ""Black authors haven't been adapted at the same rate as their white peers. Megan Ellison [founder of Annapurna Pictures] said she wanted to support this black literary adaptation, and I was all about it."" Richard E Grant was among the British winners at the Independent Spirits, taking home best supporting actor - a win hesaid he was ""utterly overwhelmed"",externalby. Glenn Close, a winner at the ceremony herself, presented Richard E Grant with his award It's unlikely he will win in the same category at the Oscars, however, as there has been a clear favourite through the rest of awards season. ""It has been carved in stone for the last month that a wonderful brilliant actor called Mahershala Ali has got the award already,"" he told BBC News of the Green Book star. ""So the other four nominees, we're just enjoying the ride of it."" He added that the number of work offers he receives has drastically increased since his Oscar nomination. ""I have new representation in Los Angeles, and I've been sent a lot of scripts which I've never had in this quantity before in my career. But I'm sure it'll all pumpkin ride before Monday,"" he laughed. The Oscar film that almost had a different star What this Oscar winner did with his jet ski Glenn Close continued her sweep of awards season at the Spirits, taking home another trophy for best actress for her role in The Wife. She is almost certain to win the same award at the Oscars - ending her record as the actress with the most nominees without a win. But she played down the competitive element, telling BBC News: ""It's very hard for me to accept a win-lose situation. ""I don't think there are any losers. So to say 'I hope I win', it doesn't sit well with me, because look who's in my category and look at the incredible work that's being done. ""I think it's a huge honour at this point in my career to be in that room with some of the most creative people on the planet."" Tilda Swinton's 2017 film Okja was also released primarily on Netflix Of course, the front runner for best picture at the Oscars this year remains Roma - which won best international film at the Spirits. Despite having a limited theatrical release, its main platform was Netflix. It's a sign that traditional film bodies are starting to show less hostility and resistance towards movies made or released by streaming services. ""I hope that Netflix are going to build some nice big cinemas in every single city around the world,"" actress Tilda Swinton told BBC News. ""That's what I want them to do... and then they'll prove that they're really dedicated to big screen entertainment."" 17 quirky facts about this year's Oscars Oscars 2019: The nominees in full The actress is someone who knows about potential snobbery towards streaming - her Netflix movie Okjaproved controversialwhen it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival last year. Swinton said the company have indicated to her they would consider making further inroads into movie theatres, adding that ""they've got the money"" to build their own cinemas. ""I have talked to them about it, and they've made some very encouraging noises so, let's hope they do it,"" she said.

Kim Jong-un leaves by train for Vietnam,"This video can not be played Mr Kim waved to cheering crowds as his train left Pyongyang (This video has no sound) North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has departed for Hanoi by train for talks with US President Donald Trump. He arrived at the Chinese border city of Dandong after 21:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday. The much anticipated second US-North Korea summit is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in the Vietnamese capital. It follows a historic first round of talks last year in Singapore. All eyes will be on what if any progress is made towards ""denuclearisation"". North Korea crisis in 300 words US envoy in N Korea for nuclear talks In pictures: Growing up in North Korea The departure, confirmed by North Korean state media, is the first official acknowledgement that the talks are taking place. The state media report said Mr Kim would pay a ""goodwill"" visit to Vietnam as part of the trip. He is thought to be travelling with his sister Kim Yo-jong and one of his key negotiators, former General Kim Yong-chol. ""We fell in love,"" Mr Trump told a rally last September of Mr Kim. ""He wrote me beautiful letters."" The second summit won't be able to match that first handshake in 2018 Despite the flowery words, the months following the first summit last June were characterised by frosty and sparse contact. This meeting is expected to build on the groundwork of that meeting and address the thorny issue of denuclearisation, where experts say little progress has been made. Days before the Hanoi meeting, the agenda remains unclear. The first summit last June in Singapore, between two leaders who had previously only exchanged vitriol, was certainly a historic moment. However, the agreement they signed was vague on detail and little has been done about its stated goal of ""denuclearisation"". This video can not be played A rare instance of a defector fleeing through the demilitarised zone was captured on CCTV in 2017 Donald Trump promised to scale back the US-South Korea military exercises that angered the North, but in the months that have passed many have queried what he got in return. Tracking sanctions-busting ships on the high seas Why Kim will be looking closely at Vietnam Moves like the dismantling of a key rocket site in the North last summer are little more more than a gesture, experts say, given the North made no commitment to halt weapons development or shut down missile bases. However, lower-level negotiation channels have recently seen activity, which could mean more goes into a Hanoi declaration. This time round both leaders will be very conscious that expectations will be high for an outcome that demonstrates tangible signs of progress - or at least a measurable roadmap for progress. Analysts will watch closely what concessions both sides are prepared to make for this. Washington's original stance was that North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis The sorry fate of North Korea's diplomat defectors But just a few days ago, President Trump said he was ""in no rush"" to press denuclearisation. One possibility mooted is a declaration to officially end the Korean War. Some suggest the US will ask North Korea to put forward concrete steps, such as dismantling the Yongbyon nuclear site and missile bases, in exchange for some US sanctions relief. It's an ideal location for many reasons. It has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, despite once having been enemies with the US - and could be used by the US as an example of two countries working together and setting aside their past grievances. Mr Kim might try to get some insights into Vietnam's remarkable economic growth Ideologically, both Vietnam and North Korea are communist countries - though Vietnam has rapidly developed since and become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, all while the party there retains absolute power. The country's rapid development could be used by the US to show the direction North Korea could go in should it choose to open its doors.

Children to be taught about FGM harmPupils in England will be taught about the physical and emotional harm caused by female genital mutilation.UK,"Secondary school pupils in England will be taught about the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM) by 2020. The new guidelines, to be announced on Monday, form part of the introduction of compulsory relationships and sex education classes in secondary schools. The new guidance says secondary schools should address the physical and emotional damage caused by FGM. The practice was outlawed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2003 and in Scotland in 2005. FGM is the deliberate cutting or removal of a female's external genitalia. Lessons will also raise awareness of the support that is available, and ensure children know that FGM is against the law. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the reforms to relationships and sex education curriculum will ensure young people are taught about different forms of abuse and their rights under the law in an age-appropriate way. He said: ""We know that FGM can have a catastrophic effect on the lives of those affected, causing life-long physical and psychological damage. ""Everyone must do all they can to protect women and girls from this extreme form of gendered violence. ""There's a legislation aspect, and enforcement, but just as important is awareness and challenging assumptions - which is why we are making sure all pupils are given all the facts at secondary school."" FGM: What is female genital mutilation? Law to make FGM reporting mandatory Sex education compulsory in schools According to the NSPCC, there are an estimated 137,000 women and girls affected by FGM in England and Wales. Since July 2015, 296 Female Genital Mutilation Protection Orders have been made to safeguard people at risk. Nimco Ali, FGM campaigner and director of the charity Daughters of Eve, said: ""As a child I had no idea FGM was illegal, I just knew it was painful. It took me years to piece together what happened to me and why I felt the way I did about it. ""Had I been given the education now being introduced, I would have been able to support those in my family to understand, and prevent other girls from being cut."" The new reforms, which will be presented to Parliament, will include relationship education for primary age pupils, relationships and sex education (RSE) for all secondary pupils. Health education will also be taught to pupils of all ages in state-funded schools in England, including academies, grammar schools and free schools. Secondary school pupils will also be taught about other forms of honour-based abuse, as well as grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse as part of a strengthened curriculum. This video can not be played Itâs estimated one in 20 girls and women in the world have undergone some form of FGM Sex and relationship education is part of the curriculum in Wales, but it is not currently compulsory. The Welsh government are consulting on new guidance for schools on sexual education, which includes FGM. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Education requires each school to have its own written policy on how it will address the delivery of relationship and sexuality education (RSE). Whilst FGM is not currently in the curriculum, last year the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland launched an awareness campaign after the Belfast Trust identified 17 cases of FGM over a nine-month period, involving women aged 24 to 46. The curriculum in Scotland is non-statutory and decisions about which topics are included in the curriculum is a matter for schools and local authorities to decide, however new guidance on sex education was introduced in 2014.

Venezuela clashes as aid is blocked,"Saturday saw deadly confrontations at border crossings as volunteers attempted to collect aid Deadly clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns on Saturday, as President NicolÃ¡s Maduro blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil. At least two people were killed by gunfire on Saturday, rights groups said, including a 14-year-old boy. Venezuelan troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters attempting to collect and transport the aid. The opposition wants the aid to go to people hit by the economic crisis. Mr Maduro claims it is a security threat. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the attacks on civilians, which he blamed on ""Maduro's thugs"". ""Our deepest sympathies to the families of those who have died due to these criminal acts. We join their demand for justice,""he said in a tweet following the clashes,external. Mr Pompeo also described the burning of some of the aid as ""sickening"". This video can not be played The moment Venezuelan troops crashed through border into Colombia Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³, who has declared himself interim president and helped to organise the aid, condemned the action by security forces. Mr GuaidÃ³, who has been recognised as leader by dozens of nations, will meet US Vice President Mike Pence on Monday in Bogota, Colombia. He is attending a meeting of the regional Lima Group, in spite of a travel ban imposed on him by Mr Maduro's government. Venezuela crisis - in nine charts In pictures: Border clashes How the day unfolded On Saturday evening, Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a tweet (in Spanish) which implored the international community to be ""open to all options"" in order to ""liberate"" Venezuela from Mr Maduro - who is continuing to resist all calls to stand down. Mr GuaidÃ³ organised the collection of hundreds of tonnes of foreign aid at the country's borders. He gave the government a deadline of Saturday to allow the aid to be brought into Venezuela or vowed to have volunteers march it in themselves. In response, President Maduro partly closed the country's borders with Brazil and Colombia, citing threats to security and sovereignty. On Saturday, Venezuelan civilians attempted to cross in order to get to the aid, which included food and medicine. A demonstrator runs into barbed wire strung across a street in UreÃ±a Images from crossing points across the country showed security forces firing tear gas at volunteers. Protesters burned outposts and threw projectiles at soldiers and riot police. Rights groups say at least two people, including a 14-year-old boy, were shot dead in Saturday's clashes in Santa Elena de Uairen, near the country's border with Brazil. Another two were reported to have been killed on Friday. Venezuela crisis - in nine charts Genuine aid or a Trojan horse? US sending aid 'at GuaidÃ³'s request' Amnesty International has described the use of firearms against protesters as a serious human rights violation and a crime under international law. There have also been reports of several aid trucks being burned - something Mr GuaidÃ³ said was a violation of the Geneva Convention. At about 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Saturday, Colombia's government estimated the number injured at border crossings to be about 300. Journalists at the scene have reported severe injuries among protesters, including several who appeared to have lost their eyes. This video can not be played Venezuela-Colombia border turns violent Mr GuaidÃ³ visited the Tienditas bridge on the Colombian side of the border, where he addressed soldiers abandoning their posts - promising them ""amnesty"" if they joined the ""right side of history"". At least 60 soldiers had defected by late Saturday, according to Colombia's migration service. But most of the military still appeared to be loyal to President Maduro. A video posted on social mediaappeared to show four soldiers publicly denouncing the president and announcing their support for GuaidÃ³.,external""We are fathers and sons, we have had enough of so much uncertainty and injustice,"" the soldiers said. How hasMaduro reacted? President Maduro continues to oppose Mr GuaidÃ³'s claim to the presidency and has ignored international calls to hold new elections. He has accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of being a ""puppet"", an ""American pawn"", a ""clown"" and an ""imperialist beggar"". As protests got under way at Venezuela's borders, Mr Maduro staged a rally in Caracas. ""Take your hands off Venezuela, Donald Trump,"" he told a cheering crowd, accusing the US president of using the aid as a means to invade the country. A demonstrator kneels before security forces in UreÃ±a Despite dozens of countries backing the opposition leader, Mr Maduro maintains the support of key economic allies including Cuba, Russia and China. The US is leading the international effort to pressure him, and has implemented a raft of financial sanctions against his government. Humanitarian aid is the latest flashpoint in the ongoing standoff between Mr Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr GuaidÃ³, who is the leader of the country's opposition-dominated National Assembly, last month declared himself the country's interim leader. He has called Mr Maduro's rule constitutionally illegitimate because of alleged irregularities with the 2018 general election. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Venezuela has been in the grip of a political and economic crisis for several years. An out-of-control inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food, toiletries and medicine. Mr GuaidÃ³ insists that citizens badly need help, while Mr Maduro views aid as a ploy by the US to invade the country. At least 2.7 million people have fled the country since 2015.

Three injured in 'explosion' at flats,"The area around the damaged property has been cordoned off Three people have been injured after flats were damaged in what is reported to have been an explosion. The incident happened in Whitchurch Lane in the Hartcliffe area of Bristol at about 19:50 GMT on Saturday. Several roads have been closed and emergency crews were at the scene. A woman who lives in the block of flats told the BBC she heard a ""humongous bang"" before her partner rescued a man on fire from one of the damaged properties. The eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said the injured man - her neighbour- was doused with water to put out the flames, but another woman escaped from the flat unharmed. She said she ran inside to get her four-year-old daughter and as they reached their garden gate ""the whole house just fell in"". Another anonymous witness told the BBC: ""When I arrived they were still letting people walk down the slip road, but half way down the police came and told us the fire brigade had asked us to move back further and taped across"". She said she saw ""lots of debris and a large glass panel that looked as though it had been expelled with some force from the upstairs window"" on the road. The corner of the property appears to have been destroyed She added: ""The fire brigade were standing outside the house and initially all I could see was smoke but a flame started burning inside and was starting to get brighter and brighter as the smoke smell got stronger. It looked as though it was too dangerous for them to enter."" Steve Imrie, area manager with Avon Fire and Rescue, toldBristol Live,external: ""We committed two crew in breathing apparatus to contain and inspect the fire, while other firefighters began to administer first aid to a number of persons at the scene. ""All casualties were conscious and breathing. Certainly the initial person who was treated has suffered minor burns."" The cause of the damage to the flats is not yet known.

Fat cat returned four times finds home,"Nine-year-old Mitzi was dubbed ""Britain's fattest cat"" due to her round appearance A plump pussycat who was returned to an animal shelter four times has finally found a home. Mitzi weighed almost 7.7kg (17lb) when she first arrived at Woodside Sanctuary in Plymouth, Devon, as a stray. The tubby tabby,dubbed ""Britain's fattest cat"",external, has since slimmed to 5.3kg (11lbs) and has been rehomed by the family of one of her old owners. ""She's such a sweet cat,"" shelter manager Helen Lecointe said. ""We really hope she's found her fairytale ending."" Unlucky moggy Mitzi has been returned to the shelter in Plymouth four times Mitzi was rescued by Woodside Sanctuary in 2017 and staff said she had been ""extremely unlucky"" in her hunt for a forever home. ""It's been ever so sad for Mitzi,"" Ms Lecointe said. ""There was an owner death, a change of circumstance and one owner became very ill."" The 'gravity-defying' art that washes away 'I was made allergic to my husband's sperm' Extreme allergies: 'I couldn't even eat an apple' Mitzi's new owners had wanted to adopt her when their family member died but were unable to look after her in rented accommodation. The shelter said staff would be looking after Mitzi until April, when her owners were due to move into a new home. Helen Lecointe said the shelter had offers from all over the world after Mitzi's story went viral ""We had offers from the US, Sweden and the Middle East, but we're so pleased that we've found an owner who already knows her and loves her,"" Ms Lecointe said. ""It's very unusual for a cat to be returned this many times but sadly she's just been so unlucky."" Nobody knows for sure how the nine-year-old cat became so big but shelter staff thought she might have been fed by people in several houses. ""Like all cats it seems she was very successful at adopting people,"" Ms Lecointe said. ""No-one owned her but everyone was feeding her.""

Flats damaged in 'big explosion',"The area around the damaged property has been cordoned off Three people have been injured after flats were damaged in what is reported to have been an explosion. The incident happened in Whitchurch Lane in the Hartcliffe area of Bristol at about 19:50 GMT on Saturday. Several roads have been closed and emergency crews were at the scene. A woman who lives in the block of flats told the BBC she heard a ""humongous bang"" before her partner rescued a man on fire from one of the damaged properties. The eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said the injured man - her neighbour- was doused with water to put out the flames, but another woman escaped from the flat unharmed. She said she ran inside to get her four-year-old daughter and as they reached their garden gate ""the whole house just fell in"". Another anonymous witness told the BBC: ""When I arrived they were still letting people walk down the slip road, but half way down the police came and told us the fire brigade had asked us to move back further and taped across"". She said she saw ""lots of debris and a large glass panel that looked as though it had been expelled with some force from the upstairs window"" on the road. The corner of the property appears to have been destroyed She added: ""The fire brigade were standing outside the house and initially all I could see was smoke but a flame started burning inside and was starting to get brighter and brighter as the smoke smell got stronger. It looked as though it was too dangerous for them to enter."" Steve Imrie, area manager with Avon Fire and Rescue, toldBristol Live,external: ""We committed two crew in breathing apparatus to contain and inspect the fire, while other firefighters began to administer first aid to a number of persons at the scene. ""All casualties were conscious and breathing. Certainly the initial person who was treated has suffered minor burns."" The cause of the damage to the flats is not yet known.
