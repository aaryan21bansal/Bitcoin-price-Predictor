Paris bakery blast death toll rises,"This video can not be played Video showed the aftermath of the explosion, with flames engulfing the ground floor The death toll from a suspected gas explosion in central Paris has risen to four after rescue workers found the body of a woman in the rubble. Two firefighters and a Spanish tourist were also killed in Saturday's blast at a bakery near a popular area. Dozens more people were injured in the blast, which also caused damage in nearby streets. The cause was thought to be accidental, though other explanations have not been excluded, the Paris prosecutor said. Damage from the blast in a corner extended over a large area Some 30 firefighters were involved in the search for a woman who had been declared missing, reports say. The body found on Sunday was in the process of being identified, a spokesman for the Paris fire service said. Search efforts would continue, he said, although rescue workers were no longer looking for anyone reported missing as such, he said. The latest casualty figures were nine people seriously injured, including one firefighter, and another 45 people with lighter injuries, including six firefighters, suffering from hearing or psychological difficulties, he added. Work was going on to reinforce the buildings hit by the blast, and residents ""would have to wait a long time"" before being allowed to return home, he added.

Trump urged to temporarily lift US shutdown,"Senator Lindsey Graham is known as a close confidant of President Trump A senior US Republican has urged President Donald Trump to temporarily reopen parts of the government shut down for more than three weeks. Senator Lindsey Graham, who is close to Mr Trump, said a limited re-opening of a few weeks would allow talks to resume between Republicans and Democrats. The partial government shutdown has now become the longest in US history. It has left hundreds of thousands of public workers unpaid and government offices closed. President Trump is refusing to approve a budget unless it includes $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) for a wall along the Mexican border - a key campaign pledge, which the president said that Mexico would pay for. Democrats have rejected his request for funding to build it and say they will not negotiate further until the government is reopened. How much has shutdown hit US economy? Mr Trump has raised the stakes by threatening to declare a national emergency and circumvent Congress and get the money he wants. Mr Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he had urged the president on Sunday to temporarily reopen government to get negotiations started again. He said if talks still failed to agree the funding, the White House could then declare a national emergency. This video can not be played 'I don't need a wall, I want money to plant crops' ""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug (to) see if we can get a deal,"" Mr Graham told Fox News Sunday. He said Mr Trump had told him: ""Let's make a deal, then open up the government."" Correspondents say pressure is building on Mr Trump as the dispute drags on, with opinion polls showing more Americans blame him for the shutdown than they do the Democrats. But on Sunday Mr Trump was continuing to blame his opponents for the standoff. How much of Trump's wall has been built? What border politicians think of Trump's wall ""I'm in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!"" he tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thousands have reportedly applied for unemployment benefits amid the financial uncertainty. Over the weekend, part of Miami International airport was closed because of a shortage of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents caused by the shutdown. The agents are ""essential"" federal workers and expected to work but many are calling in sick in protest at the situation, the Miami Herald reports.

Refunds after 'spectacularly bad' pantoEscaped rhea set to stay at golf clubBuyer 'willing to pay ÃÂ£100k for Banksy',"The venue provided promotional images of the production which featured actors that did not appear in the Chippenham panto A venue that put on a ""spectacularly bad"" pantomime has offered a refund to all customers who paid to see it. Jack and the Beanstalk at Chippenham's Neeld Community and Arts Centre was billed as boasting a ""sparkling set and glittering costumes"". But one disgruntled punter said: ""There were only three people, no scenery, they couldn't sing or dance."" The town council, which runs the venue, said it ""was not the standard of show the Neeld is used to presenting"". The company behind the show, OOOH ARRR Productions, said there had been a ""booking error"" and it had received a ""handful of complaints"" but had agreed a full refund with the venue. The show ran from 27-29 December, and was sold out, with standard tickets priced at Â£7.00. Posting on the 158-seat venue's Facebook page, ticket-buyer Natalie Uff described the panto as ""awful"". ""At one point they were talking to voices in the wings as they ran out of people,"" she said. Another panto fan, Tereza Cleverley, said: ""It was spectacularly bad. It felt as if two of the cast members had been pulled in at the last minute and it was their first live show."" And John Snell said he was ""mortified"" by the standard of the production. The Chippenham show was promoted using photos taken from a previous production with a different cast. The panto was advertised using promotional photos from a previous show which featured actors that did not appear in the Chippenham production In a statement,external, the town council said ""we pride ourselves in providing high quality shows for Chippenham"" but the ""images provided by the company for promotional purposes did not reflect the show they brought to us"". ""We had been assured by the theatre production company there would be a cast of six professional actors with industry standard staging,"" it added. In a statement,externalon its Facebook page, OOOH ARRR Productions said the ""disappointment and confusion"" was the result of a ""booking error"" which saw the original ""six person production"" replaced. ""There were conversations with the venue that involved replacing it with the three person cast due to it potentially not selling well,"" the spokesperson said. ""The other members of our staff were only made aware of this issue following the first performance."" The company apologised for the ""disappointment experienced as a result of this booking error"" and added the person ""responsible for this error"" had left the company. On its website, the Malmesbury-based firm describes itself as a ""professional theatre company"" that takes pride in being ""fun, affordable and relevant"".

Escaped rhea set to stay at golf clubBuyer 'willing to pay ÃÂ£100k for Banksy',"This video can not be played Escaped rhea on the loose at Worcestershire golf course An escaped rhea looks set to make its home at a golf course it has been roaming for more than two months. The 6ft, flightless bird arrived at Evesham Golf Club, in Worcestershire, in October and staffhave so far been unable to catch it. Golf club workers said it has become ""a star"" since its arrival and is ""more than welcome to stay"". The club said it was a pet which escaped from the village of Harvington. Due to its speed the bird was nicknamed Linford, after sprinter Linford Christie. A temporary course set up while work is being carried at the site has also been named after the rhea. Club secretary Fraser Williamson said it was ""monitoring"" the bird's welfare adding the club had liaised with animal charities after it arrived in October. ""Because it has been a mild winter it has been foraging for itself and effectively has become a wild animal,"" he said. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Mr Williamson said Linford was ""growing bigger"" and spent a lot of time by the River Avon. ""He is a talking point - people enjoy seeing him around the course,"" he said. ""I personally think he is fantastic."" The rhea, which originates in South America, can reach running speeds of up to 40mph (64km/h). There were initially fears the bird would damage the course's well-maintained greens but it did ""not seem interested"" in the grass, Mr Williamson added. ""He is not bothered by members here. He comes quite close - about 10ft (3m), but if you come closer he will trot off.""

Mark Patience, from the Mourne Rambling Group, was also walking in the mountains on Sunday and said his group had changed course due to the winds. ""The gusts were extremely strong,"" he said. ""There were times where we had to stop and stand still and brace against them."" ""There are no warnings of these gusts and if they're that strong in the valley it became clear to us that they were going to be much stronger on the summits. ""Strong enough surely to knock people off their feet."" He said the group heard someone shouting for help and went to see if they could help but could not see anything because of cloud cover. They contacted the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team. Walkers who were on the Mournes said they attempted rescues after hearing cries for help but were stopped by poor weather.

Sturgeon refers herself over Salmond case,"Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon spoke on five occasions after sexual harassment allegations were made against him The first minister has referred herself to a standards panel over her actions during an investigation into Alex Salmond. Nicola Sturgeon made phone calls and took meetings with Mr Salmond while claims of sexual harassment - which he denies - were being investigated. She said it was in the interest of the complainants that she should be examined under the ministerial code. However, she also said she ""acted appropriately and in good faith."" Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is in the interests of the women who have complained that the ongoing police investigations are allowed to continue without any risk of prejudice. That must be the priority for everyone.Â Timeline: The Alex Salmond investigation Q&A: Alex Salmond's legal victory ""I have acted appropriately and in good faith throughout, and in compliance with the ministerial code at all times. However, I have reflected carefully and understand that it is also important for parliament and the wider public to be assured of that. ""The independent advisers will now be consulted on their precise remit, and advice will also be sought on how to ensure that there is no risk of prejudice to the ongoing police investigation. The remit will be published in due course. It comes after Ms Sturgeon denied conspiring against or colluding with Alex Salmond over the sexual harassment claims. Opposition leaders havequestioned why she met himafter the allegations were made, and why no minutes were taken. Ms Sturgeon continued: ""The fact remains that at the centre of this issue are two women whose complaints could not be swept under the carpet. ""Any continuing commentary about these issues at this stage - whether from myself, the government or Mr Salmond and his representatives - would only serve to distract from and potentially compromise the proper consideration by the police of the subject matter of their investigations. ""That is something we will not do."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for a public parliamentary inquiry ""in order for the public to have confidence"" in Ms Sturgeon and her government. He said: ""Nicola Sturgeon has done the right thing in accepting Scottish Labour's call for her to refer herself under the ministerial code. ""It is also now essential that the Scottish Parliament is given the power to fully review the outcome of this investigation into whether Nicola Sturgeon has broken the ministerial code."" He added: ""Throughout this process it is essential to remember that at the centre of all of this are two courageous women who put their faith in a system that has badly let them down, and we must never lose sight of that, by safeguarding the duty of care to them and their access to justice. ""We must restore trust and confidence in the system."" Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said: ""There is no reason why such an inquiry need impact on the separate police investigation into Mr Salmond. And any attempt by the SNP to use that separate inquiry to evade legitimate questions would be quite wrong."" ""Nicola Sturgeon's handling of this matter over the last week has been absolutely abysmal. ""It is time for the first minister to stop dodging and accept that finding excuses to avoid the many wider and important questions will not wash. It's time to front up.""

Family had to sit on floor of plane,"Paula Taylor and her daughter spent part of the flight sitting on the floor A family returning from holiday found they had no seats once they had boarded their plane and spent part of the flight sitting on the floor. Despite having boarding passes, the Taylor family found empty spaces where their seats should have been. The family, from Alcester, Warwickshire, had paid Â£1,300 and were flying from Mahon in Menorca to Birmingham with TUI airlines. The Civil Aviation Authority is looking into the matter. The family raised the issue with BBC One programme Rip Off Britain: Holiday. Mrs Taylor and her husband were given flip-up seats but the plane's food and other items were stored behind them, she said Paula Taylor told the show that she, her husband and 10-year-old daughter had got to the airport early, in June, to make sure they were seated together. Their seat numbers were 41 D, E and F. But when they got on the plane there was an empty space underneath the numbers. ""We all just looked at each other as if to say 'where's our seats gone?',"" Mrs Taylor said. Once all the passengers had boarded there was just one seat left. Mrs Taylor's daughter Brooke was given that seat while she and her husband were given flip-up seats in the crew section. Paula Taylor says she was given short shrift when she tried to raise the matter with TUI afterwards But once the flight had taken off, crew were busy serving food and other items stored behind those seats and Mr and Mrs Taylor had to go and sit on the floor, in the space their seats should have been. They were joined by Brooke as she did not want to sit alone. The family say they were thanked by the plane crew for their understanding. But Mrs Taylor says she was given short shrift when she raised the matter with TUI and was eventually offered a goodwill gesture of Â£30. After the family contacted Rip Off Britain, TUI refunded their fares and said a ""last-minute aircraft change"" meant the family's assigned seats were unavailable, as the alternative aircraft had a different seating configuration. It said it was ""sorry for the way the situation was initially handled"" and will contact the family directly to apologise. The company has been contacted for further comment by BBC Online. The family were flying from Mahon in Menorca to Birmingham and had paid Â£1,300 in fares The Civil Aviation Authority says while passengers are allowed to sit in crew seats under certain conditions, they must not be left unseated during any stage of the flight. It told Rip-Off Britain it would be contacting TUI for an explanation.

Mayor dies on scuba-diving holiday,"Nigel Gawthrope was a popular figure in Cambridge The mayor of Cambridge has died suddenly while on a scuba-diving holiday with his wife in South Africa. Nigel Gawthrope, 61, collapsed on Friday after surfacing from a dive and feeling unwell. The exact cause of his death is unknown. The city councillor was a popular local figure and had been eight months into his term of office. Council leader Lewis Herbert said he served ""with distinction and panache"". A keen scuba diver and underwater photographer, Mr Gawthrope was on holiday at a diving resort near Durban with his wife, Jenny. Mr Gawthrope was a keen scuba diver and underwater photographer (file picture) Mr Gawthrope was a prolific charity fundraiser and worked at the Cambridge University Press, Judge Business School - and latterly as a porter at Clare College, Cambridge. He was particularly proud of his association with the Cambridge children's charity, theRed Hen Project,external. He was also a long-standing member of the Unite union and acted as a representative and delegate. Mr Gawthrope was elected to Cambridge City Council serving King's Hedges ward for Labour in 2012 - and again in 2016 - before taking up the mayoral role in May. Mr Herbert, leader of the city's 26 Labour councillors, said: ""Our thoughts and emotions are with his wife Jenny so far away, and with Nigel's family and close friends at this truly horrible time. ""As a councillor and mayor of Cambridge, Nigel served with distinction and panache."" He added: ""Nigel was a one-off. He was a thoroughly engaging individual who will be hard to replace."" East of England MEP Alex Mayer said Mr Gawthrope was a ""committed ward councillor... who always greeted you with a smile"" and described the news as ""deeply, deeply sad"". Labour councillor Kevin Price said he and Mr Gawthrope ""shared a history of trades union activism within the printing industry"". ""He loved representing the ward where he grew up,"" he added, ""and many residents in the ward will share our deep shock and sadness at his untimely death.""

I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit?,"On Tuesday, members of parliament in the UK are expected to hold their all-important vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for the UK's withdrawal and future relationship with the European Union. The key vote - delayed from 11 December last year - comes with the clock continuing to tick on Britain's departure from the EU on 29 March. Spoiler alert: I don't think anyone knows for sure how Brexit will end and we may not have much more certainty even by the end of next week. But here's what we might learn: first, the extent of parliamentary opposition to Theresa May's deal and second, an idea of whether she has a Plan B. That's not certain because if, as expected, she loses the big vote on Tuesday, technically she has until the following Monday to let MPs know what she intends to do. Options include trying her deal again, a different deal, no deal, a second referendum and delaying Brexit. Theresa May's deal involves two parts, a legally binding Withdrawal Treaty on the terms of Britain's departure from the EU, and a non-binding Political Declaration setting out hopes for the future relationship after Brexit. Many pro-Brexit MPs in Mrs May's Conservative Party feel the Treaty leaves the UK too close to the EU, while most pro-Remain Conservatives and all the opposition parties feel the Declaration is far too vague. The BBC is predicting Mrs May faces the biggest defeat any government has suffered in 100 years. Much pressure will be exerted by Mrs May and her ministers until the very last second to reduce the size of the defeat. Please upgrade your browser Even her closest aides don't seem to know if she has one. Both in public and apparently in private too, she insists her plan is the best and only way of delivering on the referendum result without destroying the economy. But here are some suggestions as to what she might do: return to the EU to try to make her deal more attractive to MPs, challenge MPs to unite around an alternative to her deal, threaten MPs with a no-deal Brexit or another referendum on her plan or ask Brussels for a delay to the whole process. That Mrs May has to come up with a Plan B sooner rather than later is, by the way, thanks to a massive row this week between John Bercow (the Speaker of the House of Commons) on one side and the government and pro-Brexit MPs on the other. Amidst bitter allegations against the Speaker of being biased against leaving the EU, he basically ruled that he intends to help Parliament have more of a role in managing Brexit. That matters because so far Parliament is against no deal and Mrs May's deal. Brexit has fractured and divided not just the governing Conservative Party but the main opposition Labour Party too. Its leadership under the left-wing lifelong Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn is committed to some kind of Brexit, but most of its members and voters want a second referendum to stop Britain leaving. Labour is committed to voting against Mrs May's deal on Tuesday, but what the party might do in future parliamentary votes, when push comes to shove closer to 29 March, is impossible to say. No-one knows. Put simply, more than two-and-a-half years on, MPs still can't agree what to do about the result of the referendum. It's that basic and explains why Britain is experiencing its most profound political crisis since 1945. But if nothing else happens, it's worth remembering the default position is for the UK to leave without a deal. If Mrs May is not in the end prepared to risk a no-deal Brexit and if Parliament is determined to try to stop it anyway, something needs to happen. What, if anything, that something might be is still uncertain. If you can't see the chatbot abovetap on this link,external.

What's next if MPs block the deal?,"I know that, right here, I've been writing about, and we've been discussing, our prime minister's and politicians' Brexit choices for more than two-and-a-half years. And, yes indeed, there have been many, many times we have reported it is a crunch moment, a crucial day, or a vital moment. And each mini-drama, each bizarre twist, each day where we have moved further from anything like politics-as-usual, has had meaning. That's true of the prime minister's speech in Florence, the meltingly hot cabinet day out at Chequers, Boris Johnson stalking out of the cabinet, or indeed, the EU saying ""non, non, non"" at Salzburg, or Gina Miller's Supreme Court appeal, where on Parliament's behalf - on behalf of all of us in a sense - she won a bigger say over Brexit for MPs. Ministers battle to save Brexit deal Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Barring an almost incredible-to-imagine second delay to the vote, Tuesday is when MPs get the chance to express that wish - to say yes or no to the deal that's on the table. The weird thing about it is that unless, again, something almost impossible-to-ponder happens, we know they are, in large numbers, going to say no. There is precious little jeopardy in saying that, althoughbe sceptical of any predictions about the size of the defeat. MPs don't even trust each other on rebellions, let alone always stick to what they may brag about before. If you take a clear ""no"" vote as read then, there is a possibility that moves afoot to stop us leaving without a deal, will be taken by parliamentarians who have been studying the rule books very closely. Gina Miller's court case won MPs the right for a bigger say on Brexit In recent months amid the cacophony, Parliament has steadily been taking more and more control of the Brexit process, if not ownership of the problems. And it's likely this week there will be another attempt, maybe even before the vote, to remove the risk that we can leave without a deal. Of course it would need a majority of MPs' support (always, always, easier said than done). But remember even if they do, the immediate question will be: for what? At the moment there is no majority in Parliament for any plan that has actually been put on the table. And some cabinet ministers believe the attempt to snarl up the process in that way could be blocked in any case. If that's so, well, several cabinet ministers from different parts of the Tory party, have told me they expect the prime minister will have at least another attempt to get her deal, or something rather like it, through Parliament. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. But despite her reputation for secrecy, this week she will have to make something clear. Will she shift to what many in Parliament want, a closer relationship with the EU, perhaps moving across to some kind of customs union? Or will she ramp up preparations for no-deal, trying (which many just don't believe) to show that she really would be willing to walk away with no deal, in the hope that pressure would persuade the EU to crack and make it plain she is not for turning? That is likely to be the call she'll have to make. One cabinet minister told me: ""This week it distils into what people truly think - between those who are really scared of leaving without a deal, and those who are really scared of not leaving."" Even after all this time, the Tories, and this Brexit prime minister, are still faced with the same fundamental choice there always has been - take the risk of going it alone with a dramatic break from the EU, with all the turmoil that might go alongside it. Or cleave to a closer relationship with the EU, some kind of customs union by another name, that could tear the Tory party apart. Lord Hattersley calls for another referendum Blocking Brexit 'may cause far-right surge' Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected Delay is a tactic that has been used by Theresa May with great effect, arguably keeping her - even if unhappily - in office. Every route that she might choose has risks, perhaps none of the choices are tempting for Number 10. But on Tuesday night votes will actually be counted - the numbers, and decisions after they come, just won't wait much longer.

DNA pioneer loses honours over race claims,"James Watson, seen here in 2009, apologised in 2007 after making similar remarks Nobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson has been stripped of his honorary titles after repeating comments about race and intelligence. In a TV programme, the pioneer in DNA studies made a reference to a view that genes cause a difference on average between blacks and whites on IQ tests. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said the 90-year-old scientist's remarks were ""unsubstantiated and reckless"". Dr Watson had made similar claims in 2007 and subsequently apologised. He shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for their 1953 discovery of the DNA's double helix structure. Dr Watson sold his gold medalin 2014, saying he had been ostracised by the scientific community after his remarks about race.

While his hope was that everybody was equal, he added, ""people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true"". After those remarks, Dr Watson lost his job as chancellor at the laboratory and was removed from all his administrative duties. He wrote an apology and retained his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee. But Cold Spring Harbor said it was now stripping him of those titles after he saidhis views had not changed,externalin the documentary American Masters: Decoding Watson, aired on US public broadcaster PBS earlier this month.

No 10 says it is alarmed byreports MPs,externalplan to take control of Brexit if Mrs May's deal is voted down, although a leading Tory rebel denies such a move. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to table a vote of no confidence in the government if she loses, which could trigger a general election. The PM has warned of a ""catastrophic"" breach of trust if Brexit is thwarted. Writing in the Sunday Express,external, Mrs May told MPs: ""It is time to forget the games and do what is right for our country."" Kuenssberg: What's next if MPs reject May's deal? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide About 100 Conservative MPs, and the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs, are currently expected to join Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the deal. What is likely to happen next: Monday- Day four of MPs' Brexit debate Tuesday- Day five of debate followed by ""meaningful vote"" on the PM's deal. MPs will also get to vote on amendments that could reshape the deal If the deal is rejected Theresa May will get three working days to come up with a ""plan B"" Wednesday- Mrs May is likely to head to Brussels to try to get further concessions from the EU Monday, 21 January- Expected Commons vote on ""Plan B"" Friday, 29 March- the UK leaves the EU, unless MPs have succeeded in delaying or cancelling it Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there was greater ""uncertainty"" after Commons Speaker John Bercow's decision last week to allow MPs to change the parliamentary timetable. He warned ""those on the Brexiteer side seeking ideological purity"" by voting down Mrs May's deal they risked ""leaving the door ajar to ways that increase the risk to Brexit"". ""There are lots of different plans being put forward by Members of Parliament that don't respect the result (of the referendum) or risk no deal,"" he added. Pressed on what would happen if the deal is defeated, Mr Barclay said he suspected the Commons would support something ""along the lines of this deal"" but declined to speculate on whether the government had a Brexit ""plan B"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn on how Labour would negotiate Brexit: ""The EU is well known to be flexible"" Mr Corbyn said Labour would vote against Mrs May's deal and, if she lost, would start moves to trigger a general election. He told Andrew Marr: ""We will table a motion of no confidence in the government at a time of our choosing, but it's going to be soon, don't worry about it."" The Labour leader has said his party does not have the votes in Parliament to win a confidence vote on its own and has appealed to other parties to support it. Northern Ireland's DUP party, which keeps Mrs May in power, is also planning to vote against her deal but has said it will support Mrs May in a confidence vote. If a majority of MPs back a no confidence motion, the government - or any anyone else with sufficient support - will get 14 days to try to win another confidence vote. If no-one can do that, a general election will be held. Mr Corbyn is facing growing calls from within his own party to back a second EU referendum. He told Andrew Marr he hoped to get a general election first - and ensure that the UK did not leave without a deal. ""My own view is that I'd rather get a negotiated deal now, if we can, to stop the danger of a no-deal exit from the EU on 29 March - which would be catastrophic for industry."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal.

Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Asked whether Labour would campaign to leave the EU if a general election was called, Mr Corbyn said his party would ""decide our manifesto content as soon as we know there's an election coming"". He said he would have to ask the EU to extend Article 50, the legal process taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, if he won an election, which he said would take place in February or March, to allow time for a new Labour government to negotiate a Brexit deal of its own. Mr Corbyn wants the UK to be part of a customs union with the EU, with access to the single market. Please upgrade your browser The UK will leave the EU on 29 March unless there is a new act of Parliament preventing that. Because the government controls the timetable for Commons business, it was assumed that this would not be possible. But a group of MPs, including former Tory ministers, are reported by the Sunday Times to be working on a way to allow non-government members to take control of the timetable and bring forward legislation making it illegal to leave the EU without a deal, if Mrs May loses Tuesday's vote. Downing Street has said it is ""extremely concerned"" about the reported plot, which it says could potentially overturn centuries of Parliamentary precedent. A leading Conservative Remainer, who declined to be named, has told the BBC he is not aware of any plans to change Commons rules. He dismissed newspaper stories about backbench plots as ""fantasy"", designed to frighten Brexiteer Tories into backing Mrs May's deal. But the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said MPs must now take control of the Brexit process from the government to prevent a no-deal scenario. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme: ""The prime minister's got to stop threatening Parliament and indeed, threatening the whole of the United Kingdom, that it's a choice between her deal and no deal - that's not the case."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who like Mr Blackford backs another EU referendum, said: ""I think Parliament will take control of this process, will insist that we pursue the option of no Brexit."" Sir Vince said this could happen by cancelling Article 50 - which he noted would be ""resented by lots of people"" - or via a second referendum. But former Brexit Secretary David Davis said MPs should vote down Mrs May's deal - and the government should then go back to the EU with ""our best and final offer"" of a free trade deal with no tariffs, along the lines of the deal the EU has with Canada. ""If the EU insists on no deal, then fine,""he says in an article for the Sunday Times.,external The government has previously rejected Mr Davis's proposals, which are backed by other Brexiteer Tories, saying they would not solve the Northern Irish border problem.

May: No Brexit more likely than no deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Over the next 24 hours, give this deal a second look"" Theresa May has warned opponents of her Brexit deal that they risk ""letting the British people down"" as Labour said the prime minister faced a ""humiliating defeat"" in Tuesday's crunch vote. She urged critics to give the deal ""a second look"", insisting new assurances on the Irish border had ""legal force"". She said the ""history books"" would judge if MPs delivered on Brexit while safeguarding the economy and security. But Jeremy Corbyn said the PM had ""completely and utterly failed"". And the SNP said the PM was ""in fantasy land and the government should stop threatening no-deal"". MPs will vote on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and declaration on future relations on Tuesday evening. Labour and the other opposition parties will vote against the deal while about 100 Conservative MPs, and the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs, could also join them. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn met their backbenchers after the PM's Commons statement on Monday night - the PM to appeal once more for their support and the Labour leader to reiterate his plan to call for a general election if the deal is rejected. Mr Corbyn also told his MPs a no-confidence vote in the prime minister would be ""coming soon"", according to BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Laura Kuenssberg: Multiple meanings of meaningful vote Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit Possible amendments to PM's Brexit deal Assistant whip Gareth Johnson has become the latest member of the government to quit his job over the deal, saying in his resignation letter to the PM that it would be ""detrimental to our nation's interests"". He added: ""The time has come to place my loyalty to my country above my loyalty to the government."" Ahead of the vote, Mrs May briefed MPs on the controversial issue of the ""backstop"" - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical Northern Ireland border checks. She said her ""absolute conviction"" was that the UK and EU would be able to finalise their future relationship by the end of 2020, meaning the backstop would never be needed. Shepublished a joint letter,externalfrom European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in which they stressed their ""firm commitment"" to working towards such an agreement - and said if the backstop were to be used it would be for the ""shortest possible period"". However, they said they could not add anything to change the terms of the deal negotiated with Mrs May. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Laura Kuenssberg: What's next if MPs reject May's deal? What could happen next? PM's 'hypocritical' assembly remark dropped The PM told MPs: ""I say to members on all sides of this house, whatever you may have previously concluded, over these next 24 hours, give this deal a second look. ""It is not perfect, but when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this House tomorrow and ask 'did we deliver on the country's vote to leave the EU, did we safeguard our economy, security or union or did we let the British people down'."" Five Conservative Brexiteer MPs who have been critics of the withdrawal agreement have now said they will support the government in the vote on Tuesday, including Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and former Public Accounts Committee chairman Sir Edward Leigh. But former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the PM must make the government ""the servant of the House"" if the deal was rejected, giving Parliament an ""open and honest process"" to express their will. By Alex Forsyth, BBC political correspondent The letter from Presidents Juncker and Tusk was deliberately released at the moment No 10 hoped it might have the most impact - the eve of the crucial Brexit vote. But regardless of the timing, the attempt to reassure hasn't done enough to convince many senior Brexiteers to swing behind the prime minister's deal. The contentious Northern Ireland backstop remains the biggest sticking point, and nothing short of a legally watertight guarantee that it can't go on indefinitely will be enough for many of those with concerns. At this stage, the EU has made clear it won't reopen the negotiated Withdrawal Agreement to include such a guarantee. So, however warm the words of reassurance offered today, it seems they won't be enough to persuade many opponents to Mrs May's deal to change their mind. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM ""utterly failed"" on Brexit legal agreements The so-called Irish backstop will see the UK and EU share a single customs territory until they settle their future relationship or come up with another solution to stop a hard border. Many Tory MPs, as well as the Democratic Unionists, are adamantly opposed to it. The EU has given fresh written assurances about how the backstop might be triggered and how long it would last. The key points, in the letter from top officials Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker to the PM, are: The backstop will not affect or supersede the provisions of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement The backstop will not extend regulatory alignment with EU law in Northern Ireland beyond what is strictly necessary to avoid a hard border Alternatives to the backstop such as ""facilitative arrangements or technologies"", will be looked at with progress considered every six months after the UK's departure Any alternative arrangements would not be ""required to replicate"" the backstop ""provided the underlying objectives continue to be met"" ""Were the backstop to enter into force in whole or in part, it is intended to apply only temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement,"" they said. ""The Commission is committed to providing the necessary political impetus and resources to help achieving the objective of making this period as short as possible,"" it said. Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said the assurances offered ""legal force"" to the UK, but admitted they did not alter the ""fundamental meanings"" in the Withdrawal Agreement - namely that the UK is indefinitely committed to the backstop if it comes into force, as neither side can unilaterally withdraw from it. Mr Corbyn said it amounted to nothing more than ""warm words and aspirations"" while the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said there were no ""legally binding assurances"" as talked about by the PM in December. ""In fact, there is nothing new,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser Here is what is likely to happen: Tuesday - Day five of debate followed by ""meaningful vote"" on the PM's deal. MPs will also get to vote on amendments that could reshape the deal. If the deal is rejected Theresa May will get three working days to come up with a ""plan B"" Wednesday - Mrs May could head to Brussels to try to get further concessions from the EU Monday 21 January - Expected Commons vote on ""Plan B"" The UK will leave the EU on 29 March unless there is a new act of Parliament preventing that. Three senior Conservative backbenchers - Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan - have proposed a ""European Union Withdrawal Number 2 Bill"" if she fails a second time, giving ministers three weeks to get a plan B through Parliament. If this doesn't work, they propose that the Liaison Committee - made up of the chairmen and chairwomen of all the Commons select committees - should be given ""the responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal, which would have to go back to the House for a vote"". Downing Street has said it is ""extremely concerned"" about the plot, which it says could potentially overturn centuries of Parliamentary precedent. A cross-party group of anti-Brexit politicians have also published proposed legislation to bring about a second referendum on leaving the EU, asking the public whether they want to remain in the EU or leave under the prime minister's deal. The MPs behind the draft legislation point out that Article 50 - the two-year process by which an EU member leaves the bloc - would have to be extended in order for another poll to take place, meaning the UK would remain a member beyond 29 March.

What's next if MPs reject deal?,"I know that, right here, I've been writing about, and we've been discussing, our prime minister's and politicians' Brexit choices for more than two-and-a-half years. And, yes indeed, there have been many, many times we have reported it is a crunch moment, a crucial day, or a vital moment. And each mini-drama, each bizarre twist, each day where we have moved further from anything like politics-as-usual, has had meaning. That's true of the prime minister's speech in Florence, the meltingly hot cabinet day out at Chequers, Boris Johnson stalking out of the cabinet, or indeed, the EU saying ""non, non, non"" at Salzburg, or Gina Miller's Supreme Court appeal, where on Parliament's behalf - on behalf of all of us in a sense - she won a bigger say over Brexit for MPs. Ministers battle to save Brexit deal Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Barring an almost incredible-to-imagine second delay to the vote, Tuesday is when MPs get the chance to express that wish - to say yes or no to the deal that's on the table. The weird thing about it is that unless, again, something almost impossible-to-ponder happens, we know they are, in large numbers, going to say no. There is precious little jeopardy in saying that, althoughbe sceptical of any predictions about the size of the defeat. MPs don't even trust each other on rebellions, let alone always stick to what they may brag about before. If you take a clear ""no"" vote as read then, there is a possibility that moves afoot to stop us leaving without a deal, will be taken by parliamentarians who have been studying the rule books very closely. Gina Miller's court case won MPs the right for a bigger say on Brexit In recent months amid the cacophony, Parliament has steadily been taking more and more control of the Brexit process, if not ownership of the problems. And it's likely this week there will be another attempt, maybe even before the vote, to remove the risk that we can leave without a deal. Of course it would need a majority of MPs' support (always, always, easier said than done). But remember even if they do, the immediate question will be: for what? At the moment there is no majority in Parliament for any plan that has actually been put on the table. And some cabinet ministers believe the attempt to snarl up the process in that way could be blocked in any case. If that's so, well, several cabinet ministers from different parts of the Tory party, have told me they expect the prime minister will have at least another attempt to get her deal, or something rather like it, through Parliament. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. But despite her reputation for secrecy, this week she will have to make something clear. Will she shift to what many in Parliament want, a closer relationship with the EU, perhaps moving across to some kind of customs union? Or will she ramp up preparations for no-deal, trying (which many just don't believe) to show that she really would be willing to walk away with no deal, in the hope that pressure would persuade the EU to crack and make it plain she is not for turning? That is likely to be the call she'll have to make. One cabinet minister told me: ""This week it distils into what people truly think - between those who are really scared of leaving without a deal, and those who are really scared of not leaving."" Even after all this time, the Tories, and this Brexit prime minister, are still faced with the same fundamental choice there always has been - take the risk of going it alone with a dramatic break from the EU, with all the turmoil that might go alongside it. Or cleave to a closer relationship with the EU, some kind of customs union by another name, that could tear the Tory party apart. Lord Hattersley calls for another referendum Blocking Brexit 'may cause far-right surge' Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected Delay is a tactic that has been used by Theresa May with great effect, arguably keeping her - even if unhappily - in office. Every route that she might choose has risks, perhaps none of the choices are tempting for Number 10. But on Tuesday night votes will actually be counted - the numbers, and decisions after they come, just won't wait much longer.

Polish mayor stabbed at charity event,"This video can not be played 'Mum, this man has a knife!' - witness describes the moment before Gdansk Mayor Pawel Adamowicz is fatally stabbed The mayor of the Polish city of Gdansk has been seriously injured after being stabbed on stage at the country's biggest charity event, officials say. Pawel Adamowicz, 53, was taken to hospital, where he is in a critical condition after five hours of surgery. The 27-year-old suspect, who has a criminal record, has been detained. He said the Civic Platform party, which led the previous government and had supported Mr Adamowicz's re-election, had wrongfully imprisoned him. Mr Adamowicz suffered very serious abdominal injuries during the attack. During a five-hour operation, the mayor was given 41 units of blood. ""He remains in a very, very serious condition,"" one of his doctors said early on Monday. ""The coming hours will be decisive."" In a later update on his condition, doctors said Mr Adamowicz was not breathing on his own and a machine was helping to operate his heart and lungs. The incident took place at the finale of the annual Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity event, which was attended by hundreds of people. A man holds a knife after the stabbing in Gdansk Television footage showed the suspect, who was released from prison recently, shouting ""Adamowicz is dead"" and claiming he had been tortured in prison. Poland country profile Polish police said he had access to the stage using a media badge, and they are now investigating how he obtained it. Polish broadcaster TVP reported that he had been released from prison in December. President Andrzej Duda said he was informed that ""doctors succeeded in reanimating the heart of the seriously injured mayor"". ""There is hope but his condition is very difficult,"",externalhe said on Twitter, calling on people to pray for Mr Adamowicz. Doctors said his heart was wounded, as was his diaphragm - the muscle between belly and chest which we use to breathe. Mr Adamowicz is a native of Gdansk, and has been its mayor for 20 years. People gather in front of the hospital where the mayor is being treated A graduate of Gdansk university's law school, he is married to a professor there, and the pair have two daughters - one a teenager and one under 10. His wife was in London at the time of the attack and Poland sent a government plane to bring her home, Polish media reported. His self-written online biography says he helped to organise student strikes in 1988 - a year of mass nationwide strikes against the communist government. Poland would declare a new democratic republic a year later. In 1990, he became a city councillor for Gdansk, rising to mayor of the city in 1998. He has held the office ever since. His most recent victory was in November, granting him a sixth term which is due to run until 2023. Blood donors lined up to contribute after news of Mr Adamowicz's massive blood loss were reported. The stabbing, during an event that raises money for children's hospitals, has shocked Poland, the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw reports. Moments before the attack, Mr Adamowicz posted a picture on Instagram from the stage of the event, where dozens of people were holding white lights. Allow Instagram content?

Saudi prince attacks US Syria pullout,"This video can not be played Prince Turki al-Faisal on Saudi-US relationship and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi A senior member of the Saudi royal family has warned against a US troop withdrawal from Syria. Prince Turki al-Faisal told the BBC the action would have a negative impact, further entrenching Iran, Russia and the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. US President Donald Trump announced in December that it was time to bring US troops home from Syria. Prince Turki was speaking just before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began a visit to Riyadh. Mr Pompeo is on a tour of the Middle East, and has already visited Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and Bahrain. Mr Pompeo is in Riyadh for talks Trump rewrites US Syria policy Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West US 'hopeful' on deal to protect Kurds He said that the world community was guilty of neglecting the Syrian people and the US troop withdrawal would make things worse. ""The US actions from my perspective is that it is going to further complicate, rather find any solutions to it and further entrench not only the Iranians, but also the Russians and Bashar al Assad, so from the perspective it is a very negative development,"" he said. The prince added that the departure of Defence Secretary James Mattis in December was unlikely to help matters either. ""Obviously he disagreed with the administration on Syria policy so in that context his remaining would have been a more positive sign of commitment to that policy,"" he said. President Trump announced the troop withdrawal last month The prince is no longer a member of the Saudi government, but has decades of experience within it. BBC State Department correspondent Barbara Plett says that while he is most likely reflecting Saudi official opinion he is not speaking for the government. US media report that he is expected to discuss Iran and the conflicts in Yemen and Syria during his time in Riyadh, as well as seeking an update on the investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He said at a news conference in Qatar that he would ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to hold Khashoggi's killers ""accountable"". Jamal Khashoggi was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October The trip to Riyadh comes just three months after the murder of Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi's rulers, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Riyadh has admitted he was murdered there, but denied suggestions that the crown prince was involved. It had initially maintained that the writer left the consulate unharmed. ""We will continue to have a conversation with the crown prince and the Saudis about ensuring accountability,"" Mr Pompeo said at a news conference in Qatar on Sunday.

Speaking in Qatar, America's most senior diplomat also called for more unity between Arab states, urging an end to the 18-month economic boycott of Qatar. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt - all US allies - cut ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing the oil-rich state of supporting the region's terrorist groups and Iran  - Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. Qatar denies that, and has accused its neighbours of seeking regime change. What's behind crisis with Qatar? How is Qatar coping with its economic embargo?

Guardian switches to potato starch wrapping,"Guardian readers have been opening their weekend paper to find supplements wrapped in a compostable material made from potato starch. The paper says it ditched its polythene covers after feedback from readers. Advice on the wrapping says it should not be recycled but disposed of on a compost heap or in a food waste bin. The change, which the Guardian says will increase its production costs, has been introduced in London, Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. It plans to phase in the new wrapping across the whole of the UK over the coming months. The packaging has a silky feel and is not entirely transparent like plastic. Recycled packaging 'may end up in landfill' Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Why 12 is the magic number when it comes to composting The Guardian said the wrap was suitable for domestic composting and designed to ""completely compost within six months in a well-maintained compost heap or food waste bin"". Reaction on social media has been mainly positive, although some readers were unsure whether their local authority would allow it in their food waste bin and whether it would ever fully break down.

The Guardian said it would not reveal the extra cost involved in switching to the packaging. Other publications have already moved to potato starch wrapping, including the New Internationalist and the National Trust members' magazine, but the Guardian says it is the first national newspaper to do so. Usually comes from waste potatoes so you don't need to grow a crop to make it 100% compostable Contains no oil-based materials, plastics or harmful toxins Durable Carries the EN13432 industrial certification. OK compost HOME certification, which the Guardian wrapper has, is the equivalent for domestic compost Other national newspapers say they have been experimenting with more environmentally-friendly ways to distribute their magazines, supplements and advertising leaflets. The Times said it was trialling biodegradable bags and ""belly bands"" - a looped strip of paper - and hoped to roll out at least one of these options ""as soon as we can"". A spokesman for the Mail on Sunday said: ""We are actively investigating an alternative to polythene bags, in particular using a form of paper packaging."" The FT said it removed all plastic packaging of home deliveries at the start of the year - and papers sold in newsagents and supermarkets have always been unwrapped. The move at the Guardian coincides with a 30p price hike of the Saturday edition to Â£3.20. The price of the weekday edition and the Observer are also going up by 20p, to Â£2.20 and Â£3.20 respectively.

Family had to sit on floor of planeThey were given boarding passes but found an empty space where their seats should have been.England,"Paula Taylor and her daughter spent part of the flight sitting on the floor A family returning from holiday found they had no seats once they had boarded their plane and spent part of the flight sitting on the floor. Despite having boarding passes, the Taylor family found empty spaces where their seats should have been. The family, from Alcester, Warwickshire, had paid Â£1,300 and were flying from Mahon in Menorca to Birmingham with TUI airlines. The Civil Aviation Authority is looking into the matter. The family raised the issue with BBC One programme Rip Off Britain: Holiday. Mrs Taylor and her husband were given flip-up seats but the plane's food and other items were stored behind them, she said Paula Taylor told the show that she, her husband and 10-year-old daughter had got to the airport early, in June, to make sure they were seated together. Their seat numbers were 41 D, E and F. But when they got on the plane there was an empty space underneath the numbers. ""We all just looked at each other as if to say 'where's our seats gone?',"" Mrs Taylor said. Once all the passengers had boarded there was just one seat left. Mrs Taylor's daughter Brooke was given that seat while she and her husband were given flip-up seats in the crew section. Paula Taylor says she was given short shrift when she tried to raise the matter with TUI afterwards But once the flight had taken off, crew were busy serving food and other items stored behind those seats and Mr and Mrs Taylor had to go and sit on the floor, in the space their seats should have been. They were joined by Brooke as she did not want to sit alone. The family say they were thanked by the plane crew for their understanding. But Mrs Taylor says she was given short shrift when she raised the matter with TUI and was eventually offered a goodwill gesture of Â£30. After the family contacted Rip Off Britain, TUI refunded their fares and said a ""last-minute aircraft change"" meant the family's assigned seats were unavailable, as the alternative aircraft had a different seating configuration. It said it was ""sorry for the way the situation was initially handled"" and will contact the family directly to apologise. The company has been contacted for further comment by BBC Online. The family were flying from Mahon in Menorca to Birmingham and had paid Â£1,300 in fares The Civil Aviation Authority says while passengers are allowed to sit in crew seats under certain conditions, they must not be left unseated during any stage of the flight. It told Rip-Off Britain it would be contacting TUI for an explanation.

Pompeo to seek Khashoggi update in Riyadh,"This video can not be played Prince Turki al-Faisal on Saudi-US relationship and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi A senior member of the Saudi royal family has warned against a US troop withdrawal from Syria. Prince Turki al-Faisal told the BBC the action would have a negative impact, further entrenching Iran, Russia and the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. US President Donald Trump announced in December that it was time to bring US troops home from Syria. Prince Turki was speaking just before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began a visit to Riyadh. Mr Pompeo is on a tour of the Middle East, and has already visited Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and Bahrain. Mr Pompeo is in Riyadh for talks Trump rewrites US Syria policy Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West US 'hopeful' on deal to protect Kurds He said that the world community was guilty of neglecting the Syrian people and the US troop withdrawal would make things worse. ""The US actions from my perspective is that it is going to further complicate, rather find any solutions to it and further entrench not only the Iranians, but also the Russians and Bashar al Assad, so from the perspective it is a very negative development,"" he said. The prince added that the departure of Defence Secretary James Mattis in December was unlikely to help matters either. ""Obviously he disagreed with the administration on Syria policy so in that context his remaining would have been a more positive sign of commitment to that policy,"" he said. President Trump announced the troop withdrawal last month The prince is no longer a member of the Saudi government, but has decades of experience within it. BBC State Department correspondent Barbara Plett says that while he is most likely reflecting Saudi official opinion he is not speaking for the government. US media report that he is expected to discuss Iran and the conflicts in Yemen and Syria during his time in Riyadh, as well as seeking an update on the investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He said at a news conference in Qatar that he would ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to hold Khashoggi's killers ""accountable"". Jamal Khashoggi was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October The trip to Riyadh comes just three months after the murder of Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi's rulers, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Riyadh has admitted he was murdered there, but denied suggestions that the crown prince was involved. It had initially maintained that the writer left the consulate unharmed. ""We will continue to have a conversation with the crown prince and the Saudis about ensuring accountability,"" Mr Pompeo said at a news conference in Qatar on Sunday. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Speaking in Qatar, America's most senior diplomat also called for more unity between Arab states, urging an end to the 18-month economic boycott of Qatar. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt - all US allies - cut ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing the oil-rich state of supporting the region's terrorist groups and Iran  - Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. Qatar denies that, and has accused its neighbours of seeking regime change. What's behind crisis with Qatar? How is Qatar coping with its economic embargo? The online war between Qatar and Saudi Arabia Mr Pompeo's trip is intended to reassure America's Middle East allies of its commitment to the region. On 15 January the US secretary of state will visit Kuwait, where he is expected to sign an agreement to ""boost the strategic dialogue between the two countries"", according to Kuwait's state news agency.

Who was the queen brought to life by Olivia Colman?,"British actress Olivia Colman has beenhonoured at the Golden Globesfor her portrayal of Queen Anne in The Favourite - but who was the subject of the acclaimed film? Despite what the film says, Queen Anne did not have a menagerie of 17 bunnies. And no - there is no evidence that she was in a same-sex relationship. However, the film does shed light on a British monarch often overlooked by history. Queen Anne's relatively short reign (1702-1714) is often seen as a blip in history. That's a mistake, says Sebastian Edwards, a Historic Royal Palaces curator who is part of the team overseeinga new exhibition of costumes from The Favourite,externalat Kensington Palace. ""She cleared up the mess left by the men and doesn't get much thanks or credit for it,"" he says (Anne's father, James II and VII of Scotland, was king for three years before being deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688). ""If you're looking for strong female leaders you couldn't find a better one in a time of crisis."" Anne became queen following the death of William III (and II in Scotland), also known as William of Orange, who succeeded Anne's father as king. Her reign saw the unification of Scotland and England, Britain taking possession of Gibraltar, and the development of the two-party system. Despite at least 17 pregnancies, none of her children survived into adulthood, which led to the end of the House of Stuart, the Act of Settlement of 1701, and the peaceful transition of power to the House of Hanover. She was succeeded by the German Protestant prince George, Elector of Hanover (George I). Hannah Greig, the historical adviser for the film, says the film accurately ""captures the essence of the politics of the time"" with Whigs and Tories competing for power. ""It reveals to us the tensions that were evident over whether or not England should continue its place in the European war,"" says Dr Greig, who works at the University of York. The Acts of Union between England and Scotland being read before Queen Anne, 1707. Artist Unknown (1826) In the film, Queen Anne has two female lovers: Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, and Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham. Mr Edwards says that - despite rumours of Anne being gay - there is no firm evidence. Dr Greig is less certain. She believes it is not as far-fetched as some might presume. In the film the queen has 17 pet bunnies, which Dr Greig says, represent Anne's 17 miscarriages, stillbirths and dead children. For Dr Greig, the bunnies are an emotional representation of this - and a clever way of conveying her personal history. The queen also suffered from ill-health through her life which is often depicted as gout. However, Mr Edwards says that it's more complex - today she would be thought of as disabled, he says. Blame her former friend and confidante Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, says Dr Greig. According to the film's adviser, she ""went out of her way to try and spin history and sully the past"". Why? We don't really know - but politics was probably a contributing factor. Dr Greig says it was the the Duchess of Marlborough's ambition to make the court (the royal household and advisers) a political place - but Queen Anne wanted a more balanced court where all parties were represented. In one interview,external, Colman said she sympathised with Queen Anne. ""There's so much sadness in her background, she must have been terribly lonely,"" she said. Colman said she found it harder to play current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, in Netflix series The Crown, because ""everyone knows what she looks like, everyone knows what she sounds like"". But she said she was ""proud"" of the 18th Century Monarch she is bringing to life for 21st Century audiences. ""She must have had extraordinary strength,"" she said. ""I think she wanted to be seen as a good queen but she just didn't have the confidence to do it. I never saw her as pathetic. I'm quite proud of her."" Queen Anne film: The Favourite reviewed.

Escaped rhea set to stay at golf club,"This video can not be played Escaped rhea on the loose at Worcestershire golf course An escaped rhea looks set to make its home at a golf course it has been roaming for more than two months. The 6ft, flightless bird arrived at Evesham Golf Club, in Worcestershire, in October and staffhave so far been unable to catch it. Golf club workers said it has become ""a star"" since its arrival and is ""more than welcome to stay"". The club said it was a pet which escaped from the village of Harvington. Due to its speed the bird was nicknamed Linford, after sprinter Linford Christie. A temporary course set up while work is being carried at the site has also been named after the rhea. Club secretary Fraser Williamson said it was ""monitoring"" the bird's welfare adding the club had liaised with animal charities after it arrived in October. ""Because it has been a mild winter it has been foraging for itself and effectively has become a wild animal,"" he said. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Mr Williamson said Linford was ""growing bigger"" and spent a lot of time by the River Avon. ""He is a talking point - people enjoy seeing him around the course,"" he said. ""I personally think he is fantastic."" The rhea, which originates in South America, can reach running speeds of up to 40mph (64km/h). There were initially fears the bird would damage the course's well-maintained greens but it did ""not seem interested"" in the grass, Mr Williamson added. ""He is not bothered by members here. He comes quite close - about 10ft (3m), but if you come closer he will trot off.""

Buyer 'willing to pay Â£100k for Banksy',"Steelworker Ian Lewis discovered the mural on the back of his garage one week before Christmas Someone is willing to pay about Â£100,000 for the Banksy on a garage in Port Talbot, an art dealer has said. Garage owner Ian Lewis has received several approaches from private collectors hoping to buy the piece. Art dealer and Banksy expert John Brandler said his client would offer a six-figure sum ""because it fits nicely into his collection"". Mr Lewis is understood to be meeting the Welsh Government and Arts Council of Wales to discuss other options. Earlier this week, he said howhe was struggling to cope with the pressureof owning such a sought-after piece of art. Neath Port Talbot council hasoffered to meet the full cost of ""loaning"" the graffiti to the public. The Welsh Government said on Wednesday afternoon it had offered to take over running security at the site on an interim basis to ""provide some breathing space for Mr Lewis as he considers some options for the future"". Banksy souvenirs on sale for visitors Mystery artist highlights potholes with penises Painting fetches world record Â£61m Banksy piece mistakenly painted over Volunteers estimate more than 20,000 people have visited the Banksy Mr Brandler said any offer his client was likely to make would be close to Â£100,000. ""He collects Banksy and he collects other street art, he collects a range of art,"" he added. ""He's got the grounds to display it from day one himself but I think he'd be more than willing to consider the social part of it as well."" The dealer said the collector would consider keeping the piece in Port Talbot for a few years as part of any deal. ""It could be a good way of drawing people to the centre of town, which would help the local businesses, because Port Talbot isn't generally considered a number one tourist destination, so it would help the local community in that way."" Art dealer John Brandler said people would complain if the Welsh Government spent Â£100,000 on the artwork as it was not going to ""hospitals, teachers, nurses"" Whatever the outcome, Mr Brandler said it would most likely cost ""tens of thousands of pounds"" to move the piece. One option could be to paint the back of the brickwork with a hard-setting resin, which would then allow part of the wall to be cut out without cracks appearing. Mr Brandler said if the mural had been painted on a similar-sized canvas, it could have fetched up to Â£500,000. ""The fact that this is so big means most people in the country couldn't look after this piece if you gave it to them - and that's what has happened unfortunately to the owner here,"" he added.

Robbie Williams 'tormenting' rock star Page,"Robbie Williams was granted conditional approval in December to build a swimming pool, to the chagrin of Jimmy Page Robbie Williams is ""blasting Black Sabbath music"" to torment his rock star neighbour Jimmy Page over their bitter home extension row, according to a complaint to their local council. The Take That singer won a five-year battle when he was granted conditional approval last year to build a basement swimming pool at his London home. Page fears excavation work will damage his 1875 Grade-I listed mansion. Williams is also said to be imitating Page's former bandmate Robert Plant. A letter to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea states that as well as Sabbath, the singer has been playing Pink Floyd and Deep Purple songs at high volume, as ""he knows this upsets"" the 75-year-old Led Zeppelin guitarist, who has lived at Tower House for more than 46 years. The two stars live next door to each other in Holland Park - Williams's Grade II-listed home used to belong to film director and restaurant critic Michael Winner. It is not publicly known who wrote the complaint,which is signed ""Johnny"",external. Talking about the row in the Telegraph on Friday,external, a spokesman for Williams said the claims in the complaint were ""a complete fabrication and nonsense"". The Take That singer owns a property to the right of Tower House, where Page has lived since the early 1970s A drawing from the planning application to develop the basement at the property The correspondent adds that Williams has also dressed up to imitate Plant by ""wearing a long hair wig, and stuffing a pillow under his shirt in an attempt to mock or imitate Mr Robert Plant's beer belly that he has acquired in his older age"". This is ""embarrassing"", the letter continues, because ""Mr Plant was remembered for performing with his shirt open on stage, and obviously he cannot perform in his current condition as it would be very embarrassing"". Designed and built between 1875 and 1881 by William Burges, seen as one of the greatest Victorian architects His designs were inspired by medieval England Tower House became Grade I listed in 1949 It was previously owned by Lady Jane Turnbull and actor Richard Harris before Page bought it in 1972, allegedly outbidding David Bowie It is opulently decorated with each room having a specific theme Page has meticulously conserved all of the original features,according to a Guardian profile on the house,external In December, planning permission for the extension to be builtwas granted to 44-year-old Williams. However, work cannot begin on his Kensington home until councillors receive reassurance that vibration levels and ground movement issues will be monitored. They will also decide whether to ask Williams for a bond, which could be forfeited if those conditions were breached or if any damage is done to Page's property. Man held after boy dies in hit-and-run WATCH: 'I go on night buses to help loneliness' Speeding 123mph driver 'wanted kebab' Representatives for Williams previously said any construction work would fall within stringent regulations and any effects on surrounding properties would be ""negligible"".

Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino to BBC Sport:""Tottenham did everything to win the game. Maybe we dominated and we created a lot of chances. It was an amazing second half, I am so pleased. ""Sometimes you win a game and you are disappointed, like when we won 3-0 at Old Trafford. They were better than us that day. Today the result should be different and I am happy. That is the way that we want to grow and play. Taking risks, playing football that we are going to play. The team was fantastic, that is the best 45 minutes I have seen Tottenham play since I took charge. ""There were 11 saves from De Gea who was outstanding. He fully deserved to be man of the match. ""It was a clear foul on Harry Kane, a big hit, Mike Dean said he didn't see it. Kane twisted his ankle and we hope that it is not a big issue."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Reezy Renzel:This Utd team will be found out eventually. Completely outclassed by Spurs. If not for De Gea they would've been heavily beaten. Amrul Choudhury:All those moaning that it was a ""lucky"" United win. We gave Spurs enough clear chances at goal. Put them away or count the cost. Dave Payn:You deserve to win if you take more of your chances than the oppositionâs Missed chances donât win games or titles. Spanish La Liga While we've been on air - Lionel Messi has scored his 400th La Liga goal. Ridiculous. If we were talking Premier League goals, that's as many as Alan Shearer + Steven Gerrard + Robbie Savage... Manchester United Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea to BBC Sport:""It was very good, especially at Wembley, three very important points. ""All of the saves are important, especially if we win the game. I am very happy with my performance. The team is playing very well, creating chances and playing more attacking football. ""We had three clean sheets in a row which is very good. The players are happy, you can see that on the pitch, they play with passion, like Manchester United. ""We still believe we can finish in the top four, we are United, we have good players and we are fighting to finish in the top four."" Tottenham Hotspur Mauricio Pochettino on Harry Kane's injury:""My worry is that it was a bad tackle in the last moment. It wasn't the intention of the United player but it was a bad tackle and now he has bit of a swelling on his ankle and he was limping after the game. ""We are going to lose Son for the Asia Cup and if Harry Kane suffers an injury, it is going to be massive for us."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) It was a lucky Man U rather than a game plan. On another day Spurs with a little luck 3 or 4 of those chances would have gone in. Simply Man U were lucky and didn't deserve to win. Colin Never seen a more one sided game where the better team didn't win. Steven Spurs huffed and puffed but never really laid a glove on us. Couple of standard saves for De Gea but all things considered a comfortable win. Top four now in sight. Alan, Seaton Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told Sky Sports:""I am so pleased and I'm proud. After four-and-a-half-years, the second half was the best performance I have seen Tottenham play. It was amazing and I think David de Gea made 11 saves which is unbelievable. In football, sometimes you deserve to win and don't and other times, you do not and you win. That is why we love football. ""We dominated in the first half but we didn't organised ourselves well when we lost Moussa Sissoko and that is how we conceded the goal. United were deeper in the second half, but to play against that system it was amazing to create 11 chances in the second half. I feel so proud and I am leaving Wembley with a good feeling. ""We conceded a counter attack in the first half but the second was the best performance I have seen. We were not clinical and sometimes you score with less opportunities but it is nothing to complain about. The team played unbelievable football and everyone who watched the game can feel the same as myself."" Mauricio Pochettino says he is ""worried"" that Harry Kane might have an injury. Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd Manchester United Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r told Sky Sports:""Results wise, to come away here and beat Tottenham is fantastic. We hung on in the second half and we never got to grips with it when they changed the system, but you are allowed to have a good goalkeeper. ""When you have the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, and the cleverness of Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard, the plan was to attack with pace. Marcus took his goal brilliantly and the pass from Paul was half of the goal. ""We have seen Spurs play and we thought that would be the right plan and it's good we have different plans for different teams. I thought we showed we were here to compete, in particular, the first half."" On David de Gea's performance:""Fantastic. Obviously when you make 11 saves it is a top performance, but even so, two of them were top saves but the rest you would expect David to make. We defended well as a team and when you play against Harry Kane you are always going to be tested. It was just a complete team performance. ""I know why I am here and I know what my job description is, and I'm doing what I can to help the team. We expect to win every game at Man United."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Mohamed:Madrid had Zidane, Barcelona had Pep, Solskjaer is Man Utd version of the two. Tunde Paul:I still donât get it. Mourinho said United players were not good enough but they are doing absolutely more than well for Ole 4 or 5 weeks since Mourinho left United. Tottenham Hotspur IthinkMauricio Pochettino just said that that was the best performance he has seen from Tottenham since he took charge of the club. Yes - he did. ""The second half was the best."" Manchester United Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaerto BBC Sport: ""We could have scored a few as well but we had a good back four and David de Gea in behind them was unbelievable. ""When you have pace up front and Jesse Lingard is so clever in between the lines the goal was great - it was something we worked on. ""We created enough chances to put the game away on the break, but if you don't score you will be under pressure. We defended fantastically. ""De Gea - he should have held a couple! I've played with a few fantatsic goalkeepers, we have a tradition of having them and he has grown and grown, he deserves that man of the match today. ""You expect to win every single game at Man United. You won't, but you must go in thinking that. Thet's the mentality of this group."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Manchester United should stick with Ole after that! He and his staff have the club in their veins thatâs the difference! De Gea class, Lindelof has hit beast mode! Simon, Barrow in Furness Was it the players themselves or Mourinho's management style that led to the players performances over the last few months? If the tactics didn't allow them to express themselves as they have done since OGS has taken over it would suggest it was the latter. Nick Manchester United Here comes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. ""You are allowed to have a good goalkeeper,"" he says... Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd Chris SuttonEx-Premier League striker on 606 I don't think Hugo Lloris has been good enough this season. Paulo Gazzaniga's the man. Manchester United Paul Pogbasays that ""I am enjoying playing my football now. I like to be more attacking, I had to defend too much before and that is not my best attribute. This is my position. ""The manager tells me to get into the box and score goals. The best example is Frank Lampard."" Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham defender Ben Davies told Sky Sports:""David de Gea has pulled off three or four brilliant saves, and on another day, they go on. It is disappointing but it wasn't the worst performance. The boys up front are slotting them away most weeks, but today it wasn't their day. ""United were well organised and they tried to play on the counter and perhaps we were a bit open at times. We tightened up in the second half and created more chances. We were the team that was pushing at the end and they were trying to get every bit of time they could."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Longest aircraft in full production mode,"This video can not be played A helicopter captured footage of the Airlander 10 prototype's maiden flight in August 2016 The world's longest aircraft is to go into full production with a model that will take its first paying passengers. It comes after the prototype Â£32m Airlander 10 - a combined plane and airship - was formally retired following successful final testing. As a result, Bedford firm Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) has been given Production Organisation Approval from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Airlander 10 hit the headlines in 2017, when the prototype collapsed. An eyewitness said the aircraft appeared to ""break in two"" after breaking its moorings and deflating, in November that year, less than 24 hours after completing its sixth successful test flight. The firm was given Design Organisation Approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) in October. The Airlander collapsed on 18 November 2017 Stephen McGlennan, HAV's chief executive, said 2018 had been very good, with Easa's backing a ""huge highlight"". He said the firm had changed its focus last year towards the production of Airlander 10 as a commercial aircraft for customers. ""The prototype served its purpose as the world's first full-sized hybrid aircraft, providing us with the data we needed to move forward from prototype to production standard,"" he said. It is now hoped the full commercial model will take to the skies with its first paying passengers ""in the early 2020s"". World's longest aircraft collapses Williams 'blasting' music to torment Page Man held after boy dies in hit-and-run HAV submitted a Â£32m insurance claim after the prototype crash, telling its shareholders this was the ""maximum insured value"". Airlander 10 was originally based at Cardington Airfield Approval from the CAA and Easa now puts the firm in a ""strong position to launch production"". HAV carried out its first test flight of Airlander 10 from its former home at Cardington Airfield in August 2016 but left the site in June last year. In July, it revealed it planned to offer ""luxury expeditions"" once all tests were successfully completed. CORRECTION: This article has been revised to make it clear the prototype of Airlander 10 has been withdrawn after successfully completing final testing.  It also clarifies that Hybrid Air Vehicles has been given the required certification from all air authorities to begin full commercial production of its aircraft.

Trump denies hiding detail of Putin talks,"Mr Trump (left) with Mr Putin in Helsinki in July 2018 US President Donald Trump has denied hiding details of conversations with Russia's Vladimir Putin, saying he is ""not keeping anything under wraps"". TheWashington Post alleges,externalthat on at least one occasion in 2017 he took away his interpreter's notes after talks. And there is reportedly no record of his one-on-one, two-hour discussion with Mr Putin in Helsinki last year. Mr Trump's relations with Russia before his election in 2016 are the subject of an ongoing federal investigation. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Investigators led by former FBI chief Robert Mueller are trying to establish whether there was any collusion between Mr Trump's campaign team and the Russian state to help get him elected. Earlier this weekthe New York Times reported that the FBI had opened a counterintelligence inquiryinto whether Mr Trump was secretly working for Russia after he sacked FBI director James Comey in 2017. This alleged inquiry was eventually merged into the Mueller investigation. In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had launched cyber-attacks and planted fake news stories on social media in a bid to boost Mr Trump and damage his rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton ""I'm not keeping anything under wraps,"" Mr Trump told Fox News,externalwhile referring to the latest report. ""I couldn't care less."" He said he had talked in Helsinki to the Russian leader ""like every president does"" and that they had had a ""great"" conversation about ""very positive things"" such as the economy. ""Anybody could have listened to that meeting,"" he said. ""That meeting is open for grabs. The whole Russia thing is a hoax."" The US president said he met one-on-one with many world leaders but the meetings with Mr Putin were all that were focused on. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the story was so outrageously inaccurate it didn't even warrant a response. The paper says Mr Trump concealed details of his conversations with Mr Putin from senior officials in his administration, quoting unnamed current and former US officials. After a meeting with Mr Putin in Hamburg in 2017, Mr Trump took possession of his interpreter's notes, the paper says. In Helsinki, the two presidents spoke behind closed doors for two hours with only their interpreters present. Former officials say this is at odds with practices of previous US presidents. The Washington Post adds that Mr Trump ""generally has allowed aides to listen to his phone conversations with Putin"". Robert Mueller has spent 20 months investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and possible collusion between the Trump's campaign and Moscow. It has already put some of Mr Trump's closest associates in the dock. His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance and fraud crimes while his campaign chief Paul Manafort was convicted of financial fraud. The US president has repeatedly described the inquiry as ""a witch hunt"".

Problem gambling scheme 'too easy to cheat',"Gambling addicts can self-exclude themselves from online betting sites The head of a scheme designed to help problem gamblers says she is ""deeply concerned"" after an investigation found people were able to cheat the system. More than 50,000 people have signed up to GamStop, which was launched in April 2018 to allow addicts to ban themselves from online betting platforms. The BBC found a gambler who had self-referred could still place bets online by simply changing their user details. GamStop's Fiona Palmer admitted the service was not working well enough. The Gambling Commission said it was looking to bring in tougher ID checks. GamStop is a free, independent self-exclusion scheme for people with online gambling problems.

However, by changing a few small details - including misspelling a surname -BBC Radio 5 live Investigatesdiscovered it was still very easy to open a new account and continue gambling, even while banned. Adam Bradford, from Sheffield, only discovered his father David's online gambling problem in 2014, when David was jailed for two years for fraud. He had stolen Â£50,000 from a former employer to fund his all-consuming habit. In total, Mr Bradford lost more than Â£100,000 gambling online. His son now campaigns to raise awareness around the risks of online gambling. As part of the investigation, he registered himself with GamStop. However, a few days later he showed 5 live Investigates how he was able to open a new online betting account by simply using a different email address and changing a letter in his name. He was even offered Â£50 in free bets. Adam Bradford said other people had told him how easy it was to bypass the exclusion system.

Twelve months later, a different BBC producer banned himself from 20 of the same shops in the town and was allowed to place bets in 15 of them.

However, the trade association added that it was encouraged by the results of a survey of genuine participants of the scheme.

'Blind eye' turned to street drug dealingPolice want the public to report sightings and those under the influence of drugs.,"People are ""turning a blind eye"" to drug use and dealing on the streets because it is becoming normalised, a senior police officer has warned. Now communities have been urged to help deal with the rising problem by reporting sightings. Det Insp Stuart Johnson, who covers Swansea and Neath Port Talbot for South Wales Police, said it was one way of tackling ""county lines"" drugs gangs. The two areas are in thetop 10 for heroin deaths in England and Wales. They had more than 4.5 deaths from the drug and morphine per 100,000 people between 2014 and 2016. This video can not be played What is County Lines? County lines sees urban gangs from the likes of London, Liverpool and Birmingham introduce an untraceable phone number in a different area to sell crack cocaine and heroin directly at street level. Local runners - often teenagers - then supply the drugs in these suburban areas, market towns and coastal towns around the UK. The gang often exploits young or vulnerable people to provide locations for drugs to be stored in these new areas, known as cuckooing. Insp Johnson said: ""County lines is a business and unfortunately Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot have a large degree of drug users. ""If there's a demand for the sale of drugs down here, like any business, they will come down here to try to sell some of their goods."" Reality Check: Is UK the 'drugs market of Europe'? County Lines: Why Wales is hit so hard Inside Swansea's drug-injecting community He added: ""It's become normalised seeing a drug user in the street or drug dealing taking place and I think we have to change that attitude in our communities. ""I know communities get frustrated. They say they report things to the police and other agencies and nothing is done about it. ""We try our best to come back to them through the community approach, through our partners to say what we're doing. Police carried out several raids across south Wales as part of the operation, which resulted in 12 being jailed in 2018 ""But this is where communities are key to it. They can't turn a blind eye to it any more. Please phone us. Without the community pulling together, we're fighting a losing battle."" In February last year,a gang of 12 were jailed for up to nine yearsfor a conspiracy for sell heroin and crack cocaine. It followed raids on 80 properties across south Wales involving more than 600 officers. More than half of the 67 arrests came from the Swansea and Neath areas. Insp Johnson said the focus was on catching dealers and the force had ""dramatically"" changed they way it deals with users. He said: ""They are victims first and we'll treat them as victims first.

Mayor dies on scuba-diving holidayNigel Gawthrope collapsed in South Africa after surfacing from a dive and feeling unwell.Cambridgeshire,"Nigel Gawthrope was a popular figure in Cambridge The mayor of Cambridge has died suddenly while on a scuba-diving holiday with his wife in South Africa. Nigel Gawthrope, 61, collapsed on Friday after surfacing from a dive and feeling unwell. The exact cause of his death is unknown. The city councillor was a popular local figure and had been eight months into his term of office. Council leader Lewis Herbert said he served ""with distinction and panache"". A keen scuba diver and underwater photographer, Mr Gawthrope was on holiday at a diving resort near Durban with his wife, Jenny. Mr Gawthrope was a keen scuba diver and underwater photographer (file picture) Mr Gawthrope was a prolific charity fundraiser and worked at the Cambridge University Press, Judge Business School - and latterly as a porter at Clare College, Cambridge. He was particularly proud of his association with the Cambridge children's charity, theRed Hen Project,external. He was also a long-standing member of the Unite union and acted as a representative and delegate. Mr Gawthrope was elected to Cambridge City Council serving King's Hedges ward for Labour in 2012 - and again in 2016 - before taking up the mayoral role in May. Mr Herbert, leader of the city's 26 Labour councillors, said: ""Our thoughts and emotions are with his wife Jenny so far away, and with Nigel's family and close friends at this truly horrible time.

"Call for clarity on UK-Swiss Brexit dealQuestions over trade with Switzerland and 70 other countries remain unanswered, a senior MP says.UK Politics","Ministers must clarify the UK's post-Brexit relationship with Switzerland and up to 70 non-EU countries, a Commons committee chairman has said. SNP MP Angus MacNeil said the ""most basic questions"" about the relationship remained unanswered. Last month, International Trade Secretary Liam Foxannounced a deal to allow British and Swiss businesses to continue trading freely after Brexit,external. The deal matches current arrangements ""as far as possible"", ministers say. Mr MacNeil, chairman of the international trade committee, raises the prospect that the freedom of movement of people - which is currently a condition of the deal between the EU and Switzerland - would have to be accepted by the UK. May: Brexit failure risks trust in democracy Lord Hattersley calls for another referendum I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? He is also seeking clarification on what aspect of the current relationship with Switzerland are replicated and whether the agreement will allow UK-based firms to continue trading into Switzerland on the ""same basis as they do today"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. A crunch vote in the Commons on the prime minister's withdrawal deal takes place on Tuesday. Last month, the government announced that it had approved the transition of a trade agreement with the Swiss Federal Council that will come into effect in January 2021 or on 29 March this year if the UK leaves the EU with no deal. Switzerland is not a member of the EU but is part of the bloc's single market. By Joe Miller, BBC business correspondent Member states of the European Union don't just benefit from trading freely among themselves. Over the years, Brussels has negotiated almost 40 agreements with dozens of countries around the world, including Mexico and South Korea, to bring down tariffs and reduce regulatory barriers - making it easier for goods and services to cross borders. The UK currently trades using those agreements, and last year, Mr Fox told the BBC that he hoped Britain would replicate all of those agreements after Brexit, and that 70 countries had already agreed to do so, in principle. In December, Mr Fox told parliament of his first triumph - an approved deal with Switzerland. But few details of that deal have been provided, and the chairman of the international trade committee's concern over the accord points to a larger problem. All 39-odd agreements need to pass through parliament - and if they are to be ready for a possible no-deal Brexit on 29 March, that leaves just 11 weeks to avoid disruption to much of British business. In a letter to Mr Fox, Mr MacNeil called for clarification on the UK's future trade relationship with Switzerland. Commenting on his letter, Mr MacNeil said: ""Switzerland's access to the single market requires it to accept both freedom of movement and a significant proportion of EU law. ""It is based not only on a trade agreement eliminating tariffs, but also on a myriad of other trade-related agreements. ""Blithe assurances of progress will simply not suffice as the clock ticks down to Brexit on 29 March."" Mr MacNeil added that the government was running out of time to adopt the ""other 39 or so existing EU trade agreements"".

It was an amazing second half, I am so pleased. ""Sometimes you win a game and you are disappointed, like when we won 3-0 at Old Trafford. They were better than us that day. Today the result should be different and I am happy. That is the way that we want to grow and play. Taking risks, playing football that we are going to play. The team was fantastic, that is the best 45 minutes I have seen Tottenham play since I took charge. ""There were 11 saves from De Gea who was outstanding. He fully deserved to be man of the match.

Kane twisted his ankle and we hope that it is not a big issue."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Reezy Renzel:This Utd team will be found out eventually. Completely outclassed by Spurs.

If we were talking Premier League goals, that's as many as Alan Shearer + Steven Gerrard + Robbie Savage... Manchester United Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea to BBC Sport:""It was very good, especially at Wembley, three very important points. ""All of the saves are important, especially if we win the game. I am very happy with my performance. The team is playing very well, creating chances and playing more attacking football. ""We had three clean sheets in a row which is very good. The players are happy, you can see that on the pitch, they play with passion, like Manchester United. ""We still believe we can finish in the top four, we are United, we have good players and we are fighting to finish in the top four."" Tottenham Hotspur Mauricio Pochettino on Harry Kane's injury:""My worry is that it was a bad tackle in the last moment. It wasn't the intention of the United player but it was a bad tackle and now he has bit of a swelling on his ankle and he was limping after the game. ""We are going to lose Son for the Asia Cup and if Harry Kane suffers an injury, it is going to be massive for us."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) It was a lucky Man U rather than a game plan. On another day Spurs with a little luck 3 or 4 of those chances would have gone in. Simply Man U were lucky and didn't deserve to win. Colin Never seen a more one sided game where the better team didn't win. Steven Spurs huffed and puffed but never really laid a glove on us. Couple of standard saves for De Gea but all things considered a comfortable win. Top four now in sight. Alan, Seaton Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told Sky Sports:""I am so pleased and I'm proud. After four-and-a-half-years, the second half was the best performance I have seen Tottenham play. It was amazing and I think David de Gea made 11 saves which is unbelievable. In football, sometimes you deserve to win and don't and other times, you do not and you win. That is why we love football. ""We dominated in the first half but we didn't organised ourselves well when we lost Moussa Sissoko and that is how we conceded the goal. United were deeper in the second half, but to play against that system it was amazing to create 11 chances in the second half. I feel so proud and I am leaving Wembley with a good feeling. ""We conceded a counter attack in the first half but the second was the best performance I have seen. We were not clinical and sometimes you score with less opportunities but it is nothing to complain about. The team played unbelievable football and everyone who watched the game can feel the same as myself."" Mauricio Pochettino says he is ""worried"" that Harry Kane might have an injury. Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd Manchester United Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r told Sky Sports:""Results wise, to come away here and beat Tottenham is fantastic. We hung on in the second half and we never got to grips with it when they changed the system, but you are allowed to have a good goalkeeper. ""When you have the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, and the cleverness of Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard, the plan was to attack with pace. Marcus took his goal brilliantly and the pass from Paul was half of the goal. ""We have seen Spurs play and we thought that would be the right plan and it's good we have different plans for different teams. I thought we showed we were here to compete, in particular, the first half."" On David de Gea's performance:""Fantastic. Obviously when you make 11 saves it is a top performance, but even so, two of them were top saves but the rest you would expect David to make. We defended well as a team and when you play against Harry Kane you are always going to be tested. It was just a complete team performance.

Manchester United Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaerto BBC Sport: ""We could have scored a few as well but we had a good back four and David de Gea in behind them was unbelievable. ""When you have pace up front and Jesse Lingard is so clever in between the lines the goal was great - it was something we worked on. ""We created enough chances to put the game away on the break, but if you don't score you will be under pressure. We defended fantastically. ""De Gea - he should have held a couple! I've played with a few fantatsic goalkeepers, we have a tradition of having them and he has grown and grown, he deserves that man of the match today. ""You expect to win every single game at Man United. You won't, but you must go in thinking that.

The best example is Frank Lampard."" Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham defender Ben Davies told Sky Sports:""David de Gea has pulled off three or four brilliant saves, and on another day, they go on. It is disappointing but it wasn't the worst performance. The boys up front are slotting them away most weeks, but today it wasn't their day. ""United were well organised and they tried to play on the counter and perhaps we were a bit open at times. We tightened up in the second half and created more chances.

Fugitive militant arrested 'with fake beard',"Italy has made repeated extradition requests for Cesare Battisti A former communist militant who Brazil's new president had vowed to extradite has been detained in Bolivia, a Brazilian official said. Italian Cesare Battisti is wanted for four murders in Italy during the 1970s, which he denies committing. Battisti spent years in Brazil as a refugee, backed by former left-wing President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. But far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office on 1 January, had pledged to send him back to Italy. Filipe Martins, a senior aide on international affairs to President Bolsonaro, tweeted that Battisti ""will be soon brought to Brazil, from where he will probably be sent to Italy to serve a life sentence"". Brazilian politician Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the president's sons, tweeted to Italy's interior minister Matteo Salvini: ""Brazil is no longer a land of bandits. The ""little gift"" is coming.""

An arrest warrant had been issued for Battisti in December, when Brazil's former President Michel Temer revoked his status as a permanent resident. The 64-year-old went on the run, and both his lawyer and the police told the BBC they had no idea of his whereabouts. Bolsonaro: the Trump of the Tropics? Meet Brazil's unlikely president Brazil country profile Battisti, who has a five-year-old Brazilian son, told AFP last year he would face ""torture"" and death if he returned to Italy. He was arrested by a special Interpol team formed by Italian investigators, Italian paper Corriere della Sera reports. He was wearing sunglasses and a fake beard at the time of his capture, the paper said. In December, Brazil's Federal Police had released a picture showing possible disguises that Battisti might use. Brazilian police sources told local media Battisti was found in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. In 1979, Battisti was convicted of belonging to a far-left terrorist group outlawed in Italy - the Armed Proletarians for Communism (PAC). He escaped from prison in 1981. Later, he was convicted in absentia for killing two Italian law officials, for taking part in a separate murder, and for planning another which left the victim's 14-year-old son in a wheelchair after a shoot-out. Battisti has admitted being part of the PAC but denies responsibility for the murders. Since his escape, he has gone on to became a successful writer of police novels. Battisti lived in France and Mexico before escaping to Brazil to avoid being extradited. He was arrested by Brazilian authorities in 2007, prompting the Italian government to request his extradition under an existing bilateral treaty. But Brazil's then president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva granted Mr Battisti refugee status in 2010, a move that drew strong criticism from Italy. Battisti was arrested again in 2017for carrying a large amount of undeclared cash whilst trying to cross into Bolivia from Brazil. Mr Bolsonaro made his intentions clear in October 2018, tweeting (in Portuguese and Italian),external: ""Here I reaffirm my commitment to extradite the terrorist Cesare Battisti, loved by the Brazilian left...

Missing Farc leader re-appears on video,"IvÃ¡n MÃ¡rquez (left) spent four years negotiating the peace deal with Colombia's government A former commander of Colombia's Farc rebel group, IvÃ¡n MÃ¡rquez, has released a video six months after going into hiding. In the film, he accuses the government of betraying the terms of the historic peace agreement signed in 2016. He says 400 community leaders and 85 former fighters have been killed since the peace accord was signed . Mr MÃ¡rquez led the Farc's negotiating team in the talks, which were held in Cuba and lasted four years. The Farc always said that it feared reprisals from those who opposed the peace process. In April, one of its most senior leaders, JesÃºs Santrich, was arrestedat the request of the United States, accused of drug trafficking. Soon after that, Mr MÃ¡rquez resigned from his seat in the Colombian Senate and went into hiding. Mr MÃ¡rquez does not reveal his whereabouts during the 12-minute video, which he prepared for the 24th International Rosa Luxemburg Conference in Berlin. The Farc, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, is now a political partyknown as the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force with five seats in the Senate and five in the House of Representatives. Mr MÃ¡rquez said the left-wing group had made a crucial mistake during the final phase of the negotiations: ""We agreed to lay down our weapons before securing an agreement on the political, economic and social integration of the fighters.""

But the former commander, whose real name is Luciano MarÃ­n, said he remained committed to peace and to the full implementation of the agreement. ""On 24 November 2016 it was signed in Havana the final agreement to end the conflict and to bring about stable and lasting peace,"" he said. ""Only two years later, the results in terms of implementation by the government are disheartening."" The government of President IvÃ¡n Duque says it is taking steps to increase security for former rebels. Mr Duque, a vocal critic of the peace deal, took office in August. He replaced Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the agreement with the Farc, which put an end to more than five decades of conflict. A week ago the United Nations chief, AntÃ³nio Guterres, urged President Duque to do more to protect former rebels.

Chinese coal miners die in roof collapse,"At least 21 miners died when a roof collapsed in a coal mine in northern China, officials say. Sixty-six miners were rescued after the accident on Saturday at the Lijiagou mine near the city of Shenmu in Shaanxi province. The cause of the collapse is under investigation, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Mining accidents in China are quite common despite efforts to improve safety. The Lijiagou mine is operated by the Baiji Mining Company, Xinhua said. No further details of the incident were available. Last October, 21 coal miners were killed when an underground rock fall blocked a shaft in eastern Shandong province. According to the latest figures from China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, there were 375 deaths in coal mines in 2017, a fall of about 28% on the previous year. In a statement last January, the bureau said the ""situation of coal mine safety production is still grim"" despite improvements.

US 'hopeful' on deal to protect Kurds,"The US has an estimated 2,000 troops in northern Syria US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he is optimistic an agreement can be reached with Turkey to protect Kurdish fighters in Syria after the US leaves. He was speaking in the United Arab Emirates following a phone call with his Turkish counterpart. US forces in northern Syria have fought alongside a Kurdish militia against Islamic State (IS) militants. Turkey, however, regards the People's Protection Units (YPG) as a terrorist group and has vowed to crush it. Mr Pompeo is touring the Middle East to try to reassure allies following President Donald Trump's abrupt announcement last month that US forces would withdraw from Syria. War-weary Syrians in Manbij wait to learn fate Trump rewrites US-Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Talking to reporters in Abu Dhabi, Mr Pompeo said the US recognised ""the Turkish people's right and [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan's right to defend their country from terrorists"". ""We also know that those fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected as well,"" he said. Mike Pompeo was greeted by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan during his Middle East tour Mr Pompeo said he had spoken to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, adding: ""Many details (are) still to be worked out but I'm optimistic that we can achieve a good outcome."" Last week, President Erdogan angrily rejected calls by US National Security Adviser John Bolton for the Kurdish fighters to be protected. He said such statements were ""unacceptable"". President Erdogan has threatened a military assault to defeat the YPG in northern Syria Mr Erdogan told MPs from his governing Justice and Development Party that the US did not know who the various Kurdish groups were, adding: ""If the US evaluates them as 'Kurdish brothers' then they are in a serious delusion."" Mr Bolton was on a visit to Ankara to seek guarantees over the Kurdish fighters, but President Erdogan declined to meet him. Turkey considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct organisational links to the PKK. Analysis by Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Riyadh This dispute with Turkey over America's Kurdish allies has overshadowed Mr Pompeo's sweeping Middle East trip. Mr Pompeo really wants to turn the focus to countering Iran. He is calling for a united Arab front against what he describes as its destabilising activity and Saudi Arabia is key to that. But outrage overthe Saudi murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggihas complicated the relationship. A senior US official said the Americans wanted the Saudis to give a more credible explanation of what happened and do more to punish the killers, and Mr Pompeo would press them on both points. In 2014, militants overran 100,000 sq km (39,000 sq miles) of Syria and neighbouring Iraq, and imposed their brutal rule on almost 8 million people. Now, they control only 1% of the territory they once had. This video can not be played Is this the Islamic State group's last stand in Syria? However, the defeat of IS is far from final. A US defence department report estimated in August that there might be as many as 14,000 jihadists left in Syria and 17,000 in Iraq. President Trump consequently shocked allies and faced strong criticism at home last month when he ordered US forces to immediately begin withdrawing from the approximately 30% of Syria controlled by the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. Mr Bolton later laid out several conditions for the withdrawal, which suggested that the four-month schedule agreed by Mr Trump could slip. He told reporters in Israel that it would be done in a way that guaranteed IS ""is defeated and is not able to revive itself"", and that the US would ""take care of those who have fought with us against [IS] and other terrorist groups"". About 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be deployed in Syria. Ground troops first arrived in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise YPG fighters. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? The US did this after several attempts at training and arming Syrian Arab rebel groups to battle IS militants descended into chaos. Over the intervening years the number of US troops in Syria has increased, and a network of bases and airfields has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country.

Three skiers die in Austrian Alps avalanche,"Austria has seen record snowfall this week, raising avalanche warnings (file picture) Three men have been killed in an avalanche near the Austrian ski resort of Lech am Arlberg, local police say. The search for a fourth person, declared as missing, had to be halted due to the ongoing avalanche risk. The group came from southern Germany and were reported missing by one of their wives on Saturday night. In France, two employees at the Morillon ski resort died when the avalanche-control charges they were trying to set accidentally went off. The accident took place at an altitude of 1,800m (6,000ft) as the two men were preparing the pistes ahead of their opening with an avalanche prevention programme, mountain rescuers said. Weather forecasters had warned of a high risk of avalanches in the Savoie and Haute-Savoie regions following fresh overnight snowfall. Snow brings parts of Europe to standstill The three dead German men, aged 32, 36 and 57, were found at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Police in the western province of Vorarlberg said they were located through mobile phone tracking,external, near the Langer Zug slope - one of the steepest in the world. It had been closed due to dangerous conditions. The men were wearing touring skis, which are used to climb uphill slopes and ski off-piste. The three victims bring the number of weather-related deaths in parts of Europe this month to at least 24, the Associated Press news agency reports.

'Blind eye' turned to street drug dealing,"People are ""turning a blind eye"" to drug use and dealing on the streets because it is becoming normalised, a senior police officer has warned. Now communities have been urged to help deal with the rising problem by reporting sightings. Det Insp Stuart Johnson, who covers Swansea and Neath Port Talbot for South Wales Police, said it was one way of tackling ""county lines"" drugs gangs. The two areas are in thetop 10 for heroin deaths in England and Wales. They had more than 4.5 deaths from the drug and morphine per 100,000 people between 2014 and 2016. This video can not be played What is County Lines? County lines sees urban gangs from the likes of London, Liverpool and Birmingham introduce an untraceable phone number in a different area to sell crack cocaine and heroin directly at street level. Local runners - often teenagers - then supply the drugs in these suburban areas, market towns and coastal towns around the UK. The gang often exploits young or vulnerable people to provide locations for drugs to be stored in these new areas, known as cuckooing. Insp Johnson said: ""County lines is a business and unfortunately Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot have a large degree of drug users. ""If there's a demand for the sale of drugs down here, like any business, they will come down here to try to sell some of their goods."" Reality Check: Is UK the 'drugs market of Europe'? County Lines: Why Wales is hit so hard Inside Swansea's drug-injecting community He added: ""It's become normalised seeing a drug user in the street or drug dealing taking place and I think we have to change that attitude in our communities. ""I know communities get frustrated. They say they report things to the police and other agencies and nothing is done about it. ""We try our best to come back to them through the community approach, through our partners to say what we're doing. Police carried out several raids across south Wales as part of the operation, which resulted in 12 being jailed in 2018 ""But this is where communities are key to it. They can't turn a blind eye to it any more. Please phone us. Without the community pulling together, we're fighting a losing battle."" In February last year,a gang of 12 were jailed for up to nine yearsfor a conspiracy for sell heroin and crack cocaine. It followed raids on 80 properties across south Wales involving more than 600 officers. More than half of the 67 arrests came from the Swansea and Neath areas. Insp Johnson said the focus was on catching dealers and the force had ""dramatically"" changed they way it deals with users. He said: ""They are victims first and we'll treat them as victims first. ""Every case is on its own merits, but we want to help people first. We want to target the drug dealers more than the actual users.""

""Here's to more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world."" One year later, the music industry seems to have taken note, with female artists dominating the shortlist for 2019's ceremony. Dua is up for four awards, including best single for One Kiss; tying with pop star Anne-Marie as the year's most-nominated artist. And for only the second time in Brit Awards history, more women than men are up for the night's biggest prize, album of the year. Former winner Florence + The Machine is joined by newcomers Jorja Smith and Anne-Marie in that category; with singer-songwriter George Ezra and pop group The 1975 completing the shortlist. Brit Awards 2019: Full list of nominees Brits 2018: The real winners and losers Stormzy steals the show at Brit Awards Dua Lipa UK's most-streamed female Ezra is undoubtedly the strongest contender: His feel-good second album, Staying At Tamara's, was the biggest-selling new release of 2018, and the music industry will be keen to underline his arrival as one of Britain's biggest talents. The 25-year-old is also up for best male and best single, for his summer anthem Shotgun. ""It's a bit nerve-wracking,"" said the star on ITV's nominations show The Brits Are Coming.

Best male is one of the stranger categories this year, with a belated nomination for Sam Smith, who was snubbed at last year's ceremony, and another for Peckham MC Giggs, who hasn't released any new material since 2017. With the other nominations going to dance artist Aphex Twin and R&B star Craig David, the category is Ezra's to lose. The shortlist for best female will be more hotly contested, with multiple nominees Jorja Smith, Anne-Marie, Jess Glynne and Florence + The Machine joined by Lily Allen, whose confessional, heartbreaking fourth album No Shame was one of 2018's most surprising and welcome comebacks. Arctic Monkeys may have been overlooked in the best album category, but they will be firm favourites for best group; where they square off against last year's winners Gorillaz, pop architects Years & Years, Matty Healy's The 1975 and girl group Little Mix - who receive the ninth nomination of their career.

The Lijiagou mine is operated by the Baiji Mining Company, Xinhua said. No further details of the incident were available. Last October, 21 coal miners were killed when an underground rock fall blocked a shaft in eastern Shandong province. According to the latest figures from China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, there were 375 deaths in coal mines in 2017, a fall of about 28% on the previous year. In a statement last January, the bureau said the ""situation of coal mine safety production is still grim"" despite improvements.

Kuenssberg: Could May win?,"""We're going to get smashed"" - one government insider's apocalyptic prediction about one of the most important votes in recent political history, the big night next Tuesday when MPs give their verdict on the government and the EU's compromise. As things stand, MPs are on course to kybosh Theresa May's long-argued-over Brexit deal, with a very heavy defeat. Dozens of her own backbenchers have said publicly they will vote against it. The opposition parties are adamant they will say ""no"" too. The Tories' supposed partners in government, the DUP, are deeply dug-in to opposing the agreement, for reasons we've discussed plenty of times here. Japan PM: World against no-deal Brexit May calls union leaders over Brexit deal Corbyn calls for election over Brexit And although there are whispers of compromises that might peel off a few rebels here and there and a handful of switchers - like her former policy chief George Freemanwho revealed his change of heart,externalin the Commons and will now back her - there is nothing on the horizon that looks like shifting big numbers. The draft script for Tuesday's drama, therefore, outlines a heavy and embarrassing defeat for the prime minister on her central policy, with nothing and no-one seeming to come to her rescue. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe met Theresa May for talks on Thursday But there are at least two factors that could change the dynamics, quite separate to the chorus of warnings about no deal from members of the Cabinet and outside voices like theJapanese leader Shinzo Abe. First off, with any rebellion it's not a bad rule of thumb to suggest that many of those who have made loud complaints may, in the end, prove to be less brave than they at first appear. It is not unusual for cantankerous politicians to be proven to have had rather a lot of mouth - and rather threadbare trousers. One senior Brexiteer told me they reckoned they had around 40 or 50 critics solid and certain to vote to reject the deal, far fewer than the hundred or so publicly opposed. Parliament seems in such uproar that perhaps the numbers will be as high as the most dire warnings suggest. But don't be surprised when MPs actually have to make a final decision and go through the division lobbies with their deadly rivals, if the scale of the defeat looks rather different. Casting a vote, especially one so vital, is very, very different to criticising a policy. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Second, we're not exactly short these days of twists in Parliamentary drama. And there could be another one next Tuesday. Other tweaks, amendments, might be suggested by MPs, and voted on first. The way this place works, if any of those ideas are approved, that would change what's on the table - maybe a little, maybe a lot. That means, despite the months of rows about the precise terms of the agreement, there might not be a vote on Theresa May's deal in its original form. This could be something relatively minor, although important to some MPs, like the increased environmental protections the PM has discussed with Labour MPs. Or, much bigger, an amendment that kills the deal off altogether. Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Brexit and the timetable for a 'Plan B' Still with me? Politically, what happens with the other ideas backbenchers put forward, before the expected vote on the deal as it stands, might matter enormously. That's because a defeat on the plan as amended, might be much smaller than a defeat on the deal with no changes. For Theresa May's authority, losing by a few dozen, is very different to losing by way over 100. That might, in turn, make it seem much more credible for the prime minister to have another go at getting it through. Will Hilary Benn's amendment go to the vote? And it also will matter who the main architects of the defeat appear to be. Government sources warning of being ""smashed"" in the Commons suggest the best outcome for them is, perversely, losing on an amendment, therefore avoiding a straightforward and overwhelming ""no"" to their deal. Some Brexiteers and some in government believe that that the Labour MP Hilary Benn's suggested change - that would reject the deal, and rule out no deal - could be voted through by MPs, because of support from former Remainers. And a narrow defeat at the hands of Remainers would be a totally different political beast to a heavy, heavy defeat at the hands of Brexiteers in their own party. One well-known member of the Conservative Eurosceptic group the ERG joked: ""We may not even end up being the bad guys - we might not have to rebel."" It's possible that Hilary Benn will pull that particular amendment, with talk of a different ""no deal"" amendment being put forward. And one senior Labour figure suggested the party would do almost anything to make sure that there is a clear vote on the prime minister's proposal and that Parliamentary shenanigans don't get in the way of the Commons giving a definite view, (they expect a total kicking), of Theresa May's plan. But as we head into these next few vital days, the point is that the serious games in the Commons are far from over. And what happens this time next week will be affected by precisely how Tuesday night plays out. In the wake of the likely defeat, Theresa May might make an emergency dash to Brussels, could pivot to a ""plan B"" or a series of emergency cross-party talks. But the actual numbers, the atmosphere once the tellers have actually counted the votes and who walks through which lobby will still shape what she does next.

Hattersley in referendum call,"Lord Hattersley has said that leaving the European Union would be a ""disaster"" Former Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley has said he supports another Brexit referendum ""very strongly"". The politician said Britons have ""a right"" to have their say on Theresa May's Brexit deal, which goes to a vote in the Commons on Tuesday. A People's Vote event has been held in Sheffield, with Dame Margaret Beckett and Sir Vince Cable speaking. Lord Hattersley said those who voted to leave the EU had ""no idea"" what that would mean. Former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton has also said thatthe UK's approach to Brexit meant it had decided to ""tear up"" the Good Friday Agreement. Blocking Brexit could cause ""far-right surge"" Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Lord Hattersley, 86, who was due to speak at the rally but pulled out due to illness, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think the British people have a right to cast a vote on the merits of the package Mrs May has negotiated. ""They voted by a small majority to leave the union, but they had no idea what leaving the union meant. ""We now know how bad it will be. We now know that it will be much worse than remaining in, and that the British people have a right to express a view on whether they want to remain in or they want to leave."" He added that ""sometimes, you just have to do what is right"", rather than looking at what ""wins elections"" and possibly at the risk of losing Labour supporters. No deal would be the worst possible scenario and needed to be avoided, said Lord Hattersley, who previously said that leaving the European Union would be a ""disaster"". The peer, a minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, added that he did not think a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for - would happen. MPs are widely expected to reject Mrs May's deal on Tuesday, negotiated between the EU and UK, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those expected to vote against it. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules.

But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling earliertold the Daily Mail,externalthat not leaving the EU would cause the 17 million people who voted for Brexit to feel ""cheated"". He said blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism. Lord Hattersley dismissed those comments, saying not many would regard Mr Grayling as ""an expert in these matters"". Pro-EU former Conservative minister Anna Soubry also criticised Mr Grayling's comments as ""irresponsible nonsense"". David Lammy, a Labour former minister, said it was ""a desperate attempt by a government minister to use a tiny far-right minority to hold our democracy to ransom"", adding: ""It is gutter politics."" An anti-austerity march took place in central London, ending with a rally in Trafalgar Square Ms Soubry was also among those at the Sheffield rally. Lord Hattersley had been due to say that the ""vast majority"" of Labour members want the party to campaign for a new Brexit referendum if hopes of an early general election are extinguished. He was to say that ""no conceivable deal which is remotely as beneficial to Great Britain as full membership of the European Union"" and that young people would pay the price for Brexit. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have been attending an anti-austerity march in central London. The event was organised by The People's Assembly Against Austerity, with speakers including shadow chancellor John McDonnell. People gathered outside the BBC's New Broadcasting House before marching to Trafalgar Square,many wearing yellow vests- which national organiser Ramona McCartney said was to show ""solidarity with the left and working class in France"". France has seen weeks of anti-austerity demonstrations by those wearing the vests, known as the ""gilets jaunes"" movement. Addressing protesters in Trafalgar Square, Labour's John McDonnell said eight years of austerity was ""tearing apart the very social fabric"" of the UK. He said when ""the time is right"", his party will move a motion of no confidence in the government. He read a message from Mr Corbyn, saying a general election was needed to bring about a ""fairer, more equal society"". An anti-austerity protest also took place in Belfast city centre. Separately, there was a march in central London which was broadly pro-Brexit, BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said, but smaller than the anti-austerity rally, with between 200 and 300 attending.

Grayling warns over 'blocking' Brexit,"Blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism in the UK, a cabinet minister has said. Transport Secretary Chris Graylingtold the Daily Mail,externalthat not leaving the EU would cause the 17 million people who voted for Brexit to feel ""cheated"".

Some ministers have warned the UK faces Brexit ""paralysis"" if this happens. Just days before the critical vote, Mr Grayling, who campaigned to leave the EU, told the Daily Mail there would be a ""different tone"" in British politics if the UK failed to leave the EU, and predicted a ""less tolerant society"" and a ""more nationalistic nation"". ""It will open the door to extremist populist political forces in this country of the kind we see in other countries in Europe,"" Mr Grayling told the paper. ""If MPs who represent seats that voted 70% to leave say 'sorry guys, we're still going to have freedom of movement', they will turn against the political mainstream,"" he added. ""There's already a nastiness and unpleasantness in our politics, more people with extreme views, more people willing to behave in an uncivilised way,"" he said.

Scotland's prisons 'bursting at seams',"HMP Barlinnie in Glasgow is one of the jails operating over capacity according to new figures Scotland's prisons are ""bursting at the seams"" as new figures show the majority were at, or over, capacity last month. HMP Barlinnie in Glasgow was operating at 139% capacity in December while HMP Inverness was at 137%. Scottish Liberal Democrats' justice spokesman Liam McArthur warned that inmates were being ""packed into prisons like sardines"". The Scottish government said it was focused on stopping people going to prison in the first place. The figures were revealed following a parliamentary question from the Lib Dems. Other sites at, or exceeding, their prisoner limit were Addiewell, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Glenochil, Kilmarnock, Perth and Shotts. Five prisons out of 15 were at, or beyond, their capacity at the start of 2018 - the figure rose to nine by the end of the year. Parts of prison 'not fit for purpose' Call to end 12-month prison sentences Overcrowding warning over Scottish female prison plans Those operating within their capacity last month were Cornton Vale, Grampian, Greenock, Low Moss, Polmont and Castle Huntly. Mr McArthur said: ""These new figures show that our prisons are bursting at the seams with the majority now full or overcrowded. People are being packed in like sardines. ""Those working in prisons have warned that the population surge is putting services at risk and jeopardising progress. ""Prison capacities are set for a reason. Staff need to work in a safe environment. ""Overcrowding makes it harder for them to work with individuals and help rehabilitate them."" Mr McArthur also criticised short-term sentences, saying evidence showed they were less effective at rehabilitation than ""robust"" community-based sentences, which would reduce the pressure on jails. He added: ""That is why the Scottish government now must get on and introduce a presumption against short-term sentences of less than 12 months. ""Ministers need to urgently ease the pressure on our prison system and change the way we deal with less serious offenders to make our communities safer."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland has the highest rate of incarceration per 100,000 of population of any Western European country, which is why we are focused on action to stop people going to prison in the first place. ""Our approach to reducing reoffending has seen reoffending rates drop to a 19-year low, and we are committed this year to extending the presumption against short prison sentences in favour of more effective community penalties.""

Flaws exposed in self-help betting scheme,"Gambling addicts can self-exclude themselves from online betting sites The head of a scheme designed to help problem gamblers says she is ""deeply concerned"" after an investigation found people were able to cheat the system. More than 50,000 people have signed up to GamStop, which was launched in April 2018 to allow addicts to ban themselves from online betting platforms. The BBC found a gambler who had self-referred could still place bets online by simply changing their user details. GamStop's Fiona Palmer admitted the service was not working well enough. The Gambling Commission said it was looking to bring in tougher ID checks. GamStop is a free, independent self-exclusion scheme for people with online gambling problems. Gamblers register their details and choose how long they want to be banned for. They should then not be able to logon to gambling websites. This video can not be played 5 Live Investigates has found serious flaws in scheme designed to help problem gamblers. However, by changing a few small details - including misspelling a surname -BBC Radio 5 live Investigatesdiscovered it was still very easy to open a new account and continue gambling, even while banned. Adam Bradford, from Sheffield, only discovered his father David's online gambling problem in 2014, when David was jailed for two years for fraud. He had stolen Â£50,000 from a former employer to fund his all-consuming habit. In total, Mr Bradford lost more than Â£100,000 gambling online. His son now campaigns to raise awareness around the risks of online gambling. As part of the investigation, he registered himself with GamStop. However, a few days later he showed 5 live Investigates how he was able to open a new online betting account by simply using a different email address and changing a letter in his name. He was even offered Â£50 in free bets. Adam Bradford said other people had told him how easy it was to bypass the exclusion system. ""I think it's scandalous - it means the hundreds of thousands of betting addicts across the country are not being protected. The industry is putting up what I think is a facade. It doesn't work,"" he added. Adam Bradford campaigns to raise gambling awareness after his father, David, suffered problems When presented with the findings, the chief executive of GamStop, Ms Palmer said: ""We are taking on board the feedback and we are looking to improve the scheme"". The Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry, has said it will soon announce the results of a consultation on using ID verification, which would prevent customers gambling using incorrect details on online gambling sites. BBC Radio 5 live Investigates also found that the self-exclusion scheme for High Street bookmakers is seriously flawed. Last year,a 5 live producer excluded himselffrom 21 betting shops in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, using the Multi-Operator Self Exclusion Scheme (MOSES). However, he was still able to bet in 19 of them. The operators of the scheme, the Senet Group, said lessons would be learned. Twelve months later, a different BBC producer banned himself from 20 of the same shops in the town and was allowed to place bets in 15 of them. The Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) said it was ""disappointed"" with the findings. However, the trade association added that it was encouraged by the results of a survey of genuine participants of the scheme. The ABB said anindependent survey carried out by charity GambleAware,externalfound that ""83% said that it had been effective in reducing or stopping their gambling activity and 71% said they have not attempted to use their nominated betting shops since signing up"". This video can not be played Sarah Grant, from Cardiff, talks about her battle with addiction The Senet Group, which uses funding from bookmakers to run the scheme, said ""the results of this investigation are disappointing"" but insisted MOSES is an ""important first step for people who genuinely want to reduce their gambling"". However, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said the investigation demonstrated the two schemes ""aren't fit for purpose"". He promised to take the BBC's findings to the government. Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs on gambling-related harm added: ""Any system which is easily manipulated like this is not worth it - they have to be robust enough to withstand deliberate attempts to get around them.""

World's longest aircraft grounded,"This video can not be played A helicopter captured footage of the Airlander 10 prototype's maiden flight in August 2016 The world's longest aircraft is to go into full production with a model that will take its first paying passengers. It comes after the prototype Â£32m Airlander 10 - a combined plane and airship - was formally retired following successful final testing. As a result, Bedford firm Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) has been given Production Organisation Approval from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Airlander 10 hit the headlines in 2017, when the prototype collapsed. An eyewitness said the aircraft appeared to ""break in two"" after breaking its moorings and deflating, in November that year, less than 24 hours after completing its sixth successful test flight. The firm was given Design Organisation Approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) in October. The Airlander collapsed on 18 November 2017 Stephen McGlennan, HAV's chief executive, said 2018 had been very good, with Easa's backing a ""huge highlight"". He said the firm had changed its focus last year towards the production of Airlander 10 as a commercial aircraft for customers. ""The prototype served its purpose as the world's first full-sized hybrid aircraft, providing us with the data we needed to move forward from prototype to production standard,"" he said. It is now hoped the full commercial model will take to the skies with its first paying passengers ""in the early 2020s"". World's longest aircraft collapses Williams 'blasting' music to torment Page Man held after boy dies in hit-and-run HAV submitted a Â£32m insurance claim after the prototype crash, telling its shareholders this was the ""maximum insured value"". Airlander 10 was originally based at Cardington Airfield Approval from the CAA and Easa now puts the firm in a ""strong position to launch production"". HAV carried out its first test flight of Airlander 10 from its former home at Cardington Airfield in August 2016 but left the site in June last year. In July, it revealed it planned to offer ""luxury expeditions"" once all tests were successfully completed. CORRECTION: This article has been revised to make it clear the prototype of Airlander 10 has been withdrawn after successfully completing final testing.  It also clarifies that Hybrid Air Vehicles has been given the required certification from all air authorities to begin full commercial production of its aircraft.

PM warns of 'breach of trust' on Brexit,"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was questioned by Andrew Marr on whether the government is prepared for no deal The government has made a fresh plea to MPs to get behind Theresa May's Brexit deal in Tuesday's crucial Commons vote. No 10 says it is alarmed byreports MPs,externalplan to take control of Brexit if Mrs May's deal is voted down, although a leading Tory rebel denies such a move. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to table a vote of no confidence in the government if she loses, which could trigger a general election. The PM has warned of a ""catastrophic"" breach of trust if Brexit is thwarted. Writing in the Sunday Express,external, Mrs May told MPs: ""It is time to forget the games and do what is right for our country."" Kuenssberg: What's next if MPs reject May's deal? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide About 100 Conservative MPs, and the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs, are currently expected to join Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the deal. What is likely to happen next: Monday- Day four of MPs' Brexit debate Tuesday- Day five of debate followed by ""meaningful vote"" on the PM's deal. MPs will also get to vote on amendments that could reshape the deal If the deal is rejected Theresa May will get three working days to come up with a ""plan B"" Wednesday- Mrs May is likely to head to Brussels to try to get further concessions from the EU Monday, 21 January- Expected Commons vote on ""Plan B"" Friday, 29 March- the UK leaves the EU, unless MPs have succeeded in delaying or cancelling it Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there was greater ""uncertainty"" after Commons Speaker John Bercow's decision last week to allow MPs to change the parliamentary timetable. He warned ""those on the Brexiteer side seeking ideological purity"" by voting down Mrs May's deal they risked ""leaving the door ajar to ways that increase the risk to Brexit"". ""There are lots of different plans being put forward by Members of Parliament that don't respect the result (of the referendum) or risk no deal,"" he added. Pressed on what would happen if the deal is defeated, Mr Barclay said he suspected the Commons would support something ""along the lines of this deal"" but declined to speculate on whether the government had a Brexit ""plan B"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn on how Labour would negotiate Brexit: ""The EU is well known to be flexible"" Mr Corbyn said Labour would vote against Mrs May's deal and, if she lost, would start moves to trigger a general election. He told Andrew Marr: ""We will table a motion of no confidence in the government at a time of our choosing, but it's going to be soon, don't worry about it."" The Labour leader has said his party does not have the votes in Parliament to win a confidence vote on its own and has appealed to other parties to support it. Northern Ireland's DUP party, which keeps Mrs May in power, is also planning to vote against her deal but has said it will support Mrs May in a confidence vote. If a majority of MPs back a no confidence motion, the government - or any anyone else with sufficient support - will get 14 days to try to win another confidence vote. If no-one can do that, a general election will be held. Mr Corbyn is facing growing calls from within his own party to back a second EU referendum. He told Andrew Marr he hoped to get a general election first - and ensure that the UK did not leave without a deal. ""My own view is that I'd rather get a negotiated deal now, if we can, to stop the danger of a no-deal exit from the EU on 29 March - which would be catastrophic for industry."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Asked whether Labour would campaign to leave the EU if a general election was called, Mr Corbyn said his party would ""decide our manifesto content as soon as we know there's an election coming"". He said he would have to ask the EU to extend Article 50, the legal process taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, if he won an election, which he said would take place in February or March, to allow time for a new Labour government to negotiate a Brexit deal of its own. Mr Corbyn wants the UK to be part of a customs union with the EU, with access to the single market. Please upgrade your browser The UK will leave the EU on 29 March unless there is a new act of Parliament preventing that. Because the government controls the timetable for Commons business, it was assumed that this would not be possible. But a group of MPs, including former Tory ministers, are reported by the Sunday Times to be working on a way to allow non-government members to take control of the timetable and bring forward legislation making it illegal to leave the EU without a deal, if Mrs May loses Tuesday's vote. Downing Street has said it is ""extremely concerned"" about the reported plot, which it says could potentially overturn centuries of Parliamentary precedent. A leading Conservative Remainer, who declined to be named, has told the BBC he is not aware of any plans to change Commons rules. He dismissed newspaper stories about backbench plots as ""fantasy"", designed to frighten Brexiteer Tories into backing Mrs May's deal. But the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said MPs must now take control of the Brexit process from the government to prevent a no-deal scenario. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme: ""The prime minister's got to stop threatening Parliament and indeed, threatening the whole of the United Kingdom, that it's a choice between her deal and no deal - that's not the case."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who like Mr Blackford backs another EU referendum, said: ""I think Parliament will take control of this process, will insist that we pursue the option of no Brexit."" Sir Vince said this could happen by cancelling Article 50 - which he noted would be ""resented by lots of people"" - or via a second referendum. But former Brexit Secretary David Davis said MPs should vote down Mrs May's deal - and the government should then go back to the EU with ""our best and final offer"" of a free trade deal with no tariffs, along the lines of the deal the EU has with Canada. ""If the EU insists on no deal, then fine,""he says in an article for the Sunday Times.,external The government has previously rejected Mr Davis's proposals, which are backed by other Brexiteer Tories, saying they would not solve the Northern Irish border problem.

How to fix your own broken gadgets,"""Repair parties"" are teaching people how to fix faulty gadgets Consumer campaigners arewinning the battle for a ""right to repair""- which could mean our electrical appliances last longer and are easier to mend. But when your devices go wrong, how do you know whether there's a ten-minute fix or if your appliance is destined for the scrapheap? We asked some experts for their tips on the repairs you can do at home. Is it better to fix a washing machine yourself - or call in the professionals? ""A lot of repairs are really, really straightforward. People don't do them because they think electrical items are going to be complicated,"" says Lee Gilbert, owner of Ransom Spares, which sells spare electrical parts online. Fixing a washing machine pump,externalmay sound daunting, he says, but it's a half-hour task that could save you Â£150 on a repairman. 'Right to repair' gathers force Mr Gilbert said the job just requires pulling out the machine, disconnecting the hoses, removing a panel and swapping the faulty pump for a new one. Some consumer electronics fixes are even easier, said Janet Gunter, co-founder of Restart, a project which organises parties across the country where people teach each other repair skills. If you've got a faulty headphone socket on your phone, it could be caused by a build-up of dust.Simply dig out the fluff with a toothpick,external, Restart advises. Lee Gilbert is one of many repair experts producing instructional videos online Laptops and mobile phones are the usual devices in need of attention at Restart parties. There, people might learn how to stop their computer overheating -using compressed air or a brush to clean the fan,externalcan get a laptop running cooler again. For Mr Gilbert, faulty ovens which won't heat up are a common complaint. ""You turn it on and 20 minutes later, it's still cold,"" he says. He said it takes just ten minutes,externaland costs Â£20 to Â£40 to replace the heating element. Disconnect the oven from the mains, remove the screws on a cover at the back of the oven, and swap in the new element, he says. ""The oven is one of the most expensive appliances in the house. So when it doesn't heat up, people think that's going to cost them Â£600 to get a new one."" If you're new to repairing electrical appliances, Ms Gunter advises steering clear of mains-powered devices. ""It's a good idea to get started with battery-powered devices, which are much safer, as a way to get confidence,"" she says. If you are tackling larger devices, everything should be disconnected from the mains before you start, Mr Gilbert adds. He says DIYers should also watch out for scorch marks: it might indicate an electrical fault which is not safe for amateurs to tackle. ""The safety principles are pretty much common sense,"" he says. But he also advises taking photos as you go - so you can be sure to put everything back in the right place. Flat-screen TVs may look good - but it can be impossible to repair a damaged screen Restart has campaigned for products to be easier to repair with plenty of spare parts - but not all manufacturers have got the message. ""Mostly it's low-cost or off-brand appliances which are impossible to repair - you're never going to get a spare part. If your Â£6 or Â£7 kettle or toaster goes wrong, you probably can't fix it,"" Ms Gunter says. Flat-screen TVs are also often irreparable, she says. ""If the screen is damaged, it's pretty much game over."" And Ms Gunter predicts that ""bundling"" will become a growing obstacle to the right to repair. That is, some manufacturers will only sell several spare parts bundled together, making repairs more costly. ""That's the way that manufacturers will get around everything,"" she says.

What links Fiona Bruce to Robert de Niro?,"This video can not be played Fiona Bruce takes over from David Dimbleby as Question Time host, but the music stays the same. Play for an excerpt A new year brings a new host to Question Time, with new topics to be debated. But through all the change, one thing stays the same - the programme's music. Such is the legacy of its composer Stanley Myers, his cultural imprint is still felt in Hollywood as well as on British TV. But how does he link Fiona Bruce to Robert de Niro? Gone is David Dimbleby of Dimblebot and tie fame. Here comes Question Time's first new host in 25 years, Fiona Bruce. When the BBC's lively debate show returns on Thursday night, things will be different. And yet, viewers at home will still prepare in the same way. For in their ears will be something familiar; a tune that for 40 years has got heads ready for what comes next. The ticking bomb of a piece may have inspired the Dimble-dance - and soon the Bruce bop? - but it also warns of time running out and getting things wrong. It's the sound, after all, of the public grilling politicians. And it's burned into Britain's Thursday-night psyche; the national, aural shorthand for ""it's Friday tomorrow"". The music was written byStanley Myers, the late English composer for screen silver and small with more than 100 credits to his name. Poke around in his CV and there's music for episodes of vintage TV staples Z Cars and Doctor Who, along with movies The Witches, Wish You Were Here and My Beautiful Laundrette. This video can not be played David Dimbleby's memorable moments: He said he was not only aware of the Dimble-dance but knew how to throw shapes to Myers's instantly recognisable tune Dig a bit further, though, and there's a more obscure Myers credit, the 1970 film The Walking Stick. It's this movie's melody - or a version of it - that would go on to get a Hollywood leg-up when resurrected within the decade for an A-list feature. Far gentler than Question Time's thumping bluster, the haunting tune was called Cavatina, the notes of which were plucked by guitar virtuoso John Williams (not to be confused with the composer of Star Wars and Jaws). But by 1978 - and still Williams-plucked - it had become known as something else; the theme for a Robert de Niro movie. Dimbleby and Dimblebot: Question Time and social media Fiona Bruce is debate show's new host Watch Question Time Ready for some trivia-dropping fun, then? The man who wrote Question Time also wrote the music for The Deer Hunter - the acclaimed Vietnam War epic co-starring Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken. You can listenhere. There you were thinking Fiona Bruce's sole link to de Niro was someone on Question Time saying ""you talkin' to me?"" to which the reply is ""no madam, the woman next to you in the lemon blouse"". Yet joined they are - a cultural odd couple to be sure, but together in eclectic dreams; one fronting scenes of combat, the other the star of The Deer Hunter. Composer Stanley Myers had more than 100 film and TV credits to his name According to Myers,who died aged 63 in 1993,external, the toughest nut to crack was always finding a central melody; that signature through-line. ""A main theme is the hardest thing, that's what takes the longest time,"" the Birmingham-born composer said in an interview on the recording, The Deer Hunter and Other Themes. ""To write a melody - the thing that's important to the picture - is difficult and requires a lot of craftsmanship."" He needn't have worried where Cavatina was concerned. In 1978, the piece won anIvor Novello award for best instrumental work,external. Like de Niro's face, it tells you how to feel. One fronts scenes of combat, the other is in war epic The Deer Hunter The thing with awards, though, is they speak little of cultural impact. On that score, Cavatina is the gift that keeps on giving, pairing de Niro with another unlikely figure from the fabric of British cultural life - this time via vintage kids' telly. That's because as well as 'Nam, the piece found its way into Take Hart (1977-83) - an art show fronted by the kindly Tony Hart who appealed to pre-internet kids' creative instincts. Despite having war's soundtrack, there were no battles here, just minor disagreements with Morph; a shape-shifting boy made out of modelling clay. The only explosions in Tony Hart's show were ones of glitter As with Take Hart forerunner Vision On, the show's plum spot was a segment called The Gallery in which kids' sent-in pictures were shared before their peers; a sort of early Instagram but with felt tip instead of filters. For musical accompaniment, Vision On's vibraphone whimsy was bumped for Cavatina's guitar. And as its shy melancholy played for Hollywood's whizzing bullets, it played too for kids' art. But that was Myers. A man with a melody so special, it could work for both blown-out brains and a snowman by Georgina. A man versatile enough to know the sound for a flustered cabinet member. A man whose music remains seared into the national consciousness, decades after being written. Dimbleby bids moving farewell to Question Time.

Where pubs are bucking the trend of decline,"This video can not be played What's keeping Highland pubs going? Pubs in the Highlands appeared to be bucking a UK-wide trend of pub and bar closures. Since 2008, almost a quarter of pubs in the UK have shutaccording to Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis,external. But the study shows that in the Highlands there are 14% more pubs than there were 10 years ago. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said a major factor behind the growth was that the pubs had done well catering for tourists. Tourism is the Highland region's most important industry and supports 25,000 jobs. Provisional figures for last year suggest almost 6.5 million visitors came to the area. Paul Waterson says Scottish pubs have been under pressure for years According to the ONS, more than 11,000 pubs have closed in the UK in the last decade - a fall of 23%. In Scotland, East Renfewshire and East Ayrshire saw the largest decline in pub numbers. The two areas have 40% fewer pubs than 10 years ago. Other areas of Scotland have also seen declines, including Moray, Angus, Fife and the Scottish Borders where there the numbers have fallen by 20% or more. But the Highlands and East Dunbartonshire, where there has been an increase of 20% or more in pubs, have experienced growth. They join places such as Ceredigion in Wales and English seaside resorts Scarborough, Blackpool and Brighton in bucking the trend. The Highland region appears to have bucked the UK trend, according to the ONS Tourism is held up as a factor in supporting Highlands businesses Mr Waterson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that Scottish pubs have had a hard time trading since the introduction of a law prohibiting smoking in public places. He said: ""We've been under pressure since around 2006 when the smoking ban came in. That was certainly a game changer. ""Also, a move towards home drinking through cheap supermarket alcohol hasn't helped. ""Thousands of pubs have closed over the last number of years, but the Highlands and Islands have bucked that trend. ""I think it is down to the pubs being well run and catering for the customer, but also a huge increase in the number of tourists coming to that area who are then well catered for in the pubs and bars in the Highlands and Islands."" Mr Waterson said pubs elsewhere in Scotland were being encouraged to tap into the tourism where possible. Bruce McGregor says he was told he was an idiot for trying to open a new bar Musician Bruce McGregor opened a new bar in Inverness on St Andrew's Day last year. He said he was told he was an ""idiot"" for trying to open such a business on the ""wrong side of town"" and against a national decline in pubs. But among his reasons for pressing ahead with his venture was to create somewhere he and his wife, and other people of the same age, could go to and enjoy Highland food, drink and live music. Mr McGregor said: ""Another reason was that there were so many tourists coming into Inverness. ""We were blown away by the numbers of tourists we saw last year - Americans, Germans, Spaniards and French."" George Callum said business can be tough for rural Highlands pubs outside of the tourist season However, George Callum, who has run a pub in Munlochy on the Black Isle for the last five years, said business could be tough for rural Highland pubs outside the tourism season. He said: ""Christmas is good but in the months between October to probably March most businesses are closed, or are struggling to keep afloat because of the lack of numbers."" Mr Callum said his pub was one of the ""lucky ones"" in being able to get business from local customers and, in the tourist season, from visitors. His pub puts on steak nights, karaoke and live music to attract customers. But he said he could understand why traditional pub-going had declined. ""We are in an age of uncertainty,"" he said, adding: ""And if you are young family it is economically better to sit and drink at home because you are going to get more for your pound.""
