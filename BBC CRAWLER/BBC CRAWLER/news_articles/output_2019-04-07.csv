Super-fast engine tech in new milestone,"This video can not be played Mark Thomas: ""We subjected the technology to the temperature 'threat' of high speed"" UK engineers developing a novel propulsion system say their technology has passed another key milestone. The Sabre air-breathing rocket engine is designed to drive space planes to orbit and take airliners around the world in just a few hours. To work, it needs to manage very high temperature airflows, and the team atReaction Engines Ltd,externalhas developed a heat-exchanger for the purpose. This key element has just demonstrated an impressive level of performance. It has shown the ability to handle the simulated conditions of flying at more than three times the speed of sound. It did this by successfully quenching a 420C stream of gases in less than 1/20th of a second. Super-fast engine set for key tests 'Big players' invest in UK space engine Artwork: In the test set-up, the pre-cooler is fed by the exhaust gases from a military jet engine The REL group is confident its ""pre-cooler"" technology can now go on to show the same performance in conditions that simulate flying above five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. That would mean rapidly dumping the energy in a 1,000-degree airflow. ""We're now able to prove many of the claims we've been making as a business, backed up by very high-quality data,"" REL's CEO Mark Thomas told BBC News. ""In this most recent experiment, we've near-instantaneously transferred 1.5 Megawatts of heat energy - the equivalent of 1,000 homes' worth of heat energy."" The testing was conducted at a dedicated facility at the Colorado Air and Space Port in the US. Without the pre-cooler tech at the front, Sabre would struggle in the expected temperature regime Sabre can be thought of as a cross between a jet engine and a rocket engine. At slow speeds and at low altitude, it would behave like a jet, burning its fuel in a stream of air scooped from the atmosphere. At high speeds and at high altitude, it would then transition to full rocket mode, combining the fuel with a small supply of oxygen the vehicle had carried aloft. The early air-breathing approach would deliver substantial weight savings, and allow a space plane, for example, to go straight to orbit without throwing away propellant stages on the way up, as rockets do now. But the concept brings with it an immense heat challenge. The faster the flow of air into the engine's intake during the high-speed ascent, the higher the temperature. And the heat would rise still further once the flow was slowed and compressed prior to entering the combustion chambers. Such conditions would ordinarily melt the insides of the engine. The chilled helium flowing through the pre-cooler's piping takes away the heat Sabre's pre-cooler seeks to solve this problem by efficiently, and swiftly, extracting the heat by first passing the intake gases through a tightly packed array of fine tubing. This tubing is fed with chilled helium. In 2012, REL put the pre-cooler in front of a viper jet engine and sucked ambient air through the heat-exchanger. The gas stream immediately dropped to minus-150C. Now, the company has flipped the set-up, putting the jet engine from an old F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber in front of the pre-cooler to drive hot gases directly across the piping array. The completed Colorado experiment replicates the thermal conditions corresponding to flight at Mach 3.3, the record-breaking speed at which the American SR-71 Blackbird spy plane used to operate. Importantly, though, the pre-cooler took out all the heat. ""This technology has wide application, not just in the immediate, obvious domain of high-speed flight but across the aerospace industry more generally, and into more commercial applications - anywhere there's a significant heat-management challenge and you're looking for ultra-lightweight, miniaturised, high-performance solutions,"" Mr Thomas said. The Colorado tests continue. Meanwhile, back in England, REL is progressing towards a demonstration of the core part of the engine, expected to get under way next year. This core combustion section recently passed its preliminary design review under the eye of propulsion experts at the European Space Agency. Esa has been brought in by the UK government to act as a technical auditor on the project. The Oxfordshire company is developing Sabre with the support of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Boeing. All are keen to see the many years of refinement on the engine concept finally come to fruition.

Falling through the pay gap," More than 10,000 British firms have revealed the difference between what they pay men and women. This is the second year that all companies with 250 or more employees have been required to disclose their pay gaps, revealing that more than three in four companies pay men more than they pay women. This is how the UK's pay gap sizes up. This article contains animated content, if you would prefer not to see this, you can
                        turn animation off by clicking the toggle below. 10,443 companies have disclosed the average difference between what they pay men and women. Each dot represents one company. If you work at a large firm it probably pays the average man more than the average woman -8,124 companies pay men more, while just1,424 pay women more. 895 companies have reportedno pay gap at all. Let's get rid of those for now. This is what it looks like when we reorder the companies by the size of their gender pay gaps. The ones at the top and bottom have reported the biggest difference between what they pay men and women. EasyJetpays men 47.9% more. That's one of the widest pay gaps reported among larger firms. The ones closest to the middle have the smallest pay gaps, for instanceRoyal Mail, with a 1% pay gap. The average pay gap reported is 9.6%, meaning that for every £1 the average man earns, the average woman takes home 90p. This means the gap has barely moved from last year, when it was 9.7%. The gender pay gap doesn't tell us if women are being paid less for the same job, something which has been illegal for decades. But it does let us size up the differences in men and women's occupations and working patterns. Women are much more likely to work part-time, and are under-represented in senior roles. Take airlines. Many have reported big pay gaps. Why? High-paid pilots are almost exclusively men, while women predominantly work as lower-paid cabin crew. Ryanairhas reported a 64.4% pay gap. Other airlines likeEasyJet, TUI, Flybe and Jet2.comall have pay gaps of at least 40%. Let's look at the banks. The finance and insurance sector has one of the widest pay gaps. Women working in this sector are paid 22.9% less than men. Barclays Investment Bank, Lloyds Bank and Clydesdale Bankall report pay gaps of close to or above 40%. What happens when we look at the pay gap in individual sectors? All sectors, on average, pay men more than women. But looking closer at how pay differences stack up reveals that some sectors are more equal than others. ●Men paid more ●Women paid more ●No pay gap Almost all employers in the finance sector on average pay men more than women. Only 17 of the finance firms that have disclosed their figures pay women more. Construction is a male-dominated industry, but the women who do work in it are more likely to work in lower-paid jobs. Because of this, it has the widest pay gap of any sector. Although education as a whole is dominated by women, they are over-represented in lower-paid jobs. Many schools have men in the most senior roles, creating very wide pay gaps. Women in the retail sector are over-represented in lower-paid jobs. The pay gap in retail is also driven by women being less likely to take up unsociable hours, a study by PwC found. No sector pays women as much as men, but the accommodation and food sector comes closest to equality. Companies often pay a flat rate for most roles, which is why so many report a 0% pay gap. The health sector is female-dominated, but men are over-represented in senior clinical roles, in private and public sector. This is now changing with more female doctors at junior levels. One of the causes of the gender pay gap is that there are fewer women in more senior, higher-paid jobs. A deep dive into the data shows that the proportion of women falls as pay levels rise. This happens in every sector. In sectors with the widest pay gaps, women are also most under-represented at top levels. Finance and construction are two examples of this. In contrast, where women are more evenly represented in lower and higher-paid jobs, the pay gap is smaller. The health and accommodation and food sectors are two examples of this.

Company wins big at Olivier Awards,"Patti LuPone and Jonathan Bailey won acting prizes for their roles in Company A gender-swapping revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical Company was among the big winners at Sunday night's Olivier Awards. It won four prizes at the ceremony - which is seen as the most prestigious awards event in UK theatre. The West End revival of the 1970 musical saw the lead character, Robert, re-imagined as a woman, Bobbie. The show's wins included the best supporting actress prize for theatre veteran Patti LuPone. ""I'm deeply moved, thank you for accepting me into your community,"" LuPone said as she accepted her trophy, adding: ""I love London, I love the theatre community here."" 8 things we learned at the Olivier Awards Accepting the award for best musical revival, the show's director Marianne Elliott explained her company's ""main goal was to put female stories front and centre on our stages"". ""Celebrating female stories was not only possible but absolutely vital and the most outstanding thing about doing this show was that our audience seemed to believe that too."" Company also took home best set design and best supporting actor for Jonathan Bailey. Sharon D Clarke won best actress in a musical Two other shows took home four prizes from the ceremony - The Inheritance and Come From Away. The Inheritance, which focuses on the lives of gay men in New York, was split into two parts when staged in the West End due to its seven-hour running time. The show's prizes included best new play, best actor for Kyle Soller and best director for Stephen Daldry. Come From Away's awards included best new musical, best theatre choreographer, best sound design and outstanding achievement in music. The show tells the story of the Canadian town of Gander on 9/11, where 38 passenger aeroplanes were forced to land as the terror attack was taking place. ""When the world was in turmoil, this tiny town in Gander didn't question anything,"" John Brant told BBC News backstage. ""Their initial response was 'these people are in trouble and we need to help them, and I think that means a lot right now. I think audiences are being pulled towards a story which as about kindness, love and compassion."" Other Olivier winners included Sharon D Clarke, who said she felt ""deep, deep joy"" as she won best actress in a musical for Caroline or Change. Best actor in a musical went to Kobna Holdbrook-Smith for his role as Ike Turner in Tina: The Musical. Summer and Smoke took home two of the night's major prizes - best revival and best actress for Patsy Ferran.

Websites to be fined over 'online harms',"Internet sites could be fined or blocked if they fail to tackle ""online harms"" such as terrorist propaganda and child abuse, under government plans. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has proposed an independent watchdog that will write a ""code of practice"" for tech companies. Senior managers could be held liable for breaches, with a possible levy on the industry to fund the regulator. But critics say the plans threaten freedom of speech. TheOnline Harms White Paper,externalis a joint proposal from the DCMS and the Home Office. Apublic consultation,externalon the plans will run for 12 weeks. The paper suggests: establishing an independent regulator that can write a ""code of practice"" for social networks and internet companies giving the regulator enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules considering additional enforcement powers such as the ability to fine company executives and force internet service providers to block sites that break the rules Outlining the proposals, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The era of self-regulation for online companies is over. ""Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough."" Discussing potential penalties on BBC Breakfast, he said: ""If you look at the fines available to the Information Commissioner around the GDPR rules, that could be up to 4% of company's turnover... we think we should be looking at something comparable here."" The plans cover a range of issues that are clearly defined in law such as spreading terrorist content, child sex abuse, so-called revenge pornography, hate crimes, harassment and the sale of illegal goods. But it also covers harmful behaviour that has a less clear legal definition such as cyber-bullying, trolling and the spread of fake news and disinformation. It says social networks must tackle material that advocates self-harm and suicide, which became a prominent issue after 14-year-old Molly Russell took her own life in 2017. After she died her family found distressing material about depression and suicide on her Instagram account. Molly's father Ian Russell holds the social media giant partly responsible for her death. Mr Russell told the BBC that the white paper was ""a very important step"" towards making the internet a safer place. ""I think after what we've been through and sadly what so many families go through, the urgency is huge,"" he said. However he added that the paper could have contained more specific guidance for parents. ""For example, there's not very much about age limits and ratings - it seems to me lots of companies self-rate their apps and their content and that makes it very difficult for a parent to know how much they can trust those platforms,"" he said. This video can not be played Ian Russell partly blames Instagram for his daughter taking her own life and says ""the urgency is huge"" to protect children online Home Secretary Sajid Javid said tech giants and social media companies had a moral duty ""to protect the young people they profit from"". ""Despite our repeated calls to action, harmful and illegal content - including child abuse and terrorism - is still too readily available online. The plans call for an independent regulator to hold internet companies to account. It would be funded by the tech industry. The government has not decided whether a new body will be established, or an existing one handed new powers. The regulator will define a ""code of best practice"" that social networks and internet companies must adhere to. CBBC's tips for staying safe online How can I keep my children safe online? Storyville: The Internet's Dirtiest Secrets What do other governments do about social media? As well as Facebook, Twitter and Google, the rules would apply to messaging services such as Snapchat and cloud storage services. The regulator will have the power to fine companies and publish notices naming and shaming those that break the rules. The government says it is also considering fines for individual company executives and making search engines remove links to offending websites. It is also consulting over blocking harmful websites. On the face of it, this is a tough new regime - and ministers have acted upon the demands of charities like the NSPCC which want what they regard as the ""Wild West Web"" to be tamed. But a closer look reveals all sorts of issues yet to be settled. Will a whole new organisation be given the huge job of regulating the internet? Or will the job be handed to the media regulator Ofcom? What sort of sanctions will be available to the regulator? And will they apply equally to giant social networks and to small organisations such as parents' message boards? Most tricky of all is how the regulator is going to rule on material that is not illegal but may still be considered harmful. Take this example. Misinformation is listed as a potential harm, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock has talked about the damaging effects anti-vaccination campaigners have had. So will the regulator tell companies that their duty of care means they must remove such material? The government now plans to consult on its proposals. It may yet find that its twin aims of making the UK both the safest place in the world online and the best to start a digital business are mutually incompatible. The white paper offers some suggestions that could be included in the code of best practice. It suggests the spread of fake news could be tackled by forcing social networks to employ fact-checkers and promote legitimate news sources. But the regulator will be allowed to define the code by itself. The white paper also says social media companies should produce annual reports revealing how much harmful content has been found on their platforms. The children's charity NSPCC has been urging new regulation since 2017 and has repeatedly called for a legal duty of care to be placed on social networks. A spokeswoman said: ""Time's up for the social networks. They've failed to police themselves and our children have paid the price."" Rebecca Stimson,Facebook's head of UK policy, said in a statement: ""New regulations are needed so that we have a standardised approach across platforms and private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone. ""New rules for the internet should protect society from harm while also supporting innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech."" Twitter's head of UK public policy Katy Minshall said in a statement: ""We look forward to engaging in the next steps of the process, and working to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the open, free nature of the internet."" TechUK, an umbrella group representing the UK's technology industry, said the government must be ""clear about how trade-offs are balanced between harm prevention and fundamental rights"". Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, said the government's proposals would ""create state regulation of the speech of millions of British citizens"". Matthew Lesh, head of research at free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute, went further. He said: ""The government should be ashamed of themselves for leading the western world in internet censorship. ""The proposals are a historic attack on freedom of speech and the free press. ""At a time when Britain is criticising violations of freedom of expression in states like Iran, China and Russia, we should not be undermining our freedom at home."" And freedom of speech campaigners Article 19 warned that the government ""must not create an environment that encourages the censorship of legitimate expression"". A spokesman said it opposed any duty of care being imposed on internet platforms. They said that would ""inevitably require them to proactively monitor their networks and take a restrictive approach to content removal"". ""Such actions could violate individuals' rights to freedom of expression and privacy,"" they added.

Corbyn faces fresh anti-Semitism row,"Labour said leader Jeremy Corbyn was 'committed to celebrating the Jewish community'. Jeremy Corbyn has been criticised over Labour's handling of anti-Semitism allegations by the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement. The organisation has also voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the Labour leader over the matter. Earlier, shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti called on the group not to ""personalise the issue"". Labour says it takes all complaints of anti-Semitism ""extremely seriously"" and is committed to ""rooting it out"". Labour MP Ruth Smeeth said it had been a ""heartbreaking day"" and she felt ""sick"" after the meeting. She said: ""Jewish members of the Labour Party have come together in anger and frustration to make it clear to the leadership that enough really must be enough. ""The mood was very sombre. The party has to shine a light on what's really going on - it's time for the Labour Party to remove itself from its own disciplinary and complaints process and hand it to an independent body."" Dame Margaret Hodge said the meeting was ""collegiate but angry"". The vote comes after theSunday Times reported that it had seen internal documents,externalwhich showed the party had failed to take disciplinary action in hundreds of cases. The newspaper reported that the documents, which have not been seen by the BBC, showed the party's system for dealing with complaints had been beset by delays, inaction and interference from the leader's office. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Anti-Semitism row existential threat, Lord Falconer says Labour defended its handling of complaints, saying the figures used in the newspaper report were not accurate and had been ""selectively leaked from emails to misrepresent their overall contents"". ""The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to rooting it out of our party,"" a spokeswoman said. ""All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures."" Responding to the vote, the spokeswoman said: ""Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community. ""One anti-Semite in our party is one too many. We are determined to tackle anti-Semitism and root it out."" But Jewish Labour Movement national secretary Peter Mason said the reports showed the party's processes were ""incapable of dealing with anti-Jewish racism"". He told the BBC News Channel: ""Ultimately organisations are led by the top. Cultures of organisations are set by those that lead them."" Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti, who led an inquiry into anti-Semitism within Labour in 2016, called on the Jewish Labour Movement not to ""personalise the issue and make it about Jeremy Corbyn"". Speaking on Sky News's  Ridge programme, she said the issue of anti-Semitism within the party ""goes way back"", whilst Mr Corbyn was ""one person and he won't be leader forever"". ""We have to make this non-factional, non-personal and work together,"" she added. Her review, whichconcluded in June 2016, found the party was not overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism but there is an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the Sunday Times report showed that attempts to deal with anti-Semitism had been ""treated with utter contempt"". ""Rather than own up to the problem, the Labour leadership has put its efforts into a cover-up operation,"" she said. ""Any claims to a politically independent system can now be seen as a total sham. ""Labour must now urgently open up its processes to scrutiny by the Jewish community"".

Ashley launches new Debenhams broadside,"Mike Ashley owns more than 60% of Sports Direct Retail tycoon Mike Ashley, who has tabled a rescue bid for store chain Debenhams, has accused its executives of ""a sustained programme of falsehoods and denials"". He urged them to take a lie detector test and called for an investigation and the firm's shares to be suspended. Mr Ashley has offered to inject Â£150m into the beleaguered department store, as long as he is appointed chief executive. Debenhams did not respond. Mr Ashley, who is Debenhams' biggest shareholder,has been embroiled in a battle for control with its boardand has already made clear his disdain for its current management. He launched the latest broadside as he waited for a response to his offer to invest. If his bid is turned down, the company is likely to go into administration this week. Sports Direct issued its strongly-worded statement late on Sunday, accusing Debenhams' board members of misrepresenting what had happened in a meeting between the two firms. Sports Direct claims ""misrepresentations were made to induce Sports Direct into signing a non-disclosure agreement, locking them out of any ability to trade in the bonds or equity of Debenhams for a period of time"". Sports Direct said Mr Ashley and two colleagues had already taken lie detector tests themselves, the results of which ""showed without any doubt"" that they were providing an accurate report of the meeting. ""Indeed, Mike Ashley's score for example was so significantly high as to be considered rare in comparison to others,"" the statement said. Sports Direct called for Debenhams shares to be suspended while the matter is investigated. Days beforea lender-imposed deadline is due to expire, Sports Direct at the weekend offered to underwrite Â£150m of new equity funding for the retailer, but only if Mr Ashley was appointed chief executive and Â£148m of debt was written off by lenders, who include banks and hedge funds. The department store chain's financiers are considering the offer, according to City sources. Sports Direct, which owns a near-30% stake in the retailer, confirmed its proposals on Monday and set out that it was stillconsidering a Â£61.4m bid to take full control of Debenhams. In a stock exchange announcement, Sports Direct said it had until 17:00 on 22 April to announce a firm offer or walk away. While both ideas were being considered, it would pursue only one of them in the event it was agreed, it added. Over the weekend, in a letter to Debenhams, the firm said it was ""keen to be a supportive shareholder and financier"". But the tone of Sunday's comments makes it harder to see how the two sides can come to an agreement, making the planned administration more likely. If that happens, stores, staff and suppliers would not see any immediate change. However, shareholders, including Mr Ashley, would see their stakes in the company wiped out. Under that scenario, Debenhams is planning a restructuring of the business which would lead to the closure of about 50 stores. The retailer will also attempt to get landlords to cut the rent on the remaining sites, in order to make them more profitable under a company voluntary arrangement. The struggling department store, which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people,reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year. If Mr Ashley's offer is accepted, he would control yet another High Street name. As well as Sports Direct, Mr Ashley runs House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Flannels. In January, Mr Ashley joined investor Landmark Group to vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board. High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Debenhams secures Â£200m lifeline Can Mike Ashley save debt-laden Debenhams?

Fighting near Libyan capital leaves 21 dead,"This video can not be played Gen Haftar's forces prepare for Tripoli battle Libya's UN-backed government says 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded in fighting near the capital, Tripoli. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called for an immediate halt to the fighting and called for talks. Forces under Gen Khalifa Haftar have advanced from the east with the aim of taking Tripoli. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj has accused him of attempting a coup and says his forces will not be allowed to continue. Among the dead was a Red Crescent doctor killed on Saturday. Gen Haftar's forces said they had lost 14 fighters. Earlier the UN appealed for a two-hour truce so casualties and civilians could be evacuated, but fighting continued. And in a statement, Secretary of State Pompeo said the US was ""deeply concerned about fighting near Tripoli"" and stressed the need for talks. ""This unilateral military campaign against Tripoli is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans,"" the statement said. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? International powers have begun evacuating personnel from Libya amid the worsening security situation. Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) forces have been carrying out a multi-pronged attack from the south and west of the city since Thursday. The UN said its call for a humanitarian truce had been ignored and emergency services said they had not been able to enter the areas where fighting was taking place. However a UN spokesman told AFP that they were ""still hoping for a positive response"". On Sunday the LNA said it had carried out its first air strike, a day after the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) hit them with air strikes on Saturday. Fighting has continued around the disused international airport south of the capital that Gen Haftar earlier said his forces had seized. Forces loyal to the GNA have slowed the advance and on Sunday a GNA spokesman told Al-Jazeera TV that the GNA now intended to ""cleanse"" the whole of the country. US Africa Command, responsible for US military operations and liaison in Africa,external, said that due to the ""increased unrest"" it had relocated a contingent of US forces temporarily, but gave no further details on numbers. There were reports of a fast amphibious craft being used in the operation. India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said its full contingent of 15 Central Reserve Police Force peacekeepers had been evacuated from Tripoli because the ""situation in Libya has suddenly worsened"". A market in Tripoli. Residents are said to be stocking up on supplies The Italian multinational oil and gas company, Eni, decided to evacuate all its Italian personnel from the country. The UN is also due to pull out non-essential staff. Residents of Tripoli have reportedly begun stocking up on food and fuel. But BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says many of those near the fighting are remaining in their homes for now, for fear of looting should they leave. Some fear a long operation, which Gen Haftar mounted to take the eastern city of Benghazi from Islamist fighters. Libya has been wracked by unrest since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi. Dozens of militias operate in the country. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli Recently they have been allying either with the UN-backed GNA, based in Tripoli, or the LNA of Gen Haftar, a tough anti-Islamist who has the support of Egypt and the UAE and is strong in eastern Libya. Gen Haftar helped Col Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He returned in 2011 after the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. The unity government was created at talks in 2015 but has struggled to assert national control. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj delivered a TV address on Saturday, saying he would defend the capital. Mr Serraj said he had offered concessions to Gen Haftar to avoid bloodshed, only to be ""stabbed in the back"". Analysis by Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent, in Tunis The rogue general's defiance suggests that, despite international condemnation of his recent moves, he believes he can only secure a place in Libya's future political makeup through militarily means. Diplomats are worried, because the manner and timing of the attack means he is unlikely to back down unless he is defeated. Few thought he would go ahead and launch this operation - which he has long threatened to do - because they believed ongoing talks that saw him go from Paris to Palermo and the UAE for more than a year would buy time until a new political settlement was reached through negotiations and an eventual electoral process. Today, Western nations have few cards to play to de-escalate the violence and once again find themselves in a position where they may need to start from scratch. UN-backed talks aimed at drawing up a road map for new elections have been scheduled for 14-16 April in the Libyan city of Ghadames. UN envoy Ghassan Salame insisted the talks would go ahead, unless serious obstacles prevented it, saying ""we won't give up this political work quickly"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Tripoli just last Thursday to discuss the situation. But Gen Haftar has said his troops will not stop until they have defeated ""terrorism"".

Trump replaces homeland security chief,"Kirstjen Nielsen has served in her role since December 2017 The US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who enforced some of President Donald Trump's controversial border policies, has resigned. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan will replace her temporarily, Mr Trump said. Ms Nielsen was responsible for the proposed border wall with Mexico and the separation of migrant families. Her resignation came after the president indicated he wanted to follow a ""tougher"" immigration policy. He has often accused Ms Nielsen of not being tough enough. In recent months,illegal crossings from Central America have surgedand Mr Trump has threatened to close the Mexico border. He has since backtracked and promised to give Mexico a year to stop drugs and migrants crossing into the US. The New York Times reported,externalthat Ms Nielsen went into a meeting with Mr Trump on Sunday to plan ""a way forward"" with the border situation. Instead, she was put under pressure to resign from her job, US media say, citing unnamed sources. Walking a tightrope working for Trump The White House revolving door: Who's gone? She gave no reason for her departure in her resignation letter, although she said this was ""the right time for me to step aside"" and said the US ""is safer today than when I joined the Administration"".

Ms Nielsen first joined Mr Trump's administration in January 2017 as an assistant to the former Homeland Security chief John Kelly. She became Mr Kelly's deputy when he moved to become White House chief of staff, but returned to lead her former department later that year. Ms Nielsen defended border policies such as holding children in wire enclosures in the face of strong condemnation and intense questioning by Democrats in Congress. This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know Nielsen grilled over child migrant deaths Trump's blame game on separating families In June 2018protesters booed Ms Nielsen as she ate at a Mexican restaurant in Washington DC. But she brushed off the demonstration, tweeting that she would ""work tirelessly"" to fix the ""broken immigration system"". Her relationship with Mr Trump is said to have been difficult, although in public she has been loyal to the administration. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter Kirstjen Nielsen reportedly had been on thin ice in the Trump administration for more than a year. Her closest ally, former Chief of Staff John Kelly, exited the White House in December. Now, along the annual spring thaw, the ice beneath her has finally cracked. Or perhaps the homeland security secretary simply reached her limit. The real story will have to wait for the inevitable leaks and insider accounts that spread every time this president makes a staffing change. What seems clear, however, is that there are conflicts taking place behind the scenes in the White House - conflicts accompanying the president's increasingly belligerent rhetoric on immigration. Just two days ago, Mr Trump rescinded his nomination of Ronald Vitiello to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement because, he said, he wanted to go in a ""tougher direction"". Now his homeland security secretary - whom he had in the past viewed as not aggressive enough - is out. Ms Nielsen's name will forever be associated with the Trump administration's family separation border policy that led to massive bipartisan outcry last year. The president eventually backed down from that fight, but these latest moves suggest a more confrontational approach to border security is all but assured. Members of the Democratic party have already commented on her departure. Bennie Thompson, Mississippi congressman and Chair of the Committee on Homeland Security, said Ms Nielsen's tenure was ""a disaster from the start"", while Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey calling the move ""long overdue"". However, he said the fight is ""far from over to ensure Trump's assault on our immigrant community comes to an end"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Democrats have protested against the move, and declared the emergency unconstitutional. Mr McAleenan, 47, was confirmed as the nation's top border protection officer in 2018 with bipartisan support. He previously served as Customs and Border Protection (CBP)'s deputy commissioner under the Obama administration. In 2015, Mr McAleenan received the highest civil service award from then-President Barack Obama. Last year, he faced criticism in the media for carrying out Mr Trump's zero tolerance policy that led to the family separation crisis, but he has maintained his agency's duty is to carry out the laws, not create them. Mr McAleenan is married to Corina McAleenan, an El Salvadoran immigrant, according to the Times, who worked for several years with the US Secret Service. He is a graduate of Amherst College - where his honours thesis was on marriage equality, the New York Times reported - and he helped develop antiterrorism border security strategies after the 9/11 attacks.

'Shoddy' Huawei work risks Westminster ban,"A top cyber-security official has said Huawei's ""shoddy"" engineering practices mean its mobile network equipment could be banned from Westminster and other sensitive parts of the UK. GCHQ's Dr Ian Levy told BBC Panorama the Chinese telecom giant also faced being barred from what he described as the ""brains"" of the 5G networks. The UK government is expected to reveal in May whether it will restrict or even ban the company's 5G technology. Huawei said it would address concerns. Last month, a GCHQ-backed security review of the company said it would be difficult to risk-manage Huawei's future products until defects in its cyber-security processes were fixed. It added that technical issues with the company's approach to software development had resulted in vulnerabilities in existing products, which in some cases had not been fixed, despite having being identified in previous versions. In his first broadcast interview, the executive in charge of the firm's telecoms equipment division said he planned to spend more than the $2bn (Â£1.5bn) already committed to a ""transformation programme"" to tackle the problems identified. This video can not be played WATCH: Spencer Kelly visited Huawei's giant theme park-like campus near Shenzhen for Panorama ""We hope to turn this challenge into an opportunity moving forward,"" said Ryan Ding, chief executive of Huawei's carrier business group. ""I believe that if we can carry out this programme as planned, Huawei will become the strongest player in the telecom industry in terms of security and reliability."" However, Dr Levy - the technical director of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre - said he had yet to be convinced. ""The security in Huawei is like nothing else - it's engineering like it's back in the year 2000 - it's very, very shoddy. ""We've seen nothing to give us any confidence that the transformation programme is going to do what they say it's going to do."" He added that ""geographic restrictions - maybe there's no Huawei radio [equipment] in Westminster"" was now one option for ministers to consider. This video can not be played What could happen if the UK's 5G networks suffered a major cyber-attack? Mobile UK - an industry group representing Vodafone, BT, O2 and Three -has warned that preventing Huawei from being involved in the UK's 5G rollout,externalcould cost the country's economy up to Â£6.8bn and delay the launch of its next-generation networks by up to two years. Huawei kit pulled from Pakistan CCTV system Huawei sales top $100bn despite backlash Huawei: The story of a controversial company Those already using Huawei's equipment have opted to keep it out of what is known as the core of their networks, where tasks such as checking device IDs and deciding how to route voice and data take place. EE used to make use of Huawei's gear in its 3G and 4G core, but BT is currently stripping it out after buying the business. The industry does, however, want to use Huawei's radio access network (Ran) equipment - including its antennae and base stations. These allow individual devices to wirelessly connect to their mobile data networks via radio signals transmitted over the airwaves. The US has concerns about any deployment of Huawei's products. Huawei is under pressure to tighten up its software engineering and cyber-security processes ""You would never know when the Chinese government decide to force Huawei... to do things that would be in the best interests of the Communist party, to eavesdrop on the US,"" claimed Mike Conaway, a member of the House Intelligence Committee. The Republican drafted a bill last year to ban the US government from doing business with firms that use the company's equipment. It was later adapted to become part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed into law by President Trump. The effect has been to deter the country's major telecoms networks from working with Huawei. The Chinese companyis now suing the US government claiming the move is unconstitutional,external. The congressman now has his sights on the UK. ""Obviously, the terrific relationship between the UK and the United States - English-speaking countries - is important to maintain,"" Mr Conaway told Panorama. Huawei's 5G equipment is already being installed in China ""But as a part of that we will have to assess what kind of risks we would have in sharing... secrets that would go across Huawei equipment, Huawei networks. ""We can always share things old-school ways by, you know, paper back and forth. But, in terms of being able to electronically communicate, across Huawei gear, Huawei networks, would be risky at best."" This is a matter that crosses political divides. Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also cautioned against allowing Huawei to be part of the UK's 5G networks. ""I think that the consequences could be dramatic,"" he said. ""I think there could be a real concern about the ability to fully share information because of the fear that the network that would undergird 5G in the UK, that there might be a vulnerability."" GCHQ's Dr Levy, however, played down such fears saying that efforts to digitally scramble communications meant that even if someone was able to intercept them, they would only get ""gobbledygook"". ""Anything sensitive from a company or government or defence is independently encrypted of the network,"" he explained. ""You don't trust the network to protect you, you protect yourself."" He added that despite finding vulnerabilities in some of Huawei's kit ""we don't believe the things we are reporting on is the result of Chinese state malfeasance"". For its part, Huawei says the Chinese government would never ask it to install backdoors or other vulnerabilities into its foreign clients' systems, and even if such a request were made it would refuse. Ryan Ding heads up Huawei's carrier business group, which is responsible for making and selling its mobile telecoms network kit And Mr Ding dismissed suggestions that this commitment would fall by the wayside if the US and China were to go to war. ""We have a country here that virtually uses no Huawei equipment and doesn't even know whether our 5G equipment is square or round, and yet it has been incessantly expressing security concerns over Huawei,"" he said. ""I don't want to speculate on whether they have other purposes with this kind of talk. I would rather focus the limited time that I have on making better products.""

Rwanda marks 25 years since genocide,"This video can not be played Rwanda genocide anniversary: The country will mourn for 100 days Rwanda's president said the country had become ""a family once again"", while marking the 25th anniversary of the genocide that killed 800,000 people. Paul Kagame, who led a rebel force that ended the slaughter, lit a remembrance flame in the capital Kigali. Rwandans will mourn for 100 days, the time it took in 1994 for about a tenth of the country to be massacred. Most of those who died were minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus, killed by ethnic Hutu extremists. Orphans' search for family continues ""In 1994, there was no hope, only darkness,"" Mr Kagame told a crowd gathered at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where more than 250,000 victims are thought to be buried. ""Today, light radiates from this place. How did it happen? Rwanda became a family once again."" The commemoration activities began with the flame-lighting ceremony at the memorial. The flame will burn for 100 days. The 61-year-old president, who has led the country since 2000, then delivered a speech at the Kigali Convention Centre. People hold candles in remembrance at a vigil at Amahoro Stadium He said the resilience and bravery of the genocide survivors represented the ""Rwandan character in its purest form"". ""The arms of our people, intertwined, constitute the pillars of our nation,"" he said. ""We hold each other up. Our bodies and minds bear amputations and scars, but none of us is alone. ""Together, we have woven the tattered threads of our unity into a new tapestry."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What happened here will never happen again."" Mr Kagame then led a vigil at the Amahoro National Stadium, which was used by United Nations officials to try to protect Tutsis during the killings. About 2,000 people marched together on a walk of remembrance from parliament to the stadium, where candles were lit. The BBC's Flora Drury in Kigali There was a moment - when all the candles were lit, and their lights bobbed around the stadium, when people were taking pictures with their smartphones - when it was almost possible to forget the horror that brought thousands of people together on this warm evening in Kigali. But then I turned to the man next to me, and asked him what tonight meant to him. ""Well,"" he said, ""it's important."" In the understated way which so many people in Rwanda speak he said: ""I lost people. I lost my parents. I lost my siblings."" About 2,000 people attended the vigil We had already heard the names of entire families wiped off the map read out, accompanied by a promise never to forget. We had watched students march in silence from the parliament to the stadium. But it was as the final speaker took to the stage, to describe how he survived to grow up and give his children the names of the four siblings he had lost, that the emotion seemed to bubble to the surface, and anguished cries were heard above the crowd. Sometimes on this day, my neighbour said, it is hard to keep the emotions in. A number of foreign leaders are in the country for the events. They are mainly African, although Prime Minister Charles Michel represented the former colonial ruler, Belgium. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also attended. French President Emmanuel Macron did not go, however. This weekhe appointed a panel of experts to investigate France's role in the genocide. France was a close ally of the Hutu-led government prior to the massacres and has been accused of ignoring warning signs and training the militias who carried out the attacks. France was represented by Herve Berville, a Rwandan-born MP. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was also absent. He has been accused of backing Rwandan rebels who oppose Mr Kagame. The vast number of people attending were ordinary Rwandans, including those who lived through the slaughter. Olive Muhorakeye, 26, told Reuters: ""Remembering is necessary because it's only thanks to looking back at what happened [can we] ensure that it never happens again."" On 6 April 1994, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana - a Hutu - was shot down, killing all on board. This video can not be played Between April and July 1994, an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were killed in the space of 100 days. Hutu extremists blamed the Tutsi rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). It denied the accusation. In a well-organised campaign of slaughter, militias were given hit lists of Tutsi victims. Many were killed with machetes in acts of appalling brutality. One of the militias was the ruling party's youth wing, the Interahamwe, which set up road blocks to find Tutsis, incited hatred via radio broadcasts and carried out house to house searches. Rwanda's 100 days of slaughter The 'witch' who protected a village Little was done internationally to stop the killings. The UN and Belgium had forces in Rwanda but the UN mission was not given a mandate to act. The Belgians and most UN peacekeepers pulled out. Pictures of victims at the Genocide Memorial in Kigali The RPF, backed by Uganda, started gaining ground and marched on Kigali. Some two million Hutus fled, mainly to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The RPF was accused of killing thousands of Hutus as it took power, although it denies this. Dozens of Hutus were convicted for their role in the killings by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based in Tanzania, and hundreds of thousands more faced trial in community courts in Rwanda. The genocide has cast a long shadow over regeneration and talk of ethnicity remains illegal. But the country has recovered economically, with President Kagame's policies encouraging rapid growth and technological advancement. He won a third term in office in the most recent election in 2017 with 98.63% of the vote. Growth remains good - 7.2% in 2018 according to the African Development Bank. But Mr Kagame's critics say he is too authoritarian and does not tolerate dissent.

Belle Curran had the rare condition Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), which meant she required a constant supply of oxygen and had to use a wheelchair. Belle, from Pembrokeshire, was diagnosed aged two and had been on the Great Ormond Street transplant list for 18 months. TheBelle's Story Facebook page,externalconfirmed she died on Friday. Belle, from Wolf's Castle near Haverfordwest, had won lots of bravery awards andinspired many groups,externaland individuals toraise money for charity,external. She was taken behind the scenes at her favourite TV show Masterchef, visiting the studio in London and met presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode.

John Bishop sells mansion to HS2 for ÃÂ£6.8m,"Comedian John Bishop has sold his mansion to HS2 for Â£6.8m - despite his vocal criticism of the project. The controversial Â£55bn high speed rail line will cut journey times from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Mr Bishop, 52, has called the scheme ""flawed"", saying it should be scrapped, yetthe Sun reported,externalhe has made a Â£4.5m profit on the deal. His publicist said his opposition to HS2 remained unchanged and said he had ""no choice"" but to sell. HS2 is one of Britain's biggest infrastructure projects. The Liverpudlian stand-up has been one of the scheme's most outspoken critics, tweeting in 2016: ""Anyone looking at the details sees how flawed it is, including every independent review."" He also agreed with Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg after the politician criticised the project on BBC One's Question Time, tweeting: ""I can't argue with his assessment of HS2 'a complete waste of money that should be scrapped'."" What do we know about HS2? Spending watchdog to probe Crossrail delay Crossrail running Â£600m over budget Mr Bishop put Whatcroft Hall in Northwich, Cheshire, up for sale in 2016. The Grade II listed Georgian mansion comes with 28 acres of land and is described by Historic England as late 18th Century with French windows and entrance hall, a chandelier and ornate fireplace. The new rail line will pass within 150m of the property. When Mr Bishop could not find a buyer he turned to HS2's Need to Sell scheme. Two surveyors analysed the property before making the offer. The comedian bought it for Â£2.25m in 2011 - meaning he sold it for Â£4.5m more - although his publicist said he had invested in refurbishment and the grounds in that time. A spokesman for Mr Bishop said HS2's offer was below market value and significantly less than the original estate agent price. He continued: ""John Bishop maintains his opposition to HS2. ""He is unhappy, like many others affected by the proximity of the proposed line, that he was left with no choice but to sell his family home to HS2. ""The proposed line had rendered it unsellable on the open market - thus destroying all he and his family had worked for."" A spokesman for HS2, which has spent hundreds of millions buying affected properties, said: ""We have to buy land to build HS2, as well as properties impacted by the project, and we have to pay the owners what it's worth. ""Some properties cost more than others, but in each case we are paying a price that's fair to both homeowners and taxpayers. ""We have the budget to do this, and we are within that budget.""

Malaysian golfer dies aged 28 in China,"Irawan won two events on the Asian Development Tour in 2015 Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan has died aged 28 in his hotel room during the Sanya Championship on the Chinese resort island of Hainan. A PGA Tour statement said Irawan's death was because of ""apparent natural causes"" but a coroner's report had not been completed. Irawan, who turned professional in 2013, had missed the cut at the PGA Tour China Series tournament. Organisers cancelled the final round out of respect for Irawan's family. Irawan, who was ranked 1,366th in the world, won two events on the Asian Development Tour in 2015. ""The PGA Tour and the China Golf Association grieve at this loss of one of our members and share sincere condolences with Arie's wife, Marina, and his parents, Ahmad and Jeny,"" said a PGA Tour statement.

Wife home after murder conviction quashed,"Sally Challen has been released from prison after serving nine years in jail for her husband's murder - a conviction that was quashed on Friday A woman who served nine years in jail for her husband's murder before her conviction was quashed has been reunited with her sons. Sally Challen's son David released a picture on Twitter of them and brother James after their mother's release. Mrs Challen, 65, was found guilty of murdering 61-year-old Richard in a hammer attack at their home in Claygate, Surrey and jailed in 2011. Mrs Challen will now face a fresh trial after being bailed on Friday. Her conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in February, following a campaign by her two sons. She admitted killing her husband in August 2010, but denied murder. On Friday, Mr Justice Edis set a further hearing for 7 June and a trial date for 1 July ""if necessary"". Mr Challen, 31, posted a photograph of himself with his mother and brother James, 35, on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: ""First day home with our mother after 9 years in prison."" Speaking outside the Old Bailey on Friday, he said he was ""overjoyed"" about her release, adding: ""Our mother now rejoins our family."" Writing on Twitter after his mother walked out of the prison in Ashford, Surrey, later that day, he said: ""Everyone at HMP Bronzefield have been so lovely to us."" Sally and Richard Challen were married for 31 years - she has never denied she killed him During the two-day appeal hearing in February, the court heard evidence relating to Mrs Challen's state of mind at the time of the killing and the issue of ""coercive control"". Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. The murder conviction was overturned by three judges who said the evidence of a psychiatrist, that Mrs Challen was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing, was not available at the time of her trial and undermined the safety of her conviction. At Friday's hearing, lawyers for Mrs Challen, who has never denied killing her husband, asked for the murder conviction to be reduced to manslaughter but the panel of judges refused and ordered a retrial. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the conviction was quashed, David said: ""The abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account.""

Mother faces Dubai jail for horse insult,"Laleh Shahravesh faces prosecution over two Facebook comments she posted on pictures of her husband remarrying in 2016 A British woman is facing two years in jail in Dubai for calling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"" on Facebook, campaigners have said. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at a Dubai airport after flying there to attend her former husband's funeral. She faces prosecution over two Facebook comments she posted on pictures of her husband remarrying in 2016. Ms Shahravesh's 14-year-old daughter, Paris, has written to Dubai's ruler asking for her mother's release. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the mother-of-one. UAE spy-accused recovery will 'take years' Ms Shahravesh was married to her ex-husband for 18 years, during which time she lived in the United Arab Emirates for eight months, according to the campaign group Detained in Dubai. While she returned to the UK with her daughter, her husband stayed in the United Arab Emirates, and the couple got divorced. Ms Shahravesh discovered her ex-husband was remarrying when she saw photos of the new couple on Facebook. She posted two comments in Farsi, including one that said: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse."" Under the UAE's cyber-crime laws, a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media. Detained in Dubai said Ms Shahravesh could be sentenced to up to two years in prison or fined Â£50,000, despite the fact the 55-year-old wrote the Facebook posts while in the UK. The organisation said Ms Shahravesh's ex-husband's new wife, who lives in Dubai, had reported the comments. It said Ms Shahravesh and her daughter flew to the UAE on 10 March to attend the funeral of their husband and father, who had died of a heart attack. At the time of her arrest, Ms Shahravesh was with her daughter Paris, who later had to fly home on her own, it added. In a letter to to the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Paris said her mother had been forced to sign a statement by police that was ""written in Arabic, which she did not understand"". She added: ""I cannot emphasise enough how scared I felt, especially after losing my father just a week before, as I was having to worry about losing my mother as well."" Closing the letter, she wrote: ""I ask kindly: please, please return my mother's passport, and let her come home."" The chief executive of Detained in Dubai, Radha Stirling, told BBC News that both her organisation and the Foreign Office (FCO) had asked the complainant to withdraw the allegation, but she had refused. The decision ""seems quite vindictive really"", she added. Ms Stirling said her client had been bailed, but her passport had been confiscated and she was currently living in a hotel. She said Ms Shahravesh was ""absolutely distraught"" and it was going to take her a long time to recover from her ordeal. Her daughter was ""very upset"" and had ""been through really what you would call hell"", she said. ""All she wants is to be reunited with her mother,"" Ms Stirling added. UAE 'fines' suspicious phone-check wife The 14-year-old was putting together an appeal in her mother's case, Ms Stirling said. She added that ""no-one would really be aware"" of the severity of cyber-crime laws in the UAE, and the FCO had failed to adequately warn tourists about them. The FCO said in a statement: ""Our staff are supporting a British woman and her family following her detention in the UAE. ""We are in contact with the UAE authorities regarding her case.""

Brexit plea over perishable exports,"The UK government has arranged additional freight capacity Scotland's transport secretary has called for time-sensitive exports to be given priority in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Michael Matheson has written to his UK counterpart Chris Grayling asking for goods such as Scottish seafood to be given space on ferries. He warned that livelihoods were being put at risk by this ""lack of support for exporting businesses"". The UK government said it was preparing for ""all possible"" Brexit outcomes. Mr Matheson claimed that the Department for Transport had failed to take action despite the issue being raised in previous correspondence from the Scottish government. He said: said: ""With an annual value of Â£944m, seafood accounts for 58% of Scotland's total food exports. ""Seafood is highly perishable and therefore dependent on the sort of swift and reliable transport connections which would be damaged by a disorderly UK exit from the EU."" The Scottish government believes livelihoods are at risk in rural communities Mr Matheson is asking the UK government to look again at the issues of prioritisation, and what assurance it can give businesses that their critical routes to market will be maintained in the event of a no-deal. He added: ""We have also asked that these exports are given priority access to the additional ferry capacity secured by the UK government where this is not required for essential supplies. So far, these requests have been refused. ""This lack of support for exporting businesses, which threatens the livelihoods of many in Scotland, especially in our more remote and rural communities, is of great concern to us and to the industries affected. ""The current situation, which puts at risk jobs and livelihoods, is simply not acceptable."" The UK government said the extra shipping it had hired is intended for critical supplies. ""Leaving the European Union with a deal remains our priority,"" a spokesman said, ""but we continue to work with Scottish industry to prepare for all possible outcomes. ""As agreed by ministers across government, only goods critical to the preservation of human and animal welfare - such as medicines - will be given access to the government-secured freight capacity."" He added that unused capacity will be released for sale on the open market and will be available to all suppliers.

Tourists swell Pyongyang marathon turnout,"International runners cross the starting line, waving to the crowds at Kim Il Sung stadium Twice the number of foreign runners took part in Sunday's marathon in the North Korean capital Pyongyang compared to last year, tour firms say. About 950 foreigners entered the annual race, up from 450 in 2018. Political tensions have eased in recent months leading to an increase in tourism, although the regime remains one of the world's most oppressive. A US travel ban to North Korea is still in place following the death of a student in 2017. The marathon is part of the celebrations marking the birth of the founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, in 1912. Tourists run through the strictly controlled capital city, cheered on by North Koreans lining the streets. A foreign competitor talks to a child on the roadside in Pyongyang The event attracts so-called marathon chasers - tourists who run different races across the world. Jasmine Barrett, an Australian running the marathon for the third time, said she kept coming back ""to see the smiles on the children's faces"".

Jams 'worse' despite congestion schemes,"The impact of projects ""across all 168 hours of the week, not just the 10-30 peak hours"" must be considered, the report said Jams have been made worse on dozens of major roads in England by a project to tackle bottlenecks, bosses admit. Evaluation of the first year of Highways England's (HE) Â£317m programme showed rush hour benefits but delays at other times. The A5 and A49 junction in Shropshire, parts of the M6 in Merseyside and M40 in Oxfordshire were the most affected.

John Bishop sells mansion to HS2 for Â£6.8mThe stand-up comedian has previously been an outspoken critic of the controversial Â£55bn project.Entertainment & Arts,"Comedian John Bishop has sold his mansion to HS2 for Â£6.8m - despite his vocal criticism of the project. The controversial Â£55bn high speed rail line will cut journey times from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Mr Bishop, 52, has called the scheme ""flawed"", saying it should be scrapped, yetthe Sun reported,externalhe has made a Â£4.5m profit on the deal. His publicist said his opposition to HS2 remained unchanged and said he had ""no choice"" but to sell. HS2 is one of Britain's biggest infrastructure projects. The Liverpudlian stand-up has been one of the scheme's most outspoken critics, tweeting in 2016: ""Anyone looking at the details sees how flawed it is, including every independent review."" He also agreed with Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg after the politician criticised the project on BBC One's Question Time, tweeting: ""I can't argue with his assessment of HS2 'a complete waste of money that should be scrapped'."" What do we know about HS2? Spending watchdog to probe Crossrail delay Crossrail running Â£600m over budget Mr Bishop put Whatcroft Hall in Northwich, Cheshire, up for sale in 2016. The Grade II listed Georgian mansion comes with 28 acres of land and is described by Historic England as late 18th Century with French windows and entrance hall, a chandelier and ornate fireplace. The new rail line will pass within 150m of the property. When Mr Bishop could not find a buyer he turned to HS2's Need to Sell scheme. Two surveyors analysed the property before making the offer. The comedian bought it for Â£2.25m in 2011 - meaning he sold it for Â£4.5m more - although his publicist said he had invested in refurbishment and the grounds in that time. A spokesman for Mr Bishop said HS2's offer was below market value and significantly less than the original estate agent price. He continued: ""John Bishop maintains his opposition to HS2. ""He is unhappy, like many others affected by the proximity of the proposed line, that he was left with no choice but to sell his family home to HS2. ""The proposed line had rendered it unsellable on the open market - thus destroying all he and his family had worked for."" A spokesman for HS2, which has spent hundreds of millions buying affected properties, said: ""We have to buy land to build HS2, as well as properties impacted by the project, and we have to pay the owners what it's worth. ""Some properties cost more than others, but in each case we are paying a price that's fair to both homeowners and taxpayers. ""We have the budget to do this, and we are within that budget."" The spokesman refused to confirm whether this was the highest single property purchase it had made.

Prince goes undercover with Britain's spies,"The Duke of Cambridge has spent a ""humbling"" three weeks on work placements with three of Britain's security and intelligence agencies. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ were ""full of people from everyday backgrounds doing the most extraordinary work to keep us safe"", Prince William said.

He also observed counter-terrorism teams analysing intelligence and carrying out investigations. Why real-life spooks love spy dramas MI5 'too slow' over Manchester bomber The prince's attachments came to an end on Saturday. ""Spending time inside our security and intelligence agencies, understanding more about the vital contribution they make to our national security, was a truly humbling experience,"" he said.

App users reveal car wash 'slave' cases,"The National Crime Agency says hand car washes are a high-risk business for human exploitation Nearly 1,000 reports of potential human trafficking were made in the first five months of an app enabling hand car wash users to report concerns over workers. The Safe Car Wash app was launched by the Church of England's anti-slavery arm, theClewer Initiative,external, and the Catholic Church last year. Users of the app have flagged up fearful workers, lack of protective clothing and workers living on site. These are among the signs people might be working in conditions of slavery. TheHome Office estimates there are more than 10,000 victims of human slavery in the UK,external- people being forced to work for little or no pay in a variety of industries. One area where exploitation is thought to be widespread is hand car washes. The National Crime Agency, which is supporting the app, said hand car washes were a high-risk business for exploitation, and the report into the results of the Church's mobile phone app gave a further insight into the problem. Between June,when it was launched, and December 2,271 completed entries were made via the app. Organisers said in 41% of these cases - 930 entries - users were told, after responding to a number of questions, there was a likelihood of modern slavery at the hand car wash and advised to to call the Modern Slavery Helpline. But only 18% of those people actually went on to make the call. Of the app users who reported concerns: 48% commented workers didn't have access to protective clothing 80% said the car wash had a cash only policy 17% said workers looked fearful The data collected by the app is anonymised and shared with the National Crime Agency and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, who are targeting modern slavery in the UK. The app asks questions about what the car wash user has seen ""If it was busy it was non-stop work. No breaks from 8 o'clock in the morning until 6:30 in the evening,"" says Stefan, who came to the UK from Romania and ended up working outdoors, in all weathers, at a hand car wash in the North West of England. Stefan is not his real name. He was rescued by anti-Slavery charity, the Medaille Trust after being exploited for months on end. ""The conditions were hard because there was no safety equipment. At the end of the day your hands were really damaged because of the chemicals and the soap."" He says he was bullied and told he would not be paid if he did a bad job. ""I work at this car wash for three months and at this car wash I got Â£300."" Bishop Alistair Redfern, who heads up the Clewer Initiative, said: ""They recruit people who've got mental health issues, broken relationships, come from another culture where they don't trust the police, they may have immigration issues. ""The only signs are if we notice how somebody looks, their demeanour and then we can begin to push back. ""The police can't do that, the local authority can't and health and safety can't. The public can."" If enough answers point to a suspicion of human trafficking the user is urged to call a slavery hotline The app had a healthy take-up, with a flurry of reports coming in the first few weeks and almost 1,000 in the whole of June. Although the rate dropped off from that initial level, it still stabilised by about September at a rate of almost 200 alerts per month. But the report into the scheme's first few months concludes only 18% of people followed advice to call the slavery hotline, which is triggered when users highlight enough signs of human trafficking. Mick Duthie, a former senior detective with the Metropolitan Police now working with the Catholic Church's anti slavery unit, said that may change. ""I think it's a relatively new crime for people to understand,"" he said. ""People from a faith background want to do the right thing but may not have full confidence in what to actually do. So I think the app is great start."" Bishop Alastair Redfern agreed it was good that even this many people had called in their concerns. ""In our success-orientated world you might think why isn't it 80 or 90%? This is a time of great cultural change really, I think 18% in that culture is good. ""I think we need to build on it and say 'because I care for my brothers and sisters who may be suffering, I'll risk pressing the button'."" The app was launched at the General Synod where the Bishop of Gloucester was among those to show it off The Kent and East Sussex Serious Crime Directorate said it thought the app was a useful tool against the slavery trade. It was able to identify three car washes it did not previously know about that showed potential signs of modern slavery and human trafficking. Paul Elms, Head of Prevention for the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, said he thought the app was superb because it gave the user the ability to make referrals directly, but kept them safe as they did not have to confront anyone. He said the app pinpointing the location of each report was enabling authorities to get a detailed picture of the location of car washes across the country.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called for an immediate halt to the fighting and called for talks. Forces under Gen Khalifa Haftar have advanced from the east with the aim of taking Tripoli. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj has accused him of attempting a coup and says his forces will not be allowed to continue. Among the dead was a Red Crescent doctor killed on Saturday. Gen Haftar's forces said they had lost 14 fighters. Earlier the UN appealed for a two-hour truce so casualties and civilians could be evacuated, but fighting continued. And in a statement, Secretary of State Pompeo said the US was ""deeply concerned about fighting near Tripoli"" and stressed the need for talks. ""This unilateral military campaign against Tripoli is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans,"" the statement said. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? International powers have begun evacuating personnel from Libya amid the worsening security situation. Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) forces have been carrying out a multi-pronged attack from the south and west of the city since Thursday. The UN said its call for a humanitarian truce had been ignored and emergency services said they had not been able to enter the areas where fighting was taking place. However a UN spokesman told AFP that they were ""still hoping for a positive response"". On Sunday the LNA said it had carried out its first air strike, a day after the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) hit them with air strikes on Saturday. Fighting has continued around the disused international airport south of the capital that Gen Haftar earlier said his forces had seized. Forces loyal to the GNA have slowed the advance and on Sunday a GNA spokesman told Al-Jazeera TV that the GNA now intended to ""cleanse"" the whole of the country. US Africa Command, responsible for US military operations and liaison in Africa,external, said that due to the ""increased unrest"" it had relocated a contingent of US forces temporarily, but gave no further details on numbers. There were reports of a fast amphibious craft being used in the operation. India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said its full contingent of 15 Central Reserve Police Force peacekeepers had been evacuated from Tripoli because the ""situation in Libya has suddenly worsened"". A market in Tripoli. Residents are said to be stocking up on supplies The Italian multinational oil and gas company, Eni, decided to evacuate all its Italian personnel from the country. The UN is also due to pull out non-essential staff. Residents of Tripoli have reportedly begun stocking up on food and fuel. But BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says many of those near the fighting are remaining in their homes for now, for fear of looting should they leave. Some fear a long operation, which Gen Haftar mounted to take the eastern city of Benghazi from Islamist fighters. Libya has been wracked by unrest since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi. Dozens of militias operate in the country. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli Recently they have been allying either with the UN-backed GNA, based in Tripoli, or the LNA of Gen Haftar, a tough anti-Islamist who has the support of Egypt and the UAE and is strong in eastern Libya. Gen Haftar helped Col Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He returned in 2011 after the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. The unity government was created at talks in 2015 but has struggled to assert national control. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj delivered a TV address on Saturday, saying he would defend the capital. Mr Serraj said he had offered concessions to Gen Haftar to avoid bloodshed, only to be ""stabbed in the back"". Analysis by Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent, in Tunis The rogue general's defiance suggests that, despite international condemnation of his recent moves, he believes he can only secure a place in Libya's future political makeup through militarily means. Diplomats are worried, because the manner and timing of the attack means he is unlikely to back down unless he is defeated. Few thought he would go ahead and launch this operation - which he has long threatened to do - because they believed ongoing talks that saw him go from Paris to Palermo and the UAE for more than a year would buy time until a new political settlement was reached through negotiations and an eventual electoral process.

Novichok victim meets Russian ambassador,"Mr Rowley said he went to the embassy to ask why Russia had ""killed"" Dawn Sturgess Novichok poisoning victim Charlie Rowley has said he ""didn't really get any answers"" after meeting Russia's ambassador in London. The 45-year-old's partner, Dawn Sturgess, died after being exposed to the nerve agent used to attack ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Mr Rowley visited the Russian Embassy after the Sunday Mirror arranged the meeting with Alexander Yakovenko. But he said the diplomat told him Russia was not behind the attack. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, last March but survived. It was months later when Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess, 44, fell sick in nearby Amesbury, having come into contact with a perfume bottle believed to have been used in the poisonings. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. ""I went along to ask them 'Why did your country kill my girlfriend?', but I didn't really get any answers,""Mr Rowley told the Sunday Mirror,external. Novichok victim 'terrified' about health Salisbury declared free of Novichok  Mr Yakovenko had seemed ""genuinely concerned"" during the 90-minute meeting, Mr Rowley said. However, he added that the ambassador fed him ""propaganda"" and told him Russian-made Novichok would have been more powerful, killing more people. ""Some of what he said trying to justify Russia not being responsible was ridiculous,"" he told the paper. Charlie Rowley was exposed to the same poison used to attack Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works In September, Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service said there was sufficient evidence to charge two Russians - known as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - with offences including conspiracy to murder. They are accused of being members of the Russian military intelligence service the GRU. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement, with president Vladimir Putin claiming the two suspects were civilians. During an interview, the pair said they were tourists. The Sunday Mirror quoted Mr Yakovenko saying he and Mr Rowley were ""on the same page"" and wanted to see a report into the investigation published. ""I've seen a normal person who has really suffered a lot and who has suffered a tragedy in his life. If he asked for it, I would give him support,"" he reportedly said.

'Sea swimming helps ease my migraines',"Beth Francis and Andrew Clark have filmed their swims for a documentary about trying to cure Beth's migraines A migraine sufferer who started taking a regular dip in the cold sea to see if it would help ease symptoms has completed her 100 day challenge. Beth Francis from Anglesey has seen her migraines reduce from 25 to 15 a month since her personal crusade started. She is not sure if exercise, being outdoors or swimming has helped. But she has vowed to continue and dozens of people joined her and her partner Andrew Clark for the 100th swim off Llanddona Beach on Sunday. Beth and Andrew said they will continue to swim after completing the challenge Speaking after the swim, Beth described the response to her efforts as ""incredible"". ""We've just been sharing what we've been doing through social media,"" she added. ""When we started it was just a journey, and it very quickly became much more than that. ""So we wanted to make this end day a celebration of everybody else involved as well."" New migraine drug 'works when others fail' 'I live in fear of next migraine attack' 10 things not to say to someone with a migraine Marine biologist Beth, 27, believes swimming in the sea has helped her condition, and she also found getting in the water soon after her symptoms started helped to reduce their severity of her migraines, although she continues to take medication and to see a specialist. In 2017, the chronic migraines became so severe that Beth, who has been a sufferer since the age of nine, had to take sick leave from her first year of a PhD in marine biology at Bangor University. This video can not be played How it all began...Beth and Andrew started filming their swims last year She said she became ""desperate"" with symptoms including tinnitus, nausea, stomach aches and feeling numb on one side. Migraine is very common- it affects one in seven British people - and can be hard to stop. So Beth started regularly taking the plunge in the sea off Anglesey afterreading researchthat ""the sea can be used as motivation to exercise outdoors to influence health and wellbeing"". And she and filmmaker Andrew, 29, started publishing their experiences on social media, under the name100 Days of Vitamin Sea,external. Andrew said the decision to start swimming to try and improve their wellbeing was ""easy"". ""There's a lot of anecdotal stories floating round about the benefit to health of wild swimming and cold water swimming, or people who just get a kick out of it,"" he said. ""Living where we are, when we heard it could ease Beth's migraines or just make us a bit happier, it was an easy opportunity to take."" Beth allowed Andrew to film her good and bad days to highlight her condition Their quest for a cure for Beth also saw the pair sharing their experiences on the BBC Breakfast TV sofa. The project earned them aninternational accolade,externalfor patient-led action as well as support from other sufferers, with swimmers from around the world coming to Llanddola beach for her 100th swim. ""It seems to have touched a lot of people,"" said Beth. ""It has been an amazing journey."" She said a university research project was being set up,looking for participants,externalto take cold showers rather than a dip in the sea, to see if it helped with their migraines. A spokeswoman for The Migraine Trust said she was pleased Beth had found a way to deal with her own symptoms. ""If it is working for her, then that is very positive,"" she said.

"Tourists swell Pyongyang marathon turnoutThe number of foreign runners in the North Korean capital has doubled, but none are from the US.Asia","International runners cross the starting line, waving to the crowds at Kim Il Sung stadium Twice the number of foreign runners took part in Sunday's marathon in the North Korean capital Pyongyang compared to last year, tour firms say. About 950 foreigners entered the annual race, up from 450 in 2018. Political tensions have eased in recent months leading to an increase in tourism, although the regime remains one of the world's most oppressive. A US travel ban to North Korea is still in place following the death of a student in 2017. The marathon is part of the celebrations marking the birth of the founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, in 1912. Tourists run through the strictly controlled capital city, cheered on by North Koreans lining the streets. A foreign competitor talks to a child on the roadside in Pyongyang The event attracts so-called marathon chasers - tourists who run different races across the world. Jasmine Barrett, an Australian running the marathon for the third time, said she kept coming back ""to see the smiles on the children's faces"". ""I'd definitely recommend it to others because it's a great way to see the city and the people who live there,"" she told AFP news agency. There were no American runners due to the tourist ban following the death of US student Otto Warmbier two years ago. He was detained in 2015 after allegedly stealing a propaganda sign. Pyongyang authorities returned the 22-year-old to the US in a coma in 2017 and he died days later. US family sues North Korea over son's death Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? North Korea tourism: A dangerous gamble? Colin Crooks, the British ambassador to North Korea, was one of the runners taking part. He tweeted that the ""atmosphere in the stadium was great"".

North Korea has been the subject of a series of US and international sanctions over Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons and missile tests. Tourism to the region slumped after North Korea launched a series of missiles in 2017.

Downsizing huge beer can hoard 'painful',"Nick West adapted a room in his house to display his collection A man who has spent more than 40 years collecting 9,300 beer cans has had to get rid of the bulk of them so he can buy a smaller house. Nick West, from Langford in North Somerset, has moved into increasingly larger homes to keep pace with his growing collection. But he now wants to downsize, meaning a reduction in his collection to 1,500. At one point, Mr West was buying 650 cans a year and he admitted stopping would be ""very painful"". Mr West started his collection in 1975 when he was 16 years old, after seeing a report on TV about a man who sold beer cans to collectors in the US. ""I wasn't old enough to buy them myself but luckily my parents humoured me and would buy me a can or two, if they remembered, in their weekly shop,"" said Mr West. He met his wife Deborah a year later while still at school, and she bought him a book about beer can collecting. ""So she knew what she was letting herself in for,"" he said. His first can was a half pint of Heineken - and the oldest can in the collection dates from 1936. The oldest beer can in the collection dates from 1936 Some of the cans still have beer in them but some have been emptied by making a small hole in the bottom. Mr West estimated he has spent at least Â£25,000 on his collection over 42 years. He spent two years taking photographs of each individual can, and had to see a doctor after developing tennis elbow and housemaid's knee as a result. ""Stopping collecting was a very painful thing to do. It's been such a massive part of my life,"" he said. ""But with the introduction of new craft beer cans, I was buying 650 cans a year just to keep up, and I no longer had the money or space for them."" During his last house move Mr West had to to pack his collection into 150 large removal boxes and hire two vans - one for his furniture and one for his beer cans. In one of his previous homes he even built an extension to make more room. Now, in readiness for the next move, he has sold about 6,000 cans to collectors around the world and given 1,800 to local museum Oakham Treasures. It donated money to the charity Action for ME on behalf of Mr West, whose daughter was diagnosed with the condition when she was 10 years old.

Hammond 'optimistic' over talks,"The chancellor is meeting EU finance ministers in Bucharest Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he is ""optimistic"" Brexit discussions between the government and Labour can reach ""some form of agreement"". Mr Hammond said there were ""no red lines"" in the meetings. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""waiting to see the red lines move"" and had not ""noticed any great change in the government's position"". Three days of talks ended on Friday without agreement and Labour said no more talks were planned this weekend. Downing Street responded by saying it was prepared to pursue alterations to the deal and ready to hold further discussions with Labour over the weekend. The talks have been taking place to try to find a proposal to put to MPs which could break the Brexit deadlock in the Commons before an emergency EU summit on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of an EU finance ministers' meeting in Bucharest, Mr Hammond told reporters: ""We are expecting to exchange some more text with the Labour Party today, so this is an ongoing process."" Reality Check: What's in the Brexit political declaration? Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit explained in flowcharts Mr Hammond said: ""We should complete the process in Parliament... Some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions to us. Of course, we have to be prepared to discuss them. ""Our approach to these discussions with Labour is we have no red lines. We will go into these talks with an open mind and discuss everything with them in a constructive fashion."" Jeremy Corbyn said the government's position had not changed Speaking while campaigning for next month's local elections in Plymouth, Mr Corbyn suggested votes in Parliament were now the most likely way of providing a breakthrough on Brexit, saying his key priority was ""to avoid crashing out of the EU with no deal"". Mr Corbyn told the BBC: ""We have a party position on the future relationship with Europe... and we will responsibly discharge those duties, but we are determined to make sure there is no crashing out."" The prime minister has been unable to get Parliamentary backing for the withdrawal agreement she secured with the EU in November last year, which sets out the terms of the UK's departure. Labour has said it wants fundamental changes to a document drawn up at the same time, known as the political declaration. It sets out ambitions for the future relationship between the UK and EU after Brexit - including on trade, regulations, security and fishing rights - but does not legally commit either party. Shadow home secretary Ms Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Labour had engaged in the talks ""in good faith"" and shadow Brexit minister Sir Keir Starmer had written to the government to say he wants them to continue. She said there was concern that the government has made ""no movement"" on altering the political declaration and ""that is key"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott highlighted Labour's concerns over the political declaration A Downing Street spokesman said after Friday's talks that ""serious proposals"" were made and it was ""prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says there was a sense that the government has ""only offered clarifications on what might be possible from the existing documents, rather than adjusting any of their actual proposals"". She added that both sides agreed the talks are not yet over, but there were no firm commitments for when further discussions might take place. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by the House of Commons. Prime Minister Theresa May has written to European Council President Donald Tusk torequest an extension to the Brexit process until 30 Junebut says if MPs agree a deal, the UK should be able to leave before European parliamentary elections are held on 23 May. She says the UK would prepare to field candidates in May's European Parliament elections if MPs failed to back a deal. But education minister Nadhim Zahawi told the Today programme it would be ""a suicide note of the Conservative Party if we had to fight the European elections"". He added the elections would pose an ""existential threat"" to both the Conservatives and Labour if they ""haven't been able to deliver Brexit"". Mr Zahawi suggested that if an agreement could not be found from the talks with Labour, MPs should be asked to find a compromise on a deal through a preferential voting system. Any extension to the UK's departure would have to be unanimously approved by EU leaders. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button A senior EU source told BBC Europe editor Katya Adler thatDonald Tusk would propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension, with the option of the UK leaving sooner once Parliament had ratified a deal. French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin said such a delay would require the UK to put forward a proposal with ""clear and credible political backing"". ""In the absence of such a plan, we would have to acknowledge that the UK chose to leave the EU in a disorderly manner,"" she added. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE it was unlikely that a UK request for a delay would be vetoedby any EU member nations as it could cause economic hardship in the bloc and ""they wouldn't be forgiven for it"". But he said there was growing frustration from some nations which see Brexit as distracting from other things.

Libya PM 'to defend capital' as rebels near,"Pro-government militias from the city of Misrata have reportedly been moving to defend Tripoli Libya's UN-backed prime minister has vowed to defend the capital Tripoli as forces loyal to a rival advance from the east. In a televised address, Fayez al-Serraj accused Gen Khalifa Haftar of launching a coup, saying his troops would be met with force. Gen Haftar's troops are on the outskirts of the city and say they have seized Tripoli's international airport. Tripoli is the base of the UN-backed, internationally recognised government. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. In his address on TV, he warned of a ""war without a winner"". He said: ""We have extended our hands towards peace but after the aggression that has taken place on the part of forces belonging to Haftar, he will find nothing but strength and firmness."" Mr Serraj said he had offered concessions to Gen Haftar to avoid bloodshed, only to be ""stabbed in the back"". Gen Haftar ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli on Thursday. His Libyan National Army (LNA) forces have been carrying out a multi-pronged attack from the south and west of the city. However, forces loyal to Mr Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) have now slowed the advance. ""Intensive air strikes"" were carried out by GNA aircraft 50km (30 miles) south of Tripoli on Saturday. One militia from Misrata told AFP it had aligned with the GNA and had sent armed vehicles to Tajura, in the eastern suburbs, to counter the LNA. The LNA said it had seized the disused international airport south of the capital. US Africa Command, responsible for US military operations and liaison in Africa,external, said that due to the ""increased unrest"" it had relocated an unspecified contingent of US forces, but gave no further details. Tripoli residents have begun stocking up on food and fuel. Libya has been wracked by unrest since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi. Dozens of militias operate in the country. Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli Recently they have been allying either with the UN-backed GNA, based in Tripoli, or the LNA of Gen Haftar, a tough anti-Islamist who has the support of Egypt and the UAE and is strong in eastern Libya. Gen Haftar helped Col Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He returned in 2011 after the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. The unity government was created at talks in 2015 but has struggled to assert national control. Analysis by Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent, in Tunis The rogue general's defiance suggests that, despite international condemnation of his recent moves, he believes he can only secure a place in Libya's future political makeup through militarily means. Diplomats are worried, because the manner and timing of the attack means he is unlikely to back down unless he is defeated. Few thought he would go ahead and launch this operation - which he has long threatened to do - because they believed ongoing talks that saw him go from Paris to Palermo and the UAE for more than a year would buy time until a new political settlement was reached through negotiations and an eventual electoral process. Today, Western nations have few cards to play to de-escalate the violence and once again find themselves in a position where they may need to start from scratch. UN-backed talks aimed at drawing up a road map for new elections have been scheduled for 14-16 April in the Libyan city of Ghadames. UN envoy Ghassan Salame insisted the talks would go ahead, unless serious obstacles prevented it, saying ""we won't give up this political work quickly"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Tripoli just last Thursday to discuss the situation. But Gen Haftar has said his troops will not stop until they have defeated ""terrorism"". The G7 group of major industrial nations has urged all parties ""to immediately halt all military activity"" and Russia has also called on parties to find an agreement.

Taking the plunge to ease migraines,"Beth Francis and Andrew Clark have filmed their swims for a documentary about trying to cure Beth's migraines A migraine sufferer who started taking a regular dip in the cold sea to see if it would help ease symptoms has completed her 100 day challenge. Beth Francis from Anglesey has seen her migraines reduce from 25 to 15 a month since her personal crusade started. She is not sure if exercise, being outdoors or swimming has helped. But she has vowed to continue and dozens of people joined her and her partner Andrew Clark for the 100th swim off Llanddona Beach on Sunday. Beth and Andrew said they will continue to swim after completing the challenge Speaking after the swim, Beth described the response to her efforts as ""incredible"". ""We've just been sharing what we've been doing through social media,"" she added. ""When we started it was just a journey, and it very quickly became much more than that. ""So we wanted to make this end day a celebration of everybody else involved as well."" New migraine drug 'works when others fail' 'I live in fear of next migraine attack' 10 things not to say to someone with a migraine Marine biologist Beth, 27, believes swimming in the sea has helped her condition, and she also found getting in the water soon after her symptoms started helped to reduce their severity of her migraines, although she continues to take medication and to see a specialist. In 2017, the chronic migraines became so severe that Beth, who has been a sufferer since the age of nine, had to take sick leave from her first year of a PhD in marine biology at Bangor University. This video can not be played How it all began...Beth and Andrew started filming their swims last year She said she became ""desperate"" with symptoms including tinnitus, nausea, stomach aches and feeling numb on one side. Migraine is very common- it affects one in seven British people - and can be hard to stop. So Beth started regularly taking the plunge in the sea off Anglesey afterreading researchthat ""the sea can be used as motivation to exercise outdoors to influence health and wellbeing"". And she and filmmaker Andrew, 29, started publishing their experiences on social media, under the name100 Days of Vitamin Sea,external. Andrew said the decision to start swimming to try and improve their wellbeing was ""easy"". ""There's a lot of anecdotal stories floating round about the benefit to health of wild swimming and cold water swimming, or people who just get a kick out of it,"" he said. ""Living where we are, when we heard it could ease Beth's migraines or just make us a bit happier, it was an easy opportunity to take."" Beth allowed Andrew to film her good and bad days to highlight her condition Their quest for a cure for Beth also saw the pair sharing their experiences on the BBC Breakfast TV sofa. The project earned them aninternational accolade,externalfor patient-led action as well as support from other sufferers, with swimmers from around the world coming to Llanddola beach for her 100th swim. ""It seems to have touched a lot of people,"" said Beth. ""It has been an amazing journey."" She said a university research project was being set up,looking for participants,externalto take cold showers rather than a dip in the sea, to see if it helped with their migraines. A spokeswoman for The Migraine Trust said she was pleased Beth had found a way to deal with her own symptoms. ""If it is working for her, then that is very positive,"" she said. ""Migraine is an utterly miserable condition.""
