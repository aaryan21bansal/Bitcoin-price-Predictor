Scaramucci sacked as Trump media chief,"This video can not be played 10 memorable Mooch quotes in 10 days White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has been fired after fewer than 10 days in the post. The former Wall Street financier had drawn criticism after calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced tirade against his own colleagues. President Donald Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and spokesman, Sean Spicer, both left their posts after Mr Scaramucci's appointment. Chief of staff Gen John Kelly, sworn in on Monday, sacked Mr Scaramucci. The president was also unhappy with Mr Scaramucci's performance, the White House confirmed. Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said the president thought Mr Scaramucci's comments to the reporter ""were inappropriate for a person in that position"". This video can not be played Scaramucci comments ""inappropriate"" - White House He has not been moved to another White House role, she added. Mr Trump had tweeted in the morning about job and wage figures, and insisted there is ""No WH chaos"", referring to reports about fighting among White House staff. Who is Anthony Scaramucci? What else happens in 10 days? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The people around Donald Trump Mr Scaramucci had boasted of reporting directly to the president, rather than to his chief of staff. This video can not be played The feud between Priebus and Scaramucci decoded Gen Kelly, who had formerly served as secretary of homeland security, was sworn in on Monday morning at the White House. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Staff in this White House have the job life expectancy of mayflies. Only 10 days ago, Mr Scaramucci burst on to the scene as the fast-talking New Yorker whose fanatical devotion to the president was matched only by his distaste for the established order. Although his job tenure was short, he managed to do a lot of order-disrupting. Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned to give Mr Scaramucci a ""clean slate"". Then, like a heat-seeking missile powered by foul language, Mr Scaramucci went after Reince Priebus, who was unceremoniously cashiered on Friday. Now it is Mr Scaramucci's turn to wipe down the slate. If Mr Scaramucci's exit was indeed orchestrated by John Kelly, it could be an indication that the former general is quickly asserting control over what has been a rancorous White House. Perhaps it is the first sign of order being established, even if the brevity of Mr Scaramucci's tenure - he wasn't officially set to begin until 15 August - will be a short-term embarrassment for the president. Then again, it could be that the pace of change is quickening as the Trump administration approaches the centre of the vortex. Only time will tell. Allow Twitter content?

The resignation of Reince Priebus came on Friday after Mr Scaramucci posted and then deleted a tweet which many interpreted as an accusation and a threat against Mr Priebus. Mr Scaramucci also called a reporter to attack Mr Priebus as a ""paranoid schizophrenic"" and accuse him of leaking information to the media. This video can not be played Scaramucci: ""Where I grew up, we're front stabbers"" During the on-the-record phone call, he also made vulgar statements about chief strategist Steve Bannon.

Man sees wife and children die in crash,"The carriageway was closed in both directions to allow the air ambulance to land A woman and her two young children have died in a crash witnessed by her husband. The woman's car collided with an oncoming lorry on the A361 near Barnstaple in Devon at 08:25 BST. The woman's husband was travelling in a separate vehicle and saw the crash unfolding behind him. The family is believed to have been on holiday in Devon from the Milton Keynes area. The road has now reopened. More on the crash and other news Insp Richard McLellan said: ""It would seem that a car travelling towards Barnstaple, for unknown reasons at the moment, has crossed the centre white line and hit an oncoming truck.

'America's toughest sheriff' found guilty,"Arpaio was known for his anti-immigration stance, and tough enforcement tactics Joe Arpaio, the controversial former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, has been found guilty of criminal contempt - a federal offence. He was found to have violated a judge's 2001 order that he cease detaining migrants who are not suspected of having committed a state crime. Judge Susan Bolton determined that by detaining those living in the US illegally, Mr Arpaio was acting as a de facto wing of the federal government. He faces up to six months in prison. However, lawyers say it is unlikely that he will ever serve time behind bars. Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio 'profiled' Hispanics, says judge Mr Arpaio, 85, had boasted of being ""America's toughest sheriff"" during his time as the elected lawman of Maricopa County, which includes the city of Phoenix. This video can not be played Arpaio said in 2011 interview that he was protecting jobs He rose to national prominence due to his tough stance against illegal immigration. However, a judge reminded him during his trial that only federal officers have jurisdiction over immigration. He had claimed that the judge's injunction in 2011, which he was found to have violated, was vague and unclearly worded. But a judge found on Monday that Mr Arpaio had understood the temporary injunction, which was later made permanent, and had deliberately violated it to score political points ahead of his re-election campaign in 2012. He was known during his tenure as sheriff for sweeps of undocumented immigrants in Hispanic communities, and for detaining Spanish-speakers under suspicion of being undocumented migrants. He also famously required his inmates to wear pink underpants and socks. Mr Arpaio, in a statement, insisted that the judge who issued the ruling was biased, and said he would appeal to have a jury hear his case. ""Joe Arpaio is in this for the long haul, and he will continue his fight to vindicate himself, to prove his innocence, and to protect the public,"" a statement issued by him reads.

Man paints his own parking restrictions,"Mr Taylor says that his unofficial yellow lines stop people from parking on blind corners A New Zealand activist who has unlawfully painted yellow line parking restrictions outside his house in Wellington for the last 20 years says he has done so to improve road safety and to protest against gentrification. Russell Taylor said it was necessary to stop cars from parking dangerously in an increasingly busy street. ""It's a major contribution to road safety,"" he told the BBC. The city council says the lines are illegal and will be removed. My Taylor says he has painted the lines intermittently over the last two decades when the parking problem in his street has become especially bad. ""It's a protest against the failure of our council to take action,"" he said. His personal campaign has attracted thousands of online comments since it was highlighted by local media on Monday. Mr Taylor said that life in Holloway Road has changed dramatically since he moved there in 1979. Mr Taylor - who says he looks like British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn - staunchly supports better road safety in his street ""Hardly anyone had cars then but now it has all changed as the area has become more middle class and gentrified. ""Cars park on blind corners, and on occasions fire lorries and rubbish collection vehicles have been unable to turn around because vehicles are parked on both sides of the road. ""More recently we have had the additional problem of drivers going far too fast down our narrow street."" The activist said the only way to combat the problem was by using a can of yellow paint stored in his garage. The homemade yellow lines on Holloway Road in Wellington A city council spokesman,Richard MacLean, told Stuff New Zealand,externalthat it was aware there was a parking problem in Holloway Road, and it will shortly be discussed by residents and councillors. Mr Maclean said that among the measures the council was considering was the implementation of ""no stopping"" restrictions later this year. He said it was unlikely that Mr Taylor would be punished for his long-running, unofficial road-marking campaign. ""Given the glorious and healthy history of civic activism in Holloway Road, we would rather not pick an unnecessary fight with the locals,"" he said.

Riot staff tackle prison disturbance,"This video can not be played Riot-trained staff were sent to Mount Prison in Hertfordshire Riot-trained prison staff were sent to a jail amid reports of violence on two wings. Sources earlier told BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw that one wing of HMP The Mount in Hertfordshire and half of another wing had been ""lost"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) later said the incident was ""resolved"" and no staff or prisoners had been injured. A report into the jail published earlier,externalhighlighted staffing problems and said violence was an issue. The Mount, in Bovingdon village near Hemel Hempstead, opened in 1987 and is classed as a category C male prison. A ""tornado team"" made up of riot-trained staff arrived at the jail at about 18:30, equipped with shields and batons while fire, police and ambulance crews were on standby outside. Riot officers with shields entered HMP The Mount at about 18:30 BST The MoJ said officers had dealt with an ""incident involving a number of prisoners"". The BBC understands the wings involved were H and L, which house 110 and 117 prisoners. At about 23:45, a Prison Service spokesman said: ""Specialist prison staff resolved an incident involving a number of prisoners. There were no injuries to staff or prisoners. ""The offenders responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."" Earlier on Monday, the Independent Monitoring Board published its annual review into conditions at Mount Prison and said it had ""struggled"" with staff shortages. There were 24 vacancies out of a total of 136 officers in February, it added. It also claimed violence ""grew considerably"" throughout the year and that drugs were readily available, in particular the synthetic cannabis substitute spice. The report says concerns raised last year had not been addressed by the MoJ. The Prison Reform Trust calls this type of institution one where ""prison staff think [inmates] will not escape"", while acknowledging they ""cannot be trusted in an open prison"". Prison affairs academic and blogger Alex Cavendish hadtweeted on Saturday:,external""Staff shortages at HMP The Mount (Herts) are so severe that this is the 3rd weekend of total lockdown. Meals given at cell door. Trouble brewing."" HMP The Mount is for prisoners coming to the end of longer sentences Mark Fairhurst, of the Prison Officers Association, said staff shortages in UK jails were ""an epidemic"" and partly due to ""poor salaries"". ""We need to increase the starting salary to incentivise people to join and then we need to give them regular increments to incentivise them to stay,"" he said. Mr Fairhurst added it was difficult to retain staff because of ""adverse working conditions, the violence they face and poor salary"". Hertfordshire Police, Hertfordshire Fire Brigade and East of England Ambulance crews stood by as riot officers entered the prison The Mount is built on a former RAF station site and has more than 1,000 prisoners, according to the MoJ. It is described as a ""hybrid training and resettlement prison"" for inmates in the final six months of their sentences. A 2015 inspection of the prison found The Mount was ""reasonably safe and felt calm and well ordered"", but chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick added that there was ""room for improvement"". In March 2016 an inmate at The Mountstabbed a fellow prisoner with a shard of glassfrom a microwave. Riot staff called to prison violence.

Game of Thrones script 'stolen in hack',"An upcoming Game of Thrones script was allegedly stolen A group of hackers claims to have stolen the script for a forthcoming Game of Thrones episode and other data in a breach at entertainment firm HBO. The group says it has 1.5 terabytes of the company's data and has posted episodes of Ballers and Room 104 online. It added that more material would be released ""soon"". HBO confirmed it had experienced a ""cyber-incident"" in a statement. In an emailpublished by Entertainment Weekly,external, the hackers appeared to offer more details in exchange for favourable coverage. ""Hi to all mankind,"" they wrote. ""The greatest leak of cyber-space era is happening."" They encouraged recipients to download the material and added: ""Whoever spreads well, we will have an interview with him."" Reports have said the allegedly stolen Game of Thrones script appears to be from the fourth episode of season seven, which is currently being broadcast.

Mystery of Niagara 'black cloud' explained,"It was initially feared the black discharge was an oil leak Mystery surrounding a foul-smelling black cloud that appeared in water at the base of the Niagara Falls on the US-Canadian border has been explained. Experts say the discharge - which at one point was feared to be an oil leak - was caused by residue from black carbon filters used to clean the water. The leak happened during maintenance work on Saturday, US officials say. The Niagara Falls Water Board (NFWB) has since apologised for causing alarm to residents and tourists. In a statement,externalthe board said the ""inky water"" was the result of ""routine, necessary and short term change in the waste water treatment process"" at its plant near the city of Buffalo. The black cloud remained in the water for much of Saturday ""The blackish water contained some accumulated solids and carbon residue within permitted limits and did not include any organic type oils or solvents,"" the statement said. ""The unfortunate odour was limited to the normal sewer water discharge smell,"" it added. Officials say the plant had the correct paperwork to release the discharge - which came from one of its five sediment filtration basins and was being flushed out over the weekend in preparation for contractors to begin upgrade work. Niagara Falls' colourful new look Among the first to notice the problem was Pat Proctor, vice president of Rainbow Air Inc, which provides helicopter tours over the falls. He said the black residue remained in the water for several hours on Saturday before it dissipated. ""I was just praying it wasn't an oil leak,"" Mr Proctor told the BBC. ""It had spread across a half-mile area, looked very menacing and smelt terrible."" Usually such basin discharges are not carried out at peak tourism times, like last weekend, he said. The Niagara Falls straddle the US and Canada. They are made up of three separate waterfalls and have been a popular tourist attraction for more than 200 years, in addition to being a major source of hydroelectric power.

No 10: Free movement ends with Brexit,"Suggestions that freedom of movement will continue after the UK leaves the EU are wrong, Downing Street has said. On Friday, Chancellor Philip Hammond warned full controls could take ""some time"", prompting speculation free movement may continue in all but name after the UK leaves in March 2019. But amid claims of splits in cabinet, No 10 has moved to make clear free movement will end when the UK leaves. It said: ""It would be wrong to suggest it... will continue as it is now."" Downing Street's move followed days of uncertainty over future immigration policy during any transitional phase after Brexit. Fox holds firm on opposing free movement UK won't cut taxes, Hammond tells French Johnson attacks Cable's quit 'lies' The PM's spokesman said plans for a registration system for migrants arriving after March 2019 had been set out last week, and Prime Minister Theresa May had raised, as long ago as January, the prospect of a transition period before the post-Brexit system was implemented. At the moment, citizens from the other 27 EU member states have the right to come and work and live in the UK. Ministers have said Brexit will enable the UK to control who comes to the country and in what numbers but there has been debate within government about how quickly this will happen and what its impact will be. Mr Hammond has said the cabinet is united behind the need for a transitional period of up to three years after Brexit, a period of time in which he said many arrangements would ""remain very similar to how they were the day before we exited the European Union"". The chancellor has suggested that many things will remain the same after Brexit He has said his goal is to minimise the level of disruption to British business and consumers, by retaining access to European markets both for goods and workers. But International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has warned that allowing unregulated EU immigration to continue would be a betrayal of last year's referendum result, while a former Brexit minister, David Jones, suggested some ministers were being ""kept out of the loop"" by No 10 and the Treasury. No 10 said the shape of post-Brexit immigration controls would become clearer in due course, with legislation due to be presented to Parliament later this year. ""It would be wrong to speculate on what these might look like or to suggest that freedom of movement will continue,"" the spokesman said. ""Free movement will end in March 2019. We've published proposals on citizen's rights. Last week the home secretary set out a registration system for EU nationals arriving post March 2019."" By assistant political editor Norman Smith We've had days of rival ministers setting out their different views, with former Remain ministers the loudest - the chancellor saying there might have to be a three year transitional period after the UK leaves and the home secretary saying EU migrants will still be able to come to the UK  provided they register. Downing Street has now decided that enough is enough and that it is time to stop the bickering. Number 10 says the plan is as Theresa May set out inher big speech at the start of the year,external. But will this attempt by No 10 to reassert control work? There are two reasons why this might prove tricky. The first is the diminution in Mrs May's authority after the election; the second is that there remain very profound differences between the ideologues, who believe the UK must leave to regain sovereignty, and the pragmatists who think the UK's economic well-being comes first. Downing Street also rejected the possibility of an ""off-the-shelf"" trade deal with the EU such as that enjoyed by Norway and other members of the European free trade association - which grants them access to the single market. The idea has been floated by Mr Hammond among others. Cabinet ministers have also sought to play down talks of rifts and factions within Theresa May's top team over the terms of any transitional deal. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said future immigration rules would be decided as part of the current Brexit negotiations and dismissed suggestions there were ""arguments raging around the cabinet table"" while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted the NHS must still be able to recruit new staff from across Europe. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has claimed there is a ""deep, unbridgeable chasm"" between what he has characterised as Brexit ""fundamentalists and pragmatists"" within the government while Labour's Peter Dowd said the government had ""broken down into farce"".

'Fired! White House in turmoil',"The abrupt dismissal of Donald Trump's communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, makes many of the front pages. ""White House in turmoil"" is theheadline in the Times,external, which says the new Chief of Staff, the battle-hardened General John Kelly, did not take long to end Mr Scaramucci's brief career as the West Wing's chief troublemaker. The i newspaper says,externalMr Scaramucci's recent foul-mouthed tirade against senior colleagues was seen as evidence of a lack of discipline that left him devoid of any credibility. The paper says he was apparently escorted from the White House by security guards. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Several papers report on the intervention by Downing Street in the Brexit debate. The Daily Telegraph says Number 10 moved to soothe cabinet nerves,external- and rein in Chancellor Philip Hammond - by appearing to contradict his suggestion that free movement of people would continue after the UK leaves the EU. The Sun attacks Mr Hammond,external, saying he is starting to prove a liability, with every speech and interview an accident waiting to happen. The paper urges the prime minister to tell him to belt up. But the chancellor is defended by former Conservative leader William Hague,writing in the Telegraph,external. He says Mr Hammond deserves great credit for suggesting a transition period after Brexit, during which several aspects of the UK's relationship with the EU would be broadly similar. Lord Hague calls it a plan to rescue Brexit from approaching disaster. The Guardian reports that the judge-led inquiry,externalinto the Grenfell Tower fire might have to suspend operations for a long period if prosecutors authorise corporate manslaughter charges. The paper says the identification of Kensington and Chelsea Council as a possible defendant, along with the organisation that managed the tower block, has created the potential for conflict with the public inquiry. Survivors and residents, it says, have expressed alarm at the prospect of the inquiry being delayed or diluted. The Daily Mail's front page says,externalpupils as young as 11 could have lessons in breastfeeding to make the practice more widespread. The paper says only a tiny percentage of British mothers still breastfeed after one year. The paper quotes the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health as saying that many women are still too embarrassed to breastfeed in cafes or public places. It believes that educating girls - and boys - from an early age will help remove any potential stigma. The Times reports that the Isle of Skye is debating,externalthe introduction of a tourist tax to help it cope with a massive influx of visitors. Some local groups are said to believe that a visitor levy would do more harm than good.

iPhone thieves 'robbed moving truck',"The thieves used a van to steal boxes of iPhones from a moving truck (file picture) Five Romanian men have been arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of stealing iPhones worth 500,000 euros ($590,000; Â£447,430) from a moving truck. They allegedly tailgated the vehicle before one of them climbed onto the bonnet of their van and broke into the truck in front of them. Boxes of iPhones were then passed back through the van's roof. The theft took place on the night of 24 July, on the A73 motorway near Horst. Dutch news outlet ED,externalsaid such gangs often modify their vehicles by putting an anti-slip mat on the bonnet. The risky theft tactic was first seen in Germany in 2008, the outlet said. Belgium has witnessed similar incidents, almost all targeting smartphones. Sometimes, a grinding wheel is used to break into the truck. Gold stolen in France motorway heist 'Specialist' thieves steal 24,000 bees Student caught stealing exam through duct Police spokesman Ed Kraszewski said Dutch police had been investigating truck thefts for some time, but doubted a theft like this could be pulled off. ""The truck was taking its freight from A to B and did not stop. Even so [the phones] were gone,"" he said. ""So it must have happened that way. And now we finally have the evidence, with the van and the loot."" The men, aged from 33 to 43, were arrested on Saturday at a holiday park in Otterlo, in the central province of Gelderland. Police found iPhones at the address, and the van they believe was used in the crime. The men are set to appear before a judge on Tuesday.

Grenfell fire: 12-year-old victim named,"Jessica Urbano Ramirez was described as 'loving, kind-hearted and caring'. The family of a 12-year-old girl identified as one of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire have spoken of their anger at the loss of their ""little angel"". Jessica Urbano Ramirez has now been formally identified as one of the 80 people killed in the blaze on 14 June. In a statement, the family said they were ""totally crushed"" by the news. Nura Jemal, 35, was also named by the police, bringing the total number of formal identifications to 45. Baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital on 14 June, has also been recorded by police as a victim of the fire. Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Who were the victims? Work to start on covering Grenfell Tower In a statement released by the Metropolitan Police, Jessica's family said it had been ""probably the hardest news any parents will ever have had to bear"" learning of her death. But as well as paying tribute to the ""loving, kind-hearted and caring"" schoolgirl, the family called for justice for all of the victims. ""Nothing will ever bring our little girl back, and we are angry that this should ever have happened to our little angel,"" they said. ""We will not rest until we get justice for her and for the many other lives lost as a result of this crime. ""We will only feel justice has been served when the highest possible charges are applied to culpable individuals. We entrust this task to the authorities in the hope that we will not be let down."" Nura's family described the wife and mother as ""vibrant, full of life and positive-minded"", as well as devoted to her faith in Islam. Nura Jemal has been formally identified as one of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire ""You were grateful and appreciated even the smallest things in life,"" they added. ""And your joy was contagious. Being around you could lighten up anyone's day in a matter of seconds. ""You were so passionate when you talked about heaven. Even your last words were about asking for forgiveness. You seemed to know that heaven was waiting for you and your family."" Earlier on Monday, the inquests of three victims were opened at Westminster Coroner's Court. Forty-one inquests have now been started. Eslah Elgwahry, 64, was found on the 23rd floor of the tower block and is believed to have lived on the 19th floor. Joseph Daniels, 69, was found on the 16th floor of the building. A third victim, a 35-year-old woman whose family asked for her not to be named, was discovered on the 23rd floor of the 24-storey building. The preliminary cause of death for all three victims was recorded as ""consistent with the effects of fire"".

US imposes sanctions on Venezuela leader,"Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro is now subject to a US asset freeze The US government has frozen any assets held by Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro in the US, after he held a controversial poll. Under the sanctions, US firms and individuals are banned from doing business with him. The election of a constituent assembly on Sunday was held amid mass protests. At least 10 people were killed. Mr Maduro saidthe poll was a ""vote for the revolution"", saying ""sanctions from the empire don't scare me"". It is unclear whether the president holds investments in the US and Washington's action was likely to be seen as symbolic. ""The emperor Donald Trump took decisions against me that show his desperation and hate,"" President Maduro said in a televised speech on Monday. ""I don't obey orders from foreign governments and never will... Sanction me as you wish, but the Venezuelan people have decided to be free and I am the independent president of a free nation."" Venezuela's new constituent assembly will have the power to rewrite the constitution and disband the opposition-controlled National Assembly. The opposition coalition, which boycotted the election, said 88% of voters had abstained. It has refused to recognise the poll. Electoral officials said the turnout was 41.5%. Protesters have blocked a number of roads in the capital, Caracas. A march scheduled for later on Monday to honour those killed on polling day appears to have been postponed until Wednesday, the day that the constituent assembly is due to meet. Venezuela's attorney general, Luisa Ortega, a vocal critic of the Maduro government, called the vote an expression of ""dictatorial ambition"". This video can not be played Clashes and demonstrations took place in the capital Caracas on Sunday The US had previously warned that it would not recognise the election, with President Donald Trump vowing ""strong and swift economic actions"" if it went ahead. The sanctions wereannounced in a statement,externalby US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ""Yesterday's illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people,"" he said. Venezuela's constituent assembly explained What lies ahead for divided Venezuela? What is behind the crisis? Despacito stars condemn Venezuelan leader ""By sanctioning Maduro, the United States makes clear our opposition to the policies of his regime and our support for the people of Venezuela who seek to return their country to a full and prosperous democracy."" Mr Maduro is only the fourth foreign leader to be blacklisted in this way, Mr Mnuchin said. US National Security Adviser HR McMaster said the Venezuelan leader had joined an ""exclusive club"" that also includes Syria's Bashar al-Assad, North Korea's Kim Jong-un, and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (L) and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster expressed fears for Venezuela's democracy On 26 July, the US Treasury had imposed sanctions on 13 current and former Venezuelan officials in a bid to deter Mr Maduro from holding the poll. Those targeted include the interior minister and the head of the army. ""Who do these imperialists in the United States think they are?"" Mr Maduro said in response to these sanctions. ""The government of the world?"" He called the sanctions ""illegal, insolent and unprecedented"". International condemnation of the latest vote was widespread on Monday. The EU expressed ""preoccupation for the fate of democracy in Venezuela"", and said it doubted it could accept the results. However, Russia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia have stood by Mr Maduro. Venezuela's 30 million citizens are suffering through shortages of basic goods and medicines, as the country's weakened economy declines still further. A wave of anti-government protests has left more than 120 people dead in four months. More protests are expected on Monday So far, Washington has not imposed restrictions on the country's huge oil exports to the US. Mr Mnuchin would not confirm whether oil sanctions were being considered, but said President Trump had decided not to take measures that would hurt the ""Venezuelan people"" rather than Mr Maduro's allies. The Treasury secretary also urged those elected to the 545-member Constituent Assembly not to take their seats. Last week, he warned that those elected could be subject to US sanctions for ""undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela"".

Reality Check: More mental health staff?,"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said there will be 21,000 more nurses, therapists and consultants working in mental health services in England by 2021. But the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has questioned whether there is enough money and how these posts are going to filled. BBC Reality Check looked at who's likely to be right. We're talking about England because the running of health services is devolved to the other nations. The government has pledged to spend an extra Â£1bn already promised for mental health services in England on the new staff. This is not new money from the Treasury but comes from existing NHS budgets. Experts from the Nuffield Trust, a think-tank specialising in health policy, say Â£1bn would be more than enough to fund 21,000 nurses. Although we don't know how many of the new jobs will be for nurses and how many will be for consultants - and of course their salaries vary widely - it seems the plan is roughly affordable, albeit with money that has to be found from elsewhere in NHS budgets. But that still leaves the question of whether staff can be recruited to fill the posts in such a short timeframe. New recruits Giving extra training to existing qualified staff who work outside mental health Encourage staff who have left NHS mental health services to return Recruiting from overseas The government has given itself a deadline of March 2021. That just about leaves time for people applying for nursing degrees next year and starting in the autumn of 2018 to complete their training and join the workforce. So it is possible some of these posts could be filled by training new nurses. But they will not be able to rely on newly qualified nurses alone, according to Alex Bayliss, assistant director of policy at the King's Fund health think-tank. And that's just nurses - when it comes to certain types of therapist, and to consultants, the training takes much longer. It takes about 15 years from beginning training before you can hope to become a consultant psychiatrist, for example. While the nursing workforce as a whole shrank between 2010 and 2012 and then grew, the number of mental health nurses continued to fall - by 5,161 in total since 2010. It may be that government sees this cohort of people whose jobs were cut as a pool of talent to rehire from. Even by recruiting people who have left the NHS but want to return and from overseas, it will be a difficult target to achieve, according to Mr Bayliss. A plan for the NHS workforce published alongside Mr Hunt's announcement by Health Education England (HEE) acknowledges that this target ""cannot be met via the traditional training routes within this timescale"". That's the part of the NHS responsible for making sure enough people with the right skills are trained and recruited into the health service. HEE says NHS mental health services currently lose about 10,000 members of staff each year. This means that the health service will also need to look at how it encourages existing staff, who would otherwise have left, to stay in order to maintain the current workforce and to fill those extra posts. But even the government's plan acknowledges that ""may not be possible to fill all the vacancies by 2021"". In March 2017, the latest month we have data for, there were already 11,485 jobs for nurses and midwives unfilled. This is thought to be an underestimate since it is a count of job adverts on the NHS site, each of which can be advertising multiple posts. The worry is that simply creating new posts will not be enough when there are already many posts lying vacant.

Bitcoin rebels risk 'trading chaos',"Bitcoin Cash's creators plan to offer the new currency to owners of existing bitcoins A split in the Bitcoin community is set to create a new incompatible version of the cryptocurrency on Tuesday. A group of insiders is unhappy with existing plans to speed up transaction times. They plan to offer existing investors a matching amount of a new virtual asset - called Bitcoin Cash - which could put pressure on the value of original bitcoins. One expert has warned there could be trading ""chaos"" over the coming days. Several popular Bitcoin platforms are refusing to support the new coins. That means investors who currently rely on some Bitcoin currency exchanges and virtual wallets will be unable to take advantage of the offer unless they switch to alternative providers. And moving from one platform to anothercarries risks of its own,external. ""Nobody can be sure how this is going to play out over the short term,"" commented Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director of the eToro trading platform. The breakaway plan was revealed just over a week ago after it emerged that a compromise scheme to reform Bitcoin appeared to have gathered enough support to be adopted. The middle-ground solution - known as Segwit2x - is an attempt to address one of Bitcoin's constraints: at present the ledger of past transactions, known as the blockchain, can have only one megabyte of data added to it every 10 minutes. The limitation was originally introduce to protect Bitcoin from cyber-attacks, but has meantsome users have had to wait daysfor their transactions to complete at busy times. Two conflicting solutions were initially proposed: to increase the size of each block of the blockchain to more than one megabyte, which would allow more transactions to be processed in each batch to relocate some of the information from the blockchain to a separate file, which would be transmitted alongside it Many ""miners"" - dedicated businesses and others that contribute computer processing power to authorise transactions in return for the chance of being awarded newly minted Bitcoins - favoured the former plan. Thousands of computers are dedicated to solving complex problems to authorise Bitcoin transactions But many developers - those working on Bitcoin's code or that of associated software - preferred the latter. Bitcoin swings as civil war looms Ex-Bitcoin exchange boss pleads not guilty Bitcoin infiltrates the $60bn art market Experts clash over crypto-currency The Segwit2x initiative solved the impasse by suggesting the data-splitting step should occur in August and then be followed by an increase in the block size to 2MB in November. Under the terms of a related scheme - referred to as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) - the first step would only happen if 80% of the mining effort adopted the new blockchain software required and used it consistently between 21 July and 31 July. After more than 95% of miners signalled their support for the plan it was widely assumed that a Bitcoin ""civil war"" had been averted. But then ex-Facebook engineer Amaury Sechet and other Bitcoin insidersrevealed plans to launch Bitcoin Cash,externalon 1 August at  12:20 UTC (13:20 BST). They claimed that the danger with the Segwit2x scheme was that there was no guarantee a doubling of the block size would follow the data-splitting step, as promised. Instead their new currency would have a block size of 8MB and ditch the data-dividing idea. To further complicate matters, some Bitcoin exchanges are divided about whether to support the creation of Bitcoin Cash and allow its trade, with several yet todeclare their plans,external. Furthermore, some exchanges plan to suspend or restrict trade in Bitcoin altogether for several days until they are confident that any disruption has passed. The uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin Cash's chances has led to one futures market in Bitcoin Cash to valueone coin as being worth about $267,external, a fraction of the $2,780 each bitcoin wastrading at short time ago,external. In theory, if mass adoption were expected, the two currencies should be much closer in price. Some Bitcoin exchanges plan to freeze trade in the virtual currency for two or more days ""There's massive uncertainty and the quoted futures price should be taken with a grain of salt,"" commented Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. ""We won't know the real Bitcoin Cash price until a number of exchanges across the world start trading it, and it's still not clear when that will happen.""

Will you need a driving licence in the age of self-driving cars?,"A Google self-driving car being tested in California Driverless vehicles may seem unfamiliar now, but over the coming years you'll start to encounter - or even use them - on a daily basis. Will it mean the end of the driving licence and changes to the rules of the road? It's not uncommon to see a squat white droidtrundling along the streets of Greenwich, south-east London, as it delivers takeaway food to the borough's residents at 4mph. In Paris andHelsinki, robot buses,externalare shuttling passengers along city streets, while in Colorado an18-wheeler truck drove beer 120 miles,externaldown a highway - without a driver. Around the world, projects like these are under way to help develop the technology that will ultimately bring driverless cars and other vehicles to our roads. A self-driving delivery robot being tested in Greenwich, London But alongside the issue of whether they will work is another big question: how will pedestrians, cyclists and human drivers be kept safe? Sales of self-driving vehicles are currently in the thousands, but some estimates suggest thatthey could reach 10m worldwide by 2030.,external But that's just a tiny fraction of the more than one billion cars already on the road. So, the challenge is figuring out how to accommodate both humans and driverless vehicles on roads, pavements and bike paths. A driverless Nissan Leaf being tested in London We've got several years, even decades, to get this right and self-driving vehicles that can operate without any human input at all are not on the immediate horizon. Engineers are still working out how to handle some of the most difficult challenges. Think about what happens at crossroads - when drivers and pedestrians arrive at the same time and use a combination of eye contact, gestures and intuition to navigate the junction safely. This type of reasoningstretches the abilities of machines,external. Other challenges include weather conditions that disrupt sensors. And driverless vehicles will need to learn when to disobey traffic rules - for example, when an emergency vehicle needs everyone to move out of the way. Right now, autonomous vehicles are still very much in the testing phase, ""learning"" how to deal with the unpredictability that is endemic to driving. It's not something they have mastered and it'snot uncommon for humans to have to take control,externalin road tests to avoid accidents. There have been a handful of high profile incidents, including afatality involving a semi-autonomous Tesla car,with most down to human error - such asrunning a red light.,external There are plans to test driverless cars onUK roads and motorways from 2019 The UK already has ashuttle bus,supermarket delivery vanandcars,external Driverlesstaxis are in Singapore,Uber cars in Pittsburgh,externaland aconvoy of trucks,externalhas crossed Europe Google cars in California,externalare averaging over 5,000 miles between human drivers taking control Volvo's sensors can spot Sweden's moose, butstruggle with Australia's kangaroos,external India has decided not to allow driverless cars,to protect jobs Officials are trying to get some ground rules in place for testing in public spaces, but even this may not be enough. It would take hundreds of years of road tests, over hundreds of billions of miles, to prove beyond doubt that driverless vehicles will cause fewer fatalities than human drivers,experts at think tank the Rand Corporation have argued.,external Instead, we may have to allow driverless vehicles in some circumstances, while they continue to learn. So far, there is no international safety standard for driverless vehicles - each country is responsible for writing its own rules. There are also questions about whether rules for driverless vehicles should be national - making it easier for companies to comply, or on a more local level - so that cities can tailor them to their residents' needs. This variety could speed up the process of learning about what works and what doesn't. Finding an agreement is difficult. People may give up their own cars, using on demand vehicles instead Fewer vehicles on the road could free up land for more parks and housing Using driverless cars for everything could increase congestion and pollution On demand vehicles could improve transport for those on low incomes Cities may lose revenue from fines as robot vehicles obey the rules of the road People now working as drivers may need help finding new jobs Another issue without a clear answer is around the ethics that driverless vehicles should adopt. Put simply, in the case of an unavoidable accident, should a fully autonomous vehicle be programmed to career off the road, risking the lives of the four people inside, or continue into a parent and child crossing the road? Because human drivers make split second, instinctual decisions, we can't look to human behaviour to come up with the right answer. The shift from cars doing all the driving in predictable, stable conditions with humans as back-up, to a time when they make all the decisions will be gradual. Until cars are fully automated and don't need human input, manufacturers won't be able to dispense with steering and braking controls. People will still need driving licences and they'll have to ready to take control at short notice - so challenges like distraction and drunkenness will remain. It's likely we will always need seat belts: autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically reduce crashes, but no technology is perfect. The peril of driverless vehicles is that we will repeat the mistakes we've made over the last century - like rushing to build new roads that destroy neighbourhoods and creating out of town shopping centres that only cater to drivers. But if we learn from our mistakes we could reduce congestion, pollution, and inequality. When it comes to the self-driving vehicles, people will still have to be in the driver's seat.

'What the Euros mean for us',"England's women celebrate after the game And just like that, 43 years of hurt are over for England. The 1-0 win over France at Euro 2017 was their first victory against Les Bleus since 1974. Jodie Taylor's goal not only rewrites recent history, but also puts her country into the semi-finals. ""I'm very, very proud,"" manager Mark Sampsontold the BBC afterwards. England manager Mark Sampson The Lionesses, who finished third at the World Cup two years ago, will now play the Netherlands on Thursday. Austria or Denmark will compete in the other semi-final. But will England's run help to further the game back home? And is Euro 2017 having the impact on women's football in Europe that Uefa hopes? Ruth and her dad Paul travelled out to see the Lionesses play in Deventer. ""I've played since I was five,"" explains 14-year-old Ruth. ""This England success really is making girls like me realise we can play this sport and it's grown dramatically these last few years. ""But this run needs to continue so we get better pitches and better coaches to make grassroots girls' teams better."" Ruth's dad Paul, who is a football coach, says he hopes England's success will spur more professional men's clubs into action. ""They have got to buy in to the women's game because I think it's just bits and pieces at the moment,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""The women's game is massive for our country. ""Hopefully England can go all the way and that will spark even more interest in the game for young girls, much like the Olympics did in 2012."" It was disappointment for the French players France has been one of the leaders in women's football across Europe. Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain play in front of huge crowds each week - and use the regular homes of their men's counterparts - in contrast to the non-league men's grounds commonly used in England. Claire Bruno (right) & friends Claire helped create a women's team back home in Paris for her old schoolmates. ""We are surprised because the attendances here [at Euro 2017] haven't been as good as we thought they would be,"" she says. ""But the game is growing back home and we are now getting a lot more men watching the women's game as well. ""This Euro cup is being shown on normal TV back home too so everyone can watch which is important."" Crowds for the quarter-final match between Netherlands v Sweden While passion for the Netherlands Women's team has been high at Euro 2017, gates have been much lower at the matches not involving the Dutch. Many of the fans Newsbeat has spoken to during the tournament have said that has been frustrating. Tim van Beek & Sjors Lommerts Tim and his friend Sjors are helping out in the official fan zone in Deventer. ""This is one of the biggest events of the year,"" says Tim. ""We have seen a mix of attendances because some countries don't bring as many fans. ""But women's football is big here in the Netherlands and is the fastest growing sport here so the tournament will help that for sure."" And Sjors says it is vitally important the Netherlands continue to do well to help that. ""We need to keep scoring lots of goals and keep people's interest,"" he explains. ""I'm certain a lot of young girls will be looking to go and play and watch football next season which is what this is all about."" Gerry brought his girls' team to cheer on Scotland Gerry Cummings is a football coach in Scotland. He brought his girls' team to the Netherlands to cheer on Scotland. Earlier in the tournament Gerry told Newsbeat ""we wanted to bring them out here to inspire the girls to play football and maybe emulate what this Scotland team has done"".

What lies ahead for divided Venezuela?,"Young members of ""The Resistance"" have vowed to continue their protests What will be the aftermath of Venezuela's most controversial and violent election of recent times? ""Good morning! We have a new constituent assembly!"" began President NicolÃ¡s Maduro as he greeted his supporters in the Plaza BolÃ­var in Caracas shortly after the electoral authorities announced the result. The country's National Electoral Council said that just a little over eight million ballots had been cast for members of a a new assembly designed to change the country's constitution, a turnout of 41.53% of the electorate. But the opposition boycotted the vote, guaranteeing victory for the country's socialist government, which had convened the vote. Amid the electoral violence, at least 10 deaths were reported across the country. However President Maduro faces a real challenge of governability and credibility. Perhaps the biggest is that every opposition supporter, and many millions of ordinary Venezuelans, simply do not believe the result. ""The government will claim eight million votes, but in reality it could have been about 3.5 million people,"" predicted pollster Luis Vicente LeÃ³n a day before the poll. Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro celebrated the results of the assembly election The opposition say several irregular electoral processes took place that in normal Venezuelan elections would not be allowed. For example, no indelible ink was used to mark voters' little fingers after the ballots had been cast and critics say there was nothing to stop people voting in more than one polling centre. There were also widespread reports of pressure being brought to bear on government employees to turn out in order to protect their jobs. Several countries in the region - including Colombia, Argentina and Panama - said they would not recognise the result. Venezuela's Maduro claims poll victory as opposition cries foul What did Venezuelans vote for and why was it so divisive? Venezuela's irreconcilable visions for the future Meet 'The Resistance': Venezuela's frontline protest army The United States also threatened ""strong and swift action"", with the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, calling the vote a ""sham election"" that brought Venezuela ""another step toward dictatorship"". Nevertheless, the Maduro government is treating this result as a resounding endorsement and will press ahead with its plans to change the constitution. The first steps towards creating the new body could take place within 24 hours. In part, the difficulty the Maduro government has faced in motivating its base stems from the many years they spent vociferously defending the same constitution they are now urgently trying to change. Hugo ChÃ¡vez himself often described the 1999 Constitution in sacred terms, comparing it to the Bible or the Mayan holy text, Popol Vuh. Anti-Maduro protests, some violent, have riven the country for months The approach of most government officials has been twofold. In part, they say the creation of a constituent assembly is the easiest route to peace - something that most ordinary Venezuelans are desperate to see return to their daily lives. They also argue that this constitutional change is part of a vision of a ""deeper"" form of popular democracy that the late socialist leader was never able to fully realise before his death in 2013. If so, however, he never made any great references to it while he was still alive: ""Our constitution, one of the best in the world, is protected from the caprice of any political group,"" he said in 2008. ""In Venezuela, no-one can change a comma, a full stop, a letter of our Bolivarian Constitution. Only the Venezuelan people can do that through a national referendum,"" Mr ChÃ¡vez explained. A pro-government candidate standing in a low-income neighbourhood in the east of Caracas, Joaquin Mijares, denied that the vote was unconstitutional. ""The constituent assembly will be a space to discuss the direction of the country and how the state is organised,"" he said outside his local polling station. ""The process is legitimate because we, the people, are legitimising it with our participation."" Joaquin Mijares, a local pro-government candidate in El Matadero in east Caracas, denies that the latest vote is unconstitutional However, the haemorrhaging of traditional Chavista support goes beyond this one controversial political process. It comes after months of food shortages, rampant inflation and worsening violence. One does not have to look hard for signs of public exhaustion with the Maduro government. ""Sadly, my President, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, died. Very sadly, because if he were alive, none of this would be happening,"" said Beatriz, a housewife in Catia, in western Caracas. ""I'll stay Chavista until the very end but I'm no Maduro supporter,"" she added.  It is a position shared by many others among the nation's poor. There is a uniquely Venezuelan word to describe the street closures and subsequent clashes with the authorities: ""guarimba"". Now, with the votes cast, there is still no sign of the barricades and protests letting up. If anything, positions are becoming more entrenched. ""The Resistance"" - a loose alliance of young, radicalised opposition protesters - have vowed to remain on the streets until the government concedes to their demands. ""We're going to be here until this country changes, until it improves, until the government falls,"" a 17-year-old protester manning the barricades told me. ""We need a president who's dignified enough to be called the president of Venezuela and an end to the shortages and queues."" Julio Borges, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, says the opposition is against ""a minority that has kidnapped power in the country"" The traditional opposition alliance, the MUD, also appears to remain committed to a campaign of demonstrations and civil disobedience. The government places the blame for the violence firmly at the door of the opposition. But the head of the National Assembly, Julio Borges, denied that the MUD was responsible for leading the country down a path towards further conflict. ""We are not involved in a civil war in Venezuela,"" he said. ""What we have in Venezuela is one people, one nation that is against a minority that has kidnapped power in the country."" On the other side, the military and the security forces are not backing down either. Despite suggestions of disillusionment among some sectors of the rank and file, there is little hard evidence of a genuine split or mutiny. Both before the vote and in his victory speech, President Maduro spoke of dialogue. Some nations have been trying to table negotiations between the two sides with figures like former Spanish Prime Minister JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero attempting to broker some form of peace. Spain, in particular, would want to see a stable Venezuela sooner rather than later, given its business interests in the South American nation. However, there is little sign of a breakthrough. If anything, the decision to plough ahead with the election, despite widespread opposition, may have jeopardised any chance of further conversations for the time being. Political figures including former Spanish PM JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero (r) have attempted to mediate in the crisis Furthermore, despite the unity in the name of the opposition alliance, in reality the parties remain divided, split and without a clear leader who inspires Venezuelans. As such, the immediate outlook is bleak, says Luis Vicente LeÃ³n. ""It's absolutely going to get worse before it improves."" ""The two groups both think they are in power. They both think they are going to destroy the other, that they are going to pulverise each other."" Such ""mutually assured destruction"", he argues, does nothing to tackle the problems of inflation, scarcity, poverty, lack of medicines and so on that have plagued Venezuela in recent years. It seems, at least in the short term, Venezuelans face an unenviable and uncertain period as their country continues its gradual descent into anarchy.

How much wealth is hidden offshore?,"Would you like to pay less tax? Make a sandwich: specifically, a ""double Irish, Dutch sandwich"". Suppose you're American. You set up a company in Bermuda and sell it your intellectual property. It then sets up a subsidiary in Ireland. Now, set up another company in Ireland: it bills your European operations for amounts resembling their profits. Now, start a company in the Netherlands. Have your second Irish company send money to your Dutch company, which immediately sends it back to your first Irish company. You know, the one headquartered in Bermuda. Are you bored and confused yet? If so, that's part of the point. Tax havens depend on making it, at best, very difficult to get your head around financial flows, and, at worst, impossible to find out any facts. Accounting techniques that make your brain hurt enable multinationals such asGoogle, eBay and Ikea to minimise their tax bills - completely legally. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. You can see why people get upset. Taxes are a bit like membership fees for a club: it feels unfair to dodge the fees but still expect to benefit from the services provided to members - defence, police, roads, sewers, education, and so on. But tax havens haven't always had such a bad image. Sometimes they've functioned like any other safe haven, allowing persecuted minorities to escape the oppressive rules of home. Jews in Nazi Germany, for example, were able to ask secretive Swiss bankers to hide their money. Unfortunately, secretive Swiss bankers soon undid the good this did their reputation by proving to be just as happy to help the Nazis hide the gold they managed to steal, and reluctant to give it back to the people it was stolen from. Nowadays, tax havens are controversial for two reasons: tax avoidance and tax evasion. Tax avoidance is legal. It's the stuff of double Irish, Dutch sandwiches. Like other major technology companies, Google has come under pressure over its tax arrangements. The laws apply to everyone: smaller businesses and even ordinary individuals could set up border-hopping legal structures too. They just don't earn enough to justify the accountants' fees. If everyday folk want to reduce their tax bill, their options are limited to various forms of tax evasion, which is illegal: VAT fraud,undeclared cash-in-hand work, or taking too many cigarettes through the ""nothing to declare"" lane at customs. The British tax authorities reckon that much evaded tax comes from countless such - often modest - infractions, rather than the wealthy entrusting their money to shadowy bankers. But it's hard to be sure. If we could measure the problem exactly, it wouldn't exist in the first place. In 1934, the Swiss made it a criminal offence for bankers to disclose financial information Perhaps it's no surprise that banking secrecy seems to have started in Switzerland: the first known regulations limiting bankers' ability to share information about their clients were passed in 1713 by the Great Council of Geneva. Secretive Swiss banking really took off in the 1920s, as many European nations hiked taxes to repay their debts from World War One - and many rich Europeans looked for ways to hide their money. Recognising that this was boosting their economy, in 1934 the Swiss made it a criminal offence for bankers to disclose financial information. The euphemism for a tax haven these days, of course, is ""offshore"" - despite Switzerland's lack of coastline. Gradually, tax havens have emerged on islands such as Jersey or Malta, or, most famously, in the Caribbean. Many small islands have become tax havens as a pragmatic way to grow their economies There's a logistical reason for this: a small island isn't much good for manufacturing or agriculture, so financial services are an obvious alternative. But the real explanation is historical: the dismantling of European empires in the decades after World War Two. Unwilling to prop up Bermuda or the British Virgin Islands with explicit subsidies, the UK instead encouraged them to develop financial expertise, plugged into the City of London. The subsidy was implicit, instead - tax revenue steadily leaked away to these islands. The economist Gabriel Zucman,externalcame up with an ingenious way to estimate the wealth hidden in the offshore banking system. In theory, if you add up the assets and liabilities reported by every global financial centre, the books should balance - but they don't. Each individual centre tends to report more liabilities than assets. Zucman crunched the numbers and found that, globally, total liabilities were 8% higher than total assets. That suggests at least 8% of the world's wealth is illegally unreported. Other methods have come up with even higher estimates. Zucman identified a gap between the global economy's declared assets and liabilities The problem is particularly acute in developing countries. For example, Zucman finds 30% of wealth in Africa is hidden offshore. He calculates an annual loss of $14bn (Â£11bn) in tax revenue. That would build plenty of schools and hospitals. Zucman's solution is transparency: creating a global register of who owns what, to end banking secrecy and anonymity-preserving shell corporations and trusts. That might well help with tax evasion. But tax avoidance is a subtler and more complex problem. To see why, imagine I own a bakery in Belgium, a dairy in Denmark, and a sandwich shop in Slovenia. I sell a cheese sandwich, making 1 euro of profit. How much of that profit should be taxed in Slovenia, where I sold the sandwich, or Denmark, where I made the cheese, or Belgium, where I baked the bread? There's no obvious answer. As rising taxes met increasing globalisation in the 1920s, the League of Nations devised protocols for handling such questions. They allow companies some leeway to choose where to book their profits. There's a case for that, but it opened the door to some dubious accounting tricks. Did a company in Trinidad really sell pens to a sister company for $8,500 (Â£6,600) apiece? One widely reported example may be apocryphal, but illustrates the logical extreme of these practices. A company in Trinidad apparently sold ballpoint pens to a sister company for $8,500 (Â£6,600) apiece, resulting in more profit booked in low-tax Trinidad and less in higher-tax regimes elsewhere. Most such tricks are less obvious, and consequently harder to quantify. The simple steel box that changed global trade The warrior monks who invented banking What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? Do passports restrict economic growth? Still, Zucman estimates that 55% of US-based companies' profits are routed through some unlikely looking jurisdiction such as Luxembourg or Bermuda, costing the US taxpayer $130bn (Â£100bn) a year. Another estimate puts the losses to developing country governments at many times the amount they get in foreign aid. Solutions are conceivable: profits could be taxed globally, with national governments devising ways to apportion which profit is deemed taxable where. A similar formula already exists to apportion national profits made by US companies to individual states. But that would need political desire to tackle tax havens. And while recent years have seen some initiatives,notably by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),external, they've so far lacked teeth. Perhaps this shouldn't surprise us, given the incentives involved. Clever people can earn more from exploiting loopholes than trying to close them. Individual governments face incentives to compete to lower taxes, because a small percentage of something is better than a large percentage of nothing. For tiny, palm-fringed islands, it can even make sense to set taxes at 0%, as the local economy will be boosted by the resulting boom in law and accounting. Perhaps the biggest problem is that tax havens mostly benefit financial elites, including some politicians and many of their donors. Meanwhile, pressure from voters for action is limited by the boring and confusing nature of the problem. Sandwich, anyone?

The dissident republican in the Marines,"A photograph of Maxwell posing with cannabis, recovered from one of his memory cards The jailing of Royal Marine CiarÃ¡n Maxwell for terror offences raises troubling questions for the military. How was an Irish republican with links to violent dissidents able to infiltrate an elite Royal Navy unit and evade detection for so long? For five years, Maxwell researched, acquired and stockpiled an arsenal of weapons, including material stolen from his base. A former Army officer has called for an overhaul of the vetting system. The Marine who turned to terror CiarÃ¡n Maxwell: Full list of charges Timeline of Irish dissident activity On the face of it, when the man from Larne, a coastal town in County Antrim, began the gruelling 32-week training to become a Royal Marine in 2010 he could not have seemed prouder. A young CiarÃ¡n Maxwell was beaten by loyalists before he became a marine He posted on his Facebook page: ""Pain is temporary, the Green Beret is forever."" But he had gone into the military nursing a grudge after being severely beaten by a loyalist mob oozing sectarian hatred and wielding golf clubs eight years earlier. They left the teenage, Catholic boy with a fractured skull. An underground hide found in Capanagh forest, County Antrim, Northern Ireland His case featured in the republican newspaper, An Phoblacht, and is said to have left Maxwell ""angry and traumatised"". So even before he completed his Marines training, Maxwell was living a dangerous double life. He had dedicated himself to creating an arms cache for use against the British state he was purportedly serving. It is not clear whether Maxwell was asked about the incident in which he was beaten as part of his security vetting to become a Royal Marine. He will have undertaken a long interview, which usually covers most areas of the applicant's life, including his family background. A balaclava recovered from a hide at Powderham New Plantation The Royal Navy rejects the suggestion there was a failure of vetting in the Maxwell case, but would not talk about specifics. ""All security personnel are subject to security checking prior to employment and at regular intervals throughout their careers,"" said a spokesman. But Doug Beattie, who served three tours of duty in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Irish Regiment and is now an Ulster Unionist politician, told the BBC: ""We could have been looking at loss of life perpetrated at the hands of a serving soldier of the British military. ""If we don't have a look at our security checks and how we vet people before they join the military, we're going to have problems in the future."" Timers recovered from a forest in County Antrim, Northern Ireland The rogue marine stole rounds of military ammunition and detonators from his unit, exploiting weaknesses in a system that is mainly based on trust. At the end of training exercises, military personnel have to declare any ammunition they have not used and they may be searched but it is nearly impossible to account for every round. Maxwell was careful to smuggle out small amounts at a time and he carried them back to Northern Ireland on ferries where there are fewer security checks. But he took enormous risks, including storing drugs such as LSD in his work locker. Maxwell's hide at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, County Antrim Commander Dean Haydon, the head of counter terrorism command at the Metropolitan Police, described the Maxwell case as ""very alarming"". ""The fact that ammunition was taken from a military base is clearly of concern and we are working with the military in that regard."" The security of weapons, ammunition and equipment is taken ""very seriously"", according to the Royal Navy. ""All personnel are instructed in appropriate procedures and any incidents are investigated and action taken where necessary,"" added a spokesman. During Maxwell's sentencing hearing, it emerged that he advised the military after his arrest on how it could tighten up the procedure for checking ammunition out of the stores. A greenhouse used by Maxwell at Powderham New Plantation in England Even more alarming than his theft of ammunition is that some of Maxwell's improvised pipe bombs are unaccounted for. ""We assess that it's a possibility that a small number - and I would stress that it's a small number - of devices that Maxwell would have made were not recovered and are in the hands of violent dissident republican groupings,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. ""These groupings do carry out attacks in Northern Ireland - they do attempt to kill people and if they have devices they will use them. ""But I want to reassure people that we are doing everything that we can as a police service to try to constrain these groups."" A handwritten note from Maxwell, recovered from hides at Powderham New Plantation The group that Maxwell was supplying pipe bombs to calls itself the Continuity IRA (CIRA), which believes it is carrying on the original IRA mission to force the British out of Northern Ireland. Maxwell admitted he was working with CIRA member Niall Lehd, who went to the same school as him and who was convicted of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life in 2014. Maxwell supplied the explosives. Soon after his release from a short prison term two years later and while still on licence, Lehd teamed up again with Maxwell. The pair concealed explosives in various hides around Larne. A police vest recovered from a hide in Capanagh Forest, Northern Ireland It is unclear why the diligent and highly-organised marine threw in his lot with a man described by his trial judge as ""more a risk to yourself than others"". And the police are reluctant to talk about the relationship between the men or say why Lehd was not charged as part of this investigation. Though his eventual arrest in August 2016 brought Maxwell's long years as an undercover terrorist to a dramatic end, this case is another reminder of the dark shadow that Northern Ireland's Troubles have cast over the region and beyond.

Scaramucci out as Trump media chief,"This video can not be played 10 memorable Mooch quotes in 10 days White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has been fired after fewer than 10 days in the post. The former Wall Street financier had drawn criticism after calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced tirade against his own colleagues. President Donald Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and spokesman, Sean Spicer, both left their posts after Mr Scaramucci's appointment. Chief of staff Gen John Kelly, sworn in on Monday, sacked Mr Scaramucci. The president was also unhappy with Mr Scaramucci's performance, the White House confirmed. Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said the president thought Mr Scaramucci's comments to the reporter ""were inappropriate for a person in that position"". This video can not be played Scaramucci comments ""inappropriate"" - White House He has not been moved to another White House role, she added. Mr Trump had tweeted in the morning about job and wage figures, and insisted there is ""No WH chaos"", referring to reports about fighting among White House staff. Who is Anthony Scaramucci? What else happens in 10 days? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The people around Donald Trump Mr Scaramucci had boasted of reporting directly to the president, rather than to his chief of staff. This video can not be played The feud between Priebus and Scaramucci decoded Gen Kelly, who had formerly served as secretary of homeland security, was sworn in on Monday morning at the White House. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Staff in this White House have the job life expectancy of mayflies. Only 10 days ago, Mr Scaramucci burst on to the scene as the fast-talking New Yorker whose fanatical devotion to the president was matched only by his distaste for the established order. Although his job tenure was short, he managed to do a lot of order-disrupting. Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned to give Mr Scaramucci a ""clean slate"". Then, like a heat-seeking missile powered by foul language, Mr Scaramucci went after Reince Priebus, who was unceremoniously cashiered on Friday. Now it is Mr Scaramucci's turn to wipe down the slate. If Mr Scaramucci's exit was indeed orchestrated by John Kelly, it could be an indication that the former general is quickly asserting control over what has been a rancorous White House. Perhaps it is the first sign of order being established, even if the brevity of Mr Scaramucci's tenure - he wasn't officially set to begin until 15 August - will be a short-term embarrassment for the president. Then again, it could be that the pace of change is quickening as the Trump administration approaches the centre of the vortex. Only time will tell. Allow Twitter content?

Marine bomb maker given 18 years in jail,"CiarÃ¡n Maxwell was a former lance corporal in the Royal Marines A former Royal Marine from County Antrim who made bombs for dissident republicans has been sentenced to 18 years in prison. CiarÃ¡n Maxwell, from Larne,admitted a series of terror chargesahead of a pre-sentence hearing that began last Wednesday. After his arrest last year, police found 43 weapons hides. Maxwell also admitted drugs offences On Monday, an Old Bailey judge told Maxwell he must serve a further five years on licence after his release. The dissident republican in the Marines The Marine who turned to terror Timeline of Irish dissident activity CiarÃ¡n Maxwell: Full list of charges The judge said Maxwell was motivated by hostility to the United Kingdom and had betrayed his position in the armed forces. He told the former lance corporal that the purpose of a pipe bomb - 14 of which were constructed by Maxwell - was ""to maim and kill a potential victim"". The judge rejected Maxwell's account that he was motivated by post traumatic stress disorder resulting from a sectarian beating he received as a teenager. The former Marine made 14 pipe bombs for dissident republicans He said Maxwell was ""dangerous"" and threatened the political stability of Northern Ireland. The judge added that Maxwell had ""considerable skills as a terrorist bomb maker"" and enjoyed his work. ""There was considerable planning, including attack planning, research, and the acquiring of large amounts of materials, including police items for use in disguise,"" Mr Justice Nigel Sweeney said. ""You were strongly committed to the cause. ""To state the obvious, a skilled bomb maker is of considerable importance to a terrorist organisation like the Continuity IRA."" A police vest was found in one of the hides On Friday, the court heard that Maxwell faked his support for the dissident republicans' cause as he was ""frozen"" with fear, and that he believes old connections now wish him and his family serious ill. The 31-year-old was arrested last year after two dissident republican arms dumps were found near Larne. Maxwell grew up as a Catholic in the County Antrim town and later moved to England, having enlisted in the Royal Marines in 2010. He lived in Exminster in Devon, and was based with 40 Commando in Taunton, Somerset. He never served in Northern Ireland. Bomb timers were also discovered The court was told that four of the pipe bombs he made were used in attacks in Northern Ireland. Other weapons found in the hides included anti-personnel mines, mortars, ammunition and bomb-making materials. The former Marine was not in court, but appeared by video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes. The judge said Maxwell had enough chemicals in Northern Ireland to create ""100 kg of high explosives, larger than the notorious Enniskillen bomb."" It was heard that when Maxwell applied to the Royal Marines in 2009, he said he had ""no beliefs"" on an application form. Maxwell was arrested after two arms dumps were found near Larne, County Antrim The judge said there was ""insufficient evidence"" to suggest a sinister motivation for joining the Marines. Police Service of Northern Ireland Ass Ch Const Stephen Martin said: ""Ciaran Maxwell is an extremely dangerous individual who was capable of gathering a large amount of munitions over multiple sites in Northern Ireland and England. ""The hides uncovered at Larne and surrounding areas collectively, amount to one of the most significant seizures of munitions in recent years in Northern Ireland, not to mention the further items recovered in hides in Great Britain. The hides also contained hundreds of rounds of ammunition ""It is obvious that these materials and munitions were sourced, gathered and constructed over significant periods of time which demonstrates Ciaran Maxwell's determination and committed planning. ""These items are designed to cause damage, serious injury and to kill."" Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said: ""I pay tribute to the police and other agencies in successfully bringing this case before the courts. ""This has undoubtedly saved lives."" Maxwell was also convicted of possession of cannabis with intent to supply and had images of other people's bank cards and identity documents which he intended to use in online fraud.

"Woman, 82, strangled with dog lead","Catherine Smith was left with serious injuries after being attacked in her home An 82-year-old woman has been strangled with a dog lead in a ""vicious and unprovoked"" attack on her own doorstep. Catherine Smith was found covered in blood in Lydhurst Avenue, south London sometime after 13:00 BST on 27 July. She first saw her attacker while walking her dog near Streatham Hill, police said. The attacker - described as a slim, black woman, about 5ft 5ins (1.67m) tall - followed Ms Smith and was waiting for her when she arrived home. The victim uses a mobility scooter and was heard crying for help by a passer-by The woman repeatedly asked Ms Smith for money as she entered her house, according to police. Later the woman rang the doorbell and asked if she could use the toilet. When Ms Smith refused, the woman forced her way in pushing Ms Smith to the floor, causing her to hit her head. Officers said there was a struggle, during which the attacker grabbed Ms Smith's dog lead, wrapped it round her neck and started to strangle her. The suspect then ran off in an unknown direction. She first saw her attacker while out on her mobility scooter taking her dog for a walk Ms Smith's cries for help alerted a passer-by who came to her aid. She was taken to hospital with serious injuries and has since been discharged. Scotland Yard said: ""This was a vicious unprovoked attack on an elderly, vulnerable woman's own doorstep. The attack has left her very distressed. ""We believe the suspect spotted Catherine in Palace Road Nature Gardens and for unknown reasons decided to follow her home, harass her and then brutally assault her.""

Bank of England strike to go ahead,"Some of the Bank's staff have started a three-day strike A three-day strike by some Bank of England support staff has begun, after talks at the conciliation service Acas ended without agreement. Employees in the Unite trade union are disputing a below-inflation pay rise of 1%, which has been imposed. About 20 union members, including cleaners, security and maintenance staff, are picketing the Bank's headquarters in the City of London. Some are wearing facemasks of the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. They have been joined by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Staff in the Bank's ""parlours"", which are meeting rooms on the ground floor of the Bank's building in Threadneedle Street, have also walked out. It is the first time for more than 50 years that workers at the central bank have been on strike. ""The union balloted approximately 2% of the workforce,"" the Bank said, as only 150 staff work in the three affected departments. ""The Bank has plans in place so that all essential business will continue to operate as normal during this period. ""The Bank has been in talks with Unite up to and including today and remains ready to continue those talks at any time,"" it added. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell addresses the striking bank staff The last time Bank of England staff went on strike was in the late 60s and involved printers at the Bank's printing plant in Debden, who were employed by the Bank of England at that time. Unite said the dispute centred on the ""derisory"" pay settlement that the bank had imposed on staff without the union's agreement. It was the second year running that staff had received a below inflation pay offer, it said. Unite's London and Eastern regional secretary, Peter Kavanagh, said its members had ""been left with no choice but to take industrial action"". ""Mark Carney should come to the picket lines outside this iconic British bank today and explain why hardworking men and women deserve to face years of pay cuts."" ""They are struggling to pay their bills and feed their families because the bank has unjustly imposed a below inflation or zero pay rise,"" he added. Inflation was 2.6% last month,according to official figures.

Row erupts over Channel 4's Diana tapes,"Channel 4 is due to broadcast the tapes almost 20 years after Princess Diana's death Friends of Princess Diana have urged Channel 4 not to broadcast controversial video tapes of her talking about her troubled marriage. The documentary, Diana: In Her Own Words, is due to be aired ahead of the 20th anniversary of her death. The tapes, recorded by her speech coach, have never been seen in the UK. Channel 4 said they ""provide a unique insight"" - but Diana's close friend Rosa Monckton said they were a betrayal of the late princess's privacy. Mrs Monckton is writing to the broadcaster to ask them not to air the tapes. Shetold The Guardian,external: ""This doesn't belong in the public domain. ""It is a betrayal of her privacy and of the family's privacy."" This video can not be played Lawyer defends brokering the sale of private Princess Diana footage The footage was recorded by Peter Settelen, who was hired by the Princess of Wales between 1992 and 1993 to help with her public speaking voice. She was filmed at Kensington Palace and is seen talking about her marriage to the Prince of Wales, their sex life and how she confronted him about his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall. Former royal spokesman Dickie Arbiter told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that Channel 4 was ""laughing all the way to the bank"". He said: ""These tapes were recorded in private as part of a training session. Anything done behind closed doors remains private."" Earl Spencer 'lied to' over Diana's funeral Princes regret 'rushed call' with mother Prince Harry 'in chaos' over mother's death Royal biographer Penny Junor added: ""I think it is quite obscene that they are showing this - and immoral, frankly. ""Diana, when she made them... the marriage had just come to an end, they had broken up - she was in a very bad way."" The princess ""never intended these tapes to be heard by any living soul"", she added, describing the broadcast as ""exploitation"". Diana's troubled marriage to Prince Charles is discussed in the tapes The tapes were returned to Mr Settelen in 2004 after a dispute with Diana's brother Earl Spencer, who said they belonged to him. They had initially been held by Scotland Yard after being seized in 2001 in a raid on the home of former royal butler Paul Burrell. Excerpts were broadcast in the US later in 2004 after being sold to American broadcaster NBC. The BBC was reportedly planning to show the tapes as part of a documentary in 2007, the year of the 10th anniversary of Diana's death, but scrapped the project. Marcus Rutherford, Mr Settelen's lawyer, defended their broadcast. He told BBC 5 live: ""The claim to privacy actually fails because the police looked at them, the Spencer family looked at them, Paul Burrell look at them presumably and so what was private to Peter as much as to Diana was actually lost in the process. ""So I don't think it's right to say that now, 20 years later after her death, they remain private any more."" He added that Diana was separating from her husband at the time and ""wanted the world to know what she was going through"". Channel 4's deputy chief creative officer Ralph Lee described the tapes as an ""amazing historical document"" that ""allows us to create a new portrait of Diana"". He told the BBC that ""20 years is a significant amount of time for something like this to now come to light and be aired"". A Channel 4 spokesman said the subjects covered in the tapes were ""a matter of public record and provide a unique insight into the preparations Diana undertook to gain a public voice and tell her own personal story"".

Where in the world have Britain's Brexit trio been?,"They're known as the Three Brexiteers - the ministers who all campaigned to leave the EU and are now shaping the UK's foreign relations for years to come. Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox have been racking up the air miles to put the UK's case... The foreign secretary has been setting a furious pace in terms of globe-trotting, seemingly spending as much time abroad as he has at home - even during the general election campaign. Of course, he has the edge on his cabinet colleagues as it is his job to be the UK's chief ambassador. His remit includes the full gamut of diplomacy and maintaining inter-state political relations, not just preparing the ground for Brexit and beyond. His travels have taken him to Australasia, East Asia, West Africa and the Balkans among other parts of the world. He pulled rank by being the first British minister to travel to Washington after Donald Trump's election as president. Japan is one of the many stops that Boris Johnson has made Notable omissions on his itinerary so far include Russia and China. Mr Johnson was due to visit Moscow in April but this was called off amid tensions over Syria. Like his boss, Prime Minister Theresa May, the offer of a visit to Beijing has yet to come but this is expected later this year. The list would be even longer but we've not included EU and Nato foreign ministers' meetings in Brussels and the Iraq and Syria conferences in Paris, and Shimon Peres' funeral in Israel The international trade secretary is the man with the task of banging the drum for British business overseas, with at least one eye on negotiating free trade deals after the UK leaves the EU. While not quite keeping up with Mr Johnson, he has covered plenty of ground himself. As an unabashed Atlanticist who is very much at home over the pond, it was no great surprise that his first destination was the US and that he has also found time in his diary to visit Canada. Mr Fox has been focused on the more sober business of nurturing and expanding trade links Other important strategic destinations include the Gulf - he has been on three separate occasions - and India - which in many respects is the biggest but most challenging prize for the UK in the post-Brexit trade scramble. His visits to Europe have been notably and understandably less frequent, with Germany being his destination of choice. The Brexit secretary has been limited in the amount of time he can spend overseas and also where he can go, as his focus is squarely on the negotiations with the EU. He has had to devote much of his time to setting up his department from scratch, fighting Article 50 court cases, piloting legislation through the Commons and preparing for Brexit negotiations. While the EU has specifically ruled out the UK pursuing bilateral talks with individual European countries, Mr Davis has still been out and about, taking his message to European capitals and seeking to deepen understanding of the UK's intentions and positions. The Brexit secretary has shared a number of podiums across Europe He has just about covered most of Scandinavia - but more important, strategically, were his early visits to the Republic of Ireland and Spain - two countries for whom Brexit will have major practical repercussions. He has yet to make it to Paris but has spent plenty of time opposite his French negotiating counterpart Michel Barnier in Brussels.

Do trans rights affect women's rights?,"Trans activists have welcomed moves from the government to ""streamline and de-medicalise the process"" of changing legal gender. But some women are worried about the potential impact on their own legal rights. Today, anyone who wants to legally change their gender in the UK has to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). Many don't though, because they feel the lengthy process is invasive and demeaning. In order to qualify, trans people do not need to have had surgery but must have lived for two years in their preferred gender and have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria - distress caused by a mismatch between biological sex and gender identity. One way to simplify things for trans men and women would be to allow individuals to self-declare the gender in which they choose to live, without the need for medical evidence or proof. That's what the government has now putout to consultation. But the idea has been met with anger and shock in some forums including parenting website Mumsnet, where the latest in a series of threads attractedmore than 1,000 comments,externalin two days. Former boxing manager Kellie Maloney says her application was twice rejected before her gender recognition certificate was granted At present, the guidance issued to service providers - women's refuges, for example - by the Equality and Human Rights Commission states: ""Where a transsexual person is visually and for all practical purposes indistinguishable from someone of their preferred gender, they should normally be treated according to their acquired gender unless there are strong reasons not to do so."" Those with a GRC ""should be treated in their acquired gender for all purposes"". That means that anyone who identifies themselves as a woman - whether that is their legal status or not - can already use separate-sex facilities such as changing rooms, toilets or single-sex gyms. The proposed changes to the gender recognition act does not change that. The concern is that the greater ease with which gender could be legally changed would give a tiny minority with nefarious motives greater opportunity. The Equality Act 2010 also permits service providers - including hospitals and prisons - to use their discretion to refuse a trans person access to single-sex services on a case-by-case basis. This legislation however, could also change. A report on transgender equality published in January 2016,externalby Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee recommended discretion should not apply where a trans person had been recognised as their acquired gender ""for all legal purposes"" under the Gender Recognition Act - in other words, obtained a GRC. And it's that which could get much easier in future. Under current law, any person who self-identifies as a woman can use female-only services like toilets and changing rooms A lot of the discussion online is around women-only spaces. Refuges and rape centres, even changing rooms are places viewed as ""safe"" by women, some of them fleeing violence, because they typically exclude men. Many of those commenting on Mumsnet fear that simply by choosing to call themselves women, ""predatory males"" - a minority who may want to abuse the system - could get access to those places and put women at risk. Prisons are another area of concern, with warnings that biological males, some potentially dangerous, could be placed in facilities with vulnerable women. Transgender prison deaths: Watchdog calls for action Trans prisoner 'let down by prison, NHS and family' In the world of sport, the users also fear women could find themselves at risk or unable to compete as they could be taking part alongside biological males. GRCs do not however, affect the categorisation of people for sporting purposes. Sports authorities have their own rules. UK Athletics for example, says trans women can compete in their affirmed gender on providing hormonal evidence. One Mumsnet commentator, BahHumbygge, described ""biological sex"" as ""vitally important"", adding: ""The idea that a predatory male can just decree by personal fiat he is now female and can now access any female-only space is simply horrifying."" ""I fully support the right of people to dress how they like, call themselves what they like, and 99% of the time do whatever job they like or live wherever they like... But 1% of the time - women's prisons, women's spaces where they are naked and vulnerable, women's shelters and rape crisis centres - people with penises should not be in these spaces or taking jobs in those places,"" M0stlyBowlingHedgehog writes. Mumsnet CEO Justine Roberts said the site's users were ""deeply divided"". ""It's a hugely complex and emotive issue that, sadly, seems to pit two vulnerable groups against each other,"" she added. A guide to transgender terms 'I'm a transgender woman - ask me your invasive questions' Jenni Murray trans women article criticised The fears expressed echo those raised by some in the feminist movement, including writer Sarah Ditum, who argues the move could create a system ""vulnerable to exploitation and open to abuse"". ""We have female-only spaces to protect women and help them participate in public life. It's taken a long time to establish women-only services,"" Sarah said. ""Discretion must be protected,"" she said, so that facilities such as prisons can continue to use their judgement on a case-by-case basis. Set against these complaints are other voices, who stress the value of a law change to trans people. ""This gender bill would be an amazing step forward for trans rights. You are indeed on the wrong side of history,"" writes BuffyChiro. Campaign group Stonewall called the current system""demeaning and broken"". Writer and broadcaster Paris Lees transitioned when she was a teenager. She has not applied for a GRC but her passport says she's female. She told the BBC anything to make the transitioning process ""just a little bit easier"" was ""long overdue and great news"". She rejects the fears raised on Mumsnet and elsewhere as""absurd"",external. It can take more than five years for trans men and women in England and Wales to legally change their gender under the current system To change gender in the eyes of the law, individuals have to apply for a certificate under the 2004 Gender Recognition Act They must be aged 18 or older and must live for two years in their preferred gender They need to have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a psychiatrist - a condition where a person experiences distress because of a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity Once someone has this diagnosis, they can apply to a gender recognition panel - a legal tribunal which will look at the evidence submitted before deciding whether to issue a certificate People can change the gender on documentation including passports and driving licences without a gender recognition certificate Read more Critics of a change also warn about possible implications for data gathering. If official information no longer distinguishes between natal sex and identified sex, statistics would inevitably be affected. ""This would obscure important trends in society,"" Sarah said, ""like the gender pay gap, crime and male violence - especially with regard to who is committing crimes against who"". Trans people currently have explicit protection under the Equality Act if they've undergone ""gender reassignment"", be it medical or non-medical. Other so-called protected characteristics include race, religion, sex and disability. But the term ""gender reassignment"" has been deemed outdated and a bill to change the protected characteristic to ""gender identity"", is awaiting its second reading in the House of Commons. ""Gender identity legislation makes it appear that sex discrimination doesn't exist anymore. But it does,"" said Sarah. Broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray came under criticism in March after suggesting men who have had sex-change operations should not claim to be ""real women"" Stephanie Davies-Arai founded the Transgender Trend website - a group for parents to discuss transgender issues. ""Men could in effect identify their way into the protected category for women,"" she said. What this means for women, Stephanie argues, is that the female sex would no longer have a protected category or political representation. ""'Women are oppressed on the basis of their biological sex, not their gender identity,"" she added. ""There has to be a place for the female sex as a distinct group."" This argument - the distinction between sex and gender - is refuted by some, including trans activist and feminist author Julia Serano, who argues there aremore than two discrete mutually exclusive sexes,external. Instead, she argues sex is made up of a number of variable dimorphic traits - like chromosomes and reproductive organs - that sometimes align in a person, and sometimes don't. Both Sarah and Stephanie have stressed their support for trans rights, but that hasn't stopped criticism being directed at them. ""There's a climate that if you challenge this - you are a trans-phobic, bigoted hater,"" Stephanie says. The government's consultation is due to be published in the autumn, but until then the debate for all women's rights continues. How do you legally change gender?

Kids Company ex-directors facing bans,"Business Secretary Greg Clark is to bring proceedings against former directors of the collapsed charity Kids Company charity to have them banned from company directorships. The Insolvency Service names former chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh, Alan Yentob and seven others. Kids Company - which provided support to deprived and vulnerable children - closed down in August 2015 following allegations of mismanagement. The bans would be for up to six years. The list of nine directors includes Mr Yentob, who was creative director at the BBC at the time of the charity's collapse. The proceedings name all nine former directors; Sunetra Devi Atkinson, Erica Jane Bolton, Richard Gordonn Handover, Vincent Gerald O'Brien, Francesca Mary Robinson, Jane Tyler, Andrew Webster and Alan Yentob,"" said the Insolvency Service statement. ""The former chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh was not formally a director at the time the charity collapsed. However, the proceedings will allege that she acted as a de facto director and should therefore also be disqualified from running or controlling other companies."" ""We can confirm that the Insolvency Service has written to the former directors of Keeping Kids Company informing them that the Business Secretary intends to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods of between two-and-a-half and six years. ""As this matter will now be tested in the Court, it is not appropriate to comment further."" Former Prime Minister David Cameron supported Kids Company Founded in 1996 in south London, Kids Company employed more than 600 people, with high-profile supporters including former Prime Minister David Cameron. The charity relied heavily on public money. In its last set of published accounts, for 2013, the government provided Â£4m, about one-fifth of its annual Â£20m funding. When it closed in August 2015, the charity said its finances had become stretched because of the number of children ""pouring"" through its doors for help. But donors had been steadily withdrawing support, alarmed by stories of alleged mismanagement. Earlier that summer, the charity had said it wanted to restructure and had sought new funds from the government and donors. But it closed, with ministers saying they wanted to recover a Â£3m grant they had given to the charity a week before.

Riot police tackle prison disturbance,"This video can not be played Riot-trained staff were sent to Mount Prison in Hertfordshire Riot-trained prison staff were sent to a jail amid reports of violence on two wings. Sources earlier told BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw that one wing of HMP The Mount in Hertfordshire and half of another wing had been ""lost"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) later said the incident was ""resolved"" and no staff or prisoners had been injured. A report into the jail published earlier,externalhighlighted staffing problems and said violence was an issue. The Mount, in Bovingdon village near Hemel Hempstead, opened in 1987 and is classed as a category C male prison. A ""tornado team"" made up of riot-trained staff arrived at the jail at about 18:30, equipped with shields and batons while fire, police and ambulance crews were on standby outside. Riot officers with shields entered HMP The Mount at about 18:30 BST The MoJ said officers had dealt with an ""incident involving a number of prisoners"". The BBC understands the wings involved were H and L, which house 110 and 117 prisoners. At about 23:45, a Prison Service spokesman said: ""Specialist prison staff resolved an incident involving a number of prisoners. There were no injuries to staff or prisoners. ""The offenders responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."" Earlier on Monday, the Independent Monitoring Board published its annual review into conditions at Mount Prison and said it had ""struggled"" with staff shortages. There were 24 vacancies out of a total of 136 officers in February, it added. It also claimed violence ""grew considerably"" throughout the year and that drugs were readily available, in particular the synthetic cannabis substitute spice. The report says concerns raised last year had not been addressed by the MoJ. The Prison Reform Trust calls this type of institution one where ""prison staff think [inmates] will not escape"", while acknowledging they ""cannot be trusted in an open prison"". Prison affairs academic and blogger Alex Cavendish hadtweeted on Saturday:,external""Staff shortages at HMP The Mount (Herts) are so severe that this is the 3rd weekend of total lockdown. Meals given at cell door. Trouble brewing."" HMP The Mount is for prisoners coming to the end of longer sentences Mark Fairhurst, of the Prison Officers Association, said staff shortages in UK jails were ""an epidemic"" and partly due to ""poor salaries"". ""We need to increase the starting salary to incentivise people to join and then we need to give them regular increments to incentivise them to stay,"" he said. Mr Fairhurst added it was difficult to retain staff because of ""adverse working conditions, the violence they face and poor salary"". Hertfordshire Police, Hertfordshire Fire Brigade and East of England Ambulance crews stood by as riot officers entered the prison The Mount is built on a former RAF station site and has more than 1,000 prisoners, according to the MoJ. It is described as a ""hybrid training and resettlement prison"" for inmates in the final six months of their sentences. A 2015 inspection of the prison found The Mount was ""reasonably safe and felt calm and well ordered"", but chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick added that there was ""room for improvement"". In March 2016 an inmate at The Mountstabbed a fellow prisoner with a shard of glassfrom a microwave. Riot staff called to prison violence.

"Child sex doll an obscene item, judge rules","David Turner dressed the black haired doll himself A judge has ruled that a child sex doll imported by a former primary school governor is an obscene item. Lawyers for David Turner had argued the doll was not covered by a law banning the importation of obscene items. But a judge dismissed that, saying ""any right-thinking person"" would find the doll obscene. Turner, 72, of Ramsgate, Kent, had already admitted possessing more than 34,000 indecent images of children. He will be sentenced in September. Other men have been convicted for importing child sex dolls, but this was the first case where the question of whether a doll is indecent or obscene had been tested by the courts. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was ""the first ruling of its kind"". Under the 1979 Customs and Excise Management Act it is against the law to import obscene or indecent items. NCA officers arrested Turner - an ex-church warden - in November last year after Border Force officers intercepted a 3ft doll that he was attempting to import from China. He claimed that it was intended to be a ""companion"" for him and his wife. David Turner arriving at Canterbury Crown Court Investigators said Turner already had two other child dolls at his home, one of which they claimed he had ""sex"" with. The charge was brought over a 3ft 10in sex doll already in his possession, which he bought clothes for. In an earlier hearing, Turner also admitted possessing more than 34,000 indecent images of children, aged from three to 16, contained on 17 pen drives.  Of the images, 138 were of the most serious kind, Category A. When interviewed, he also admitted ""secretly"" taking photographs of girls aged six to 11 in public places. Judge Simon James said the importation of a child sex doll was an ""unusual offence"" and that it ""adds a degree of complexity"" to the sentencing. Turner was freed on bail and will be sentenced on 8 September. The maximum sentence is seven years. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent More than 100 child sex dolls have been seized in the UK as part of a special operation set up by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Border Force. Investigators believe the dolls, which are made to be as life-like as possible, are being imported by people who have a ""sexual interest"" in children. Advertised as ""adult dolls"" on sites including EBay and Amazon, they are manufactured in the Far East and sent to Britain via courier, fast parcel and other delivery services. Hazel Stewart, operations manager for the NCA, said when people have been questioned by police about the dolls some have claimed they were bought for a ""joke"", others say they for ""companionship"". ""If it was a Marks and Spencer mannequin I wouldn't be stood here,"" she said. Read more from Danny Shaw. Hazel Stewart, from the National Crime Agency, said: ""We know [child sex doll] purchases can indicate other offences against children, as was the case against Turner who had a sickening stash of abuse images. ""Importers of such obscene items should expect to have law enforcement closing in on them."" Jon Brown, head of development for the NSPCC, welcomed the ruling, but wants more to be done to tackle the issue of child sex dolls. ""The NSPCC is calling on government to take action to criminalise the manufacturing, distribution and possession of these grotesque dolls, in the same way it does indecent images of children,"" he said. The NSPCC haspreviously called for sites selling the dolls to take them down, telling BBC Radio 5 live that it could lead into ""contact offending"" and ""normalises"" it.

The restaurateur who puts hospitality above food,"Shelly Fireman's career as a restaurateur spans more than five decades Like other great success stories, Sheldon Fireman's started with a sense of ambition, an understanding of the local culture, and nothing to do on a Friday night. Hanging out in the Greenwich Village neighbourhood of New York in the 1960s, Mr Fireman - Shelly to his friends - got the idea to open an all-night cafe specialising in serving breakfast food. It would be called the Hip Bagel. ""I fell in love with my idea,"" says Mr Fireman, who wanted to create a place that was fun to hang out and be seen in at all hours. He opened The Hip Bagel in 1964 at a cost of just $500 (Â£385). For the next 14 years the establishment lived up to its name - attracting celebrities such as Woody Allen and Barbra Streisand. It also propelled Mr Fireman towards becoming one of New York's preeminent restaurateurs. He was in his 20s then. Today, 53 years later, his company, Fireman Hospitality Group owns nine restaurants in New York and Washington DC that continue to attract celebrities, and which brought in nearly $60m (Â£47m) in 2016 alone. In the 1960s The Hip Bagel attracted New York celebrities looking for a late night bite Mr Fireman grew up in The Bronx, New York, and started his career in the garment business before switching to hospitality. ""I had no mentors [in the garment business],"" says Mr Fireman, ""and I was impatient to be successful in life."" That impatience drove him towards a risky industry. About 60% of restaurants in the US close in their first three years, and in New York the challenges are particularly acute. Rents are high, you need to attract both locals and tourists, and new establishments are more likely to get negative reviews. There is also competition from approximately 24,000 other eateries around the city. Decades into his career, Mr Fireman keeps moving forward with new ideas In 1974 Mr Fireman opened his second restaurant, Cafe Fiorello, just blocks from Central Park. Like The Hip Bagel, the focus was on hospitality. It's a theme he's carried through to each successive restaurant, be they fine-dining establishments like Trattoria Dell'Arte or casual restaurants like the Brooklyn Diner. Customers are more likely to remember how the place made them feel, Mr Fireman argues, than the food that they ate. ""Everyone has their favourite pizza. Who am I to say what the best is?"" he explains. ""But hospitality they remember."" Adam Platt, a restaurant critic who has covered New York's food scene for more than 15 years, says that for old-school restaurateurs like Mr Fireman, running a restaurant is a lot like putting on a Broadway show. ""He's really a theatrical producer. The Brooklyn Diner isn't really a diner and it's not in Brooklyn, but he puts together this successful production,"" says Mr Platt. The Brooklyn Diner on 57th Street is Mr Fireman's tribute to casual American dining While Mr Fireman likes to jump from one type of restaurant to another, there are characteristics common to all his establishments. Each tends to be large and to have a clearly defined concept. Prices are also high, but not out of line with nearby competitors, and each relies heavily on its location to attract a high volume of customers. The Brooklyn Diner, for example, serves on average 1,200 customers every day. Mr Fireman has a ""nose for location and for matching that location to the appetite of the neighbourhood"", says Mr Platt. In 2010, the Fireman Hospitality Group also opened its first restaurant outside of New York - an outpost of its steakhouse, Bond 45, just outside Washington DC. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: How Bite Beauty is building an all-natural lipstick business The millionaire boss who admits he had a lot of luck The man who built a $1bn firm in his basement How one man built a global hospitality empire The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich While Mr Fireman has been reluctant to work with celebrities, he does rely on investors for financial support and business guidance. He took on his first investors in 1992 when he opened Trattoria Dell'Arte, which is located opposite the famous concert venue, Carnegie Hall. Since then he has taken on outside investors for every new project, giving up 10%-15% of the ownership, depending on the restaurant. Trattoria Dell'Arte was the first of Mr Fireman's restaurants to take on outside investors ""Investors are wonderful, but you have to be able to hear their criticism,"" says Mr Fireman. Disagreeing with the businessman, who has been described as outspoken and eccentric, can be daunting. Stephen Zagor, the former manager of Trattoria Dell'Arte, says those who plan to tell Mr Fireman he's wrong better come armed with information to back it up. ""He loves a good verbal joust. If you don't have your information together he will pick you apart,"" Mr Zagor says. But Mr Fireman himself admits that not every project has been a success. A restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan gave him particular difficulty. Over the course of 15 years, it failed to make a profit, despite repeated redesigns, name changes and menu updates. A partnership to launch an outlet of the Brooklyn Diner in Dubai also failed. According to Mr Fireman, it failed to live up to the quality his partners had promised to deliver. ""You're never going to do it perfectly; if you can't take the pain of mistakes you can't do this,"" he says. With around 24,000 eateries in New York, there is a lot of competition facing Fireman group restaurants like the Redeye Grill The company has also faced criticism from employees who complain that the intense focus on hospitality means the mantra ""the customer is always right"" can sometimes be taken too far. A 2006 lawsuit also pitted the Fireman Hospitality Group against employees who claimed that they had been underpaid and wages had been withheld. The company settled the case out of court, paying $3.9m (Â£3m). None of this has shaken Mr Fireman from his desire to open more restaurants and test new concepts. After more than 50 years in the restaurant business, he is as hungry for success as ever. He is currently working on a new idea for a fast casual restaurant that he plans to launch in New York and spread throughout the US. ""Every time I think about it and improve on it and tweak it, it's like I'm finding gold,"" says Mr Fireman. Fancy a four flowers or ginger fried pork pizza?

Vanessa Feltz 'upset over racist column',"This video can not be played Vanessa Feltz describes the Sunday Times column as ""blatant racism"" Vanessa Feltz has said she felt ""extremely upset"" by a Sunday Times column which suggested she and Claudia Winkleman earned high salaries because they were Jewish. The BBC presenter described the piece by Kevin Myers as ""so obviously racist it's surprisingly hurtful"". She also questioned how no-one at the paper appeared to spot the article. Editor Martin Ivens said the piece, which was in the Irish edition and online, should not have been published. Speaking on BBC Radio London where she presents the breakfast show, Feltz said: ""I would have thought after all these years I'd be immune or used to it, but that's not at all how I felt. I felt extremely upset. ""The apologies are all very well but how did it end up in the paper in the first place?"" she added. Feltz revealed Ivens had personally rung her to apologise and had told the presenter he was ""horrified"". She said she told the editor that she could not understand how the article had been allowed to be published when it has to go through ""layers of command"". The article has been removed following outcry at its content The column, titled ""Sorry, ladies - equal pay has to be earned"", follows criticism of the BBC, after it was revealedtwo-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male. Commenting that two of the best-paid female presenters, Winkleman and Feltz, were Jewish, Myers wrote: ""Good for them. ""Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity."" Times readers - who must pay a subscription to access online content - commented on the original article to express their disgust. ""The proud anti-Semitism in this column is nothing short of disgraceful. Myers must go and so must the editor who approved this piece,"" Alan Simpson wrote. By Amol Rajan, BBC media editor The obvious question readers of Kevin Myers's bizarre column will ask is: ""How on earth was it published?"" The truth is in newspapers where sub-editing resources have been cut and cut in recent years idiocy will sometimes slip through. I used to be comment editor at a national title. The usual process is: you talk to the writer, distil the idea, discuss it with your editor, tell the writer to go ahead, and then when the copy comes in, you check for howlers, sharpen it up, and stick a headline on. That should then be read by the paper's editor. It's no excuse, of course, but the fact it is July - when staffing levels are low despite the evidence that historically it's an exceptionally busy month - means such mistakes are more likely to slip through. And the fact that it was in the Irish edition of the Sunday Times will help deflect responsibility from Martin Ivens, editor of the main edition, who was forced to apologise after a cartoon by Gerald Scarfe early in his tenure led to complaints of anti-Semitism. It is notable that Frank Fitzgibbon, the editor of the Irish edition, said in his statement that he ""takes full responsibility for this error of judgement"". Vanessa Feltz is right to be appalled. Myers's column was not only misogynistic and anti-Semitic, but intellectually incoherent too. The article was taken down following anger on social media and a formal complaint from theCampaign Against Anti-Semitism,externalto press regulator Ipso. Ivens offered the paper's ""sincere apology, both for the remarks and the error of judgement that led to publication"". Frank Fitzgibbon, editor of the Sunday Times Ireland, said he took ""full responsibility"", adding: ""This newspaper abhors anti-Semitism and did not intend to cause offence to Jewish people."" A News UK spokesman said the column included ""unacceptable comments both to Jewish people and to women in the workplace"". In the article, Myers also argued that male presenters might earn more because they ""work harder, get sick less frequently and seldom get pregnant"". The Sunday Times has said the columnist ""will not write again"" for the newspaper. Former BBC presenter Sue MacGregor has said there will never be equal pay between genders at the BBC ""until men have babies"". In an interview on the Today programme, which she hosted from 1984 until 2002, she said ""women always end up doing most of the work"" with children. This video can not be played Former Today presenter Sue MacGregor says gender pay parity is not possible until ""men have babies"" The BBC's annual report showed that the show's male presenters John Humphrys and Nick Robinson were paid more than Â£600,000 and Â£250,000 respectively. Its top-earning female presenter Mishal Husain was paid more than Â£200,000, however colleague Sarah Montague did not appear on the list of highly paid staff. Speaking about how the Today programme has changed, MacGregor said: ""My view is that there will never be totally equal pay for women until men have babies. ""They will never have equal pay because there will be times when they have to leave. ""There are extraordinary people who come back to work after two weeks or four weeks, but mostly and rightly, their attention is taken by this new little thing in their lives.""

Ceremony honours Passchendaele 'bravery',"This video can not be played Watch highlights from the ceremony The ""courage and bravery"" of those who fought in one of the bloodiest battles of World War One has been remembered, 100 years after it began. Prince Charles, Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May were among those who paid tribute to soldiers who fought at Passchendaele, in Belgium. Some 4,000 relatives attended the ceremony at Tyne Cot cemetery, Ypres. In the three months of fighting, half a million Allied and German soldiers were killed, wounded or went missing. Prince Charles addressed the service, saying: ""We remember it not only for the rain that fell, the mud that weighed down the living and swallowed the dead, but also for the courage and bravery of the men who fought here."" The conflict - officially known as the Third Battle of Ypres - was fought from 31 July 1917 until November that year. It was not only infamous for the number of casualties but the mud. Many drowned in the thick quagmire, caused by weeks of relentless rain. In pictures: Passchendaele commemoration 'I was named after a World War One battle' The stories behind the names on a village memorial Relatives remember Passchendaele on social media Descendants secured tickets to the event at the cemetery in a ballot run by the government. Former England rugby captain Lewis Moody visited Tyne Cot to pay tribute to his mother's great uncle, who is commemorated there. The 39-year-old told the BBC News Channel it was so ""hugely moving"" that he broke down in tears when he found his relative Ernest Lovejoy's spot. ""The brutality and the blood and the sacrifice that happened here is replaced with beauty, serenity, peace and calm,"" he said. Asked about the desire of young men wanting to sign up, Mr Moody said you just ""could not comprehend it now"". Prince Charles, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister Theresa May were among those to pay tribute with King Philippe of Belgium and Queen Mathilde of Belgium The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the grave of the Unknown Soldier during the ceremony Bill Rhodes, whose great great uncle William Rhodes died 100 years ago on the first day of the battle, said it was ""very important"" for him to be at the ceremony. ""I don't think anyone can actually appreciate how horrific it was,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""I think the conditions were unbelievable and looking at what the guys had to fight in... the rain, the mud. ""It is a very nice July day, but 100 years ago today it was very, very different."" This video can not be played Poignant details about those who died in the Passchendaele battle are read aloud King Philippe of Belgium and Prince Charles also laid floral tributes During the service, military personnel and descendants read out letters and diaries from soldiers who fought at Passchendaele. An account by Private Bert Ferns, of the Lancashire Fusiliers, who fought in the battle, was read by Fusilier Shaun Mclorie. He said: ""I staggered up the hill and then dropped over the slope into a sort of gully. ""It was here that I froze and became very frightened because a big shell had just burst and blown a group of lads to bits; there were bits of men all over the place, a terrible sight, men just blown to nothing. ""I just stood there. It was still and misty, and I could taste their blood in the air.""

The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the grave of the Unknown Soldier and Prince Charles and King Philippe led the laying of wreaths at the cross of remembrance. Some stopped to take photographs of the gravestones The ceremony ended with a fly past by the Belgian air force in a formation that paid tribute to ""the missing man"". By Kate Palmer, BBC News, at Tyne Cot cemetery Once a battlefield of liquid mud, Tyne Cot is now an immaculately maintained cemetery. Thousands of people have gathered for Monday's service to mark the centenary of the Battle of Passchendaele, but their numbers are dwarfed by rows of pristine graves and an imposing stone Memorial to the Missing. ""It has hit home, quite how disastrous the death toll was,"" says Ann Philips, whose uncle Edward Woolley was killed weeks into the battle, age 22, on 22 August 1917. She is wearing a white dress with poppies, as she finds her Uncle Ted's name on the cemetery's memorial, alongside 35,000 other missing soldiers. Many were a similar age to student Daniel Fay, 20, whose great-great-uncle James McBarrons was a labourer in Paisley before the war. He died aged 28. ""It makes me think of my group of friends who would have been the same age,"" he says. A few miles away in Ypres, the city has hosted a weekend of culture, telling stories of heroism and sacrifice in song and plays. But today strikes a solemn, more contemplative tone. 'It's overwhelming to take in how much they gave' Prince Charles also visited a WW1 bunker, which lies about 30ft (9m) below ground in the town of Zonnebeke near Ypres. He met the grandson and great-grandson of Company Sergeant Major Henry Hawtin of 171 Tunnelling Company - one of the men who excavated it. His grandson, retired RAF Regiment Wing Commander Pete Hawtin, 49, said: ""Prince Charles was fascinated to meet relatives of a man who had physically been down there. ""He just couldn't believe that men would be that far below ground and how they could survive down there and work.""

Ronaldo appears in court on tax charges,"Ronaldo could potentially be jailed for three-and-a-half years if found guilty, experts say Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has appeared at a Spanish court where he was facing allegations he evaded millions in tax. Prosecutors accuse Ronaldo, reported to be the world's highest paid athlete, of evading â¬14.7m ($17.3m; Â£13.1m) in tax. He had been expected to make a statement after the pre-trial hearing, but left without saying a word. The Real Madrid star, 32, has previously denied the allegations, saying his ""conscience is clear"". Ronaldo is the latest in a string of footballers to be pursued by the Spanish tax authorities. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? Will Ronaldo really leave Real Madrid? Argentina's Lionel Messi, who plays for Barcelona, was handed a 21-month prison sentence after being found guilty of the same charge last year. Earlier this month, the court ruled he could pay â¬252,000 in place of jail time. However, Messi was only accused of evading â¬4.1m in tax, â¬10.6m less than Ronaldo. Ronaldo spent an hour-and-a-half giving evidence to judges at a court in the Madrid suburb of Pozuelo de AlarcÃ³n on Monday, dodging the media camped outside by arriving and leaving via an underground garage. The stage was set for Ronaldo, in more ways than one. Around 40 TV crews and over 100 journalists had gathered at the small court in the Madrid suburb of Pozeulo. But Ronaldo dodged them on arrival - choosing to enter the court by a side door. This video can not be played Boos from the media after Ronaldo decides against giving a statement By then, a lectern and a sound system arrived. Ronaldo would, we were told, speak to the world's media once he had finished giving his testimony. With the crowd of journalists poised to hear from the world's best paid player there was then disappointment. Ronaldo had gone home having decided against saying anything. His case continues. So too will the huge interest in it and him. According to prosecutors, Ronaldo allegedly took ""advantage of a company structure created in 2010 to hide income generated in Spain from his image rights from tax authorities"", which was a ""voluntary and conscious breach of his fiscal obligations in Spain"". Ronaldo's management has also denied the allegations. But if the case is sent to trial and he is found guilty, the Portuguese forward could face a fine of ""at least â¬28m"" and a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years, the Gestha union of experts at Spain's Inland Revenue says.

Optometrist wins manslaughter appeal,"The lack of diagnosis by optometrist Honey Rose was deemed so severe legal proceedings were started An optometrist has had her conviction quashed after failing to spot an eye condition in an eight-year-old boy who later died. Honey Rose, 35, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter after Vincent Barker died in July 2012 when fluid built up on his brain. She was given a two-year suspended sentence in August after missing the condition during a routine eye test. Vincent's family said the appeal court ruling had left them ""devastated"". Judges found there had been a ""serious breach of duty"", but that was a matter for regulators and not the courts. During her trial last year mother-of three Ms Rose, from Newham, east London, told the court she had conducted all the required tests during Vincent's eye examination at the Ipswich branch of Boots on 15 February 2012. However, a jury heard she failed to notice that the boy had swollen optic discs, an abnormality which is a symptom of hydrocephalus - fluid on the brain. Vincent, known as Vinnie, died in July 2012, about five months after the eye test. Vincent Barker died after a build-up of fluid on his brain led to an increase in pressure in his skull Sir Brian Leveson, sitting with two other judges at The Court of Appeal, said: ""This decision does not, in any sense, condone the negligence that the jury must have found to have been established at a high level in relation to the way that Ms Rose examined Vincent and failed to identify the defect which ultimately led to his death. ""That serious breach of duty is a matter for her regulator; in the context of this case, however, it does not constitute the crime of gross negligence manslaughter."" The Barker family said a guilty verdict would ""never make us winners, our loss is simply too great"" A statement released by the Barker family after Monday's ruling said: ""We are understandably devastated. We feel that the conviction of manslaughter by gross negligence should have been upheld. ""We remain in no doubt that if Honey Rose had not breached her duty of care to our son he would still be with us today."" Not only was Vinnie ""let down"" by his optometrist, but ""he has also been failed by the legal system"", they added.

Mongolian girl grappling with sumo world,"Mongolian wrestlers have dominated the Japanese sumo scene for years and Bum-Erdene Tuvshinjargal is keen to follow in their footsteps. As a girl, that means challenging centuries of tradition, but that's another fight she's ready to take on. She spoke to journalist Erin Craig at her home in Ulan Bator. On one side of the ring squats a formidable, heavyset wrestler, the traditional mawashi wound around his waist. On the other is Bum-Erdene Tuvshinjargal, her loincloth wrapped over black spandex. The competitors wait, stare, then cannon toward each other. They hit in the centre, straining in a slow dance of raw power. Then Tuvshinjargal explodes forward, muscling her opponent out of the ring. She gives a rare, brief smile as she walks off the mat. ""You can't be scared,"" says the 17 year old sumo world champion. ""If you're scared you won't win."" As a child, Tuvshinjargal watched sumo on TV with her grandparents, never dreaming she would be a wrestler herself. She later took up judo, and in 2015 her instructor suggested trying sumo at a competition the following month. That competition turned out to be the Junior Sumo World Championships. Tuvshinjargal came home with a bronze medal. Last year she went back for the gold. Her coach, Gankhyag Naranbat, thinks this is just the beginning. As a former rikishi - a professional sumo wrestler - and World Games gold medallist, he knows what to look for in a competitor. ""I think she will be more than three times world champion, heavyweight category,"" he predicts. That would break a world record - one established only last year by Tuvshinjargal's teammate, Khishigdorj Sunjidmaa. But no matter how many records she breaks, Tuvshinjargal's career is approaching the rice paper ceiling. In sumo, only men can go pro. Professional sumo is only practiced in Japan where rikishi participate in six annual Grand Tournaments. Sumo began as a religious ceremony and the sport remains deeply ritualistic. Tradition forbids women even entering the ring. Pro sumo only exists in Japan - and only for men But women have competed at the amateur level since the mid-1990s when Olympic aspirations convinced the sport to go ""co-ed"". Sumo still hasn't made the Olympics but after 12 World Championships women have become an integral part of landscape. Unlike many female wrestlers, Tuvshinjargal comes from a country where sumo is incredibly popular. Mongolian rikishi have dominated professional sumo for years; just this month Mongolian superstar Hakuho broke the world record for total career wins. Wrestling has always been important to Mongolian culture, as one of the legendary Three Manly Sports, and many boys learn sumo alongside traditional wrestling. According to Naranbat, Mongolians fundamentally changed sumo by bringing in moves from traditional wrestling. While sumo matches can be over in seconds, Mongolian wrestling isn't limited by a ring and requires more time and strategy. ""Before Mongolian wrestlers sumo was only pushing,"" says Naranbat. ""That's why Mongolian wrestlers are high level."" But amateur sumo isn't covered in the Mongolian media, leaving female wrestlers permanently in the dark. People are often surprised to learn they exist. They're even more surprised to see what these women can do. ""They think that when I'm on this mat I looks like a beast."" Tuvshinjargal acknowledges. ""But when I step out of this building, I'm just a girl."" And like most people her age she is thinking about the future. After graduating from high school last June, she has been busy applying to universities and considering careers. Most of all, she wants to forge a path as a female wrestler. ""I have given my heart to sumo,"" she says. ""I want to pursue it to the highest level."" It's unclear whether she could make it a career, as amateurs don't usually receive sponsorships. The Mongolian government gives monetary awards to medal winners but with only one major international competition a year even a gold medal isn't enough to live on. She would love to combine her other passion - acting - with athletics, like her favourite movie star Jackie Chan. That's not unprecedented - Mongolian sumo champion Ulambayar Byambajav has appeared on several TV programmes. Or she could blaze new territory and become the country's first female sumo coach. Like many of her teammates, Tuvshinjargal can rely on a supportive family. Her grandparents enjoy experiencing sumo through her instead of the TV and their walls are covered in pictures of Tuvshinjargal in her mawashi. The 2018 World Championship will be Tuvshinjargal's last match in the junior division unless she outperforms the older women to earn a place in the adult division. It could be long until sumo offers a career for women as it does for men She already competed on the Mongolian National Women's Team during 2016 World Championships, which placed second overall. After that, her eyes are on the 2021 World Games and maybe, someday, the Olympics. Naranbat is quietly confident in his student's ability. After all, she is already strong enough to beat men. Once she masters the strategy, there will be no stopping her. And if the rules changed, if women were allowed to go pro, would Tuvshinjargal have the ability to make it? ""Yes,"" he says. ""She would be a champion."" Japan gets first sumo champion in 19 years Senegal fighters wrestle with sumo.

Ypres lights up to remember dark past of Passchendaele,"Stories from the battle were projected onto the outside of Cloth Hall on Sunday evening The lonely, eerie sound of a bugle is one that locals in Ypres, Belgium, are well used to. But for the thousands of Britons gathered around the imposing white stone memorial of Menin Gate, it may be the first time they have heard a melody that has sounded at that spot almost every night for 90 years. The Last Post is played each evening by Belgian buglers - volunteers who play the call to remember British and Commonwealth soldiers who defended their town. But Sunday night was different. William and Kate remember WW1 battle 'I was named after a World War One battle' Passchendaele's untold army of women nurses Standing under the vast stone arch were British and Belgian royals, the UK prime minister, members of the armed forces and faith leaders, many carrying flowers and wreaths of red poppies. They had gathered for a special service to mark a century since the start of the Battle of Passchendaele. And lining the road leading to the gate were thousands more - many with a personal connection to the battle. The prime minister stands alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the King and Queen of Belgium, under Menin Gate Robert Lloyd-Rees, 75, has been camped outside a coffee shop by the gate since Sunday morning. ""What this town does, to commemorate those soldiers, is remarkable,"" he says. It is 60 years since Robert has heard the Last Post, he says, having first visited Ypres with his father Tom, who served at Passchendaele in the Welsh Regiment's Machine Gun Corps. Robert, who comes from Bristol and now lives in Ottawa, Canada, says the trip has been ""tearful"". Robert Lloyd-Rees' father served at Passchendaele Earlier that day, he had visited Tyne Cot, a large war cemetery a few miles from Ypres, which he first walked around with his father. ""I remember him stopping at two gravestones and I had asked, 'Dad, what is it?' and he said 'These are my friends'. ""He told me that he had spent two days and two nights behind his machine gun, while two of his comrades lay dead on the sandbags,"" Robert says. He does not know how his father, who was just 17 when he signed up in 1914 and had lied about his age, could ""withstand such horror"", but recalls that he rarely spoke of his wartime experiences. Headstones to unknown soldiers lay in rows in Tyne Cot cemetery Menin Gate may be on foreign soil but bears the names of more than 54,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who fought at Passchendaele, and whose graves are not known. Father and son Phil and Luke Seeley were also outside the gate, to remember their relative - Sgt Herbert Seeley. Herbert was injured and sent back to the frontline four times during the war - eventually being sent to Passchendaele in 1917 - but miraculously survived the war. WW1 'melting' mud sculpture unveiled WW1 missing Ypres bells on show ""My dad says he remembers him sitting in the corner of the room and he would not say anything,"" says Phil. ""He was bayoneted and sent home to recover, but each time went back knowing what it would be like."" ""I've got goosebumps,"" Phil adds, who says Herbert, from Colchester in Essex, began the war as a private and was by 1918 promoted to a warrant officer. ""We're here to find out more about what it must have been like."" Phil Seeley and his son and Luke travelled to Ypres to find out more about his father Herbert, who fought at Passchendaele For three months from 31 July 1917, the battle for a number of ridges south and east of the Belgian town of Ypres resulted in massive loss on both sides, with nearly half a million soldiers thought to be killed, wounded or missing. Phil and 16-year-old Luke travelled from Colchester through the night to reach Ypres. ""We arrived at around three in the morning, and had to wait outside our campsite for five hours,"" says Phil. ""We were so tired and hungry and barely able to move, and thought what must it have been like feeling like this and living in total fear for three months."" There was near silence among the crowd as the bugles began playing at 20:00 (19:00 BST). After readings and more music, poppies were released from the arch of the gate to mark the climax of the ceremony. Paper poppies fell to represent the soldiers named on Menin Gate A short walk away from the gate was Ypres' medieval Cloth Hall, which was rebuilt from ruins after the war. For this occasion it was illuminated, and was the focus of much of the sense of excitement in the city, as well as quiet contemplation . The events continue on Monday, where a commemoration service is expected to strike a more sombre tone. At Tyne Cot cemetery - the site of 11,000 graves and a memorial to more than 35,000 missing soldiers - royals and relatives will attend an afternoon of song and remembrance. Tyne Cot's rows of immaculately maintained, white graves are a reminder of the battle's death toll. One hundred years on, Passchendaele is still synonymous with the blood and horror of the First World War. ""It's ensuring that we don't forget,"" says Robert, who has a firm plan to ensure that younger relatives know all about and can take pride in what one member of the Lloyd-Rees family did at Passchendale 100 years ago. He says: ""I'll be showing my grandson my father's medals.""

Bid to prosecute Blair over Iraq fails,"The High Court has blocked an attempt to bring a private prosecution against Tony Blair over the Iraq War. Former Iraqi general Abdul Wahed Shannan Al Rabbat alleged the former prime minister committed ""the crime of aggression"" by invading Iraq in 2003. No such crime exists in England and Wales and the court ruled there was ""no prospect"" of the case succeeding. The general had wanted to prosecute Mr Blair, ex-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, and ex-Attorney General Lord Goldsmith. Last year, Westminster Magistrates' Court had turned down Mr Al Rabbat's bid to bring private prosecution. He then sought a judicial review in an attempt to get the Supreme Court - the UK's highest court - to overturn a 2006 House of Lords ruling that there is no such crime as the crime of aggression under the law of England and Wales. However, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the Lord Chief Justice, and Mr Justice Ouseley dismissed the general's application, saying there was ""no prospect"" of the case succeeding. The UK's attorney general had earlier intervened in the case, urging the High Court to block the challenge on the grounds that it was ""hopeless"". Reacting to the ruling, a spokesperson for the attorney general's office said the case had raised ""important issues about the scope of the criminal law"". ""It should be for Parliament, and not the courts, to create new criminal offences. This principle was upheld when the House of Lords ruled in 2006 that the 'crime of aggression' does not exist in English law. ""In this legal challenge, we argued that this remains the case today and the courts agreed."" Tony Blair visited troops in Basra in 2005 In 2003, the UK joined the US-led coalition to overthrow Saddam Hussein, after then US president George W Bush and Mr Blair accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction. Last year, the UK's Iraq War inquiry, led by Sir John Chilcot, ruled the invasion had not been the ""last resort"" presented to MPs and the public. His report ruled Mr Blair had overstated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. Michael Mansfield QC, appearing for Mr Al Rabbat, argued the report justified the prosecution of Mr Blair. He said a paragraph in it could be summarised as concluding that Saddam Hussein did not pose an urgent threat to the interests of the UK. It said the intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction had been presented with ""unwarranted certainty"". Mr Mansfield told the court: ""Nothing could be more emphatic than this evidence. ""It does not say there was an unlawful war or crime of aggression. It doesn't need to because the criteria are arguably all there in that paragraph."" Speaking last year, former Labour prime minister Mr Blair apologised to the families of those killed in the 2003 Iraq War, but insisted he did what he thought was the ""right thing"" at the time.

Jolie denies child audition 'cruelty',"Angelina Jolie has come under fire for her description of recruiting child actors Angelina Jolie has fiercely denied playing tricks on Cambodian children while casting for a film. The actress and UN special envoy recruited local children to star in her film about Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, First They Killed My Father. She spoke to Vanity Fair about the film,externaland explained how they used a casting game which involved giving money to poor children then taking it away. The interview caused outrage, with many accusing Jolie of being ""exploitative"". In it, Jolie explains how the directors looked through slums and orphanages to find actors for the film, and were ""specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship"". Their casting game saw children being asked to snatch some money, and then when caught, come up with a lie for why they stole it. Srey Moch (pictured left) eventually landed the lead role in Jolie's Netflix movie ""Srey Moch [who was selected for the lead role] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,"" Jolie told the magazine. ""When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion... When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn't have enough money for a nice funeral."" Angelina Jolie on Cambodia, politics and a 'difficult year' Jolie on her Netflix directorial debut Cooking bugs with Angelina Jolie in Cambodia Jolie, who directed the Netflix film, said it was ""false and upsetting"" that people misinterpreted her description of the casting process. ""I am upset that a pretend exercise in an improvisation, from an actual scene in the film, has been written about as if it was a real scenario,"" Jolie said in a statement. She added: ""The point of this film is to bring attention to the horrors children face in war and to help fight to protect them. The suggestion that real money was taken from a child during an audition is false and upsetting. I would be outraged myself if this had happened."" ""Every measure was taken to ensure the safety, comfort and well-being of the children on the film starting from the auditions through production to the present,"" she said. This video can not be played Jolie on family, film and Cambodia First They Killed My Father is Jolie's directorial debut for streaming giant Netflix. It is based on a true-life account of a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide and is told through the eyes of a child. Jolie told the BBC earlier this year that she hoped the film would help Cambodians speak more openly about their period of trauma. Jolie's controversial account of casting drew outrage among many, with social media users calling it ""emotionally abusive and cruel"". ""Angelina Jolie has gone too far,"" wrote one woman on Facebook. ""For someone who constantly declares her love for Cambodia and children, this was a sick and depraved stunt she pulled. Some philanthropist she is."" ""Child abuse"" was how one Facebook user described it, slamming Jolie's ""authentic methods"" of casting. ""You are no longer welcome in my world. You didn't realise you were dealing with children with post-traumatic syndrome (PTSD) and poverty?"" But some fans stood by Jolie's defence. ""This all sounds like it was taken out of context,"" said Nathalie Anderson. ""She is a humanitarian and I believe she would never traumatise children like that.""

French actress Jeanne Moreau dies at 89,"Moreau once said ""physical beauty is a disgrace"" Actress Jeanne Moreau, one of French cinema's biggest stars of the last 60 years, has died at the age of 89. Moreau is probably best known for her role in Francois Truffaut's 1962 new wave film Jules et Jim. She won a number of awards including the best actress prize at Cannes for Moderato Cantabile in 1960. She also worked with Orson Welles on several films and won the Bafta Award for best foreign actress for Viva Maria! in 1967. Moreau appeared in Joseph Losey's Eva in 1961 Moreau was found dead at her home in Paris, the district's mayor told the AFP news agency. Paying tribute, French President Emmanuel Macron said Moreau had ""embodied cinema"" and was a free spirit who ""always rebelled against the established  order"". Of the three most iconic French actresses of her generation - herself, Catherine Deneuve and Brigitte Bardot - Moreau was the one with the most on-screen authority. Post-war French cinema is unthinkable without her. So many key directors owe important, often breakthrough successes to her - Louis Malle's Lift to the Scaffold and The Lovers, Francois Truffaut's Jules et Jim and Jacques Demy's Bay of Angels, for instance. Her famous sensual presence was backed up with formidable timing and technique, so much so that every major director wanted to work with her - Orson Welles, Michelangelo Antonioni, Joseph Losey and Luis Bunuel among them. She was, perhaps, the female equivalent of what Welles called a ""king"" actor - someone who cannot help but be the centre of attention. Certainly, over time, she became almost everyone's idea of the ultimate magnetic French movie star. Moreau made her name in the 1950s - pictured with Fernand Ledoux in a 1951 production of Tartuffe Moreau was born in 1928, the daughter of a French restaurateur and a Tiller Girl dancer from Oldham. She pursued an acting career, despite her father's disapproval, and got her break in the 1957 films Lift to the Scaffold, which had a jazz score by Miles Davis, and The Lovers. Known for her husky tones, her other films included 1961's La Notte, directed by Michelangelo Antonioni; Luis Bunuel's Diary of a Chambermaid (1964); and Tony Richardson's Mademoiselle (1966). Welles, who worked with her on films including Chimes at Midnight and his adaptation of Kafka's The Trial, once described her as the greatest actress in the world. Moreau (left) and Brigitte Bardot starred in the comedy Viva Maria!, directed by Louis Malle She famously turned down Mike Nichols' invitation to play Mrs Robinson in The Graduate, and instead reunited with Truffaut for 1968's The Bride Wore Black, an homage to Alfred Hitchcock. She was also known for her singing voice and performed the refrain Le Tourbillon de la Vie in Jules et Jim. Moreau had a prolific career and continued acting into her 80s. She posed with Steven Spielberg after they both won Cesar Awards in 1995 In an interview with the New York Times in 1989, she said: ""I work more now because at this time of my life I am not disturbed from my aim by outside pressures such as family, passionate relationships, dealing with who am I - those complications when one is searching for one's self. I have no doubt who I am."" Her theatre career included a role in 1989 as a matchmaker in La Celestine, a 15th Century Spanish play by De Fernando de Rojas. Moreau won one of France's highest acting honours, a Cesar for best actress, for The Old Lady Who Walked in the Sea in 1992.

Service marking Passchendaele centenary,"This video can not be played Watch highlights from the ceremony The ""courage and bravery"" of those who fought in one of the bloodiest battles of World War One has been remembered, 100 years after it began. Prince Charles, Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May were among those who paid tribute to soldiers who fought at Passchendaele, in Belgium. Some 4,000 relatives attended the ceremony at Tyne Cot cemetery, Ypres. In the three months of fighting, half a million Allied and German soldiers were killed, wounded or went missing. Prince Charles addressed the service, saying: ""We remember it not only for the rain that fell, the mud that weighed down the living and swallowed the dead, but also for the courage and bravery of the men who fought here."" The conflict - officially known as the Third Battle of Ypres - was fought from 31 July 1917 until November that year. It was not only infamous for the number of casualties but the mud. Many drowned in the thick quagmire, caused by weeks of relentless rain. In pictures: Passchendaele commemoration 'I was named after a World War One battle' The stories behind the names on a village memorial Relatives remember Passchendaele on social media Descendants secured tickets to the event at the cemetery in a ballot run by the government. Former England rugby captain Lewis Moody visited Tyne Cot to pay tribute to his mother's great uncle, who is commemorated there. The 39-year-old told the BBC News Channel it was so ""hugely moving"" that he broke down in tears when he found his relative Ernest Lovejoy's spot. ""The brutality and the blood and the sacrifice that happened here is replaced with beauty, serenity, peace and calm,"" he said. Asked about the desire of young men wanting to sign up, Mr Moody said you just ""could not comprehend it now"". Prince Charles, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister Theresa May were among those to pay tribute with King Philippe of Belgium and Queen Mathilde of Belgium The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the grave of the Unknown Soldier during the ceremony Bill Rhodes, whose great great uncle William Rhodes died 100 years ago on the first day of the battle, said it was ""very important"" for him to be at the ceremony. ""I don't think anyone can actually appreciate how horrific it was,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""I think the conditions were unbelievable and looking at what the guys had to fight in... the rain, the mud. ""It is a very nice July day, but 100 years ago today it was very, very different."" This video can not be played Poignant details about those who died in the Passchendaele battle are read aloud King Philippe of Belgium and Prince Charles also laid floral tributes During the service, military personnel and descendants read out letters and diaries from soldiers who fought at Passchendaele. An account by Private Bert Ferns, of the Lancashire Fusiliers, who fought in the battle, was read by Fusilier Shaun Mclorie. He said: ""I staggered up the hill and then dropped over the slope into a sort of gully. ""It was here that I froze and became very frightened because a big shell had just burst and blown a group of lads to bits; there were bits of men all over the place, a terrible sight, men just blown to nothing. ""I just stood there. It was still and misty, and I could taste their blood in the air.""

The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the grave of the Unknown Soldier and Prince Charles and King Philippe led the laying of wreaths at the cross of remembrance. Some stopped to take photographs of the gravestones The ceremony ended with a fly past by the Belgian air force in a formation that paid tribute to ""the missing man"". By Kate Palmer, BBC News, at Tyne Cot cemetery Once a battlefield of liquid mud, Tyne Cot is now an immaculately maintained cemetery. Thousands of people have gathered for Monday's service to mark the centenary of the Battle of Passchendaele, but their numbers are dwarfed by rows of pristine graves and an imposing stone Memorial to the Missing. ""It has hit home, quite how disastrous the death toll was,"" says Ann Philips, whose uncle Edward Woolley was killed weeks into the battle, age 22, on 22 August 1917. She is wearing a white dress with poppies, as she finds her Uncle Ted's name on the cemetery's memorial, alongside 35,000 other missing soldiers. Many were a similar age to student Daniel Fay, 20, whose great-great-uncle James McBarrons was a labourer in Paisley before the war. He died aged 28. ""It makes me think of my group of friends who would have been the same age,"" he says. A few miles away in Ypres, the city has hosted a weekend of culture, telling stories of heroism and sacrifice in song and plays. But today strikes a solemn, more contemplative tone. 'It's overwhelming to take in how much they gave' Prince Charles also visited a WW1 bunker, which lies about 30ft (9m) below ground in the town of Zonnebeke near Ypres. He met the grandson and great-grandson of Company Sergeant Major Henry Hawtin of 171 Tunnelling Company - one of the men who excavated it. His grandson, retired RAF Regiment Wing Commander Pete Hawtin, 49, said: ""Prince Charles was fascinated to meet relatives of a man who had physically been down there. ""He just couldn't believe that men would be that far below ground and how they could survive down there and work.""

"UK won't cut taxes, Hammond tells French","The UK will not cut tax and regulations after Brexit in a bid to undercut EU rivals, Philip Hammond has suggested. The chancellor told French newspaper Le Monde that tax raised as a percentage of the British economy ""puts us right in the middle"" of European countries. ""We don't want that to change, even after we've left the EU,"" he added. It has been viewed as a softer tone from Mr Hammond, who in January said the UK would do ""whatever we have to do"" post-Brexit to stay competitive. But Labour said Mr Hammond was ""in open dispute"" with himself. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says that having lost their majority at this year's general election, the Conservatives would struggle to persuade the Commons to support slashing taxes and regulation. Fox holds firm on opposing free movement Mapped: The three Brexiteers' trips In his latest interview, Mr Hammond told Le Monde: ""I often hear it said that the UK is considering participating in unfair competition in regulation and tax. ""That is neither our plan nor our vision for the future. ""I would expect us to remain a country with a social, economic and cultural model that is recognisably European."" Our correspondent said those words ""appeared to be at odds with some of his own comments earlier this year"". Cutting taxes and business regulations would make the UK more like Singapore During an interview in January, Mr Hammond was asked by Welt am Sonntag whether the UK could become a tax haven after leaving the EU. He said he was ""optimistic"" about securing a good trade deal with the EU but if this did not happen ""you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do"". ""If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term,"" he said at the time. ""In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness."" Labour said Mr Hammond was now contradicting what he had said at the start of the year. ""The truth is that the British people will not believe the fake U-turn of a Tory chancellor in a French newspaper, while he is still going ahead with billions of pounds in corporation tax giveaways in this parliament, and refuses to rule out further cuts,"" said shadow minister Peter Dowd. In his latest interview, Mr Hammond also said the UK wanted EU workers be part of the British economy and carry on with their family life in the country, and the same for British expats working in Europe. He said the bill for Brexit was not a question about money, but how the UK leaves the EU without causing problems for businesses and people. Breaking up the City of London would benefit New York not Frankfurt or Paris, he added.

Ronaldo to appear in court on tax charges,"Ronaldo could potentially be jailed for three-and-a-half years if found guilty, experts say Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has appeared at a Spanish court where he was facing allegations he evaded millions in tax. Prosecutors accuse Ronaldo, reported to be the world's highest paid athlete, of evading â¬14.7m ($17.3m; Â£13.1m) in tax. He had been expected to make a statement after the pre-trial hearing, but left without saying a word. The Real Madrid star, 32, has previously denied the allegations, saying his ""conscience is clear"". Ronaldo is the latest in a string of footballers to be pursued by the Spanish tax authorities. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? Will Ronaldo really leave Real Madrid? Argentina's Lionel Messi, who plays for Barcelona, was handed a 21-month prison sentence after being found guilty of the same charge last year. Earlier this month, the court ruled he could pay â¬252,000 in place of jail time. However, Messi was only accused of evading â¬4.1m in tax, â¬10.6m less than Ronaldo. Ronaldo spent an hour-and-a-half giving evidence to judges at a court in the Madrid suburb of Pozuelo de AlarcÃ³n on Monday, dodging the media camped outside by arriving and leaving via an underground garage. The stage was set for Ronaldo, in more ways than one. Around 40 TV crews and over 100 journalists had gathered at the small court in the Madrid suburb of Pozeulo. But Ronaldo dodged them on arrival - choosing to enter the court by a side door. This video can not be played Boos from the media after Ronaldo decides against giving a statement By then, a lectern and a sound system arrived. Ronaldo would, we were told, speak to the world's media once he had finished giving his testimony. With the crowd of journalists poised to hear from the world's best paid player there was then disappointment. Ronaldo had gone home having decided against saying anything. His case continues. So too will the huge interest in it and him. According to prosecutors, Ronaldo allegedly took ""advantage of a company structure created in 2010 to hide income generated in Spain from his image rights from tax authorities"", which was a ""voluntary and conscious breach of his fiscal obligations in Spain"". Ronaldo's management has also denied the allegations. But if the case is sent to trial and he is found guilty, the Portuguese forward could face a fine of ""at least â¬28m"" and a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years, the Gestha union of experts at Spain's Inland Revenue says.

Unplanned overdraft fees could be banned,"Charges for unarranged bank overdrafts could be banned, under one option being considered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It said the charges for those who go into the red without agreement can be high and complex. Earlier this month, the UK's largest lender, Lloyds, said it wasgetting rid of unarranged overdraft feesaltogether from November. Barclays has already stopped all unauthorised lending. However, other banks charge about Â£6 a day, or up to Â£90 a month. ""We believe there is a case to consider fundamental reform of unarranged overdrafts, and whether they should have a place in any modern banking market,"" the FCA said,in its review into the high-cost credit market.,external ""Maintaining the status quo is not an option,"" said FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey. Unarranged overdraft fees were often ""significantly higher"" than payday loans, he added. However, the FCA made it clear that an outright ban on unarranged overdrafts was only one option being considered. It could impose a cap on charges, or demand some affordability checks before a bank lends money on an unplanned basis. A year ago the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)decided against a capon charges. The FCA is also looking at how understandable car finance deals are Half of all overdraft users go over their agreed borrowing limit, according to the CMA. In 2014 such customers spent Â£1.2bn in charges as a result. The banking industry responded by saying that customers were usually warned if they were about to go overdrawn, usually via a text alert on on a mobile app. ""When used sustainably, consumer credit is important for economic growth, and lenders work hard to ensure the balance is right between helping customers to borrow while ensuring longer term affordability,"" said Eric Leenders, head of personal banking at UK Finance. The FCA has also highlighted concerns about the rent-to-own market, typically used by consumers to buy fridges, freezers and televisions. ""We think that is a sizeable issue, because people are paying three or four times more than if they used cash,"" Mr Bailey told the BBC. The FCA said that one option might be for housing associations to provide such goods instead. FCA considers price cap on rent-to-own agreements Mr Bailey said there were also concerns about motor finance, a worry already highlighted by the Bank of England. ""We're looking at affordability tests and the transparency of terms,"" he said. The FCA will publish an update on this work in the first quarter of 2018. As part of its review into high-cost lending, the FCA also looked at how the cap on payday loans was working. It said that the cap, first imposed in January 2015, had delivered ""substantial benefits"" to consumers. Since then, no one has had to pay more than 0.8% a day of the amount borrowed. The maximum they pay is no more than twice the amount they borrowed. The FCA said its review found that the cap meant 760,000 borrowers in this market were saving a total of Â£150m a year, that companies were now less likely to lend to customers who cannot afford to repay, and debt charities were seeing fewer people struggling with ballooning borrowing from payday loans. Mr Bailey said the FCA would continue to focus its efforts on what else needed to be done in this area.

Service to mark Passchendaele centenary,"This video can not be played Watch highlights from the ceremony The ""courage and bravery"" of those who fought in one of the bloodiest battles of World War One has been remembered, 100 years after it began. Prince Charles, Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May were among those who paid tribute to soldiers who fought at Passchendaele, in Belgium. Some 4,000 relatives attended the ceremony at Tyne Cot cemetery, Ypres. In the three months of fighting, half a million Allied and German soldiers were killed, wounded or went missing. Prince Charles addressed the service, saying: ""We remember it not only for the rain that fell, the mud that weighed down the living and swallowed the dead, but also for the courage and bravery of the men who fought here."" The conflict - officially known as the Third Battle of Ypres - was fought from 31 July 1917 until November that year. It was not only infamous for the number of casualties but the mud. Many drowned in the thick quagmire, caused by weeks of relentless rain. In pictures: Passchendaele commemoration 'I was named after a World War One battle' The stories behind the names on a village memorial Relatives remember Passchendaele on social media Descendants secured tickets to the event at the cemetery in a ballot run by the government. Former England rugby captain Lewis Moody visited Tyne Cot to pay tribute to his mother's great uncle, who is commemorated there. The 39-year-old told the BBC News Channel it was so ""hugely moving"" that he broke down in tears when he found his relative Ernest Lovejoy's spot. ""The brutality and the blood and the sacrifice that happened here is replaced with beauty, serenity, peace and calm,"" he said. Asked about the desire of young men wanting to sign up, Mr Moody said you just ""could not comprehend it now"". Prince Charles, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister Theresa May were among those to pay tribute with King Philippe of Belgium and Queen Mathilde of Belgium The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the grave of the Unknown Soldier during the ceremony Bill Rhodes, whose great great uncle William Rhodes died 100 years ago on the first day of the battle, said it was ""very important"" for him to be at the ceremony. ""I don't think anyone can actually appreciate how horrific it was,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""I think the conditions were unbelievable and looking at what the guys had to fight in... the rain, the mud. ""It is a very nice July day, but 100 years ago today it was very, very different."" This video can not be played Poignant details about those who died in the Passchendaele battle are read aloud King Philippe of Belgium and Prince Charles also laid floral tributes During the service, military personnel and descendants read out letters and diaries from soldiers who fought at Passchendaele. An account by Private Bert Ferns, of the Lancashire Fusiliers, who fought in the battle, was read by Fusilier Shaun Mclorie. He said: ""I staggered up the hill and then dropped over the slope into a sort of gully. ""It was here that I froze and became very frightened because a big shell had just burst and blown a group of lads to bits; there were bits of men all over the place, a terrible sight, men just blown to nothing. ""I just stood there. It was still and misty, and I could taste their blood in the air.""

The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the grave of the Unknown Soldier and Prince Charles and King Philippe led the laying of wreaths at the cross of remembrance. Some stopped to take photographs of the gravestones The ceremony ended with a fly past by the Belgian air force in a formation that paid tribute to ""the missing man"". By Kate Palmer, BBC News, at Tyne Cot cemetery Once a battlefield of liquid mud, Tyne Cot is now an immaculately maintained cemetery. Thousands of people have gathered for Monday's service to mark the centenary of the Battle of Passchendaele, but their numbers are dwarfed by rows of pristine graves and an imposing stone Memorial to the Missing. ""It has hit home, quite how disastrous the death toll was,"" says Ann Philips, whose uncle Edward Woolley was killed weeks into the battle, age 22, on 22 August 1917. She is wearing a white dress with poppies, as she finds her Uncle Ted's name on the cemetery's memorial, alongside 35,000 other missing soldiers. Many were a similar age to student Daniel Fay, 20, whose great-great-uncle James McBarrons was a labourer in Paisley before the war. He died aged 28. ""It makes me think of my group of friends who would have been the same age,"" he says. A few miles away in Ypres, the city has hosted a weekend of culture, telling stories of heroism and sacrifice in song and plays. But today strikes a solemn, more contemplative tone. 'It's overwhelming to take in how much they gave' Prince Charles also visited a WW1 bunker, which lies about 30ft (9m) below ground in the town of Zonnebeke near Ypres. He met the grandson and great-grandson of Company Sergeant Major Henry Hawtin of 171 Tunnelling Company - one of the men who excavated it. His grandson, retired RAF Regiment Wing Commander Pete Hawtin, 49, said: ""Prince Charles was fascinated to meet relatives of a man who had physically been down there. ""He just couldn't believe that men would be that far below ground and how they could survive down there and work.""

The village that gave men to Passchendaele,"Volunteer soldiers from Brimington pictured in 1914 - at least two were killed at Passchendaele Brimington, near Chesterfield in north-east Derbyshire, sent hundreds of its men to fight in World War One. Fifteen of them were killed at Passchendaele. Now, a couple from the village have traced out the lives, and graves, of those who died on the battlefield 100 years ago. Charles Hurst and Fred Hobson were friends, bound together by their lives in Brimington, a busy working-class village where they lived during the early 1900s. They worked in the same production shop for the Staveley Coal and Iron Company, and played cricket together. Most notably of all, both stepped forward on the same day in March 1917 to enlist, and fight for their country. After basic training, they both joined The Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment on 20 July, just before the Battle of Passchendaele. That battle began on 31 July 1917, and is one of the most-remembered battles of World War One. An estimated 320,000 men were killed and wounded on the Allied side, and the conditions were nightmarish. Some parts of the muddy battlefield were so deep that men drowned. Fred, 23, got married five days before signing up. We don't know if Charles, 22, was there, or if he was Fred's best man, but it seems possible. What we do know is that these two young friends, who worked, played sport and went to war together, died together at Passchendaele on 12 October, and that their bodies have never been found. There are no photographs of them, but their names are engraved on the Tyne Cot Memorial in Belgium. Sally Mullins used the Brimington war memorial plaque as the foundation of her research We only know all this today because of Sally and Stuart Mullins, a couple from Brimington who have spent years bringing to life those men who sacrificed theirs. ""Stuart had an uncle who died in World War One, and another in World War Two,"" says Sally. ""In 1998 I got hold of an aged computer and started tinkering around on the internet, looking for information on his relatives. Then I just began looking into soldiers from Brimington."" Sally, 64, says she and Stuart, 70, have worked as a team on their relentless research. Stuart describes his wife as ""research"", and himself as ""logistics"". Brimington's memorial is on ornamental gates - the land behind was once a sports field Sally's starting point was the village's war memorial, containing 120 names. She says the number of those killed is actually higher, but for various reasons some were not included on the memorial. Many more men were left maimed by the fighting. Using the plaque's names as a base, Sally traced the soldiers's histories, using military records online. Her task was not made easier by some vague names, such as F Brown. And to complicate matters, some names were misspelled. Charles's surname of ""Hurst"", for example, is recorded as ""Hirst"". She also spent hours at Chesterfield library, squinting at microfiche replicas of local newspapers, booking the one computer attached to a printer and ""spending a fortune"" on printing out military records, and newspaper pages containing notices of a soldier's death on a battlefield. The Mullins also bought, at some cost, the entire 1901 census. Tyne Cot in Belgium is one of the places overseas where Brimington's men are commemorated At least 800 of Brimington's young men went to fight in World War One, and among the many stories Sally has unearthed is one involving four brothers from the village. Private George Bradshaw, 27, joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1915 and saw action in the Balkans and France before his battalion was moved to the Ypres area in 1917. He was awarded the Military Medal for bravery on 16 August 1917 but was killed at Passchendaele on 19 October, leaving behind a wife and young son. He is buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery in Belgium, but his headstone only became engraved with ""MM"", to mark his medal, after the Mullins spotted that it was missing and reported it. George's brother John was shot in the ankle in 1915 and died in the Battle of Arras in April 1917, while another sibling, Thomas, died in Belgium in October 1914. Just one brother, Len, who served in India and France with the Yorks and Lancs regiment, survived the war. There is no record of the boys' mother in the local archives, or of how she coped with such a terrible loss to her family. Queen Street remains largely unchanged since 1917 and is where Charles Hurst lived An honorary mention must be given to one of Brimington's residents, Fred Greaves, who won a Victoria Cross for his bravery at Passchendaele. Although born elsewhere in Derbyshire, he loved living in the village and remained there after the war until his death in 1973. What's also come to light is how the young men of the village at the start of the 20th Century, who worked in mines and did back-breaking factory work, were clearly as fit as a fiddle. ""Our local schoolboys' football trophy was the Clayton Challenge Shield - it was the prestigious competition of that era,"" says Sally. ""By 1913 Brimington boys had won the shield four times in eight years. ""Unfortunately by the summer of 1917 and Passchendaele, at least seven players of the old Brimington teams were already dead, killed in action in earlier arenas of the Great War."" Years later, armed with an updated computer, Sally has now painstakingly pieced together enough information torun a Brimington history website,externaland self-publish a memorial book of all the village men lost to the war. She coos and rubs her palm lovingly over the page of one soldier as she talks about him. Since August 2014 she has been printing out a list of the soldiers who died in the corresponding month 100 years ago, during World War One. This goes on display on an altar at one of Brimington's churches, where it is read out by the rector at the start of each month. The list of fallen soldiers is displayed in St Michael and All Angels Church in Brimington Not only have the Mullins made a huge effort to remember Brimington's boys on paper, they have travelled extensively around Belgium and northern France to find their graves. Sally and Stuart, who are attending the 100-year commemorations being held at Passchendaele, have been making about four visits a year to the region. They started in 2004, driving themselves around with maps and their own, Brimington-inspired itinerary. Once, they covered a 1,000-square-mile area in a week. They seek out the well-known cemeteries containing thousands of soldiers, as well as tiny plots with a few dozen bodies laid to rest, ones not usually found on battlefield tours. It's in all these places that they find the men from their village. Stuart says upon reaching the grave of any of ""our lads"", the couple feel ""heartbreak"" and sometimes become tearful. He also says they follow the same ritual each time. Stuart reaches out his hand to demonstrate and speaks with a Derbyshire accent, warm and comforting. ""We always pat the headstone and say 'We're here, lad. We're here.'"" WW1 'melting' mud sculpture unveiled.

Race to host EU agencies after London exit,"The agencies are currently based in London's Canary Wharf EU countries have until midnight to submit bids to provide a new home for two agencies that will be relocated from the UK after Brexit. The European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), based in Canary Wharf in London, employ just over 1,000 staff between them. The banking and medicines agencies are seen as the first spoils of Brexit by the 27 remaining members of the EU. About 20 countries are expected to enter the bidding process. There will be fierce competition to attract the agencies' highly skilled employees, their families and the business that comes with them. This includes about 40,000 hotel stays for visitors each year. Countries have printed glossy brochures, posted promotional videos online and hired lobbying firms. Frankfurt - location of the European Central Bank and a major financial centre - is seen as favourite to get the EBA. But Paris is also keen to win that contest. And the Irish government is marketing Dublin as a location,with a brochure,externalthat highlights the city's business culture as well as ""beaches and mountains on its doorstep"". The Wicklow Mountains near Dublin: Part of the Irish package in the bidding The contest has pitched larger countries against smaller ones from across the EU. Each country can bid to host one or both agencies. But it can only make one bid per agency. The European Commission will assess the entries based on the quality of office space, job opportunities for spouses, good ""European-oriented"" schooling and transport links. Accessibility and efficient infrastructure are the top two agreed criteria. Amid the rivalry to host the EMA, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark have hosted events in Brussels to promote their bids, thePolitico news website reports.,externalThe number of states vying for the EMA is reckoned to be 21.

Fifth of MPs still employ family member,"One in five MPs continue to employ a member of their family using taxpayers' money despite the practice being banned for new members of Parliament. Of the 589 returning MPs, 122 have declared the employment of a relative in thelatest Register of Members' Financial Interests.,external None of the 61 new MPs who secured their seats at the general election on 8 June are allowed to do so. Campaigners say there needs to be a clear end date for all MPs. Announcing the ban in March, the parliamentary watchdog, Ipsa, said employing family members was ""out of step"" with modern employment practices, and would not be permitted for new MPs in the next Parliament. It was brought in sooner than expected when Prime Minister Theresa May announced a snap general election.  However, MPs who served in the previous Parliament were allowed to continue their existing employment arrangements with relatives. Alexandra Runswick, the director of Unlock Democracy, which campaigns for voting reform, said: ""The ban on new MPs employing family members reflects the public's concerns about nepotism and the potential abuse of public money. ""A transitional period is reasonable, particularly as the snap election means that these rules have come into force three years earlier than expected. ""However, there does need to be a clear end date.  If MPs employing family members is wrong in principle then when the MP was first elected is irrelevant. While it is reasonable the current employees have some protection, it is important that we move to a situation where the rules apply equally to all MPs."" Allow Twitter content?

There was anger among MPs at the introduction in 2010 of a limit of one family member of staff in the wake of the expenses scandal. Many argued that spouses were best able to handle the unpredictable work patterns, long hours and need for absolute trust associated with being an MP's secretary or assistant. Ipsa said the crackdown was not due to any abuse of the rules or inappropriate claims, but that the need for transparency and good employment practice outweighed the benefits MPs found in hiring relatives. Darren Hughes, the acting chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said it was fair to phase out the practice. ""Given the high rate of turnover of both MPs and staff, it is clear that within the next few electoral cycles it will apply to the vast majority of Parliamentary staff. ""Voters must be able to have confidence that our democracy is resourced in an open and transparent way, so it's welcome that Parliamentary authorities have taken steps to reform the system.""

Lights in the dark in memory of soldiers of Passchendaele,"Stories from the battle were projected onto the outside of Cloth Hall on Sunday evening The lonely, eerie sound of a bugle is one that locals in Ypres, Belgium, are well used to. But for the thousands of Britons gathered around the imposing white stone memorial of Menin Gate, it may be the first time they have heard a melody that has sounded at that spot almost every night for 90 years. The Last Post is played each evening by Belgian buglers - volunteers who play the call to remember British and Commonwealth soldiers who defended their town. But Sunday night was different. William and Kate remember WW1 battle 'I was named after a World War One battle' Passchendaele's untold army of women nurses Standing under the vast stone arch were British and Belgian royals, the UK prime minister, members of the armed forces and faith leaders, many carrying flowers and wreaths of red poppies. They had gathered for a special service to mark a century since the start of the Battle of Passchendaele. And lining the road leading to the gate were thousands more - many with a personal connection to the battle. The prime minister stands alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the King and Queen of Belgium, under Menin Gate Robert Lloyd-Rees, 75, has been camped outside a coffee shop by the gate since Sunday morning. ""What this town does, to commemorate those soldiers, is remarkable,"" he says. It is 60 years since Robert has heard the Last Post, he says, having first visited Ypres with his father Tom, who served at Passchendaele in the Welsh Regiment's Machine Gun Corps. Robert, who comes from Bristol and now lives in Ottawa, Canada, says the trip has been ""tearful"". Robert Lloyd-Rees' father served at Passchendaele Earlier that day, he had visited Tyne Cot, a large war cemetery a few miles from Ypres, which he first walked around with his father. ""I remember him stopping at two gravestones and I had asked, 'Dad, what is it?' and he said 'These are my friends'. ""He told me that he had spent two days and two nights behind his machine gun, while two of his comrades lay dead on the sandbags,"" Robert says. He does not know how his father, who was just 17 when he signed up in 1914 and had lied about his age, could ""withstand such horror"", but recalls that he rarely spoke of his wartime experiences. Headstones to unknown soldiers lay in rows in Tyne Cot cemetery Menin Gate may be on foreign soil but bears the names of more than 54,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who fought at Passchendaele, and whose graves are not known. Father and son Phil and Luke Seeley were also outside the gate, to remember their relative - Sgt Herbert Seeley. Herbert was injured and sent back to the frontline four times during the war - eventually being sent to Passchendaele in 1917 - but miraculously survived the war. WW1 'melting' mud sculpture unveiled WW1 missing Ypres bells on show ""My dad says he remembers him sitting in the corner of the room and he would not say anything,"" says Phil. ""He was bayoneted and sent home to recover, but each time went back knowing what it would be like."" ""I've got goosebumps,"" Phil adds, who says Herbert, from Colchester in Essex, began the war as a private and was by 1918 promoted to a warrant officer. ""We're here to find out more about what it must have been like."" Phil Seeley and his son and Luke travelled to Ypres to find out more about his father Herbert, who fought at Passchendaele For three months from 31 July 1917, the battle for a number of ridges south and east of the Belgian town of Ypres resulted in massive loss on both sides, with nearly half a million soldiers thought to be killed, wounded or missing. Phil and 16-year-old Luke travelled from Colchester through the night to reach Ypres. ""We arrived at around three in the morning, and had to wait outside our campsite for five hours,"" says Phil. ""We were so tired and hungry and barely able to move, and thought what must it have been like feeling like this and living in total fear for three months."" There was near silence among the crowd as the bugles began playing at 20:00 (19:00 BST). After readings and more music, poppies were released from the arch of the gate to mark the climax of the ceremony. Paper poppies fell to represent the soldiers named on Menin Gate A short walk away from the gate was Ypres' medieval Cloth Hall, which was rebuilt from ruins after the war. For this occasion it was illuminated, and was the focus of much of the sense of excitement in the city, as well as quiet contemplation . The events continue on Monday, where a commemoration service is expected to strike a more sombre tone. At Tyne Cot cemetery - the site of 11,000 graves and a memorial to more than 35,000 missing soldiers - royals and relatives will attend an afternoon of song and remembrance. Tyne Cot's rows of immaculately maintained, white graves are a reminder of the battle's death toll. One hundred years on, Passchendaele is still synonymous with the blood and horror of the First World War. ""It's ensuring that we don't forget,"" says Robert, who has a firm plan to ensure that younger relatives know all about and can take pride in what one member of the Lloyd-Rees family did at Passchendale 100 years ago. He says: ""I'll be showing my grandson my father's medals.""

Will you even need a driving licence in the future?,"A Google self-driving car being tested in California Driverless vehicles may seem unfamiliar now, but over the coming years you'll start to encounter - or even use them - on a daily basis. Will it mean the end of the driving licence and changes to the rules of the road? It's not uncommon to see a squat white droidtrundling along the streets of Greenwich, south-east London, as it delivers takeaway food to the borough's residents at 4mph. In Paris andHelsinki, robot buses,externalare shuttling passengers along city streets, while in Colorado an18-wheeler truck drove beer 120 miles,externaldown a highway - without a driver. Around the world, projects like these are under way to help develop the technology that will ultimately bring driverless cars and other vehicles to our roads. A self-driving delivery robot being tested in Greenwich, London But alongside the issue of whether they will work is another big question: how will pedestrians, cyclists and human drivers be kept safe? Sales of self-driving vehicles are currently in the thousands, but some estimates suggest thatthey could reach 10m worldwide by 2030.,external But that's just a tiny fraction of the more than one billion cars already on the road. So, the challenge is figuring out how to accommodate both humans and driverless vehicles on roads, pavements and bike paths. A driverless Nissan Leaf being tested in London We've got several years, even decades, to get this right and self-driving vehicles that can operate without any human input at all are not on the immediate horizon. Engineers are still working out how to handle some of the most difficult challenges.

This type of reasoningstretches the abilities of machines,external. Other challenges include weather conditions that disrupt sensors. And driverless vehicles will need to learn when to disobey traffic rules - for example, when an emergency vehicle needs everyone to move out of the way.

It would take hundreds of years of road tests, over hundreds of billions of miles, to prove beyond doubt that driverless vehicles will cause fewer fatalities than human drivers,experts at think tank the Rand Corporation have argued.,external Instead, we may have to allow driverless vehicles in some circumstances, while they continue to learn. So far, there is no international safety standard for driverless vehicles - each country is responsible for writing its own rules. There are also questions about whether rules for driverless vehicles should be national - making it easier for companies to comply, or on a more local level - so that cities can tailor them to their residents' needs. This variety could speed up the process of learning about what works and what doesn't. Finding an agreement is difficult. People may give up their own cars, using on demand vehicles instead Fewer vehicles on the road could free up land for more parks and housing Using driverless cars for everything could increase congestion and pollution On demand vehicles could improve transport for those on low incomes Cities may lose revenue from fines as robot vehicles obey the rules of the road People now working as drivers may need help finding new jobs Another issue without a clear answer is around the ethics that driverless vehicles should adopt. Put simply, in the case of an unavoidable accident, should a fully autonomous vehicle be programmed to career off the road, risking the lives of the four people inside, or continue into a parent and child crossing the road? Because human drivers make split second, instinctual decisions, we can't look to human behaviour to come up with the right answer. The shift from cars doing all the driving in predictable, stable conditions with humans as back-up, to a time when they make all the decisions will be gradual. Until cars are fully automated and don't need human input, manufacturers won't be able to dispense with steering and braking controls. People will still need driving licences and they'll have to ready to take control at short notice - so challenges like distraction and drunkenness will remain. It's likely we will always need seat belts: autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically reduce crashes, but no technology is perfect. The peril of driverless vehicles is that we will repeat the mistakes we've made over the last century - like rushing to build new roads that destroy neighbourhoods and creating out of town shopping centres that only cater to drivers. But if we learn from our mistakes we could reduce congestion, pollution, and inequality. When it comes to the self-driving vehicles, people will still have to be in the driver's seat.

NHS to boost mental health staff numbers,"Thousands more mental health workers are to be recruited by the NHS in England, the health secretary has said. Jeremy Hunt said it was time to end the ""historic imbalance"" between mental and physical health services. The aim is to recruit enough nurses, therapists and consultants to treat an extra one million patients by 2020-21. But the Royal College of Nursing said the plans did not add up, and more ""hard cash"" would be needed if the new staff were to be trained in time. The government said an extra Â£1bn already promised for mental health services in England would fund the scheme - part of a pot of Â£1.3bn committed in 2016 to transform provision. These plans set out how some of that money will be spent - mostly on recruiting staff, with the main focus being on child and adolescent mental health services, therapists delivering talking therapies for adults and nurses working in crisis care. The plans also include improving staff training, encouraging those who have left the profession to return, and addressing a high dropout rate among trainees. The plans include: 2,000 more nurses, consultants and therapist posts in child and adolescent mental health services 2,900 additional therapists and health professionals supporting adult talking therapies 4,800 additional posts for nurses and therapists working in crisis care settings more mental health support for women around the time they give birth and early intervention teams working with people at risk of psychosis This video can not be played Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt tells Today his mental health targets will be ""challenging to meet"" But data published last week showed that even before this latest recruitment drive, many thousands of nursing posts remain unfilled. Mr Hunt said: ""We want people with mental health conditions to receive better treatment, and part of that means having the right NHS staff. ""We know we need to do much more to attract, retain and support the mental health workforce of the future - today is the first step to address this historic imbalance in workforce planning."" Mr Hunt said the measures were ""ambitious"" and amounted to ""one of the biggest expansions of mental health services in Europe"". However, Labour's shadow minister for mental health, Barbara Keeley, said the government was ""promising only jam tomorrow, when what is needed is action today"". ""The workforce plan provides no real answers on how these new posts will be funded or how recruitment issues will be overcome,"" she added. ""And it offers little hope to those working in the sector faced with mounting workloads, low pay and poor morale."" Claire Murdoch, national mental health director at NHS England, said the plan was not just about numbers. ""It's about having a motivated and skilled workforce in place to deliver the work we need to do."" Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said 570 extra consultants had been promised in the plans. ""You would expect to see a consultant if you had cancer and the same applies for mental health. ""The biggest challenge to creating robust mental health services is the workforce. I am very supportive of this strategy which starts to tackle that problem."" But Janet Davies, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""There is already a dangerous lack of workforce planning and accountability and this report is unable to provide detail on how the ambitions will be met. ""It is clear the government will need to work hard just to get back to the number of specialist staff working in mental health services in 2010. ""Under this government, there are 5,000 fewer mental health nurses and that goes some way to explaining why patients are being failed.""

Venezuela turnout '41.5%' after violent vote,"Government officials celebrated the results but the opposition has cried foul Electoral officials in Venezuela say turnout in the controversial election for a constituent assembly was 41.5%, a figure disputed by the opposition. The opposition coalition said 88% of voters abstained and it refused to recognise the election. It also called for more protests on Monday. Sunday's election was marred by violence, with widespread protests and at least 10 people killed. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro hailed the poll as a ""vote for the revolution"". President Maduro hailed the vote as a victory President Maduro spoke at length on television after the results came out. It was a victory speech for him and his followers but after a day of violence on the streets it's a pretty hollow victory - if you can even call it that. For all the talk of the vote being an example of democracy, critics accuse him of voter fraud and intimidation and many don't believe the official numbers of voter turnout. This vote highlights just how polarised the country is with a president who ploughs on regardless of the millions of people who object to it. The anger was palpable on the streets of Caracas on Sunday with crowds of people defying a protest ban and building barricades, awaiting confrontations with police. It's a scene we've seen for several months now and one that, given the way this vote has gone, we will no doubt see more of. This video can not be played Clashes and demonstrations took place in the capital Caracas on Sunday Venezuelans were asked to choose the more than 500 representatives who will make up a constituent assembly. The constituent assembly was convened by President Maduro to rewrite the existing constitution, which was drafted and passed in 1999 when his mentor, President Hugo ChÃ¡vez, was in office. Electoral council head Tibisay Lucena said the turnout had been ""extraordinary"" The head of the National Electoral Council (CNE), Tibisay Lucena, on Monday announced that there had been an ""extraordinary turnout"" of more than eight million voters. She also announced that the wife of President Maduro, Cilia Flores, was among those elected as representatives, as well as the president's close allies Diosdado Cabello, Iris Varela and Delcy RodrÃ­guez. The announcement was met with outrage and derision by the opposition, who boycotted the vote. Opposition politician Henry Ramos Allup said their figures suggested fewer than 2.5 million Venezuelans had turned out to vote. How many people turned out was key for both the government and the opposition With the opposition boycotting the election from the start and not fielding any candidates, it was always less about who would be elected and more about how many Venezuelans would take part in the voting. The opposition held an unofficial referendum two weeks before the election asking Venezuelans whether they wanted a constituent assembly at all. According to opposition figures, more than seven million Venezuelans rejected the constituent assembly in that vote. The opposition urged Venezuelans to stay at home and even some Chavistas (supporters of the socialist movement created by President Hugo ChÃ¡vez and of which Mr Maduro is a part) said they objected to the constituent assembly and would not vote. There were widespread reports of public sector workers being told by their bosses to go and vote or face being sacked. How many people turned out was therefore seen as a key indicator of support for the government. The opposition claims that the figures are unverifiable because a number of procedures which have been in place at previous elections were not followed. For example, voters' little fingers were not marked with indelible ink to prevent them from trying to vote multiple times. There were also no independent observers. However, National Electoral Council head Tibisay Lucena said voting had proceeded ""normally"" and that violent outbreaks at a small number of polling stations had been controlled. Protests were held by Venezuelans living abroad as well as those in Venezuela President Maduro convened the constituent assembly on 1 May amid fierce anti-government protests. He argued the constituent assembly would promote ""reconciliation and peace"", however he did not give details of exactly how rewriting the constitution would achieve such broad aims. Government critics fear that President Maduro wants to use the constituent assembly to maximise his power and cling on to it for longer. As the constituent assembly will be drawing up a new constitution it has the potential to fundamentally change how Venezuela is run. The last time a constituent assembly met in 1999, the legislature was suspended while the constitution was debated. More protests are expected on Monday The opposition has called for fresh protests on Monday. On Sunday, at least 10 people were killed in protests across the country, prompting opposition leader Henrique Capriles to speak of a ""massacre"". Despite a government ban on protests and the threat of jail terms of up to 10 years for anyone disrupting the electoral process, streets were barricaded and a number of polling stations attacked ahead of the vote. Tensions are likely to increase further on Monday and ahead of the swearing-in of the constituent assembly members on Wednesday. OAS head Luis Almagro has been a fierce critic of the Venezuelan government Venezuela is facing mounting international criticism over the new assembly. On Sunday the US said it was considering fresh sanctions targeting the oil industry there. It has already imposed sanctions on 13 members of Mr Maduro's government. The US State Department said it would take swift action against what it called the ""architects of authoritarianism"". US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, dismissed the vote as a ""sham election"" and a ""step towards dictatorship"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"'No value' in UN's N Korea meeting, says US","This video can not be played The US B-1 bombers were joined by South Korean and Japanese planes The US says it will not call for a UN Security Council meeting over North Korea's missile tests because it would produce ""nothing of consequence"". Such a meeting would send a message to North Korea that the international community was unwilling to challenge it, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said. Pyongyang said its tests proved that the entire US was within range. The US has responded by testing an anti-missile system and flying bombers over the Korean peninsula. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump and they agreed on the need for further action on North Korea given its most recent missile test on Friday. The two did not discuss any use of military action. Ms Haleysaid in a statement,externalthat North Korea was already subject to numerous Security Council resolutions that they ""flout with impunity"". Ms Haley said a security council meeting would produce ""nothing of consequence"" ""An additional Security Council resolution that does not significantly increase the international pressure on North Korea is of no value,"" she said. ""In fact it is worse than nothing because it sends the message to the North Korean dictator that the international community is unwilling to seriously challenge him.""

Despite fierce objections from China, the US military recently began installing missile defences - the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system - in South Korea, with the aim of shooting down any North Korean missiles fired in conflict.

Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he was ""very disappointed"" with China, adding that he would not allow it to ""do nothing"" about the isolated state.

Lights in the dark to remember soldiers of Passchendaele,"Stories from the battle were projected onto the outside of Cloth Hall on Sunday evening The lonely, eerie sound of a bugle is one that locals in Ypres, Belgium, are well used to. But for the thousands of Britons gathered around the imposing white stone memorial of Menin Gate, it may be the first time they have heard a melody that has sounded at that spot almost every night for 90 years. The Last Post is played each evening by Belgian buglers - volunteers who play the call to remember British and Commonwealth soldiers who defended their town. But Sunday night was different. William and Kate remember WW1 battle 'I was named after a World War One battle' Passchendaele's untold army of women nurses Standing under the vast stone arch were British and Belgian royals, the UK prime minister, members of the armed forces and faith leaders, many carrying flowers and wreaths of red poppies. They had gathered for a special service to mark a century since the start of the Battle of Passchendaele. And lining the road leading to the gate were thousands more - many with a personal connection to the battle. The prime minister stands alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the King and Queen of Belgium, under Menin Gate Robert Lloyd-Rees, 75, has been camped outside a coffee shop by the gate since Sunday morning. ""What this town does, to commemorate those soldiers, is remarkable,"" he says. It is 60 years since Robert has heard the Last Post, he says, having first visited Ypres with his father Tom, who served at Passchendaele in the Welsh Regiment's Machine Gun Corps. Robert, who comes from Bristol and now lives in Ottawa, Canada, says the trip has been ""tearful"". Robert Lloyd-Rees' father served at Passchendaele Earlier that day, he had visited Tyne Cot, a large war cemetery a few miles from Ypres, which he first walked around with his father. ""I remember him stopping at two gravestones and I had asked, 'Dad, what is it?' and he said 'These are my friends'. ""He told me that he had spent two days and two nights behind his machine gun, while two of his comrades lay dead on the sandbags,"" Robert says. He does not know how his father, who was just 17 when he signed up in 1914 and had lied about his age, could ""withstand such horror"", but recalls that he rarely spoke of his wartime experiences. Headstones to unknown soldiers lay in rows in Tyne Cot cemetery Menin Gate may be on foreign soil but bears the names of more than 54,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who fought at Passchendaele, and whose graves are not known. Father and son Phil and Luke Seeley were also outside the gate, to remember their relative - Sgt Herbert Seeley. Herbert was injured and sent back to the frontline four times during the war - eventually being sent to Passchendaele in 1917 - but miraculously survived the war. WW1 'melting' mud sculpture unveiled WW1 missing Ypres bells on show ""My dad says he remembers him sitting in the corner of the room and he would not say anything,"" says Phil. ""He was bayoneted and sent home to recover, but each time went back knowing what it would be like."" ""I've got goosebumps,"" Phil adds, who says Herbert, from Colchester in Essex, began the war as a private and was by 1918 promoted to a warrant officer. ""We're here to find out more about what it must have been like."" Phil Seeley and his son and Luke travelled to Ypres to find out more about his father Herbert, who fought at Passchendaele For three months from 31 July 1917, the battle for a number of ridges south and east of the Belgian town of Ypres resulted in massive loss on both sides, with nearly half a million soldiers thought to be killed, wounded or missing. Phil and 16-year-old Luke travelled from Colchester through the night to reach Ypres. ""We arrived at around three in the morning, and had to wait outside our campsite for five hours,"" says Phil. ""We were so tired and hungry and barely able to move, and thought what must it have been like feeling like this and living in total fear for three months."" There was near silence among the crowd as the bugles began playing at 20:00 (19:00 BST). After readings and more music, poppies were released from the arch of the gate to mark the climax of the ceremony. Paper poppies fell to represent the soldiers named on Menin Gate A short walk away from the gate was Ypres' medieval Cloth Hall, which was rebuilt from ruins after the war. For this occasion it was illuminated, and was the focus of much of the sense of excitement in the city, as well as quiet contemplation . The events continue on Monday, where a commemoration service is expected to strike a more sombre tone. At Tyne Cot cemetery - the site of 11,000 graves and a memorial to more than 35,000 missing soldiers - royals and relatives will attend an afternoon of song and remembrance. Tyne Cot's rows of immaculately maintained, white graves are a reminder of the battle's death toll. One hundred years on, Passchendaele is still synonymous with the blood and horror of the First World War. ""It's ensuring that we don't forget,"" says Robert, who has a firm plan to ensure that younger relatives know all about and can take pride in what one member of the Lloyd-Rees family did at Passchendale 100 years ago. He says: ""I'll be showing my grandson my father's medals.""

How does Orkney copes with invasion - by cruise ships?,"The number of cruise ship passengers stopping off in Orkney has increased massively in recent years but the tourist invasion has not all been plain sailing. This year, 140 cruise liners will berth at Hatston pier, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, the biggest town on Orkney's mainland. More than 130,000 tourists are expected during the season - between the start of April and the end of September - six times the population of the entire Orkney archipelago, which lies about 10 miles off Scotland's northern tip. In 2011, the number of cruise line visits for the year was just 36,000. Hatston terminal, where the liners dock, is just a short distance from the centre of Kirkwall The ships bringing tourists to Orkney range in size from a couple of hundred passengers to the huge MSC Preziosa, the biggest ship to have ever berthed there. It arrived on 10 May with a capacity of 4,345 passengers and 1,400 crew, more than half the size of Kirkwall's population. Jimmy Poke, who operates the shuttle bus service that takes passengers into the town, tells theBBC Scotland documentary Orkney: When The Boat Comes Inthat the increase in cruise ships has been a ""very positive thing"" for his business. He says: ""When we started we had one bus and now we have 23. It is not the only thing that keeps us in business but it's a huge factor in the summer time."" Shuttle bus operator Jimmy Poke says the cruise ships have been a positive thing However, Jimmy admits that there is some ""negativity"" on the island, with shopkeepers saying they sometimes struggle to cope with the large influxes of people and complaining that many of the tourists are not big spenders. Jimmy says: ""I still think that if I wasn't involved in the industry I would be happy to see people here because I like the hustle and bustle of it all."" By 10:00 on the morning of the MSC Preziosa's arrival, 460 passengers have already been shuttled into town. Judith Glue says the liner business helps her to survive the winters when the town is ""very quiet"" Judith Glue's shop on the high street, selling knitwear, gifts and jewellery, is doing good business. She says: ""I opened the shop when I was very young and I've seen lots of changes throughout the years particularly with the increase in the liner traffic. ""I think it has given us such a boost in the summer time to have all these people coming here. ""There is no way our town centre would look as good as it does if we did not have those cruise ships."" The MSC Preziosa is the biggest liner to berth in Kirkwall She says that the town is ""absolutely dead"" in January, February and March. ""There are no tourists here, it is as quiet as anything,"" Judith says. ""In order to survive the winter we do need these cruise ships."" By lunchtime, Jimmy is already shuttling passengers from the town to get back onboard the ship. He says: ""Sometimes people get annoyed because the food is all-inclusive on the ship so people go back at lunchtime and the cafes and restaurants in the town say they don't make a lot."" Lorraine Pilkington-Tait says the food industry does not do very well out of the liner tourists At Lolz, owner Lorraine Pilkington-Tait says she feels that the food industry does not do very well out of the liner passengers. She surveys her crowded cafe and says: ""Everybody is having teas and coffees. Nobody is eating any food. ""We get people coming in and having a cup of coffee, sitting on the wifi, they can stay hours. ""You can't exactly ask them to move on."" Lorraine also voices the opinion that the number of people visiting the island has spoiled some of its undiscovered magic. She says: ""Some friends of mine who used to come to Orkney feel these cruise liners are changing everything, it's spoiling it."" Recent research suggested that local business-owners were fairly positive about the impact of the liners and their passengers but much depended on which cruise ship was visiting. High-spending passengers such as those who arrived on the recent Disney Magic cruise were seen to have the most positive benefit. Steven Cooper says jewellery is ideally suited for cruise ship passengers Jeweller Steven Cooper, owner of Aurora, says: ""The jewellery side can be really good if you get people coming in and they want to buy a gold ring. ""I've had people buying a gold ring or a diamond for Â£1,000 but it tends to be more silver because they are generally buying it as gifts. ""Actually last year I had a passenger off a cruise ship who bought a gold bangle for Â£2,500. It's great when they do."" Steven adds: ""Jewellery is ideally suited for cruise ship passengers because it is a small item which is not taking space up in their luggage. ""Over and above that they really like textiles, tartan products etc. That's quite a big part of the business."" Kayleigh Archibald, from the Clan Cancer Support charity shop, says the crew from the liners often shop there One shop that does good business from the cruise liners but does not attract big spenders is the Clan Cancer Support charity shop. Kayleigh Archibald says the crew from the liners seem to buy a lot of bedding and handbags. She says most of the crew are from South Asia. ""They do a lot of shopping to take back to their families,"" Kayleigh says. ""The reason they come into charity shops is because it is a bit cheaper. Today they were buying bodywarmers because they were finding it a bit cold."" Orkney: When the Boat Comes In is on BBC One at 19:30 on Monday 31 July.

How Welsh was legendary King Arthur?,"Previous best guesses for the home of Camelot include Winchester, Monmouthshire, and Somerset Who was King Arthur and how Welsh was he? These are two of the questions up for debate at a new exhibition at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. From ancient Brythonic warlord to mythical chivalric king with a court anywhere from Wales to Glastonbury or as far north as Scotland - it is hard to separate myth, legend and fact. According to curator Dr Maredudd ap Huw, these unknowns lie at the heart of King Arthur's enduring appeal. ""The beauty of Arthur is that he was - indeed, according to some 'is' - whoever you want him to be,"" said Dr ap Huw. ""There is some early evidence to suggest that there was an Arthur in the 4th or 5th Centuries. ""Though in all likelihood he was very far removed from the romantic depictions of (writers) Thomas Malory and Alfred, Lord Tennyson."" However, just how Welsh he would have been is a ""moot point"", Dr ap Huw added. Before the Saxons drove the Brythonic people (Celtic Britons) west and north, there was no recognised entity of an independent Wales, making his nationality hard to ascertain. The exhibition brings together all the crucial texts which have informed our perception of Arthur for more than a millennium. The Book of Aneirin forms part of the exhibition One of the exhibits is the 13th Century Book of Aneirin, which includes a 6th Century poem describing a battle near what is now Catterick in North Yorkshire. Dr ap Huw said one reference in it is extremely telling. A young Brythonic hero called Gwawrddur is described as fighting valiantly against the Saxons ""although he was no Arthur"". ""It is possible to infer (from this) that the legend of Arthur as a fearsome warlord was already well-established by the 6th Century,"" Dr ap Huw added. But the man who drew all the threads together and introduced Arthur's wife Guinevere, his sword Excalibur and the Knights of the Round Table was Geoffrey of Monmouth. Dr ap Huw describes the 12th Century writer as ""the most influential author in the history of Wales"". ""Forget Dylan Thomas, what Geoffrey wrote had a far more profound impact on world thinking and the perception of Arthur as a Welsh hero,"" he said. ""Writing in Latin, his ideas rapidly spread throughout Europe, and via Chretien De Troyes, fed into the French-Norman ideals of chivalric kingship. ""Geoffrey claimed as his source an ancient Welsh manuscript which was then lost, never to be found.  Read into that what you will, but what is certainly true to say is that it is still essentially Geoffrey's version of King Arthur which we are taught as children, right up to the present day."" Arthur's castle Camelot and other characters such as the wizard Merlin are then referenced in the 13th Century Black Book of Carmarthen. There he is described as ""a war veteran who has lost his wits in battle in Scotland, and has developed the gift of being able to talk to animals"". But it was not until the 15th and 16th Century that ""Arthur Mania"" reached its heights after William Caxton published Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. While Geoffrey of Monmouth set Camelot in the former Roman stronghold of Caerleon, near Newport, Malory anchored it as a thoroughly English tale. So much so that King Henry VII named his eldest son Arthur in honour of the legend. By 1534, Polydore Vergil's Anglica Historia had debunked much of Geoffrey of Monmouth's work, and cast doubt on the very existence of a historical Arthur at all. ""Virgil's account wasn't wholly accepted. John Prise - a lawyer for Thomas Cromwell - published a rebuttal in defence of Arthur, but by then the historiographic interest in Arthur was already fatally damaged. ""That's not to say we'd forgotten about him altogether. Edmund Spencer's Faerie Queene drew heavily on Arthurian tradition and, when it was presented to Queen Elizabeth I in 1590, she was so delighted that she awarded him a pension of Â£50 a year for life,"" Dr ap Huw said. ""But by then Arthur had become a Britannia or Gloriana-type figurehead for a nation. ""The historical Arthur was deadâ¦though there are some who say he never died, and is simply waiting to wake again when his country needs him.""

Frontline women - story of Passchendaele's nurses,"Nurses like Nellie Spindler worked alongside doctors in makeshift hospitals a hair's breadth from the front line ""No words of mine can soften the blow. There is one consolation for you - your daughter became unconscious immediately after she was hit, and she passed away perfectly peacefully."" This was how Minnie Wood, a 36-year-old matron, comforted the parents of one of her young nurses, Nellie Spindler, who was killed by a shell during the First World War's Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. According to Minnie's letter, 26-year-old Nellie ""was oblivious to her surroundings"" as she died from a blast at the hospital where they worked, which was three miles from the front line. ""Shells continued to fall in for the rest of the day,"" wrote Minnie, who ran to the scene of the bomb and held Nellie in her arms as she died. The battle of Passchendaele was fought near Ypres between 31 July and 10 November 1917, in battlefields that turned to liquid mud. But women, as well as soldiers, braved the relentless rain and shell fire of the three-month battle - and efforts have recently been made to shed light on their experiences. ""I'm astounded by what the nurses did and how they kept calm despite absolute horror,"" says Capt Amelia Cummings, a military nurse from the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, the same group of nurses which served in Ypres. On Monday, she will join thousands of relatives of soldiers who fought at Passchendaele for a service at Tyne Cot Cemetery near Ypres, to mark 100 years since the battle began. ""With the amount of training we do now, we're so prepared for conflict,"" says Capt Cummings, who was posted to Afghanistan in 2014, where she says nurses also had to deal with bomb attacks and ""constantly develop our practices"". She adds: ""Most Queen Alexandra's nurses were aristocratic ladies whose lives would have been incredibly sheltered before they dealt with the injuries from mechanised war."" Capt Amelia Cummings, a Queen's Alexandra nurse, says she is ""astounded"" by the work of women in her corps 100 years ago Nellie, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who was also a Queen Alexandra's nurse, was buried with military honours near where she worked at Lijssenthoek, west of Ypres. She is the only woman alongside 10,000 men buried there - but the only detail that marks the difference between her headstone and a soldier's is her rank: ""Staff Nurse"". According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission'sdatabase,external, she is one of two women buried in Belgium, compared with 122 women from World War One buried in France, where most major hospitals were based. But little is known about many of the nurses who survived the battle. Prof Christine Hallett, author ofNurses of Passchendaele, has recently pieced together many of their letters and diaries, and says ""more could be done to highlight their sacrifices"". She says: ""They were not frail things who needed protecting by the men - many soldiers could not have survived without the nurses' care."" Nurses had learnt new roles, including performing surgery, by Passchendaele An estimated 50 to 100 nurses worked across a complex of hospitals and casualty clearing stations around the battlefields of Ypres. ""It was terrifying lying in bed, expecting every minute to be blown to pieces,"" wrote one sister, Mary Tilton, whose camp was so close to German lines that they ""peppered us with bombs"". She says she tried to laugh off the danger as she ""could not control the violent trembling of my legs - my knees positively knocked together"". 'I was named after the Battle of Passchendaele' Another anonymous account of the battle reveals how Violetta Thurstan, a nurse from Ore in Sussex, ""dragged a wounded man into a shelter at great personal risk"" before assisting an operation in a makeshift hut - ""though at the time the shelling was very heavy"". By 1917, nurses were closer to the battlefield than at any point during the war - a distance of around three miles. The proximity to the front line saved lives but, after Nellie's death on 21 August 1917, the decision was made to move hospitals further back. With the campaign for women's suffrage suspended during the war, nurses saw the opportunity to improvise with what was a strictly-defined role at home. ""Don't think about the pretty nurse in the uniform with the brave soldier,"" says Dr Emily Mayhew, Imperial College London's historian-in-residence. ""By Passchendaele, the military medical system was the best it's ever been and nurses were really important to that."" Traditional tasks such bed-making and cleaning patients and wards were part of a Passchendaele nurse's job - but by 1917 the roles had transformed. They had learned the best way to treat shock using a mixture of saline, coffee and brandy - and were among the first women to work as anaesthetists and perform surgery. ""It was the most demanding job you could ask of anyone and they did it every day,"" Dr Mayhew says. A sign giving directions at a casualty clearing station near Ypres - similar to modern hospitals The ""most remarkable"" job was the way they cared for the dying, she says. If a patient had no hope, they were taken to a ward where no doctors entered. A nurse would speak to him, brush his hair, give him sips of water until he died - all the time recording everything their patient said. ""One nurse had to write 66 letters in one day to families, either warning their son was about to die or recording their final moments,"" says Dr Mayhew. ""Families would get an official telegram, but by the next post receive a letter from a lovely efficient lady with good handwriting - you can imagine how comforting that would have been.""

Capt Cummings says that, 100 years later, the Passchendaele nurses still give her corps a sense of ""immense pride"".

How president's daughter sparked breastfeeding row,"Aliya Shagieva said the row was because the female form had been hyper-sexualised A picture of the Kyrgyz president's youngest daughter feeding her baby dressed in her underwear has sparked a debate about breastfeeding and sexualisation. Aliya Shagieva posted the photo on social media back in April with the caption: 'I will feed my child whenever and wherever he needs to be fed.' She took the post down after being accused of immoral behaviour, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC she said the row was a result of a culture which hyper-sexualised the female form. ""This body I've been given is not vulgar. It is functional, its purpose is to fulfil the physiological needs of my baby, not to be sexualised,"" she told BBC Kyrgyz. This video can not be played Aliya Shagieva says her child simply needs to eat It wasn't only some social media users who disapproved. Her parents, President Almazbek Atambayev and his wife Raisa, were also unhappy. ""They really didn't like it.  And it is understandable because the younger generation is less conservative than their parents,"" Ms Shagieva said, speaking at her home on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Ms Shagieva posts actively on social media, including her own artwork and carefully stylized portraits of herself and her husband and baby, often set against the backdrop of wide open landscapes. Many of Ms Shagieva's pictures are set against the backdrop of Kyrgyz landscapes Breastfeeding is a recurring theme. ""When I'm breastfeeding my child I feel like I'm giving him the best I can give. Taking care of my baby and attending to his needs is more important to me than what people say about me,"" Ms Shagieva said. Breastfeeding at work: Women's stories Your stories: Breastfeeding toddlers Gulnara Kasmambetova, BBC Kyrgyz I interviewed Aliya Shagieva in her flat in a prestigious quarter of Bishkek which she shares with her husband and child. Her drawings and pictures were on the walls and the couple offered fruit and herbal tea.  Herbs were growing in pots on the window sills; the couple are vegetarian, a rarity in a traditionally meat-eating country. In the context of a post-Soviet traditional Muslim society, Aliya Shagieva is very bold and very different. She was quite open, sharing her experience of feeling lonely as a child of very busy parents. She spoke of the generation gap and her efforts to understand and find compromise with her parents, not least over her social media activities. ""My mum received messages from her 'friends' about me,"" she said. ""Now that I am a mother myself, I know what my mum went through raising me."" Aliya has been active supporting causes such as awareness of children with Downs syndrome and animal rights, but has no obvious political ambitions. People in Kyrgyzstan have recent memories of the two previous presidents' children getting involved in politics and business - both leaders were ousted. But the incumbent leader has pledged that his children will never meddle in politics. Aliya Shagieva is active in photography, painting and drawing Kyrgyzstan is a mainly Muslim ex-Soviet republic. It is socially conservative but breast feeding in public is acceptable. Women are seen in parks and other public spaces feeding their babies, but they usually try and cover their breasts with a piece of clothing. When Ms Shagieva's post first went online some social media users thought there was no need to post a picture of such an intimate moment; others denounced her for not being modest enough. And her breastfeeding photos attracted attention well beyond Kyrgyzstan - they were republished by newspapers and websites as far away as Europe. Many took to social media to praise her for breaking taboos surrounding women's bodies. The question of breastfeeding in public is a matter of debate in many countries, including the UK where only three years ago a woman was asked to cover up in the restaurant of London's famous Claridges Hotel while feeding her baby, causing an outcry. Claridge's breastfeeding row: Protest by mothers Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament Former Senator Larissa Waters made history when she breastfed in Australia's parliament in May When different BBC language services ran the interview with Aliya Shagieva, the resulting online conversation threw a light on different breastfeeding cultures and practices in Muslim countries. Women writing from Iran shared their experiences about the stress they feel when breastfeeding in public: ""People zoom in on me, I have to either cover myself and the baby or just leave him hungry,"" one Tehran mother wrote. Others praised the recently installed mother and baby rooms in Tehran's Metro. An employee of the Tehran metro sent pictures of mother and baby facilities at stations An Afghan woman from Kabul, Zarifa Ghafari, shared a story from her own extended family, saying mothers had to go into a separate room to breastfeed: ""She can't do this in front of others. If she did she would face strong reactions from the elder members of the family. It is a big issue but slowly, slowly the culture is changing."" Another Afghan woman, Nageen related a shopping trip with her sister in law. ""We had to buy some gifts just so she could feed her baby in a shop. She sat there and covered herself with a big scarf."" A Turkish Facebook user said, she herself preferred covering up while feeding her baby. ""I don't rub it in people's faces. I use a cover. There are many who still sexualize breasts."" Victoria Tahmasebi, a women and gender studies expert at Toronto university tweeted: ""From a capitalist view point women's breasts can create profit as long as they are sexualised. Breastfeeding in public makes women's breasts less sexy, therefore it is not acceptable."" As for Aliya Shagieva's picture which caused a stir - she finally took it down because her parents were worried that the attention ""could be harmful to her young family"". But it hasn't stopped her speaking out, and it hasn't stopped the debate.

Could Putin prove to be Trump's fatal attraction?,"There was a time when to work out what was happening in Moscow you needed to read between the lines in Pravda, or look at the line-up of Soviet officials at a Red Square parade and study who was standing next to whom. The art of Kremlinology has moved on since then. And I'm proud to say I've come up with my own 21st Century method for keeping up to date with the current thinking in the corridors of Russian power: it involves walking to the train station opposite the BBC Moscow office, going up to the souvenir stand and looking at the fridge magnets on sale. You can tell a lot from Russian fridge magnets. This week's selection includes several different ""Vladimir Putin in military camouflage"" magnets, complete with patriotic slogans, like: ""Together we are a force to be reckoned with!"" and ""We will always look out for our guys!"" Kremlin policy in a nutshell. One fridge magnet in particular caught my eye. It looks just like a $100 bill but, in place of the American founding father Benjamin Franklin, there is a portrait of Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin features on a range of Russian fridge magnets I know. It's only a fridge magnet. But it encapsulates the whole Putin-Trump/Russia-America saga. After six months of Donald Trump in the White House, Russians are beginning to feel that their country enjoys considerable influence over America. And who could blame them for thinking that? Particularly in light of allegations of the Kremlin hacking a US election and putting a Russian puppet in the White House, and with all the rumours of Russian lawyers, Russian lobbyists and Russian oligarchs conspiring with the Trump team and the Trump family. Trump: I get along 'very well' with Putin Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House Trump and Putin: Comparing the men behind the meeting Trump and Putin had another, undisclosed conversation at G20 It will be up to official investigations to establish whether there was, indeed, collusion. But even the suggestion that there may have been has got the whole world talking about the power of Putin's Russia and the weakness of Trump's America. There are times when Vladimir Putin seems to be basking in the infamy of running a cyber superpower. There is just one problem for President Putin. It's the problem of all fridge magnets, really. They look so pretty when you buy them in the shop. But they don't stick to every fridge. Many Russians welcomed Donald Trump's presidential victory When it began, Donald Trump's presidency looked very pretty to Moscow. The Russians expected that America's new leader would herald a new era in US-Russian cooperation. At the time, a news anchor on Russian State TV described Trump as ""an Alpha male... a real man."" The day after America's presidential election, one Russian state official told me that she had celebrated Trump's victory with a cigar and a bottle of champagne. But, after six months of President Trump, US sanctions against Russia remain in place. The two Russian diplomatic compounds, closed by President Obama last December, remain shut. And the idea of a ""Grand Deal"" with America, much hoped for here at the start of the Trump presidency, has disappeared from the pages of the Russian dailies. Moscow is not blaming Donald Trump directly for this. One Russian newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, explained recently that, in the current atmosphere, ""Trump doesn't have the slightest possibility to improve Russian-US relations, since any step, any glance even in the direction of Russia is met with suspicion back home and even viewed as treason."" A few days ago I was chatting to a Russian senator. He complained that the intense pressure President Trump was facing over the Russia question was complicating US-Russian diplomacy. Behind the smiles, what concrete effects will come from the Trump/Putin political relationship? ""Trump is like a prisoner,"" he told me, ""And how can you talk to a prisoner?"" But Russia and America are talking. Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have now met, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. And, although progress is slower than Moscow would like, there is cautious talk of cooperation: in Syria, for example, and in the area of cyber security. Mr Trump continues to argue there is nothing wrong in seeking a closer relationship with Russia. He insists it is in America's interest to do so. And, while America's president and America's Western allies often appear poles apart on a variety of issues, Donald Trump seems drawn like a magnet to Vladimir Putin. Indeed, he has openly praised the Kremlin leader. Yet Russia is casting a shadow over the US administration. For Donald Trump, could this prove to be a fatal attraction?
