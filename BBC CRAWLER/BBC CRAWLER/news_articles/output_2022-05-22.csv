Monkeypox detected in three more countries,"Israel, Switzerland and Austria are the latest countries to confirm cases of monkeypox, bringing the total number of nations reporting outbreaks to 15. Israel and Switzerland both said they identified one infected person who had recently travelled abroad. Israel is investigating other suspected cases. Monkeypox does not tend to spread easily between people and the illness is usually mild. The virus is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa. More than 80 cases have been confirmed in the recent outbreak in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. This outbreak has taken scientists by surprise, but the risk to the wider public is said to be low. Most people who catch the virus recover within a few weeks, according tothe UK's National Health Service,external. EXPLAINER:What is monkeypox? ANALYSIS:Time to worry or one to ignore? The World Health Organization has said a number of other suspected cases are being investigated - without naming the countries involved - and warned that more infections are likely to be confirmed. Asked about the outbreak as he finished a visit to South Korea, US President Joe Biden said that if the virus were to spread more widely it would be ""consequential"", adding that ""it is something that everybody should be concerned about"". He said the US was ""working hard"" on its response and what vaccines in might use. After the outbreak was first identified in the UK, the virus began to be detected across Europe - with public health agencies in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden all confirming cases. The UK Health Security Agency has identified 20 cases so far and its chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis."" She said the virus is now spreading in the community - with cases detected which have no contact with anyone who has visited West Africa, where the disease is endemic. But the risk to the general population remains ""extremely low"", with cases so far mostly found in some urban areas and among gay or bisexual men, Dr Hopkins said. Although there is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, several countries have said they are stocking smallpox vaccines, which are about 85% effective in preventing infection because the two viruses are quite similar. In a statement on Friday,external, the WHO said that the recent outbreaks were unusual in that they were occurring in countries where the disease was not endemic. It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is that the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation is that the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. The WHO's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has warned that ""transmission could accelerate"" during the summer season, as people gather for festivals and parties. In addition to the European cases, Australia has confirmed that one man who had travelled to the UK contracted the virus. In North America,health authorities in the US state of Massachusetts,externalsaid one man who recently travelled to Canada had tested positive for the virus. Canada's Public Health Agency said it had identifiedtwo cases in Quebec,external, but said it was not clear if the US traveller had been infected before or during his visit to Montreal.

ScotRail's scaled back timetable comes into force,"ScotRail's new timetable, which will see almost 700 fewer train services a day, has been rolled out as the deadlock over driver pay continues. The move, which will see the last train on many routes departing before 20:00, follows a third Sunday of disruption. Drivers' union Aslef has argued a 2.2% pay rise is not acceptable at a time of soaring inflation. Employment minister Richard Lochhead said he understood the pressures but urged ""sensible"" pay claims. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Why has ScotRail cancelled hundreds of trains? Minister urges people to be 'sensible' over pay Anger over 'devastating' cuts to ScotRail services Aslef and the RMT union are both balloting members for strike action after rejecting the pay offer. Ministers insist that scaling back the number of services under thenew temporary timetable,externalwill reduce the need for cancellations. But hospitality and entertainment businesses have warned the transport situation will affect their income, while some commuters have also raised concerns. The original May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services, but from Monday this will be reduced temporarily by a third to 1,456. Opposition politicians have criticised the move which comes after a Scottish government owned company took over the running of ScotRail last month. The previous operator Abellio had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. More than 300 services were cancelled on Sunday before the temporary timetable came into place. ScotRail's service delivery director David Simpson conceded that the temporary timetable would see a reduction in service but said it would also provide customers with ""a level of certainty and reliability"". ""I hope we have this in place for as short a time as possible because we recognise the disruption it is causing to people,"" he told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme. ""We need to sit down and talk against the background where everyone is clear that we need to compromise. The demands of 10, 11% are just not sustainable in the current economic climate of the railway. We need to find a way round that."" He said ScotRail needed to demonstrate ""taxpayer value"" in the way the company operated. ""We think the offer we have made is a strong one,"" Mr Simpson added. ""It's 2.2% on basic plus 5% through the revenue share. We think that reflects the current economic position of the industry but also offers good package for drivers and other grades that allows them to share in the success of ScotRail as they move forward."" The operator has been dependent on drivers working extra hours, following delays in training new staff during the Covid pandemic. Mr Simpson said ScotRail could return to a full timetable if drivers returned to the previous level of rest-day working, but added that its training scheme for new drivers was ""going very well"" with 130 new drivers currently going through the programme. The Scottish government has said a train driver in Scotland typically earns more than Â£50,000 a year, and has urged the rail unions to negotiate with ScotRail. But Aslef has said it was ""not sensible"" to offer a 2.2% pay increase with inflation running at the current levels. Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay has now written to the first minister asking her to provide ""positive political intervention"" in bringing ScotRail back to the negotiating table to end an impasse over wages. He said: ""We urgently need to see progress and a de-escalation of this situation. The Scottish public demand it. They need to get to and from work, leisure, and important cultural and sporting events satisfactorily and this needs a full service that is invested in, not cut. ""We have said repeatedly we want to return to talks - we stand ready whenever they are called to meet with ScotRail and the Scottish government anytime, anyplace and anywhere."" He added: ""Sadly, up until now there has been negative political interference, it is now time for positive political intervention and leadership from you with an instruction to ScotRail to enter as a matter of urgency meaningful pay talks with the full intention to sensibly settle these pay negotiations."" Asked on the BBC'sThe Sunday Showif the unions were making reasonable demands, Employment Minister Richard Lochhead said: ""My message to all workers in Scotland, in all these sectors, is that we have to sensible. ""Everything has to be affordable because the country is in a very precarious position at the moment and if we take wrong decisions we could end up with a recession."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said last week she hoped the timetable would get back to normal ""as quickly as possible"". Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth has said she expects 38 new drivers to be qualified by the end of the summer, 55 by the end of the year, and 100 by June 2023. She has previously described the practice of rest day working as ""outdated"" and that the Scottish government was looking to phase it out. ""I would encourage both partners to sit round the table today,"" she said on Monday. ""We need to see negotiations move on and that means compromise on both sides."" She added: ""We need to make nationalisation a success. I want the railway unions to be part of that success."" Graham Simpson, the Scottish Conservatives transport spokesman, said there were ""serious questions to answer"" about why negotiations were not taking place on Monday. ""Jenny Gilruth might have the luxury of her ministerial car to get around, but others do not,"" he added. ""She needs to start showing leadership and ensure that passengers do not continue to suffer this miserable and disastrous service on our trains.""

Two-child families paying Â£400 a month more,"Basic goods and services for a typical family with two young children are about Â£400 a month more expensive than they were last year, new data suggests. Energy prices added about Â£120 to families' monthly costs as price caps rose and cheap tariffs ended. Pay is rising more slowly than prices, forcing many families to make tough spending choices. The data from Loughborough University is based on what focus groups deem aminimum acceptable standard of living,external. As well as the essentials needed to survive, like food, rent and heating, the budgets include things the focus groups believe are needed to take part in society, such as internet access, school trips and an annual family holiday in the UK. Gas and electricity costs havegone up sharply over the past year, especially for those on the lowest tariffs, because of rises in the energy price cap and the disappearance of cheap deals. Transport costs, including petrol and parking charges, added at least Â£85 to families' outgoings, while childcare costs rose by Â£66 a month. Stacey Sherwood, a single mother of two from Leicester, says she is constantly having to scale back. Stacey, who has two children, says: ""I work, I should be able to pay for things myself"" ""Day trips out with the kids, outings - all of that's gone,"" she says. Ms Sherwood, who works for a window company, sends her two-year-old daughter Arabella-Rose to nursery three days a week. She'd like to send her full-time, but can't afford to, so her parents help with childcare. Rising bills have forced the family to limit showers and share baths, and she can no longer afford to take her nine-year-old son Oliver on outings, such as trips to the bowling alley. ""Once you've paid for bowling, food and so on, you've spent Â£100 and we simply can't afford that anymore,"" she says. ""I don't want to be saying no. It makes me feel like a failure, like a bad mum. I work, I should be able to pay for things myself."" Why are prices rising so quickly? When might the inflation rate come down? Energy bills push inflation to 40-year high The cost of these basic household budgets - known as the Minimum Income Standard - has often gone up faster than inflation, which is calculated using prices across the whole economy. With inflation reaching a 40-year high of 9% in April 2022, families with two children face costs 13% higher than they did in the same month last year. Budgets for other household types, including those without children, are set to be published later this year. Peter Matejic from anti-poverty charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says low-income households are hit the hardest by price rises: ""Families in poverty are feeling the worst effects of the frightening jumps we are seeing in the cost of living, because more of their budget goes on essential items and their incomes just can't keep up. ""The government has the power to close the gap by uprating benefits now, ensuring that the worst off are not pulled under."" The government has said it is supporting families struggling financially in the face of rising prices, including a Â£150 council tax discount and a Â£200 loan for energy bills in the autumn. But Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is under increasing pressureto offer more support to households, including a windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits, a cut to VAT and further financial help with energy bills. Prices are rising for everyone - especially as increases are being driven by the cost of energy, such as heating and lighting our homes. But the impact is clearly more acute for those whose household budgets are already very tight. So far, government support has been a mix of broad, general assistance, such as council tax rebates, and more targeted policy - such as allowing those on universal credit to take home more of what they earn. The prime minister and chancellor have said they stand ready to offer more help. The debate in the weeks ahead will not only be about how generous, but also how specifically directed, that support could be.

New Australia leader signals climate policy change,"This video can not be played WATCH: New Australian PM says climate action ""shouldn't be controversial"" Australia's new leader has vowed to take the country in a new direction, with a big shift in climate policy. Anthony Albanese, who won Saturday's election with the opposition centre-left Labor Party, said Australia could become a renewable energy superpower. He is to be sworn in as PM on Monday, but it is not clear whether his party will have a majority in parliament. Climate change was a key concern for voters, after three years of record-breaking bushfire and flood events. Outgoing PM Scott Morrison, the leader of an ousted Liberal-National coalition, thanked the ""miracle of the Australian people"" after conceding. Vote counting is still going on and he is still a few seats short of the 76 that Labor needs to secure a majority in the 151-member lower house of parliament. Final results may not be known for several days, as electoral officials have just started counting nearly three million postal votes. If the election results in a hung parliament, Greens and independents - who have been campaigning for radical climate change action - could wield greater influence in framing the new government's policies on the issue. A simple guide to the Australian election Scott Morrison runs out of miracles Why Australia's election is big for the planet Watch: What are Indigenous people hoping for? Speaking to the BBC's Shaimaa Khalil shortly after his election victory, Mr Albanese, 59, said: ""We have an opportunity now to end the climate wars in Australia. ""Australian businesses know that good action on climate change is good for jobs and good for our economy, and I want to join the global effort."" Mr Albanese, who will be heading Australia's first Labor government in almost a decade, also promised to adopt more ambitious emissions targets. However, he has so far refused calls to phase out coal use or to block the opening of new coal mines. By Jay Savage, Australia editor Anthony Albanese has vowed to ""end the climate wars"" that have poisoned Australia's will for emissions cuts in the past decade. He now has a mandate. The rejection of Scott Morrison's government in the big cities was seismic. It's a clear repudiation of policies that have made Australia a climate laggard among rich nations. Yet Labor has not been the biggest vote beneficiary. Unlike when the party last left opposition in 2007 on a big swing to Kevin Rudd, dubbed the ""Ruddslide"", this result has been separately claimed as a ""tealslide"" and a ""Greenslide"". The surge in vote for those candidates has reshaped Australia's political landscape. Teal independents picked up key seats in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth. Perhaps most incredibly, the Greens are on track to win three seats in Brisbane. While it is a different story regionally, the result has upended many perceptions of Queensland as Australia's most conservative state. How Australia is becoming more unliveable The teals and Greens want even stronger climate action than Mr Albanese, whose election pledges included a commitment to coal. Some have already suggested they will lobby him for more ambitious goals. If Mr Albanese fails to secure a majority, their voices will be even louder. Mr Albanese will fly to Tokyo on Monday for a summit with the leaders of Japan, India and the US, known as the Quad. As he will be representing Australia as its prime minister, he will be sworn into office before his departure. ""Obviously the Quad leaders meeting is an absolute priority for us,"" he told journalists on Sunday. ""It's an opportunity for us to send a message that there is a change of government and that there will be a change of policies on things like climate change. ""I will return to Australia on Wednesday and then we'll get down to business."" He said he wanted to ""change the country and change the way that politics operates in this country"". One of Australia's longest-serving politicians, Mr Albanese served briefly as deputy prime minister to Kevin Rudd in 2013 and has long been a favourite of his party's left wing. Since becoming opposition leader in 2019, he has positioned himself more towards the centre. After taking over from Malcolm Turnbull in 2018, Mr Morrison led Australia through a period dominated by natural disasters and the pandemic. He had been expected to narrowly lose the election, but the result showed a collapse in his vote. The Coalition shed crucial seats to so-called ""teal"" independents, mostly women, in traditional inner-city Liberal strongholds. They had campaigned on platforms of climate action and integrity in politics. Mr Morrison congratulated Mr Albanese and said he would step down as Liberal leader after the defeat. He said it had been ""a time of great upheaval"". ""What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,"" the outgoing prime minister said. Mr Morrison, 54, is the first prime minister to serve a full term in office since John Howard in 2007. Former Defence Minister Peter Dutton is seen as favourite to take over as Liberal leader, after former Treasurer Josh Frydenberg seemed set to lose his seat. US President Joe Biden called Mr Albanese on Sunday to congratulate him on his victory. The two countries are part of the Quad group, along with Japan and India, which is holding a summit in Tokyo on Tuesday. Mr Albanese has said he will be there, a decision welcomed by Mr Biden. ""President Biden reaffirmed the United States' steadfast commitment to the US-Australia alliance and his intent to work closely with the new government to make it stronger still,"" the White House said. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he looked forward to working with Mr Albanese ""in the weeks, months and years ahead as, together, we tackle shared challenges and demonstrate the importance of our shared values"". New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern said she had ""a warm conversation"" with Mr Albanese, describing Australia as ""our most important partner"". Indian PM Narendra Modi also congratulated Mr Albanese on his party's election victory.

"""I was ignored"" - report finds maternity racismThe charity Birthrights conducted a year-long investigation into ""racial injustice"" in maternity care.Health","This video can not be played WATCH: Hiral Varsani says she was traumatised by her treatment during the birth of her first child Black and Asian women are being harmed by racial discrimination in maternity care, according to an inquiry. The year-long investigation into ""racial injustice"" was conducted by the charity Birthrights. Women reported feeling unsafe, being denied pain relief, facing racial stereotyping about their pain tolerance, and microaggressions. The government has set up a taskforce to tackle racial disparities in maternity care. Hiral Varsani says she was traumatised by her treatment during the birth of her first child. The 31-year-old from north London developed sepsis - a potentially life-threatening reaction to an infection - after her labour was induced, which she says was only spotted after a long delay. ""I was shivering, my whole body was aching, my heart was beating really fast and I felt terrible. But everyone kept saying everything was normal,"" she says. ""It was almost 24 hours later before a doctor took my bloods for the first time and realised I was seriously ill."" Hiral had an emergency C-section and her daughter was taken into intensive care after also contracting sepsis. Why are black mothers at more risk of dying? Miscarriage: 'I was in pain - they did not listen' She believes her race played a role in her care: ""I experienced microaggressions and was stereotyped because of the colour of my skin. ""The staff would say 'hello princess', and while I was having contractions in a corridor a midwife walked past and said, 'Oh, you're definitely going to need an epidural'. I had never even met her before. ""I was repeatedly ignored, they just thought I was a weak little Indian girl, who was unable to take pain."" While death in pregnancy or childbirth is very rare in the UK,there are stark racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.,external Black women are more than four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women in the UK, while women from Asian backgrounds face almost twice the risk. Tinu Alikor was terrified she would become one of those statistics when she gave birth to her daughter 14 months ago. Tinu Alikor feared she might die while pregnant with her daughter The mother-of-three from Kent says she was ""mistreated and unheard"" during her maternity care each time, but says her most recent experience was perhaps the worst. During Tinu's second trimester, she had heavy, unexplained bleeding, and said she begged for an examination. ""The blood was getting worse, I was scared, I thought I was losing my baby. I've have had two miscarriages before. ""The doctors refused to examine me and just said I had a UTI. I was told I still had four days till the end of my antibiotics course, and I remember saying, 'four days to what - till I bleed to death'?"" When Tinu was eventually examined, she was immediately taken to hospital because of a serious bleed coming from her bladder, and she needed several blood transfusions. ""If I had not have been hospitalised, I don't think I'd be sitting here right now. And I don't think my daughter would be. I've met some amazing midwives and doctors but I think all my experiences in my pregnancies and labour have been tainted by my race. ""With all three of my labours, I wasn't given any pain relief. I had to beg for it during my first two births, and even then, I was only ever given gas and air. ""Racial stereotyping has got a lot to do with it. There is an assumption that black women have a higher pain tolerance. I don't know where this comes from. It doesn't hurt any less because I'm black."" The Birthrights investigation - supported by the law firm Leigh Day - found common themes across the testimony it heard. These included: Black and brown women reported feeling physically and psychologically unsafe during their care Health care professionals failed to recognise serious medical conditions such as jaundice in black babies because ""white bodies"" were considered the norm Women described racial stereotyping, microaggressions and assumptions - leading to distress and trauma. One of the most common experiences was that of black, brown and mixed ethnicity women reporting pain relief being denied or delayed because of racist stereotypes, including black women's perceived ability to tolerate pain and Asian women's perceived inability to cope with pain There were many accounts of women and staff hearing Asian women being referred to as ""princesses"" or ""precious"" and black women as ""aggressive"" or ""angry"" Some women and health care professionals shared examples of overt racism, such as hearing staff saying that black women and babies have ""thick, tough skin"", that the ward ""smells of curry"" when south Asian families were being cared for, and that Chinese people are ""dirty"" Melissa Brown, a midwife and officer for Birthrights, said maternity services were facing immense challenges. ""We did hear positive examples of maternity care, but there is racism and racial discrimination at a structural and individual level which is putting black, brown and mixed ethnicity women at harm. There are many complex reasons for poorer health outcomes for ethnic minorities, and racism and discrimination is definitely playing a role."" The Birthrights report - which will be sent to MPs - highlights the need for urgent action, including training for health care professionals which highlights diversity. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the Maternity Disparities Taskforce would ""level up maternity care for all women"". ""It will address factors linked to unacceptable disparities in quality of care, experiences and outcomes.""

'How the state tried to silence my abusive MI5 agent expose',"Much of the evidence was kept secret from Daniel De Simone and the BBC team No journalist enjoys attempts at censorship. We often face restrictions, but I had never encountered anything like this - a vast list of things the government wanted to ban me saying about an abusive MI5 agent I had spent a long time investigating. I received the list during the months-long legal battle between the BBC and the government. I had been investigating a state informant for some time, and when we put the findings to the government, they took us to court. It eventually ran to 54 pages and included a series of arguments about the government's demands. They wanted to stop our story about the agent who can only be referred to as X. The right-wing extremist had used his security service role to terrorise and coerce his British girlfriend, who we are calling Beth. In one incident, which she recorded on her mobile phone, he attacked her with a machete. Evidence we gathered establishes he had also threatened to kill women and children, and was a sexual threat to young girls. I was the main witness in the legal case to defend reporting on the story. The litigation process took over my life. The pressure was significant and I had many low moments. My journalism was under scrutiny - with government lawyers critically examining every detail in the large volume of evidence, and challenging the accuracy of our work. We argued that it was important to identify X so that other women he encountered could be warned about him and the abusive behaviour our investigation had uncovered. The security service, however, argued that naming X would create an unacceptable danger to him from extremists and discourage other people from acting as informants, which would damage national security. The government initially asked for the right to exercise written approval over our reporting. This would have amounted to ministers having editorial control over our story, which we argued in court would be ""repugnant"" to any media organisation but particularly the BBC, with its charter obligation of independence from government. This demand was eventually dropped and the judge later said he would have required ""great persuasion"" to have granted it. Watch the full investigation This is the story of a dangerous MI5 agent, which the government tried to keep secret. Available now on BBC iPlayer There were several stages to the court case. In one, the judge ruled - after receiving secret evidence that I was not allowed to see - that X could not be identified. The next stage involved an argument over what other details should be kept from the public. I thought even if X was anonymised, our news report could still reveal a great deal and generate public debate about important issues, particularly the state's response to violence against women and girls. But it was clear that everything we had uncovered could potentially be censored. Very little had been agreed between the parties, the judge noted, and the number of issues in dispute was ""dispiritingly large"". The BBC's legal team outside the High Court in London As he put it, MI5 was seeking to limit ""practically everything known about [X] that is not already in the public domain"". That was an awful lot, given the only things known publicly had emerged from the court case itself. However, after receiving a judgement in the case this week, we were able to broadcast and publisha significant report on Thursday. The legal case itself had been draining, with much of the evidence entirely secret and kept from me and the BBC team. I was anonymous in the proceedings, but I cannot tell you why. My name was redacted in public documents, and when I was pointed at and referred to in open court - even when I was actually sitting there - my name was not used. There was a challenge from MI5 on the reliability of the story, but the judge ultimately found I had taken ""proper steps to assess whether its various elements were true"" and that it was ""comfortably"" shown to have a credible evidential foundation. The investigation had been lengthy and complicated. It started simply with the account of Beth and went from there. Eventually we found another abused former partner of X's - who, in our reporting,  we called Ruth. Everything that could be, was tested and corroborated, with every new discovery subjected to the same process. The research would ultimately drag in MI5, the government, a foreign intelligence agency, police, prosecutors, and the High Court. MI5 agent X terrorised his partner with a machete Hardly anyone within the BBC knew what was going on. The whole thing felt like a parody of a spy film. I would sneak off from my normal tasks to carry out research and have meetings in odd locations. The small BBC team involved - investigations editor Ed Campbell, producer Sira Thierij and lawyer Lucy Moorman - used a random codename for the project and each element of the investigation was meticulously planned. During the legal proceedings, my main opposite number was a senior MI5 officer, who could only be referred to as Witness A. On various issues, it was my evidence against his. But the case involved another bewildering element. The government had applied for something called a closed material procedure, where secret evidence is put before a judge, including during a closed hearing in a secure courtroom behind locked doors. This part of the case excluded the BBC team and our lawyers, with what are known as special advocates - security cleared barristers - appointed to act on our behalf. The procedure is designed to let the security and intelligence agencies present evidence that is too secret for almost anyone to hear. I've reported on cases involving terrorism suspects where this process is central. But I effectively now found myself in the same position - blind to the evidence being presented against me. It will remain secret. We met our special advocates and explained our case. However, once they had seen the secret evidence we were banned from communicating with them. This meant we could not provide any instructions in response to the evidence they were seeing. Any further messages between us had to be channelled through an official go-between - a civil servant - to check that nothing secret was being disclosed. In court we could nod and smile at them, but have no conversations. The two women we interviewed both think X could kill a woman - and I formed the same view. Counter terrorism investigations are typically focused on preventing harm. Why wait for a terrorist to hurt people if you can stop him before? The same principle applied to investigating and challenging X. The judge eventually ruled that we were allowed to publish and broadcast the story, and it came as a huge relief to finally be out there reporting on it so prominently. Since it went into the public domain on Thursday, it's led to the issues being debated and the story being referenced by leading politicians. One described the revelations as ""harrowing and horrific"" - the deputy prime minister, whose government had taken me and the BBC to court.

Pay gap from bosses to staff to widen - think tank,"The gap between the pay of company executives and other workers is set to widen this year after falling during the height of the Covid pandemic, research by a think tank suggests. The High Pay Centre said cuts to executive pay led to a fall in the median pay gap between bosses in FTSE 350 firms and employees last year. But it said early data indicated that the gap will widen again in 2022. Pay ratios were widest in retail and lowest in media and financial services. Unions called for maximum pay ratios to ""bring some fairness back"" to the system. Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high Bosses 'earn average worker's salary in 34 hours' Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said the think tank's report indicated companies showed ""some sensitivity to the need to treat workers fairly and reduce vast pay inequalities during the pandemic"". ""However, as the Covid-19 emergency hopefully reduces, it would be a shame if the spirit of solidarity it generated fades away as well,"" he added. ""With the dire outlook for the UK economy, how we share existing resource will become increasingly important."" Households are currently being hit by the rising cost of living, with food, fuel and energy prices all biting into budgets. Prices were already rising as economies opened following pandemic restrictions, but war in Ukraine has led to further increases and wages are failing to keep pace. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise,jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April,up from 7% in March and is forecast to rise further by the end of the year. However, the governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey has previously urged workers tonot ask for big pay rises - to try and stop inflation spiralling out of control. But Mr Hildyard said major employers had ""a key role to play balancing their pay awards so that high, middle and low earners are all paid fairly and proportionately"". Across 69 companies that disclosed pay ratios in the first months of 2022 to the High Pay Centre, the average chief executive to average employee pay ratio was 63:1 - almost double the ratio for the same group of companies in 2021, at 34:1. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Hildyard said: ""For many households the cost of living's rising, their economic situation is getting a lot worse not better, but that doesn't seem to be stopping the big companies that are making big profits from paying vast amounts to their chief executives and people at the top while not necessarily awarding pay rises to lower earning workers who are struggling with that cost of living."" Mubin Haq, chief executive of the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, which contributed to the research, said the previous narrowing of the pay gap during the height of the pandemic showed ""change is possible"". ""As inflation starts to bite, it's more important than ever that companies do the right thing and pay is distributed fairly,"" he said. ""Going back to past practice, where pay ratios increase year-on-year, is one area where we do not want to see a return to normal following the pandemic. However, this increasingly seems unlikely as evidence from a number of companies shows pay at the top rebounding."" Mr Haq said wage growth for those on lower incomes would be ""critical"" to ensure ""millions can weather the cost-of-living crisis we are now facing"". However, Emily Fielder, head of communications at the Adam Smith Institute, said while ""fretting about CEO pay might make for a good headline, getting involved would do little to increase workers' wages and benefits to shareholders"". She claimed research into ""unexpected executive deaths and the effect that this had on the companies they represent"" had shown that bosses of big firms ""have a real impact on a company's performance"". ""The UK should be adopting policies which will get the economy growing again, rather than undertaking a PR exercise in the politics of envy,"" she added. The High Pay Centre's most recent chief executive pay analysis said the average FTSE 100 boss was paid Â£2.69m in 2020. The figure was 86 times the average full-time UK worker but was a 17% drop from Â£3.25m in 2019. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Pay inequality has gone much too far."" ""Even for the best-performing executives, pay can be out of all proportion compared to hard-working staff on the frontline,"" she said.

'How the state tried to silence my abusive MI5 agent expose'BBC News reporter Daniel De Simone on his courtroom fight to reveal how an MI5 agent abused women.,"Much of the evidence was kept secret from Daniel De Simone and the BBC team No journalist enjoys attempts at censorship. We often face restrictions, but I had never encountered anything like this - a vast list of things the government wanted to ban me saying about an abusive MI5 agent I had spent a long time investigating. I received the list during the months-long legal battle between the BBC and the government. I had been investigating a state informant for some time, and when we put the findings to the government, they took us to court. It eventually ran to 54 pages and included a series of arguments about the government's demands. They wanted to stop our story about the agent who can only be referred to as X. The right-wing extremist had used his security service role to terrorise and coerce his British girlfriend, who we are calling Beth. In one incident, which she recorded on her mobile phone, he attacked her with a machete. Evidence we gathered establishes he had also threatened to kill women and children, and was a sexual threat to young girls. I was the main witness in the legal case to defend reporting on the story. The litigation process took over my life. The pressure was significant and I had many low moments. My journalism was under scrutiny - with government lawyers critically examining every detail in the large volume of evidence, and challenging the accuracy of our work. We argued that it was important to identify X so that other women he encountered could be warned about him and the abusive behaviour our investigation had uncovered.

E.On UK warns 40% of customers face fuel poverty,"E.On says around one in eight of its customers are struggling to pay their bills One of the UK's biggest energy suppliers has warned that up to 40% of its customers will be in fuel poverty by October as it called on the government to help struggling homes. E.On UK boss Michael Lewis said the rise in energy prices is ""unprecedented"" and a growing number of its customers are in arrears. The government is facing calls to levy a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said Rishi Sunak will look at all options. ""We will review everything,"" he told the BBC, adding: ""We've got Â£22bn in the next 12 months of help to those people who need it the most."" However, Mr Lewis said around one in eight of its customers were already struggling to pay their bills, even before the weather turns colder and the new energy price cap comes into force in October, which is expected to rise significantly. ""We do need more intervention in October and it has to be very substantial,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Programme. What is a windfall tax and how would it work? Why is the cost of living going up? A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy. E.On UK boss Michael Lewis said energy price rises are ""unprecedented"" Mr Lewis said around a fifth of its customers were already in fuel poverty but that is expected to rise significantly later this year. Energy regulator Ofgem lifted the price cap on gas and electricity bills in April, adding around Â£700 to the average household energy bill to take it to Â£1,971. For the 4.5 million people on pre-payment meters - which are typically used by people on lower incomes - the price of energy has now risen further, by an average Â£708, to Â£2,017 a year. Due to the rising cost of wholesale gas, however, the price cap is expected to increase and take the typical energy bill to as much as Â£2,800, if not higher. ""In my 30 years in the energy industry I've never ever seen prices increasing at this rate,"" said Mr Lewis. Following the rise of gas and electricity prices in April, the UK's inflation rate reached a 40-year high of 9%. He declined to comment on whether the government should impose a windfall tax on companies benefitting from the sharp rise in crude oil and wholesale gas prices which has been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Mr Lewis said it is important the government taxes ""those with the broadest shoulders"". Recently, Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years. ""Intervene"". The word could be heard clearly four times during Mr Lewis' interview this morning. He used it repeatedly, not holding back on his request that the government must now step in and help energy customers facing huge bills. The chief executive of a huge energy firm admitting that the ""scale is too big for us to manage at the moment"" was a direct signal to Downing Street for help. Mr Lewis made suggestions on what policy tools he believed were at the disposal of government to help his customers, 20% of whom he said are now in fuel poverty, a figure that's expected to double. The pressure continues to build on the Treasury for solutions to the cost of living crisis, to help people who are really struggling. This candour from the top of business will only add to that. A windfall tax has been backed by Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reluctant to introduce a tax over concerns it could hit energy firms' investments in the UK. Butthe Sunday Times reported,externalthat the chancellor is considering implementing the levy. Mr Sunak recently told the BBCthat he is ""not naturally attracted by the idea of"" a windfall tax. ""But what I do know is these companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices."" Mr Sunak said that he wants to see ""significant investment back into the UK economy to support jobs, to support energy security"". ""And if that doesn't happen, then no options are off the table,"" he said. Mr Lewis suggested that the government could substantially increase the size and scope of the Warm Homes Discount scheme. It offers those in receipt of certain benefits the option to seek a one-off Â£140 payment. Mr Lewis said the scheme ""works well"" but told the BBC ""the scale of this is simply too big for us to manage at the moment"". ""If we were to expand the scope from three million to six million customers and increase the payment from Â£140 up to Â£600 that would make a very, very big difference to those customers on lower incomes."" A Treasury spokesperson said ""while we can't shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we're supporting British families to navigate the months ahead with a Â£22 billion package of support. ""The chancellor has been clear that as the situation evolves, our response will evolve - and we stand ready to do more."" Mr Lewis claimed energy providers were limited in the help they can give customers because gas and electricity prices are set by energy regulator Ofgem.

"Children's social care needs radical reset - reviewThe system is geared to crisis intervention but struggling families need help earlier, says the lead of a major review.UK","Henrietta, in care from 14, says her life would have been different if her mother had been offered help earlier Tens of thousands more children could end up in care without radical changes to child protection, a ""once-in a generation"" review has warned. Thereview,externalof England's council-run children's services says struggling families need early intervention to ensure they do not reach crisis point. The recommendations include phasing out young offender institutions and a drive to recruit more foster parents. Ministers promised ""ambitious and detailed"" plans before the end of 2022. But Labour and the British Association of Social Workers both blamed government austerity measures since 2010 for stripping away services for vulnerable families. And the Independent Children's Homes Association, representing private providers of residential care, accused the review of ""overreaching"". The Independent Review of Children's Social Care's lead Josh MacAlister called for Â£2.6bn over five years to transform the system and prevent the number of children in care - already at record levels - rising above 100,000. It follows the killing of toddlersArthur Labinjo-HughesandStar Hobson,who died in separate incidents in 2020. The trials of their killers highlighted the inadequacies of the social system meant to protect at-risk children. A separate report on the failings in both cases is expected soon. Huge profits made from children's care - report Children in care 'seen as criminals not victims' Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' The landmark review's recommendations have also called for: new child-protection experts to ensure senior staff are directly involved in frontline decisions a recruitment drive to increase the number of foster parents who can care for children a new law protecting care leavers from discrimination young offender institutions, described as ""wholly unsuitable for children"", to be phased out ""I was always walking with a black bin bag,"" says Henrietta Imoreh, of being moved from placement to placement five times during her first weeks in care at the age of 14. Youth worker Henrietta, now 27, says the sort of early intervention recommended in the report could have transformed her life. Being in care ""felt like a never-ending storm"", she says. It disrupted her education, she was bullied and got into fights. ""Where is the support for families right at the start, when they're struggling?"" she asks. She says: ""There were so many moments in my childhood where my mum was suffering and nobody offered support... Maybe we wouldn't have gone into care and maybe our stories would have been different."" Mr MacAlister, a former teacher who led the government-commissioned review, told the BBC: ""I've walked away from this feeling a mixture of inspiration at times - seeing what families have been able to do and where children have been able to get despite the circumstances - but also rage. ""Some of the things going on in the system are outrageous and are not acceptable."" He said Â£2.6bn was needed for a five-year programme to change the system fundamentally, and improve the lives of children and their families. Without that, he said, the number of children in care - already at a record 80,000 - would grow. ""Carry on as we are and we'll have nearly 100,000 children in care by this time next decade, and the costs per year will be Â£15bn [up from Â£10bn]... and it won't be achieving better outcomes for anybody."" He suggested some of the money could be raised by a windfall tax on the 15 largest providers of residential children's care and foster care, who he said had ""done very well out of market failure"" by capitalising on demand. Mr MacAlister said: ""What we found is that this is a system - the children social care system - that needs a radical reset, because at the moment it is in a cycle where problems escalate, costs rise, outcomes continue to be too poor, and that's getting worse and worse over time."" Mr MacAlister (centre) and his team spoke to more than 2,000 people with personal experience of the care system Another key recommendation is extra financial support for relatives taking on the care of a child to avoid them going into children's homes, or being fostered. ""Children have told us, having been in care, that they desperately would have liked to stay with their grandparents or that uncle or family friend,"" Mr MacAlister said. But too often relatives' housing is unsuitable or budgets won't stretch to the cost of taking on an extra child, says the report, which argues for kinship carers to be paid the same amount as foster carers. Lisa, whose baby granddaughter was adopted last year, wishes she could have taken her in instead - but she says the social workers who handled the case were ""negative and nit-picking"" and not on her side. She already has a special guardianship order for the baby's older brother, but when she applied for the second child, she was told that a condition was giving up her job to focus on her granddaughter's emotional wellbeing. Lisa says she had no choice but to allow her granddaughter to be adopted Losing her income would have plunged the whole family into poverty, so Lisa felt she had no choice. ""It was the hardest decision I've ever made... I think I will take to my grave whether it was the right one or not."" Lisa says special guardians need better help. ""We are an afterthought. We don't get the support that foster carers get. We don't get the support adopters get - and yet we're the most successful placements for a child. It doesn't make sense."" In a statement, ministers said they were committed to ""major reforms to improve the lives of England's most vulnerable children and families"". Initial measures set out by the government include: family hubs for ""essential early support"" an expert National Implementation Board to oversee ""transformational change"" a foster carer recruitment drive more funding for councils to keep vulnerable children in education ""This is the start of a journey to change the culture and dramatically reform the children's social care system,"" said Education Secretary Nadim Zahawi, who pledged detailed plans for ""bold and ambitious change"" within months. Labour called the poor outcomes for children in care ""a source of shame for our country and our government"". ""A decade of Conservative governments have stripped away the early help services that children and families rely on,"" said Helen Hayes, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years. The British Association of Social Workers said: ""Public service austerity has not only driven social care services to breaking point, it has fundamentally undermined social protection for the poorest and most marginalised. ""While tackling poverty and funding cuts are in the review report, it needs to be unequivocal in asking government to act on poverty and structural underfunding of preventive and universal services, which is increasing demand on social services and inequalities between areas."" The Independent Children's Homes Association said it was ""stunned"" at the review's call for ""the destruction of more than 30 years in the children's social care sector, work that has produced one of the leading care systems in the world, while demonstrating an alarming lack of knowledge of the sector, poor examination of evidence, and misleading interpretation of critical data"".

"Monkeypox detected in three more countriesScientists are still unsure what is causing the outbreak, which has now spread to 15 countries.","Israel, Switzerland and Austria are the latest countries to confirm cases of monkeypox, bringing the total number of nations reporting outbreaks to 15. Israel and Switzerland both said they identified one infected person who had recently travelled abroad. Israel is investigating other suspected cases. Monkeypox does not tend to spread easily between people and the illness is usually mild. The virus is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa. More than 80 cases have been confirmed in the recent outbreak in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. This outbreak has taken scientists by surprise, but the risk to the wider public is said to be low. Most people who catch the virus recover within a few weeks, according tothe UK's National Health Service,external. EXPLAINER:What is monkeypox? ANALYSIS:Time to worry or one to ignore? The World Health Organization has said a number of other suspected cases are being investigated - without naming the countries involved - and warned that more infections are likely to be confirmed. Asked about the outbreak as he finished a visit to South Korea, US President Joe Biden said that if the virus were to spread more widely it would be ""consequential"", adding that ""it is something that everybody should be concerned about"". He said the US was ""working hard"" on its response and what vaccines in might use. After the outbreak was first identified in the UK, the virus began to be detected across Europe - with public health agencies in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden all confirming cases. The UK Health Security Agency has identified 20 cases so far and its chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis."" She said the virus is now spreading in the community - with cases detected which have no contact with anyone who has visited West Africa, where the disease is endemic. But the risk to the general population remains ""extremely low"", with cases so far mostly found in some urban areas and among gay or bisexual men, Dr Hopkins said. Although there is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, several countries have said they are stocking smallpox vaccines, which are about 85% effective in preventing infection because the two viruses are quite similar. In a statement on Friday,external, the WHO said that the recent outbreaks were unusual in that they were occurring in countries where the disease was not endemic. It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is that the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation is that the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. The WHO's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has warned that ""transmission could accelerate"" during the summer season, as people gather for festivals and parties. In addition to the European cases, Australia has confirmed that one man who had travelled to the UK contracted the virus. In North America,health authorities in the US state of Massachusetts,externalsaid one man who recently travelled to Canada had tested positive for the virus. Canada's Public Health Agency said it had identifiedtwo cases in Quebec,external, but said it was not clear if the US traveller had been infected before or during his visit to Montreal.

"Against thud of artillery, Ukraine's miners struggle on","Imagine being a coal miner, descending into a deep, ageing, rickety mineshaft. Then imagine doing that in a war zone. ""It's scary, but what can you do? We don't have many other options,"" said Ukrainian nurse Ira Yusko, 30, smiling grimly, as she switched on her headlamp at the Toretsk coal mine in the eastern Donbas region. Around her, more than a dozen miners - their faces already smeared with grime - shuffled forwards in the dark towards a rattling iron elevator that stood waiting to take the group 800 metres underground for a six-hour shift. ""We try to be positive. But it's hard on the soul. Depressing. These are terrible times. It's sad at home too - my wife is gone,"" said Vitaly Vahorder. He's spent half his life working at the Toretsk mine. His family recently joined the exodus heading west to safer locations. Outside, the occasional boom and crunch of artillery fire echoed across the wheat fields from the front lines 4km to the east and south, where Russian troops are struggling to gain ground against fierce Ukrainian resistance in Donbas. ""People go down the mine knowing they may not come back up. And when you do come back up, anything can happen - the town is constantly being bombed,"" said Anatoly Sholokhov, deputy head of Toretsk's coal miners' association, as he watched the elevator door slide shut. The 69-year-old miner was born in the town and was once its mayor. After years of conflict, most of eastern Ukraine's mines have been forced to close The coal mines, their steep-sided slag heaps dotting the horizon like dark pyramids, have been a defining feature of eastern Ukraine for well over a century. They provided the Russian Empire, and then the Soviet Union, with much of its raw energy. But the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the past eight years of separatist conflict with pro-Russian militias, and the Kremlin's new offensive have combined to force most of the mines to close. One of many concerns today is that the latest mine closures are happening abruptly, and without proper safety measures, causing old shafts to flood with highly toxic water that threatens to poison local rivers. ""The danger comes when you stop several mines at once,"" said Anatoly. ""You can't control where the ground water goes. It would be a disaster if it comes to the surface. This whole area would become uninhabitable. So, an ecological crisis looms over our town. May God prevent these mines from stopping. If the work stops and water begins to flood the mines, it could cause a catastrophe,"" Only two mines are still working here in Toretsk - formerly called Dzerzhynsk in honour of the founder of the Communist secret police. The front lines are just four miles from the mine Driving in from the west, past Ukrainian army checkpoints and roadblocks and into the near-empty town with its Soviet-era architecture and monuments, is like stepping back into the past. A Soviet red star still clings to the top of one of the oldest towers at the Toretsk mine, which first began producing coal in the 1930s, and was badly damaged during World War Two. The mine appears to have experienced few improvements, or even licks of paint, since it was refurbished in 1955. One sunny morning last week, staff showed visitors around the site. Giant pieces of rusting machinery sat beside doodle-like swirls of rail track, where a lone female worker was busy pushing mine carts into a wooden shed by hand. Two giant slag heaps behind the mine were partially covered with trees and undergrowth. A huge tree grew through one ancient winding wheel. Overhead, floorboards creaked ominously as staff walked along a footbridge from the shaft back to the communal shower block - currently without water, like the rest of the town, due to blockages on a nearby canal which locals blamed on the war. Only a third of the mine's staff remain since the Russian offensive began ""There's no water anywhere in this town. You go to the toilet - but how do you flush? When it rains, everyone in our apartment block goes out to collect rainwater,"" said Vitaly. Only a third of the mine's staff have stayed on in the town since the Russian offensive began earlier this year - some out of loyalty to the mine itself, but mostly for financial reasons. ""I've been working here for twenty years. I went straight to the mines after school. We don't have any other professions here. No factories. We earn 8,000 to 10,000 hryvnias a month (Â£220 - Â£275, $275 - $343) and with the current prices that's nothing, tiny, no better than a student's stipend,"" said Yuri Podlutsky. As a group, the miners appeared reluctant to pass judgement on the war or President Putin directly. Many of them are Russian-speaking and appeared keen to avoid territory that could cause frictions within a tight-knit community. But several men acknowledged a strong nostalgia for the Soviet era and the times when Ukrainians and Russians worked side by side in the mines. ""Whether you want Putin or not, we still need to live and work. There are a lot of 'Soviets' here,"" said Vitaly. ""I consider myself simply a local. Some of us speak Russian as our first language. But we all share the same sky.""

We'll be back on Monday morning Ukraine time. You can find all our most recent coverage of the war on our website. The Polish leader was given a standing ovation for his address in Ukraine's parliament Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a snapshot of the day's headlines. Oleksandr Zinchenko draped the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy After winning the English Premier League title for the fourth time with his club Manchester City, Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko has said he found it hard to even think about football after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Speaking to Sky Sports after draping the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy, an emotional Zinchenko called it an unforgettable moment. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian,"" he said. ""I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine, for all Ukrainian people, because they deserve it."" Zinchenko said the time since the invasion began was the ""toughest period in my life"". In an interview with BBC Sport's Gary Linekersoon after the start of the war, the Manchester City defender said he could not count the number of times he had cried since Russia's invasion began. Lithuania is no longer importing energy from Russia as of today. Its energy minister said purchases of gas, oil and electricity from Moscow were stopping to show ""solidarity"" with Ukraine - and to cut funding for the ""Russian war machine"". He hoped electricity demands could be met through local green energy production instead. Lithuania, a former Soviet state and a Nato member, is a strong ally of Ukraine. Despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to provide fuel to many European countries. However, Finland's gas supply was cut off yesterday after it refused Moscow's demand to pay in roubles. The port city's been largely destroyed by Russian shelling People are being deported from Mariupol to other Russian-held territory at a faster and faster rate, according to a mayoral adviser in the fallen port city. Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram app that 313 Mariupol residents were taken away to a so-called ""filtration camp"" in Russian-occupied Bezimenne on Saturday. 55 of them were children. Andryushchenko said many of those being taken to camps were later being sent to Russia itself. The BBC has not been able confirmed the claims, and Russia has previously denied any forced deportations. Mariupol is now under total Russian control after its last defenders surrendered at an industrial plant on Friday. New pictures from the Reuters news agency have given a flavour of life for Ukraine's military personnel. Soldiers are seen performing exercises or taking breaks. The photos were taken in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east - the focus of fierce fighting. An update now on Andriy Shevchyk, the man installed by Russia as the mayor of occupied Enerhodar. Shevchyk is now in intensive care after being injured in an explosion, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reports. No further details were available. Earlier we reported thatShevchyk and his bodyguards were hurtin what appeared to be a ""precise and targeted attack"", according to the city's elected mayor - who was ousted from power by the Russians. James FitzGeraldBBC News The Luhansk regional governor blamed Russian 'orcs' for destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has accused Russian ""orcs"" of destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, amid fierce fighting in the area. Serhiy Haidai is just the latest Ukrainian official to compare Russian troops to a type of mythical monster popularised by JRR
Tolkienâs book The Lord of the Rings. In the epic novel, orcs are seen as âbrutal, aggressive
and chaoticâ says Ostap Slyvynsky, an associate
professor at Lviv University specialising in the literature of east-central
Europe. Some Ukrainians even call Russia itself
âMordorâ â alluding to a dark land in Tolkienâs fantasy. The images give Ukrainians an easy-to-understand metaphor for what's going on in real life. ""The fantasy world has a
very clear accent on what is good and what is bad,"" Slyvynsky explains. âThese terms are kind of euphemisms,â he adds. âIt is better to call Russians âorcsâ than more vulgar words.â The trend emerged some time after 2014 - the year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed
separatists seized parts of the eastern Donbas region. As for the Russians: they've been labelling Ukrainians âelvesâ - another Tolkien allusion - in the belief that those fictional beings embody weakness, Slyvynsky says. Adam EastonReporting from Warsaw The Polish president has delivered a message of strong support for Ukraine during the first address in person by a foreign leader to the parliament in Kyiv since the Russian invasion began. During his speech Andrzej Duda thanked Ukraine for defending Europe against what he called âRussian imperialismâ. âThe free worldâ, he said, âhas the face of Ukraineâ. Duda said recent calls for Kyiv to negotiate with President Putin, and even give into some of his demands, were disturbing. No decisions about your future will be made without you, he said. Poland has been one of Ukraineâs staunchest supporters, taking in millions of refugees fleeing the fighting and sending tanks and rocket launchers to the Ukrainian military. Duda, who received a standing ovation after his speech, said Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the European Union. An exhibition of destroyed Russian tanks is proving popular with the public in Kyiv. The vehicles have gone on show at Mykhailivska Square. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine have met in Kyiv today Polish citizens living in Ukraine are to be
granted the same rights that Ukrainian refugees in Poland are
currently receiving. Ukraine's President Zelensky announced the plan during a visit from his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. A bill will be tabled in parliament to make the changes happen. Poland has granted the right to live, work and claim
social security payments to more than three million Ukrainian refugees
who've fled Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill banning symbols of the Russian invasion, including those containing the letters Z and V, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram. Zheleznyak noted that the document included President Zelensky's proposals, which he submitted when he vetoed the previous draft law passed on 14 April. The new version of the law widens the range of cases when the display of the symbols is allowed, namely in museums, libraries, scientific works, textbooks and so on, according to our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. The new bill, however, bans the creation of NGOs which use Russian war symbols and whose activities are aimed at spreading war propaganda and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The letters ""Z"" and ""V"", which don't exist in the Russian alphabet, have been widely used to symbolise support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are used to mark Russian military vehicles on the battlefield. A bid by Ukraine to join the EU could not be finalised for ""15 or 20 years,"" France's minister for European affairs has said. Speaking on Radio J in Paris, Clement Beaune said: ""We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying. ""It's probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time."" His comments poured cold water on Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes for expedited entry to the bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion. Beaune repeated French President Emmanuel Macron's offer to create a looser ""European political community"" that could help integrate Ukraine sooner, adding: ""I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies."" Zelensky has turned down what he called ""such compromises"" and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. Beaune said Macron's proposal is not ""an alternative to joining the European political community"", emphasising: ""It doesn't prevent membership later on."" Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and Nato are seen as the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Macron's European political community initiative is due to be debated at an EU summit in June. Ukraine has extended martial law for three months until 23 August. President Volodymyr Zelensky first signed the decree, along with a general military mobilisation call, on 24 February and since then has extended it for a month on two occasions. Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region. Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"". Poland's President Andrzej Duda meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv If you're just joining us, here's a look at the main news from the war in Ukraine so far today: Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukraine remains vulnerable to aerial strikes Military and financial support from Western
countries is increasingly making a difference. At the start of the war, President Zelensky was saying they
needed more and they needed it faster. But his position has gradually shifted, to acknowledge that the Ukrainians are getting the support they need with the urgency they
need. The big missing piece in the puzzle is still air defences. A statement yesterday from the Russians
- saying theyâd destroyed a big shipment of military aid â shows Ukraine is
still not getting the latest in air defence systems. On every other front, I think the support is starting to
come through. Iâve seen modern Western equipment being sent to the front lines. They are always going to need more though, especially
given the increased Russian pushes weâve been seeing. Andriy Shevchyk, a mayor installed by Russia in the occupied city of Enerhodar, has reportedly been injured in an explosion. The city's elected mayor Dmytro Orlov - who is currently in nearby Zaporizhzhia - wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Shevchyk and his bodyguards had been taken to hospital after being wounded. Orlov noted that the circumstances were still being established. He added that nobody else had been hurt in the blast - suggesting this had been a ""precise and targeted attack"". There was no immediate comment from the Russian side. Enerhodar, a city of about 50,000 people which serves Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine embraced in the chamber earlier today ""Only Ukraine has the right to
decide its future"", the Polish president has said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. Andrzej Duda said ""worrying voices"" were suggesting Ukraine should give in to Russia's President Putin, according to comments quoted by the Reuters news agency. He told lawmakers that those voices should not be heeded - because ceding even an inch of Ukrainian territory would be a blow to the whole West. Duda also reportedly stressed that Poland supported Ukraine in its bid to gain full membership of the European Union - a matter on which EU countries have not reached a consensus. He was the first foreign leader to give an in-person speech to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia invaded on 24 February. Photos posted on Twitter by Duda's office showed him receiving a standing ovation in parliament and embracing Zelensky. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, according to an update from the Russian defence ministry. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points, 13 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment were amassed, as well as four ammunition depots in the Donbas region, the Reuters news agency reported. In Ukraine's southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets hit a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, around 100km northeast of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said.

Rail unions vow to fight government strike threat,"Rail unions have reacted with fury to a government threat to make strike action illegal unless a minimum number of train staff work during a walkout. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said a law would protect freight shipments of goods such as food and fuel. But unions vowed ""fierce resistance"" to any curb on the right to strike, calling the move ""authoritarian"" and ""desperate nonsense"". Some 40,000 rail workers are being balloted over taking industrial action. The ballot of National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) members closes on Tuesday and the results are likely to be known the following day. The RMT claims that the strike - involving members of 15 train operating companies and Network Rail - could be the biggest ""in modern history"" and bring the country ""to a standstill"". Mr Shappstold The Sunday Telegraph,externalthat unions were using strikes as a first resort rather than a last measure. He cited a promise thatthe Conservative Party made in its 2019 manifesto,externalthat it ""will require that a minimum service operates during transport strikes"". He told the newspaper: ""We had a pledge in there about minimum service levels. If they really got to that point then minimum service levels would be a way to work towards protecting those freight routes and those sorts of things. ""We very much hope they will wake up and smell the coffee."" However, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said ""any attempt"" by Mr Shapps to ""make effective strike action illegal on the railways will be met with the fiercest resistance from RMT and the wider trade union movement"". He was joined by Unite general secretary Sharon Graham who said the union ""will confront head-on and by whatever means necessary, any further attacks on the right to strike"". She called it ""a cynical, authoritarian move"", adding: ""A worker's right to withdraw their labour is inalienable in any democracy worth its name."" Meanwhile, Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, said: ""What we are seeing here is desperate nonsense from the Tories who have chosen to attack working people in our union who kept the railways running every single day of the pandemic."" In its manifesto, the Conservatives said: ""Rail workers deserve a fair deal, but it is not fair to let the trade unions undermine the livelihoods of others."" The RMT said the strike is over pay, terms and conditions as well as planned job cuts. It said its members are facing  ""pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions"". Network Rail plans to shed 2,500 maintenance jobs in order to make Â£2bn worth of savings. Network Rail - which maintains the railways and carries out vital functions such as signalling - has not been involved in a national strike since 1994. There are concerns a walkout by its workers could affect both passengers and the movement of goods by train, such as fuel and food. Although rail makes up a relatively small proportion of all freight, this has been increasing because of the lorry driver shortage, and environmental considerations.

"LiveLiveOnly diplomacy can end Ukraine war, says Zelensky1 minute ago","Polandâs president has given the first address in person by a foreign leader to the Ukrainian parliament since the Russian invasion began Andrzej Duda received a standing ovation after he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future Earlier, the Ukrainian government said Kyiv would not agree a ceasefire deal with Moscow that involved giving away any territory Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, said making concessions would result in Moscow starting an even larger, more bloody offensive in the longer term Russian forces have continued their attacks on the eastern Donbas region following their capture of Mariupol They are said to have made limited advances towards Severodonetsk â where it is thought they are planning a new siege Edited by Ben Tobias We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for a few hours. We'll be back on Monday morning Ukraine time. You can find all our most recent coverage of the war on our website. The Polish leader was given a standing ovation for his address in Ukraine's parliament Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a snapshot of the day's headlines. Oleksandr Zinchenko draped the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy After winning the English Premier League title for the fourth time with his club Manchester City, Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko has said he found it hard to even think about football after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Speaking to Sky Sports after draping the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy, an emotional Zinchenko called it an unforgettable moment. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian,"" he said. ""I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine, for all Ukrainian people, because they deserve it."" Zinchenko said the time since the invasion began was the ""toughest period in my life"". In an interview with BBC Sport's Gary Linekersoon after the start of the war, the Manchester City defender said he could not count the number of times he had cried since Russia's invasion began. Lithuania is no longer importing energy from Russia as of today. Its energy minister said purchases of gas, oil and electricity from Moscow were stopping to show ""solidarity"" with Ukraine - and to cut funding for the ""Russian war machine"". He hoped electricity demands could be met through local green energy production instead. Lithuania, a former Soviet state and a Nato member, is a strong ally of Ukraine. Despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to provide fuel to many European countries. However, Finland's gas supply was cut off yesterday after it refused Moscow's demand to pay in roubles. The port city's been largely destroyed by Russian shelling People are being deported from Mariupol to other Russian-held territory at a faster and faster rate, according to a mayoral adviser in the fallen port city. Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram app that 313 Mariupol residents were taken away to a so-called ""filtration camp"" in Russian-occupied Bezimenne on Saturday. 55 of them were children. Andryushchenko said many of those being taken to camps were later being sent to Russia itself. The BBC has not been able confirmed the claims, and Russia has previously denied any forced deportations. Mariupol is now under total Russian control after its last defenders surrendered at an industrial plant on Friday. New pictures from the Reuters news agency have given a flavour of life for Ukraine's military personnel. Soldiers are seen performing exercises or taking breaks. The photos were taken in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east - the focus of fierce fighting. An update now on Andriy Shevchyk, the man installed by Russia as the mayor of occupied Enerhodar. Shevchyk is now in intensive care after being injured in an explosion, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reports. No further details were available. Earlier we reported thatShevchyk and his bodyguards were hurtin what appeared to be a ""precise and targeted attack"", according to the city's elected mayor - who was ousted from power by the Russians. James FitzGeraldBBC News The Luhansk regional governor blamed Russian 'orcs' for destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has accused Russian ""orcs"" of destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, amid fierce fighting in the area. Serhiy Haidai is just the latest Ukrainian official to compare Russian troops to a type of mythical monster popularised by JRR
Tolkienâs book The Lord of the Rings. In the epic novel, orcs are seen as âbrutal, aggressive
and chaoticâ says Ostap Slyvynsky, an associate
professor at Lviv University specialising in the literature of east-central
Europe. Some Ukrainians even call Russia itself
âMordorâ â alluding to a dark land in Tolkienâs fantasy. The images give Ukrainians an easy-to-understand metaphor for what's going on in real life. ""The fantasy world has a
very clear accent on what is good and what is bad,"" Slyvynsky explains. âThese terms are kind of euphemisms,â he adds. âIt is better to call Russians âorcsâ than more vulgar words.â The trend emerged some time after 2014 - the year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed
separatists seized parts of the eastern Donbas region. As for the Russians: they've been labelling Ukrainians âelvesâ - another Tolkien allusion - in the belief that those fictional beings embody weakness, Slyvynsky says. Adam EastonReporting from Warsaw The Polish president has delivered a message of strong support for Ukraine during the first address in person by a foreign leader to the parliament in Kyiv since the Russian invasion began. During his speech Andrzej Duda thanked Ukraine for defending Europe against what he called âRussian imperialismâ. âThe free worldâ, he said, âhas the face of Ukraineâ. Duda said recent calls for Kyiv to negotiate with President Putin, and even give into some of his demands, were disturbing. No decisions about your future will be made without you, he said. Poland has been one of Ukraineâs staunchest supporters, taking in millions of refugees fleeing the fighting and sending tanks and rocket launchers to the Ukrainian military. Duda, who received a standing ovation after his speech, said Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the European Union. An exhibition of destroyed Russian tanks is proving popular with the public in Kyiv. The vehicles have gone on show at Mykhailivska Square. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine have met in Kyiv today Polish citizens living in Ukraine are to be
granted the same rights that Ukrainian refugees in Poland are
currently receiving. Ukraine's President Zelensky announced the plan during a visit from his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. A bill will be tabled in parliament to make the changes happen. Poland has granted the right to live, work and claim
social security payments to more than three million Ukrainian refugees
who've fled Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill banning symbols of the Russian invasion, including those containing the letters Z and V, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram. Zheleznyak noted that the document included President Zelensky's proposals, which he submitted when he vetoed the previous draft law passed on 14 April. The new version of the law widens the range of cases when the display of the symbols is allowed, namely in museums, libraries, scientific works, textbooks and so on, according to our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. The new bill, however, bans the creation of NGOs which use Russian war symbols and whose activities are aimed at spreading war propaganda and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The letters ""Z"" and ""V"", which don't exist in the Russian alphabet, have been widely used to symbolise support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are used to mark Russian military vehicles on the battlefield. A bid by Ukraine to join the EU could not be finalised for ""15 or 20 years,"" France's minister for European affairs has said. Speaking on Radio J in Paris, Clement Beaune said: ""We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying. ""It's probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time."" His comments poured cold water on Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes for expedited entry to the bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion. Beaune repeated French President Emmanuel Macron's offer to create a looser ""European political community"" that could help integrate Ukraine sooner, adding: ""I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies."" Zelensky has turned down what he called ""such compromises"" and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. Beaune said Macron's proposal is not ""an alternative to joining the European political community"", emphasising: ""It doesn't prevent membership later on."" Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and Nato are seen as the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Macron's European political community initiative is due to be debated at an EU summit in June. Ukraine has extended martial law for three months until 23 August. President Volodymyr Zelensky first signed the decree, along with a general military mobilisation call, on 24 February and since then has extended it for a month on two occasions. Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region. Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"". Poland's President Andrzej Duda meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv If you're just joining us, here's a look at the main news from the war in Ukraine so far today: Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukraine remains vulnerable to aerial strikes Military and financial support from Western
countries is increasingly making a difference. At the start of the war, President Zelensky was saying they
needed more and they needed it faster. But his position has gradually shifted, to acknowledge that the Ukrainians are getting the support they need with the urgency they
need. The big missing piece in the puzzle is still air defences. A statement yesterday from the Russians
- saying theyâd destroyed a big shipment of military aid â shows Ukraine is
still not getting the latest in air defence systems. On every other front, I think the support is starting to
come through. Iâve seen modern Western equipment being sent to the front lines. They are always going to need more though, especially
given the increased Russian pushes weâve been seeing. Andriy Shevchyk, a mayor installed by Russia in the occupied city of Enerhodar, has reportedly been injured in an explosion. The city's elected mayor Dmytro Orlov - who is currently in nearby Zaporizhzhia - wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Shevchyk and his bodyguards had been taken to hospital after being wounded. Orlov noted that the circumstances were still being established. He added that nobody else had been hurt in the blast - suggesting this had been a ""precise and targeted attack"". There was no immediate comment from the Russian side. Enerhodar, a city of about 50,000 people which serves Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine embraced in the chamber earlier today ""Only Ukraine has the right to
decide its future"", the Polish president has said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. Andrzej Duda said ""worrying voices"" were suggesting Ukraine should give in to Russia's President Putin, according to comments quoted by the Reuters news agency. He told lawmakers that those voices should not be heeded - because ceding even an inch of Ukrainian territory would be a blow to the whole West. Duda also reportedly stressed that Poland supported Ukraine in its bid to gain full membership of the European Union - a matter on which EU countries have not reached a consensus. He was the first foreign leader to give an in-person speech to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia invaded on 24 February. Photos posted on Twitter by Duda's office showed him receiving a standing ovation in parliament and embracing Zelensky. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, according to an update from the Russian defence ministry. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points, 13 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment were amassed, as well as four ammunition depots in the Donbas region, the Reuters news agency reported. In Ukraine's southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets hit a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, around 100km northeast of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said.

""I want to bring Australia together. I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity, and not fear or division,""  said the 59-year-old veteran politician who has led Labor back to power after nearly a decade. Here's a recap of the day's biggest takeaways:  This live page was brought to you by Rebecca Seales, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Zubaidah Abdul Jalil and Aparna Alluri in Singapore, Jay Savage, Tiffanie Turnbull, Isabelle Rodd and Frances Mao in Sydney, Kirstan Ross in Melbourne, Zoe Kean in Hobart, and Tiffany Wertheimer in London. Thank you for joining us! As the day comes to an end, here's a look at some of the millions of Australians who cast their ballots today to elect a new government. Voters pose with their pooch outside a polling station in Melbourne A man votes at Bondi Beach, Sydney, wearing a pair of Speedos - what Australians affectionately call ""budgie smugglers"" Two year-old Lexi enjoys a ""democracy sausage"" - a staunch Australian tradition - after her parents voted in Dickson, Brisbane Brisbane voters wait in the rain to cast their ballots Peter Power enjoys a sausage sizzle after voting in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, with his dogs Lily and Dancer in tow Simon AtkinsonBBC News The first couple of days in a new job are often pretty cruisy right? Get set up on your email, find out where the stationery is kept, maybe discover what to do if there's a fire. But Anthony Albanese has got a more intense start. He will need to be sworn in as Prime Minister pretty quickly - perhaps as soon as Sunday. Because on Monday he will fly to Tokyo for the Quad leader's meeting with US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. France's outgoing Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said Scott Morrison's defeat at the polls on Saturday ""suits me fine"". There has been a political rift between the two countries since Australia scrapped a $37bn (Â£27bn) submarine deal with France last year, and instead made a new pact with the US and UK - so-called Aukus.  The move enraged French President Emmanuel Macron,who famously accused Mr Morrison of lying to him. ""The prime minister's defeat suits me fine,"" Mr Le Drian was quoted by AFP as saying. ""I hope we can resume frank and constructive dialogue with Australia in the future."" Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Less than half an hour after becoming Australiaâs
prime minister-elect, Anthony Albanese faced his first major challenge - being ""doorstepped"" by the BBC. For a man so new to the job of running Australia,
he was surprisingly quick to talk about international policy, saying he was a
huge supporter of theAukus defence alliancebetween Australia, the UK and the
US. Mr Albanese also said that he wanted to follow in
the UKâs footsteps in being a climate action leader. Anthony Albanese with his beloved dog Toto Anthony Albanese is set to become Australia's next prime minister after leading the Labor Party to its first election victory in almost a decade. One of the country's longest-serving politicians, he promised voters ""safe change"" as he worked to kick out the conservative Liberal-National coalition which has been in power since 2013. Where ousted Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a self-described ""bulldozer"", Mr Albanese vows to be a ""builder"". After the pandemic, which saw Australian states cut off from each other and cities splintered by strict lockdowns, fostering unity is a top priority for the new leader. So who is Albo? Mr Albanese has earned a reputation as a defender of Australia's free healthcare system, an advocate for the LGBT community, a republican, and a passionate rugby league fan. The 59-year-old - nicknamed Albo - was raised in social housing by a single mother on a disability pension. He has often cited his upbringing as the foundation for his progressive beliefs. Read more here. Going into the election, all signs indicated incumbent PM Scott Morrison was in trouble. His tenure has been dominated by disasters and the pandemic, but also by his governmentâs many scandals. There was the ill-timed holiday to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia and the way his government treated women and handled sexual harassment claims. His character has also come under fire, from members of his own party and even the French President who accused him of lying. Last election he was dubbed a ""miracle-worker"" for pulling off an unexpected victory. So how did things go so wrong for ScoMo?Read more here. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney Every sentence Anthony Albanese delivered at Labor HQ was met with rapturous applause. Whether it was a commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, making Australia the leader in renewable energy as part of a major shift in climate policy, or protecting the minimum wages of young workers to make sure they  kept up with inflation - with his call for optimism, not fear, Anthony Albanese outlined a different vision for Australia from the one projected by Scott Morrison. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. ""I look forward to working with you as we reap the rewards of our comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, the AUKUS partnership and the unmatched closeness between the British and Australian people,"" he wrote. More from Anthony Albanese's speech. The incoming PM preached a message of unity and hope, saying he wanted to ""bring Australians together"". ""I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and optimism, not fear and division. It is a show of strength to collaborate and work with people, not weakness."" He also urged Australians to seize opportunities ""to shape change, rather than be shaped by it"", and said that together the country could ""end the climate wars"", become a renewable energy ""superpower"", as well as strengthen the economy, healthcare, and childcare. He also promised to establish a national anti-corruption commission, and reaffirmed his commitment to womens and Indigenous people's rights. He ended his speech thanking his party colleagues, campaign team, family, and finally his mum who is ""beaming down on us"". ""I hope there are families in public housing watching this tonight. Because I want every parent to be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in Australia the doors of opportunity are open to us all."" Peter Dutton has scraped through in his Queensland seat of Dickson, paving the way for him to become the next Liberal Party leader after Scott Morrison's resignation. If he does put his hand up, it'll be Mr Dutton's second tilt at the top job. He unsuccessfully challenged then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018 after a dispute over energy policy. But it was Scott Morrison who ultimately won the party room support to replace Mr Turnbull. Mr Dutton - from the party's right faction - has been a controversial figure, and there are questions over whether he'll be able to win back support that the party lost in more progressive, metropolitan seats. Incoming Prime Minister Albanese said that PM Scott Morrison had in an earlier phone call ""very graciously wished me well"". ""I thanked him for that and I wish him well. And I thank him for the service that he has given to our country as Prime Minister."" Albanese went on to refer to his own humble beginnings as the ""son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing"". ""I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars. I want Australia to continue to be acountry that no matter where you live, who you worship, who you love or what your last name is, that places no restrictions on your journey in life."" At this point Albanese was drowned out by repeated cheering and chants of his name, to which he jokingly responded: ""I know at the beginning of the campaign they said people didn't know me but I reckon they've got [the name by now].... Can we have a bit of order? I intend to run an orderly government and it starts here, so behave."" Anthony Albanese, Australia's next prime minister, has just arrived at Labor's party headquarters to thunderous applause and cheers. He began his speech thanking Australians ""for this extraordinary honour"". ""Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. I am humbled by this victory and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia. ""My Labor team will work every day to bring Australians together. And I will lead a government worthy of the people of Australia. A government as courageous and hard working and caring as the Australian people are themselves."" Australia's Treasurer and Liberal party member Josh Frydenberg has acknowledged it will be difficult to hold onto his Kooyong seat in Melbourne, as independent ""teal"" candidate Monique Ryan looks set to win. Kooyong has long been a Liberal seat, and this will mark a shock loss to a complete political newcomer. Frydenberg will also become one of the highest-ranking cabinet ministers to ever be voted out. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" Frydenberg told supporters in a televised speech. His mood was markedly different earlier today when he posed for pictures with voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The first Indigenous person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to serve as a minister has lost his seat. Ken Wyatt's seat of Hasluck has fallen to Labor as the Liberal Party suffer a massive swing against them in the state of Western Australia. Mr Wyatt - who has Noongar, Yamatji and Wongi heritage - was elected in 2010, and became the Assistant Minister for Health in 2015. He's held a number of portfolios since then, and in 2019 become the first Aboriginal person to be the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Liberal colleague Senator Simon Birmingham said his defeat is a huge loss for the parliament. ""While there are many colleagues I would grieve for tonight, it is important that we note the historic contribution that Ken Wyatt made to the parliament, as an Indigenous Australian, to serve at the highest levels of office,"" he said. ""We pay tribute to him tonight.""  Ken Wyatt was elected in 2010 Anthony Albanese will be Australia's next PM, but Scott Morrison's Liberal-National coalition appears to be in the lead on first-preference votes (see the chart below). Why is that? It's because Australia uses a preferential voting system - each ballot is numbered by voters from their most to least preferred. Candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated, but votes for them are still counted - theyâre re-distributed to the next preference listed on each ballot. The process is repeated until only two candidates are left, and the person with the majority is declared the winner. So under preferential voting, many of the Greens votes, for instance, are likely to move to Labor - as those voters are likely to have preferenced Labor above the Liberals. Nationally, networks are projecting that just over half the first-preference vote will go to Labor. Morrison took to the stage amid chants of ""Scomo, Scomo"" More on Morrison's concession speech - he said he was quitting as the leader of the Liberals, following their unsuccessful outing at the polls. Morrison, who led the country through bushfires and a pandemic, also gave thanks for ""the miracle of the Australian people"". ""What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,"" he said. ""It has been the Australian people under the strong support of a strong government that's enabled all of us to come through to where we are today, and that's something that all Australians can give thanks for as 
we move forward.â He added that his party was handing over a country that was ""in a stronger position... than we inherited it when we came to government those years ago under Tony Abbott"". âWe leave government having secured our borders many years ago. And we leave government 

having restored our nation's defences.â A huge roar - the biggest of the night - erupted as Morrison ended his speech saying he ""looks ahead to victory"" in the next election, reports the BBC's Phil Mercer who was at the scene. Morrison was mobbed by television crews as he left the stage. Scott Morrison has just arrived at his Liberal party's headquarters and has conceded defeat to Labor's Anthony Albanese. He congratulated Albanese on his election success, and adds: ""This has been a time of great upheaval."" ""It is important for our nation to heal"" from disruption, he adds. The BBC's Phil Mercer who is at the scene says that a crowd of several hundred people, including former PM John Howard, had stayed behind to listen to Mr Morrison's speech. But the mood is not funereal, with free-flowing beer and wine keeping spirits up. It's hugs and cheers all round for Labor supporters this evening, as the party is set to form the country's new government. This is the first time Labor has come to power in almost a decade. Supporters were crossing their fingers for a win... ...then began to cheer as the results started coming in... ...and broke out in chants for ""Albo"" as networks called a Labor win. Labor's Sally Sitou was half-way through her victory speech when her supporters realised the party had won - and they broke out in cheers. Labor is still four seats short of the 76-mark for a majorty government, but that could change in the coming hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
