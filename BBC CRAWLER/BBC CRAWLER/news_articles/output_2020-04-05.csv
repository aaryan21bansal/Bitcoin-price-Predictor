Tech firms summoned over 'crackpot' 5G conspiraciesGovernment will tell social media firms to take down posts more quickly after attacks on masts.,"The culture secretary is to order social media companies to be more aggressive in their response to conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the coronavirus pandemic. Oliver Dowden plans to hold virtual meetings with representatives from several tech firms next week to discuss the matter. It follows a number of 5G masts apparently being set on fire. The issue will test the companies' commitments to free speech. Earlier in the week, blazes were reported at masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling in Merseyside. A spokesman for Vodafone's mobile network told the BBC there had been a total of four further incidents over the past 24 hours at both its own sites and those shared with O2, but did not identify the locations. ""We have received several reports of criminal damage to phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online,"" a spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport told the BBC. ""Those responsible for criminal acts will face the full force of the law. ""We must also see social media companies acting responsibly and taking much swifter action to stop nonsense spreading on their platforms which encourages such acts."" DCMS has yet to confirm which tech companies are being summoned. False theories are being spread on smaller platforms such as Nextdoor, Pinterest and the petitions site Change.org as well as larger ones including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. Scientists have said the idea of a connectionbetween Covid-19 and 5G is ""complete rubbish"" and biologically impossible. Several of the platforms have already taken steps to address the problem but have not banned discussion of the subject outright. Pinterest, for example, limits its search results for coronavirus and related terms to showing pinned information from recognised health organisations but does not have a comparable restriction for 5G. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Facebook said it had also removed a number of groups that were encouraging attacks on 5G masts. However, a post entitled ""burn baby burn - it's begun"", which accompanied videos of telecoms equipment ablaze, was only taken down about six hours after it was flagged to the company's press office. YouTube bans some types of bogus posts about Covid-19, but classes conspiracy theories linking the virus to 5G as ""borderline content"". As a result, it said it tries to reduce the frequency its algorithms recommend them, but does not delete the videos from its platform. A spokeswoman for the Google-owned service said it intended to ""evaluate the impact"" of this approach. It did, however, remove one video flagged by the BBC that featured threatening language. Change.org said its open nature allowed anyone to set up a petition about any issue they cared about, but added they must comply with its guidelines to stay online. ""We have removed a number of petitions making unsubstantiated health claims about 5G from the platform,"" a spokeswoman added. Vodafone has said the attacks are ""now a matter of national security"". ""It beggars belief that some people should want to harm the very networks that are providing essential connectivity to the emergency services, the NHS, and rest of the country during this difficult lockdown period,"" wrote UK chief executive Nick Jeffery. ""It also makes me angry to learn that some people have been abusing our engineers as they go about their business. ""Online stories connecting the spread of coronavirus to 5G are utterly baseless. Please don't share them on social media - fake news can have serious consequences."" The GSMA - a trade body that represents the wider mobile industry - also urged social media and other content-hosting providers to ""accelerate their efforts to remove fake news"" relating to the problem. The campaign against 5G has been flourishing on social media for the last year. Facebook in particular has been full of groups claiming the technology is dangerous, with many of them also pushing anti-vaccine messages. Until recently, apart from the odd fact-checking message alongside posts, the companies have done little to combat this trend. Neither Twitter nor YouTube, for instance, has an option in their reporting systems to flag misinformation. Even on Friday, complaints to Facebook moderators about a group that appeared to encourage arson attacks on 5G masts received replies saying the page did ""not violate our community standards"" - although after the BBC contacted Facebook's press office it was taken down. In normal times, social media platforms are very reluctant to curb what they regard as an essential part of their mission: giving people the right to free expression, however outlandish or unscientific their views. But these are not normal times. The government is effectively waging a war against a deadly virus, and keyworkers looking after vital infrastructure are facing abuse, possibly inspired by these social media campaigners. That means there is now intense pressure on the likes of Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter to combat what one minister has called ""dangerous nonsense"" - and they will want to be seen to be acting responsibly, even if some of their users cry censorship.

"Player wage row a disgrace - RooneyDerby striker Wayne Rooney says the power struggle over how footballers use their wages to aid the coronavirus fight is ""a disgrace"".","Derby striker Rooney questions why footballers are being treated like ""scapegoats"" The power struggle over how Premier League footballers can financially assist in the fight against coronavirus is ""a disgrace"" and has players in a ""no-win situation"", says Wayne Rooney. Players have beenurged to do moreby health secretary Matt Hancock and the Premier Leagueproposed a 30% pay cut. The Professional Footballers' Association says thatmay harm the NHS. Derby striker Rooney says he is happy to offer support but asked: ""Why are footballers suddenly the scapegoats?"" In his Sunday Times column,,externalthe 34-year-old ex-England captain added: ""For the Premier League to just announce the proposal, as it has done, increases the pressure on players and in my opinion it is now a no-win situation: if players come out and say they can't agree or are not willing to cut by 30%, even if the real reasons are that it will financially ruin some, it will be presented as 'Rich Players Refuse Pay Cut'. ""It seemed strange to me because every other decision in this process has been kept behind closed doors, but this had to be announced publicly. ""Why? It feels as if it's to shame the players - to force them into a corner where they have to pick up the bill for lost revenue."" Furloughing staff: What have clubs done so far? Gary Lineker expects a decision on how footballers will contribute in the coming days England manager Gareth Southgate has reportedly taken a 30% pay cut, though the Football Association is yet to confirm the move. The Premier League says it wants a 30% cut in players' wages in order to ""protect employment throughout the professional game"". The PFA says the proposal would be ""detrimental to our NHS"" as it would equate to more than Â£500m in wage reductions over 12 months, and a loss in tax contributions of more than Â£200m to the UK government. Derby player-coach Rooney questioned the timing of the Premier League's proposed wage cuts when top-flight captains were already in discussions as to how they could set up a fund that would go to a charitable cause, most likely the NHS. Rooney also said the Premier League's own contribution of Â£20m to the NHS was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared to what players are being asked to give up. ""How the past few days have played out is a disgrace,"" added England's all-time leading goalscorer. ""I get that players are well paid and could give up money. But this should be getting done on a case-by-case basis. ""Clubs should be sitting down with each player and explaining what savings it needs to survive. Players would accept that. ""One player might say, 'I can afford a 30%'; another might say, 'I can only afford 5%'. ""Personally, I'd have no problem with some of us paying more. I don't think that would cause any dressing room problems. ""Whatever way you look at it, we're easy targets. What gets lost is that half our wages get taken by the taxman. Money that goes to the government, money that is helping the NHS."" Rooney questioned why ""big stars from other sports, who are able to avoid tax by living in places like Monaco"" are not being scrutinised over the financial support they are offering in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. He also criticised health secretary Hancock focusing on footballers and believes big clubs do not need players to take cuts in order to survive, adding if they did then ""football is in a far worse position than any of us imagined"". Premier League leaders Liverpool arefacing criticism from former players and fansfor joining Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich in furloughing non-playing staff. Rooney said he expects people to ""point the finger"" at him for airing his views on the pay-cut issue but wanted to ""speak up"" for players. ""At the moment it's almost a free-for-all: it's like the government, Premier League and sections of the media have set the players up to fall,"" he added. Fellow ex-England captain Gary Lineker told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show that footballers he had spoken to were ""desperately keen"" to offer help but were an ""easy"" target for criticism. ""Why not call on all the wealthy to try and help if they possibly can rather than just pick on footballers?"" the Match of the Day presenter said. ""Nobody seems to talk about the bankers, the CEOs, huge millionaires. Are they standing up? Are they being asked to stand up? We don't know. ""The problem is how you do it. It's obviously complicated and it takes time. People are always quick to jump on the judgemental high horse, certainly when it comes to footballers but lots of them do lots of really good things and I'm sure they'll continue to do so. ""Footballers do an extraordinary amount of good in the community, lots of them will already be giving in their own silent ways and I know that plans are afoot to make their contributions to society.

"Breaking|Breaking newsPM admitted to hospital over virus symptomsBoris Johnson admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus.UK","The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said. He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature. It is said to be a ""precautionary step"" taken on the advice of his doctor. The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning. Mr Johnson, 55, spent the night in hospital and is having what has been described as a series of ""routine tests"". In a statement, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. ""This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus."" She added: ""The prime minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government's advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending ""our nation's well wishes"" for Mr Johnson's ""own personal fight with the virus"". ""All Americans are praying for him. He's a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is ""a strong person"". Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished Mr Johnson well, saying he hoped for a ""speedy recovery"". The prime minister, alongside the Queen, personifies the country's public response to this pandemic. And Boris Johnson is continuing to personally experience the unpleasant reality of the virus. Downing Street officials are adamant Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government and is in contact with ministerial colleagues and civil servants. But the undeniable reality is there is nothing conventional, nothing normal about this - however routine the tests are that the prime minister is receiving. The coronavirus has repeatedly proven its capacity to turn the far-fetched into reality, over and over again. Advisers, officials and ministerial colleagues have all been forced to self-isolate. Covid-19, the illness which the virus causes, is crippling the economy, robbing us of our usual liberties - and now it is straining the personal capacity of those at the highest level of government to respond to it. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital. Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March. He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning. Also on Friday, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms. This video can not be played Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday ""I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,"" he said. ""But we're working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus."" On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she has spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference. The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms. Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if the prime minister was unwell and unable to work,Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The news of Mr Johnson's admission to hospital came shortly afterthe Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"".

Nearly 400 care groups 'face protection shortages',"This video can not be played 'It's vital we have the equipment we need to keep people safe' Almost 400 care companies which provide home support across the UK have told the BBC they still do not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE). Without protection, providers say they may not be able to care for people awaiting hospital discharge. Of 481 providers, 381 - 80% - said they did not have enough PPE to be able to support older and vulnerable people. The government said it was working ""around the clock"" to give the sector the equipment it needs. The BBC sent questions to the nearly 3,000 members of the UK Homecare Association. About a quarter of respondents said they have either run out of masks or have less than a week's supply left. LIVE UPDATES:UK to give daily briefing A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Others said they were struggling to get the gloves and aprons they needed for staff who go from one client's home to the next to support them with washing, dressing and eating. Just under a third of the home care providers the BBC heard from were looking after people with Covid-19 symptoms. Suzanne Catterall, a senior care worker at Westmorland Homecare in Cumbria, speaking after visiting the first of seven clients she would see during her day, said: ""I needed to use seven pairs of gloves on one call and an apron. ""This is due to cleaning, then doing personal care for the client, including applying three different creams, and preparing food."" Dr Chris Moss, who runs Westmorland Homecare, said they have had to get supplies of PPE from local nail bars and vets' practices. They have had some government supplies, he said, but estimated their stock would last about a week.

The Queen's broadcast in full,"I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all. I want to thank everyone on the NHS frontline, as well as care workers and those carrying out essential roles, who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all. I am sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times. I also want to thank those of you who are staying at home, thereby helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones. Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it. Jonny Dymond: Ambitious speech to reassure and inspire Queen: 'We will succeed' in fight against virus I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future. The moments when the United Kingdom has come together to applaud its care and essential workers will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit; and its symbol will be the rainbows drawn by children. Across the Commonwealth and around the world, we have seen heart-warming stories of people coming together to help others, be it through delivering food parcels and medicines, checking on neighbours, or converting businesses to help the relief effort. And though self-isolating may at times be hard, many people of all faiths, and of none, are discovering that it presents an opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect, in prayer or meditation. It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister. We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety. Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do. While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us. We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.

Nearly 400 home care groups 'have no protection',"This video can not be played 'It's vital we have the equipment we need to keep people safe' Almost 400 care companies which provide home support across the UK have told the BBC they still do not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE). Without protection, providers say they may not be able to care for people awaiting hospital discharge. Of 481 providers, 381 - 80% - said they did not have enough PPE to be able to support older and vulnerable people. The government said it was working ""around the clock"" to give the sector the equipment it needs. The BBC sent questions to the nearly 3,000 members of the UK Homecare Association.

Just under a third of the home care providers the BBC heard from were looking after people with Covid-19 symptoms. Suzanne Catterall, a senior care worker at Westmorland Homecare in Cumbria, speaking after visiting the first of seven clients she would see during her day, said: ""I needed to use seven pairs of gloves on one call and an apron. ""This is due to cleaning, then doing personal care for the client, including applying three different creams, and preparing food."" Dr Chris Moss, who runs Westmorland Homecare, said they have had to get supplies of PPE from local nail bars and vets' practices. They have had some government supplies, he said, but estimated their stock would last about a week. ""Without having it you risk transmission, you risk making more of society unwell and you put more pressure on the NHS,"" he added. And care providers warned that without the right protective equipment, they would have to make hard decisions about who they support.

Cath Kidston set to call in administrators,"Cath Kidston, the floral fashion brand, is set to file for administration as the coronavirus shutdown pushes High Street retailers to breaking point. The move will put nearly 950 jobs at risk at the company which is best-known for its brightly-coloured designs. Debenhams, the department store chain, is also expected to appoint administrators as early as this week. And reports have emerged that Topshop-owner Arcadia may walk away from the leases on some of its 550 shops. Cath Kidston confirmed that it intends to appoint advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal as administrators. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Coronavirus: New Look delays supplier payments 'indefinitely' Worst year for retail in 25 years, says trade body A spokesperson said it was part of an ongoing process to explore all options for the company which was in the middle of a turnaround plan before the global Covid-19 pandemic hit. Cath Kidston employs 941 people, of which 820 have beenfurloughed under the government's employee payment scheme. After the coronavirus outbreak forced store closures, Cath Kidston has stayed open online. But most employees were furloughed on 22 March which means the government will pay 80% of an employee's wages up to Â£2,500 a month. An urgent review of the business began last month and there has been interest from possible buyers. The chain sells home furnishings, clothes and accessories in trademark floral and vintage prints. It has 60 shops in the UK and a presence in 200 globally. Founded in 1993, it was bought by Baring Private Equity Asia in 2016. It is thought a so-called pre-pack administration is now the most likely outcome for Cath Kidston. Debenhams, which employs around 20,000 staff, is also understood to be considering a pre-pack administration. Debenhams employs around 20,000 people If it goes ahead, it will bethe second time in a year that the retailer has filed for administration. It is understood Debenhams wants to protect the business against claims from creditors including suppliers who are yet to be paid. Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that Arcadia, which is owned by Sir Philip Green, is preparing to walk away from a number of its property leases. A spokesman for Arcadia said: ""No decision has been taken at this time."" Arcadia has furloughed 14,500 of its 16,000 employees since the coronavirus lockdown and said its board members and senior leadership are taking pay cuts of between 25% and 50%. Sir Philip Green controls Arcadia which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burtons Arcadia is also facing uncertainty over the future of its concessions in Debenhams' stores which include the brands Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge and Wallis. As the High Street remains in shutdown, some retailers such as Primark have opted to cancel orders with their suppliers. Fashion chain New Look recently informed its suppliers that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centre would be delayed ""indefinitely"". While the coronavirus has heaped pressure on many businesses, independent retail expert Clare Bailey said retailers had already been under strain for the last two or three years because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its effect on consumer confidence. ""[Coronavirus] was the final straw of all the straws that broke the camel's already very broken back,"" she said.

Player wage row a disgrace - Rooney,"Derby striker Rooney questions why footballers are being treated like ""scapegoats"" The power struggle over how Premier League footballers can financially assist in the fight against coronavirus is ""a disgrace"" and has players in a ""no-win situation"", says Wayne Rooney. Players have beenurged to do moreby health secretary Matt Hancock and the Premier Leagueproposed a 30% pay cut. The Professional Footballers' Association says thatmay harm the NHS. Derby striker Rooney says he is happy to offer support but asked: ""Why are footballers suddenly the scapegoats?"" In his Sunday Times column,,externalthe 34-year-old ex-England captain added: ""For the Premier League to just announce the proposal, as it has done, increases the pressure on players and in my opinion it is now a no-win situation: if players come out and say they can't agree or are not willing to cut by 30%, even if the real reasons are that it will financially ruin some, it will be presented as 'Rich Players Refuse Pay Cut'. ""It seemed strange to me because every other decision in this process has been kept behind closed doors, but this had to be announced publicly. ""Why? It feels as if it's to shame the players - to force them into a corner where they have to pick up the bill for lost revenue."" Furloughing staff: What have clubs done so far? Gary Lineker expects a decision on how footballers will contribute in the coming days England manager Gareth Southgate has reportedly taken a 30% pay cut, though the Football Association is yet to confirm the move. The Premier League says it wants a 30% cut in players' wages in order to ""protect employment throughout the professional game"". The PFA says the proposal would be ""detrimental to our NHS"" as it would equate to more than Â£500m in wage reductions over 12 months, and a loss in tax contributions of more than Â£200m to the UK government. Derby player-coach Rooney questioned the timing of the Premier League's proposed wage cuts when top-flight captains were already in discussions as to how they could set up a fund that would go to a charitable cause, most likely the NHS. Rooney also said the Premier League's own contribution of Â£20m to the NHS was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared to what players are being asked to give up. ""How the past few days have played out is a disgrace,"" added England's all-time leading goalscorer. ""I get that players are well paid and could give up money. But this should be getting done on a case-by-case basis. ""Clubs should be sitting down with each player and explaining what savings it needs to survive. Players would accept that. ""One player might say, 'I can afford a 30%'; another might say, 'I can only afford 5%'. ""Personally, I'd have no problem with some of us paying more. I don't think that would cause any dressing room problems. ""Whatever way you look at it, we're easy targets. What gets lost is that half our wages get taken by the taxman. Money that goes to the government, money that is helping the NHS."" Rooney questioned why ""big stars from other sports, who are able to avoid tax by living in places like Monaco"" are not being scrutinised over the financial support they are offering in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. He also criticised health secretary Hancock focusing on footballers and believes big clubs do not need players to take cuts in order to survive, adding if they did then ""football is in a far worse position than any of us imagined"". Premier League leaders Liverpool arefacing criticism from former players and fansfor joining Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich in furloughing non-playing staff. Rooney said he expects people to ""point the finger"" at him for airing his views on the pay-cut issue but wanted to ""speak up"" for players. ""At the moment it's almost a free-for-all: it's like the government, Premier League and sections of the media have set the players up to fall,"" he added. Fellow ex-England captain Gary Lineker told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show that footballers he had spoken to were ""desperately keen"" to offer help but were an ""easy"" target for criticism. ""Why not call on all the wealthy to try and help if they possibly can rather than just pick on footballers?"" the Match of the Day presenter said. ""Nobody seems to talk about the bankers, the CEOs, huge millionaires. Are they standing up? Are they being asked to stand up? We don't know. ""The problem is how you do it. It's obviously complicated and it takes time. People are always quick to jump on the judgemental high horse, certainly when it comes to footballers but lots of them do lots of really good things and I'm sure they'll continue to do so. ""Footballers do an extraordinary amount of good in the community, lots of them will already be giving in their own silent ways and I know that plans are afoot to make their contributions to society.

Tech firms summoned over 'crackpot' 5G conspiracies,"The culture secretary is to order social media companies to be more aggressive in their response to conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the coronavirus pandemic. Oliver Dowden plans to hold virtual meetings with representatives from several tech firms next week to discuss the matter. It follows a number of 5G masts apparently being set on fire. The issue will test the companies' commitments to free speech. Earlier in the week, blazes were reported at masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling in Merseyside. A spokesman for Vodafone's mobile network told the BBC there had been a total of four further incidents over the past 24 hours at both its own sites and those shared with O2, but did not identify the locations. ""We have received several reports of criminal damage to phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online,"" a spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport told the BBC. ""Those responsible for criminal acts will face the full force of the law. ""We must also see social media companies acting responsibly and taking much swifter action to stop nonsense spreading on their platforms which encourages such acts."" DCMS has yet to confirm which tech companies are being summoned. False theories are being spread on smaller platforms such as Nextdoor, Pinterest and the petitions site Change.org as well as larger ones including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. Scientists have said the idea of a connectionbetween Covid-19 and 5G is ""complete rubbish"" and biologically impossible. Several of the platforms have already taken steps to address the problem but have not banned discussion of the subject outright. Pinterest, for example, limits its search results for coronavirus and related terms to showing pinned information from recognised health organisations but does not have a comparable restriction for 5G. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Facebook said it had also removed a number of groups that were encouraging attacks on 5G masts. However, a post entitled ""burn baby burn - it's begun"", which accompanied videos of telecoms equipment ablaze, was only taken down about six hours after it was flagged to the company's press office. YouTube bans some types of bogus posts about Covid-19, but classes conspiracy theories linking the virus to 5G as ""borderline content"". As a result, it said it tries to reduce the frequency its algorithms recommend them, but does not delete the videos from its platform. A spokeswoman for the Google-owned service said it intended to ""evaluate the impact"" of this approach. It did, however, remove one video flagged by the BBC that featured threatening language. Change.org said its open nature allowed anyone to set up a petition about any issue they cared about, but added they must comply with its guidelines to stay online. ""We have removed a number of petitions making unsubstantiated health claims about 5G from the platform,"" a spokeswoman added. Vodafone has said the attacks are ""now a matter of national security"". ""It beggars belief that some people should want to harm the very networks that are providing essential connectivity to the emergency services, the NHS, and rest of the country during this difficult lockdown period,"" wrote UK chief executive Nick Jeffery. ""It also makes me angry to learn that some people have been abusing our engineers as they go about their business. ""Online stories connecting the spread of coronavirus to 5G are utterly baseless. Please don't share them on social media - fake news can have serious consequences."" The GSMA - a trade body that represents the wider mobile industry - also urged social media and other content-hosting providers to ""accelerate their efforts to remove fake news"" relating to the problem. The campaign against 5G has been flourishing on social media for the last year. Facebook in particular has been full of groups claiming the technology is dangerous, with many of them also pushing anti-vaccine messages. Until recently, apart from the odd fact-checking message alongside posts, the companies have done little to combat this trend. Neither Twitter nor YouTube, for instance, has an option in their reporting systems to flag misinformation. Even on Friday, complaints to Facebook moderators about a group that appeared to encourage arson attacks on 5G masts received replies saying the page did ""not violate our community standards"" - although after the BBC contacted Facebook's press office it was taken down. In normal times, social media platforms are very reluctant to curb what they regard as an essential part of their mission: giving people the right to free expression, however outlandish or unscientific their views. But these are not normal times. The government is effectively waging a war against a deadly virus, and keyworkers looking after vital infrastructure are facing abuse, possibly inspired by these social media campaigners. That means there is now intense pressure on the likes of Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter to combat what one minister has called ""dangerous nonsense"" - and they will want to be seen to be acting responsibly, even if some of their users cry censorship.

Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags,"As the death toll from coronavirus continues to climb, hospitals across the UK are working flat out to create more intensive care beds for those who are critically ill. Speaking to the BBC, one intensive care doctor describes the crippling reality of a lack of support and equipment faced by some health-care workers in England. Several healthcare workers in England have told the BBC of a lack of equipment in their hospitals. Warned against speaking to the media, they were unwilling to talk publicly. However, one intensive care doctor from the Midlands wanted to go on record. The BBC agreed to change her name in order to protect her identity. Dr Roberts describes a hospital on the brink. Intensive care is already full of coronavirus (Covid-19) patients. All operations deemed non-urgent, even the cancer clinics, have been cancelled. There is a lack of staff, a lack of critical care beds, a shortage of basic antibiotics and ventilators. All this, combined with the looming uncertainty of what will be the expected peak, estimated to hit the UK around 14-15 April, means hospital staff are already feeling the strain. However, nothing Dr Roberts describes is quite as alarming as the fact that these medical professionals, who continue to care for critically ill patients for 13 hours every day, are having to resort to fashioning personal protective equipment (PPE) out of clinical waste bags, plastic aprons and borrowed skiing goggles. Dr Roberts shown in the left picture, tying a bin bag covering the sides and back of her colleague's head While the public attempts to keep to a social distance of two metres, many NHS staff are being asked to examine patients suspected of coronavirus at a distance of 20cm - without the proper protection. With potentially fatal implications, Dr Roberts says several departments within her hospital are now so fearful of what's coming next, they have begun to hoard PPE for themselves. ""It's about being pragmatic. The nurses on ITU (Intensive Treatment Unit) need it now. They are doing procedures which risk aerosol spread of the virus. But they've been told to wear normal theatre hats, which have holes in them and don't provide any protection. ""It's wrong. And that's why we're having to put bin bags and aprons on our heads."" The government has acknowledged distribution problems, but says a national supply team, supported by the armed forces, is now ""working around the clock"" to deliver equipment. NHS England also said more thanone million respiratory face masks were delivered,externalon 1 April, but with no mention of much-needed head protection and long-sleeved gowns. Dr Roberts says her hospital has not received anything from the government, and what they do have is causing concern. ""The respiratory protection face masks we're using at the moment, they've all been relabelled with new best-before end dates. Yesterday I found one with three stickers on. The first said, expiry 2009. The second sticker, expiry 2013. And the third sticker on the very top said 2021."" Public Health England has saidall stockpiled pieces of PPE [personal protective equipment] labelled with new expiry dates have ""passed stringent tests"",externaland are ""safe for use by NHS staff"". But Dr Roberts says she is not convinced. Dr Roberts pulls expiry date stickers from the packaging on a face mask The Department of Health and Social Care also said it was ""working closely with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the Armyâ¦ If staff need to order more PPE there is a hotline in place"". It said its new guidance on PPE was in line with World Health Organization advice to ""make sure all clinicians are aware of what they should be wearing"". Currently ventilated and under Dr Roberts' care are three of her colleagues, all of whom have tested positive for coronavirus. One is an intensive care doctor working on a Covid ward, who, like Dr Roberts, only had access to inadequate protection. The other two were both working on non-Covid wards and therefore were wearing no PPE. However, given their symptoms, Dr Roberts believes both of them contracted the virus while at work. Although colleagues continue to visit, as with all other patients, no relatives are allowed anywhere within the hospital. ""The hardest thing at the moment is having to tell families you are withdrawing care, over the phone. Telling them their relatives are dying or have died but we can't let you come and see them,"" says Dr Roberts. ""Normally you can say to their relative who's at the bedside, 'We're going to do everything we can', but I haven't felt able to say that, because at the moment, I can't. ""I can't necessarily give them the best care on a ventilator, I can't guarantee the best nursing care, because the best nurses are being stretched four ways. We're running out of antibiotics, and I can't guarantee all the treatments that I know would help them."" NHS England says it has no record of how many medical professionals have been admitted to hospital after contracting coronavirus at work. Testing, PPE and ventilators - how has the government done? However, the two hardest-hit countries in Europe are counting. Spain's emergency health minister announced on 27 March that more than 9,400 health-care workers had tested positive, and in Italy, as of 30 March, more than 6,414 medical professionals were reported to have been infected. In the UK, several health workers are known to have died from coronavirus, including Areema Nasreen, a staff nurse in the West Midlands, Thomas Harvey, a health-care assistant in east London, Prof Mohamed Sami Shousha in central London, Dr Alfa Saadu in north London, Dr Habib Zaidi in Southend, Dr Adil El Tayar in west London and Dr Amged El-Hawrani in Leicester. Based on projections from Italy and Spain, Dr Roberts says health-care workers are bracing for the peak to hit in less than two weeks. ""If cases rise as quickly as they did in Spain and Italy, then quite frankly, we are screwed. All of our overspill areas will soon be full. ""The anaesthetic machines we have, which are designed to work for two to three hours at most, have been running for four to five days straight. We're already getting leaks and failures."" Also short of PPE, an intensive care nurse in Spain wears a bin bag and a protective plastic mask, donated by a local company Extra intensive care beds, set up in several operating theatres and wards, have nearly doubled the hospital's capacity to support critically ill patients, particularly those who can't breathe for themselves and need to be put on a ventilator. However, by expanding intensive care, Dr Roberts says it's the nursing staff who are disproportionately affected. ""Intensive care nurses are highly trained and normally deliver care one-to-one to those critically ill. Their patients may be asleep, but they have such a close relationship, they can describe every hair on a patient's head. ""But now, with these extra beds, nurses are under pressure to look after up to four patients, while delivering the same level of critical care. They are in tears and really struggling. They are the most important part of the system, but that's where it's going to fall down"". Outside in the hospital car park, Dr Roberts describes how a new temporary building has appeared in the ambulance bay with just one purpose - to vet all patients for symptoms of coronavirus before they are admitted. It is run by a clinician, who, Dr Roberts points out, could otherwise be looking after patients. She describes the unit as a ""lie detector"". ""It's really common for people to lie about their symptoms just to get seen. People who should have stayed at home, but they come to A&E. ""So now every single patient gets vetted in the car park, to make sure those with Covid symptoms go to the right part of the hospital and don't infect everyone else, like those who've come in with a broken arm."" But for Dr Roberts, it's not just about those turning up at A&E, it's everyone. ""Most hospital staff, we are isolating ourselves when we are not at work, so as not to put other people at risk. ""But the most frustrating thing for us is to see the parks full, or Tescos even busier than usual. Please stay at home."" Illustrations by Charlie Newland A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Key workers 'overlooked and underpaid' - Starmer,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the government still needs to be asked 'difficult questions' in the fight against coronavirus. Key workers have been ""overlooked and underpaid"" and there will have to be a ""reckoning"" after the coronavirus crisis, the new Labour leader has said. Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""They were last and now they've got to be first."" He said another decade of austerity would be a mistake, saying it was ""inevitable"" that the wealthy would have to pay more. The 57-year-oldwon the contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday. He defeated Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey in a ballot of party members and other supporters. Meanwhile, Sir Keir has announced some members of his new shadow cabinet, includingformer leadership rival Lisa Nandy as shadow foreign secretary. Keir Starmer elected as new Labour leader Analysis from Laura Kuenssberg: The task facing Labour's new leader Profile: Sir Keir Starmer Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Keir said: ""What we can't do is go back to business as usual we now know who the key workers are, they have very often been overlooked, underpaid and there has got to be a change."" He said funding of the NHS had to be looked at and ""we have to think about how we reimagine the economy going forward"". ""I think it is inevitable that we have to ask those that have more to pay more,"" he said. ""When we are through [the coronavirus crisis] there is going to have to be a reckoning, we are going to have to do things differently."" LIVE UPDATES:China holds day of remembrance A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health His comments come as Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned thatexercise outside the home could be bannedif people ignore the lockdown rules on staying at home and social distance. Sir Keir said Labour would support the government if it decides to take the step of further restrictions, including on exercising outside the home. He was it was ""particularly difficult"" for those who do not have gardens or live in overcrowded homes, but he said: ""We have got to get through this. Every time people break the guidance from the government, they put other people at risk"". But, he said, the government had to plan an exit strategy to end the lockdown, including a national vaccination programme, and this should be published. Sir Keir said that ""as soon as"" a vaccine arrives, there had to be a plan to roll it out nationally, ""but priority obviously for those on the front line"". Asked about the deadline for a post-Brexit UK-EU trade deal and whether the government can meet it, Sir Keir said the December 2020 deadline was ""unlikely"" but, he said, the focus had to be on dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. He added that the ""very, very tight"" deadline should be extended ""if necessary"". Sir Keir also said he spent time after the leadership election result ""reaching out"" to members of the Jewish community, after he apologised for the ""stain"" of anti-Semitism that has tainted Labour in recent years. He said his success will be judged on whether Jewish members return to Labour. This video can not be played Sir Keir recorded a video in which he spoke of the ""honour"" of becoming leader Elsewhere, writing in an article in the Sunday Times, Sir Keir said failure to provide enough protective equipment for frontline workers and delays over testing had been ""serious mistakes"" in tackling coronavirus. He said that ministers took too long to explain why they were ""so far behind"" on testing. With the government having promisedit will dramatically increase coronavirus testing to 100,000 a dayby the end of the month, Sir Keir said its ""greater clarity"" over testing ""should have come sooner"". ""Now the focus must be on making sure the promise of 100,000 tests is delivered and that these tests reach those who need them most, including our frontline NHS staff,"" he added. Labour confirmed that Sir Keir had been briefed on the coronavirus outbreak by senior government officials. ""During the call, the Labour leader reiterated his commitment to work constructively with the government in the national interest,"" a spokesman said. Sir Keir, who became an MP in 2015, won the Labour leadership contest on the first round of voting, with more than 50% of ballots cast. Meanwhile, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner was elected deputy leader, replacing Tom Watson, who stood down as an MP before the election.

Motorists have been caught driving at more than double the speed limit on roads which are clearer than usual due to the coronavirus lockdown. One driver was seen doing 70mph in the 30mph section of Beverley Road in Hull, while another was clocked at 80mph in a 40mph stretch of the city's Roger Millward Way. Safer Roads Humber said it had detected a number of drivers doing 100mph or more on the region's motorways, with top speeds of 130mph and 114mph. The organisation said it was particularly concerned about the A63 and A15, where average speeds were around 10mph more than the national speed limit.

Small batch distillery Tarquin's Gin, from Padstow, switched its production from floral spirits in order to help frontline health and emergency workers to clean their hands when no soap is available. The cleaning product will be distributed to to community hospitals across the county, as well as foodbanks and Devon & Cornwall Police, the company said. Company owner Tarquin Leadbetter said the distillery had moved into making sanitiser to help the community after significant demand from the public.

The latest deaths include12 more in Wales,seven in Northern Irelandandtwo in Scotland. As of 09:00 BST on Sunday, 47,806 people had tested positive for coronavirus, the Department of Health said. Understanding the death toll Can I go for a walk in the sunshine? What powers do the police have to fight coronavirus? Mr Hancock said the government was ""not planning any changes imminently"" to social distancing policies but he ""could not rule out further steps"". ""What we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed,"" he said. ""So I say this to the small minority of people who are breaking the rules or pushing the boundaries: you're risking your own life and the lives of others and you're making it harder for us all.""

Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bagsOne intensive care doctor describes the reality faced by some UK health workers on the front line.Health,"As the death toll from coronavirus continues to climb, hospitals across the UK are working flat out to create more intensive care beds for those who are critically ill. Speaking to the BBC, one intensive care doctor describes the crippling reality of a lack of support and equipment faced by some health-care workers in England. Several healthcare workers in England have told the BBC of a lack of equipment in their hospitals. Warned against speaking to the media, they were unwilling to talk publicly. However, one intensive care doctor from the Midlands wanted to go on record. The BBC agreed to change her name in order to protect her identity. Dr Roberts describes a hospital on the brink. Intensive care is already full of coronavirus (Covid-19) patients. All operations deemed non-urgent, even the cancer clinics, have been cancelled. There is a lack of staff, a lack of critical care beds, a shortage of basic antibiotics and ventilators. All this, combined with the looming uncertainty of what will be the expected peak, estimated to hit the UK around 14-15 April, means hospital staff are already feeling the strain. However, nothing Dr Roberts describes is quite as alarming as the fact that these medical professionals, who continue to care for critically ill patients for 13 hours every day, are having to resort to fashioning personal protective equipment (PPE) out of clinical waste bags, plastic aprons and borrowed skiing goggles. Dr Roberts shown in the left picture, tying a bin bag covering the sides and back of her colleague's head While the public attempts to keep to a social distance of two metres, many NHS staff are being asked to examine patients suspected of coronavirus at a distance of 20cm - without the proper protection. With potentially fatal implications, Dr Roberts says several departments within her hospital are now so fearful of what's coming next, they have begun to hoard PPE for themselves. ""It's about being pragmatic. The nurses on ITU (Intensive Treatment Unit) need it now. They are doing procedures which risk aerosol spread of the virus. But they've been told to wear normal theatre hats, which have holes in them and don't provide any protection. ""It's wrong. And that's why we're having to put bin bags and aprons on our heads."" The government has acknowledged distribution problems, but says a national supply team, supported by the armed forces, is now ""working around the clock"" to deliver equipment. NHS England also said more thanone million respiratory face masks were delivered,externalon 1 April, but with no mention of much-needed head protection and long-sleeved gowns. Dr Roberts says her hospital has not received anything from the government, and what they do have is causing concern. ""The respiratory protection face masks we're using at the moment, they've all been relabelled with new best-before end dates. Yesterday I found one with three stickers on. The first said, expiry 2009. The second sticker, expiry 2013. And the third sticker on the very top said 2021."" Public Health England has saidall stockpiled pieces of PPE [personal protective equipment] labelled with new expiry dates have ""passed stringent tests"",externaland are ""safe for use by NHS staff"". But Dr Roberts says she is not convinced. Dr Roberts pulls expiry date stickers from the packaging on a face mask The Department of Health and Social Care also said it was ""working closely with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the Armyâ¦ If staff need to order more PPE there is a hotline in place"". It said its new guidance on PPE was in line with World Health Organization advice to ""make sure all clinicians are aware of what they should be wearing"". Currently ventilated and under Dr Roberts' care are three of her colleagues, all of whom have tested positive for coronavirus. One is an intensive care doctor working on a Covid ward, who, like Dr Roberts, only had access to inadequate protection. The other two were both working on non-Covid wards and therefore were wearing no PPE. However, given their symptoms, Dr Roberts believes both of them contracted the virus while at work. Although colleagues continue to visit, as with all other patients, no relatives are allowed anywhere within the hospital. ""The hardest thing at the moment is having to tell families you are withdrawing care, over the phone. Telling them their relatives are dying or have died but we can't let you come and see them,"" says Dr Roberts. ""Normally you can say to their relative who's at the bedside, 'We're going to do everything we can', but I haven't felt able to say that, because at the moment, I can't. ""I can't necessarily give them the best care on a ventilator, I can't guarantee the best nursing care, because the best nurses are being stretched four ways. We're running out of antibiotics, and I can't guarantee all the treatments that I know would help them."" NHS England says it has no record of how many medical professionals have been admitted to hospital after contracting coronavirus at work. Testing, PPE and ventilators - how has the government done? However, the two hardest-hit countries in Europe are counting. Spain's emergency health minister announced on 27 March that more than 9,400 health-care workers had tested positive, and in Italy, as of 30 March, more than 6,414 medical professionals were reported to have been infected. In the UK, several health workers are known to have died from coronavirus, including Areema Nasreen, a staff nurse in the West Midlands, Thomas Harvey, a health-care assistant in east London, Prof Mohamed Sami Shousha in central London, Dr Alfa Saadu in north London, Dr Habib Zaidi in Southend, Dr Adil El Tayar in west London and Dr Amged El-Hawrani in Leicester. Based on projections from Italy and Spain, Dr Roberts says health-care workers are bracing for the peak to hit in less than two weeks. ""If cases rise as quickly as they did in Spain and Italy, then quite frankly, we are screwed. All of our overspill areas will soon be full. ""The anaesthetic machines we have, which are designed to work for two to three hours at most, have been running for four to five days straight. We're already getting leaks and failures."" Also short of PPE, an intensive care nurse in Spain wears a bin bag and a protective plastic mask, donated by a local company Extra intensive care beds, set up in several operating theatres and wards, have nearly doubled the hospital's capacity to support critically ill patients, particularly those who can't breathe for themselves and need to be put on a ventilator. However, by expanding intensive care, Dr Roberts says it's the nursing staff who are disproportionately affected. ""Intensive care nurses are highly trained and normally deliver care one-to-one to those critically ill. Their patients may be asleep, but they have such a close relationship, they can describe every hair on a patient's head. ""But now, with these extra beds, nurses are under pressure to look after up to four patients, while delivering the same level of critical care. They are in tears and really struggling. They are the most important part of the system, but that's where it's going to fall down"". Outside in the hospital car park, Dr Roberts describes how a new temporary building has appeared in the ambulance bay with just one purpose - to vet all patients for symptoms of coronavirus before they are admitted. It is run by a clinician, who, Dr Roberts points out, could otherwise be looking after patients. She describes the unit as a ""lie detector"". ""It's really common for people to lie about their symptoms just to get seen. People who should have stayed at home, but they come to A&E. ""So now every single patient gets vetted in the car park, to make sure those with Covid symptoms go to the right part of the hospital and don't infect everyone else, like those who've come in with a broken arm."" But for Dr Roberts, it's not just about those turning up at A&E, it's everyone. ""Most hospital staff, we are isolating ourselves when we are not at work, so as not to put other people at risk. ""But the most frustrating thing for us is to see the parks full, or Tescos even busier than usual. Please stay at home."" Illustrations by Charlie Newland A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Five bus workers die after contracting coronavirusMayor of London, Sadiq Khan, described the deaths as ""devastating"".London","Five London bus workers have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus Five London bus workers have died after contracting coronavirus. Unite said their members had been doing ""a heroic job in getting NHS and care workers to their places of work"" and described the loss as a ""tragedy"". Regional secretary Peter Kavanagh said the union would be assisting families ""in every possible way"". Transport for London (TfL) said it was ""extremely saddened"" by the deaths, while mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""absolutely devastated"". It is understood three were drivers and two were controllers. Unite said it had contacted Mr Khan, who shared its view ""that bus drivers must be fully protected"". ""We are absolutely committed to doing everything in our power to make the driving of buses safe during this unprecedented crisis,"" said Mr Kavanagh. Vehicles are being deep-cleaned and safety measures are in place Current safety measures include deep-cleaning vehicles, erecting screens around the driver, providing hand sanitiser and blocking off the seats closest to the driver. Mr Khan said he will continue to make enhancements across public transport in London to ensure there are even higher levels of protection. ""My thoughts are with their friends and families at this awful time,"" he said. ""I have been clear that our incredible public transport staff, on the buses, tubes, trams and trains, are critical workers, making a heroic effort to allow our NHS staff to save more lives. ""But we all need to play our part too and that means fewer Londoners using the public transport network. Please follow the rules. Stay at home and do not use public transport unless it is absolutely unavoidable."" Sadiq Khan is asking people to only travel on public transport if absolutely necessary Gareth Powell, TfL's managing director for surface transport, said they had been offering the bus companies for whom the drivers worked ""every support possible"". ""The safety of our staff and customers is our absolute priority and we have been working closely with the bus companies, the mayor and Unite to implement a range of changes and improvements to keep the bus network and garages safe for those operating and using it, in accordance with Public Health England advice.""

Premier League pay cut plans 'detrimental to NHS',"Liverpool lead the Premier League by 25 points from Manchester City The Professional Footballers' Association says proposals for a 30% pay cut for Premier League players would be ""detrimental to our NHS"". The PFA also called on the league to increase its own Â£20m charity pledge. The government has said it is ""concerned"" by what it called ""infighting"". The league wants playersto take a 30% salary cut in order to ""protect employment throughout the professional game"", amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the union says that equates to more than Â£500m in wage reductions over 12 months, and a loss in tax contributions of more than Â£200m to the UK government. The union also questionedHealth Secretary Matt Hancock's public criticismof footballers' salaries during a news conference on Thursday. ""What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the NHS?"" the statement read. ""Was this considered in the Premier League proposal and did the Health Secretary factor this in when asking players to take a salary cut?"" Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, tweeted: ""Concerned about the turn football talks have taken... people do not want to see infighting in our national sport at a time of crisis. ""Football must play its part to show that the sport understands the pressures its lower paid staff, communities and fans face."" Liverpool furlough some non-playing staff What is each Premier League club doing on pay? The PFA said all Premier League players ""will play their part in making significant financial contributions in these unprecedented times"". England manager Gareth Southgate is reported to have made such a gesture by agreeing a 30% pay cut, although the Football Association declined to confirm when asked by BBC Sport. Top-flight professionals have been coming under increasing pressure to take a drop in pay, especially with five Premier League clubs - Liverpool, Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich - now placing some non-playing staff on furlough leave under the Government's coronavirus job retention scheme. However, clubs themselves are understood to have financial concerns, with Burnley saying on Saturday they faced a shortfall of Â£50m if the Premier League season was not completed. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber, meanwhile,said the Premier League was not ignoring the plight of the general populationduring the coronavirus pandemic. The PFA statement came hours after a conference call with the Premier League and the League Managers' Association (LMA), the managers' union, to discuss the wage cut plans. Saturday's call, which featured a Premier League presentation of the wage cut plans to around 65 participants, was concluded in less than an hour with no agreement reached. The Premier League is not mandated to make a decision on wage cuts, as it has to be agreed by the players and coaches. Clubs and players are now set to discuss the plan, with talks set to go into next week. As part of the proposals, the Premier League would advance Â£125m to the English Football League (EFL) and National League, and give Â£20m towards the NHS. The PFA says it is happy to continue talks with the Premier League, although it added: ""Â£20m is welcome, but we believe it could be far bigger. ""The EFL money is an advance. Importantly, it will aid cashflow in the immediate, but football needs to find a way to increase funding to the EFL and non-league clubs in the long-term. ""Many clubs require an increase in funding just to survive. We believe in our football pyramid and again stress the need for solidarity between all clubs. ""Going forward, we are working together to find a solution which will be continually reviewed in order to assess the circumstance of the Covid-19 crisis. ""The players are mindful that as PAYE employees, the combined tax on their salaries is a significant contribution to funding essential public services - which are especially critical at this time."" During Saturday's conference call, the Premier League warned that it faces a Â£762m financial penalty if the season does not resume, and broadcasters demanded refunds on games they could not show. It added that hundreds of millions of pounds could be lost in sponsorship and matchday revenue because the season has been suspended, and that the campaign will almost certainly be played behind closed doors if it resumes. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live,England defender Danny Rose - on loan at Newcastle from Tottenham - said that Premier League players were keen to give up a portion of their wages to help good causes, but felt their ""backs are against the wall"" regarding the pressure they had faced to accept cuts. Captains of Premier League clubs, led by Liverpool's Jordan Henderson, have been in talks overa plan to make charitable donations. ""We sort of feel that our backs are against the wall. Conversations were being had before people outside of football were commenting,"" Rose told the Friday Football Social. ""I've been on the phone to Jordan Henderson and he's working so hard to come up with something. ""It was just not needed for people who are not involved in football to tell footballers what they should do with their money. I found that so bizarre."" The Premier League declined to comment on the PFA statement. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Rarely has the relationship between the Premier League's stars and their employers been so fragile. In an unprecedented crisis, the country's top footballers have found their voice like never before, exacerbating an unseemly row over money, and fracturing the unity of the sport in a way not seen since the threatened players' strike of 2001. Saturday's remarkable statement represents an attempt by the players and the PFA to go on the offensive against not only their own clubs, but also their critics, including even the government. They argue that the clubs' proposed 30% cut in wages would be counter-productive and detrimental to the NHS because of the loss in tax revenue it would result in. Privately, some Government officials accept the validity of this argument, but are dismayed that the sport is embroiled in such a squabble when Premier League players earn on average Â£3.5m a year. The Premier League had hoped Saturday's conference call would convince the players of the need to accept the cut in pay that many politicians and members of the public have been calling for. It seems that hope has proved naive however, and with clear tensions between the two sides, negotiations are now set to extend into next week.

Falconry Days, in Hexham, Northumberland, has cancelled all this summer's falconry displays amid the lockdown, and Mark French and his wife Mandy have had to let one part-time member of staff go. They are also concerned about finding the money to feed more than 90 birds if the shutdown continues for the months ahead. ""We don't have a rateable value on any part of the premises so can't qualify for any of the grants,"" said Mr French. ""We've got enough food to feed the birds for three months. After that we'll need to reorder, but basically we've got no income at all. ""We do need support. It's not our fault our business has closed. We need to survive."" Official data suggests testing for Covid-19 in England has been considerably slower per person than in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Across England there have been 238 people tested per 100,000, which compares to 395 per 100,000 in Northern Ireland, 351 in Scotland and 330 in Wales.

"'Serious mistakes' made on coronavirus, says Starmer","This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the government still needs to be asked 'difficult questions' in the fight against coronavirus. Key workers have been ""overlooked and underpaid"" and there will have to be a ""reckoning"" after the coronavirus crisis, the new Labour leader has said. Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""They were last and now they've got to be first."" He said another decade of austerity would be a mistake, saying it was ""inevitable"" that the wealthy would have to pay more. The 57-year-oldwon the contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday. He defeated Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey in a ballot of party members and other supporters. Meanwhile, Sir Keir has announced some members of his new shadow cabinet, includingformer leadership rival Lisa Nandy as shadow foreign secretary. Keir Starmer elected as new Labour leader Analysis from Laura Kuenssberg: The task facing Labour's new leader Profile: Sir Keir Starmer Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Keir said: ""What we can't do is go back to business as usual we now know who the key workers are, they have very often been overlooked, underpaid and there has got to be a change."" He said funding of the NHS had to be looked at and ""we have to think about how we reimagine the economy going forward"". ""I think it is inevitable that we have to ask those that have more to pay more,"" he said. ""When we are through [the coronavirus crisis] there is going to have to be a reckoning, we are going to have to do things differently."" LIVE UPDATES:China holds day of remembrance A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Sir Keir said Labour would support the government if it decides to take the step of further restrictions, including on exercising outside the home. He was it was ""particularly difficult"" for those who do not have gardens or live in overcrowded homes, but he said: ""We have got to get through this. Every time people break the guidance from the government, they put other people at risk"". But, he said, the government had to plan an exit strategy to end the lockdown, including a national vaccination programme, and this should be published. Sir Keir said that ""as soon as"" a vaccine arrives, there had to be a plan to roll it out nationally, ""but priority obviously for those on the front line"". Asked about the deadline for a post-Brexit UK-EU trade deal and whether the government can meet it, Sir Keir said the December 2020 deadline was ""unlikely"" but, he said, the focus had to be on dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. He added that the ""very, very tight"" deadline should be extended ""if necessary"". Sir Keir also said he spent time after the leadership election result ""reaching out"" to members of the Jewish community, after he apologised for the ""stain"" of anti-Semitism that has tainted Labour in recent years. He said his success will be judged on whether Jewish members return to Labour. This video can not be played Sir Keir recorded a video in which he spoke of the ""honour"" of becoming leader Elsewhere, writing in an article in the Sunday Times, Sir Keir said failure to provide enough protective equipment for frontline workers and delays over testing had been ""serious mistakes"" in tackling coronavirus. He said that ministers took too long to explain why they were ""so far behind"" on testing. With the government having promisedit will dramatically increase coronavirus testing to 100,000 a dayby the end of the month, Sir Keir said its ""greater clarity"" over testing ""should have come sooner"". ""Now the focus must be on making sure the promise of 100,000 tests is delivered and that these tests reach those who need them most, including our frontline NHS staff,"" he added. Labour confirmed that Sir Keir had been briefed on the coronavirus outbreak by senior government officials. ""During the call, the Labour leader reiterated his commitment to work constructively with the government in the national interest,"" a spokesman said. Sir Keir, who became an MP in 2015, won the Labour leadership contest on the first round of voting, with more than 50% of ballots cast.

""What we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed,"" he said.

Spain 'close to passing peak' as deaths fall againPrime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has extended lockdown measures in the country until 25 April.Europe,"This video can not be played Inside the ICU in one of Spain's biggest hospitals Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez says the country is ""close to passing the peak of infections"" as the number of coronavirus deaths fell for the second day in a row. Mr SÃ¡nchez also extended lockdown measures until 25 April, saying the restrictions were ""saving lives"". The toll of 809 deaths in one day is the lowest in Spain for a week. Meanwhile, officials are trying to get masks for all citizens as part of plans to eventually ease restrictions. Face masks are currently almost impossible to get hold of in Spain. The government had previously said they served little purpose outside hospitals. However, views on wearing masks appear to be shifting in Western countries, with US health authorities on Friday recommending their use in public. Austria, the Czech Republic, Israel and Turkey have also mandated the use of masks in various public places. Live virus updates from around the world Globally, more than 60,000 people have died in the pandemic and more than 1.1 million have been infected, Johns Hopkins University in the US says. Officials say 7,026 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in Spain in the past 24 hours - down from Friday's figure of 7,472. A total of 11,744 people have died, while the total number of cases - 124,736 - is now higher than in Italy. Addressing the nation, Mr SÃ¡nchez said extending the lockdown for two weeks was necessary to give the health service time to recover. ""These are the most difficult days of our lives,"" he said. Once the number of new infections was under control a ""progressive return to a new normal"" would get under way to rebuild the economy, he said. New hygiene, detection and tracing measures would be in place. Lockdown measures will be in force until 25 April He also called for European unity to tackle the economic consequences of the pandemic. ""Europe must not fail this time,"" he said. ""It is clear that the Spanish economy will have to go into debt and we will have to take resources from future generations to tackle the pandemic,"" he added. So far the EU has been unable to agree on a plan to share out coronavirus-incurred debt in the form of special bonds - dubbed coronabonds - despite pleas from Spain, Italy, France and others. Coronavirus outbreak eats into EU unity The Madrid region has been Spain's worst affected area. Care homes have seen large-scale outbreaks leading to a collapse in staffing. In two facilities alone there are reports of almost 90 deaths linked to the crisis. Last month the military was called in to help at retirement homes and found elderly patients abandoned and, in some cases, dead in their beds.

The total number of people who have died in hospitals is now 4,313. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pregnant fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds said she had spent several days in bed with symptoms of the virus. She said she was ""on the mend"" after seven days of rest. Mr Johnson tested positive for the virus last week and has been conducting cabinet meetings via video link. Italy has seen its first drop in the number of patients in intensive care during the outbreak. The number of new deaths - 681 - has taken the country's death toll to 15,362 but is smaller than in previous days. China observed a three-minute silence in remembrance of more than 3,000 people who died of coronavirus in the country. In Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, all traffic lights turned red temporarily. New York has recorded 630 more virus deaths, another daily record that takes its overall toll to 3,565. Most deaths have been in New York City. The state now has almost as many cases - over 113,000 - as the whole of Italy. Governor Andrew Cuomo said infections could peak in between four and 14 days.

"Premier League pay cut plans 'detrimental to NHS'The Professional Footballers' Association warns that proposals for a 30% pay cut in the Premier League would be ""detrimental to our NHS"".BBC Sport","Liverpool lead the Premier League by 25 points from Manchester City The Professional Footballers' Association says proposals for a 30% pay cut for Premier League players would be ""detrimental to our NHS"". The PFA also called on the league to increase its own Â£20m charity pledge. The government has said it is ""concerned"" by what it called ""infighting"". The league wants playersto take a 30% salary cut in order to ""protect employment throughout the professional game"", amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the union says that equates to more than Â£500m in wage reductions over 12 months, and a loss in tax contributions of more than Â£200m to the UK government. The union also questionedHealth Secretary Matt Hancock's public criticismof footballers' salaries during a news conference on Thursday. ""What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the NHS?"" the statement read. ""Was this considered in the Premier League proposal and did the Health Secretary factor this in when asking players to take a salary cut?"" Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, tweeted: ""Concerned about the turn football talks have taken... people do not want to see infighting in our national sport at a time of crisis. ""Football must play its part to show that the sport understands the pressures its lower paid staff, communities and fans face."" Liverpool furlough some non-playing staff What is each Premier League club doing on pay? The PFA said all Premier League players ""will play their part in making significant financial contributions in these unprecedented times"". England manager Gareth Southgate is reported to have made such a gesture by agreeing a 30% pay cut, although the Football Association declined to confirm when asked by BBC Sport. Top-flight professionals have been coming under increasing pressure to take a drop in pay, especially with five Premier League clubs - Liverpool, Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich - now placing some non-playing staff on furlough leave under the Government's coronavirus job retention scheme. However, clubs themselves are understood to have financial concerns, with Burnley saying on Saturday they faced a shortfall of Â£50m if the Premier League season was not completed. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber, meanwhile,said the Premier League was not ignoring the plight of the general populationduring the coronavirus pandemic. The PFA statement came hours after a conference call with the Premier League and the League Managers' Association (LMA), the managers' union, to discuss the wage cut plans. Saturday's call, which featured a Premier League presentation of the wage cut plans to around 65 participants, was concluded in less than an hour with no agreement reached. The Premier League is not mandated to make a decision on wage cuts, as it has to be agreed by the players and coaches. Clubs and players are now set to discuss the plan, with talks set to go into next week. As part of the proposals, the Premier League would advance Â£125m to the English Football League (EFL) and National League, and give Â£20m towards the NHS. The PFA says it is happy to continue talks with the Premier League, although it added: ""Â£20m is welcome, but we believe it could be far bigger. ""The EFL money is an advance. Importantly, it will aid cashflow in the immediate, but football needs to find a way to increase funding to the EFL and non-league clubs in the long-term. ""Many clubs require an increase in funding just to survive. We believe in our football pyramid and again stress the need for solidarity between all clubs. ""Going forward, we are working together to find a solution which will be continually reviewed in order to assess the circumstance of the Covid-19 crisis. ""The players are mindful that as PAYE employees, the combined tax on their salaries is a significant contribution to funding essential public services - which are especially critical at this time."" During Saturday's conference call, the Premier League warned that it faces a Â£762m financial penalty if the season does not resume, and broadcasters demanded refunds on games they could not show. It added that hundreds of millions of pounds could be lost in sponsorship and matchday revenue because the season has been suspended, and that the campaign will almost certainly be played behind closed doors if it resumes. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live,England defender Danny Rose - on loan at Newcastle from Tottenham - said that Premier League players were keen to give up a portion of their wages to help good causes, but felt their ""backs are against the wall"" regarding the pressure they had faced to accept cuts. Captains of Premier League clubs, led by Liverpool's Jordan Henderson, have been in talks overa plan to make charitable donations. ""We sort of feel that our backs are against the wall. Conversations were being had before people outside of football were commenting,"" Rose told the Friday Football Social. ""I've been on the phone to Jordan Henderson and he's working so hard to come up with something. ""It was just not needed for people who are not involved in football to tell footballers what they should do with their money. I found that so bizarre."" The Premier League declined to comment on the PFA statement. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Rarely has the relationship between the Premier League's stars and their employers been so fragile. In an unprecedented crisis, the country's top footballers have found their voice like never before, exacerbating an unseemly row over money, and fracturing the unity of the sport in a way not seen since the threatened players' strike of 2001. Saturday's remarkable statement represents an attempt by the players and the PFA to go on the offensive against not only their own clubs, but also their critics, including even the government. They argue that the clubs' proposed 30% cut in wages would be counter-productive and detrimental to the NHS because of the loss in tax revenue it would result in. Privately, some Government officials accept the validity of this argument, but are dismayed that the sport is embroiled in such a squabble when Premier League players earn on average Â£3.5m a year. The Premier League had hoped Saturday's conference call would convince the players of the need to accept the cut in pay that many politicians and members of the public have been calling for. It seems that hope has proved naive however, and with clear tensions between the two sides, negotiations are now set to extend into next week.

Mast fire probe amid 5G coronavirus claims,"Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside Mobile phone mast fires are being investigated amid conspiracy theories claiming a link between 5G and coronavirus. There have been fires at masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling in Merseyside. A video, allegedly of the blaze in Aigburth, was shared on YouTube and Facebook, claiming a link between the mobile technology and Covid-19. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said it was ""dangerous nonsense"". The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said on Twitter ""there is absolutely no credible evidence"" of a link, while trade body Mobile UK said such rumours and conspiracy theories were ""concerning"".

Merseyside Police said an investigation is under way after the telecommunications box in Aigburth caught fire on Friday. A video of what appears to be the incident, which happened shortly after 22:00 BST, was shared on YouTube. Verification from the BBC's disinformation team suggests the video is authentic, however, it is unclear whether the box has anything to do with 5G technology. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said it is also investigating a blaze it extinguished at a 5G mast in the village of Melling, north of Liverpool, on Friday night. West Midlands Fire Service said the fire in Birmingham involved a 70ft tower on a telecommunications site. However, it said the cause was yet to be identified and it could not confirm the mast was 5G. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ""We're aware of a fire involving a phone mast, but are awaiting further details on its cause."" Does 5G pose health risks? Coronavirus: Fake news is spreading fast Live updates: Coronavirus in England At the government's daily coronavirus briefing earlier, Mr Gove said conspiracy theories linking 5G with Covid-19 were ""just nonsense, dangerous nonsense as well."" NHS Director Stephen Powis told the press conference 5G infrastructure is critical both to the general population who are being asked to stay at home and to the healthcare response to the virus. ""I'm absolutely outraged and disgusted that people would be taking action against the infrastructure we need to tackle this emergency,"" he said. Mobile UK said key workers had suffered abuse and threats from people about damaging infrastructure under the pretence of claims about 5G. ""This is not acceptable and only impacts on our ability as an industry to maintain the resilience and operational capacity of the networks to support mass home working and critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals."" By Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. One suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags as protection,"As the death toll from coronavirus continues to climb, hospitals across the UK are working flat out to create more intensive care beds for those who are critically ill. Speaking to the BBC, one intensive care doctor describes the crippling reality of a lack of support and equipment faced by some health-care workers in England. Several healthcare workers in England have told the BBC of a lack of equipment in their hospitals. Warned against speaking to the media, they were unwilling to talk publicly. However, one intensive care doctor from the Midlands wanted to go on record. The BBC agreed to change her name in order to protect her identity. Dr Roberts describes a hospital on the brink. Intensive care is already full of coronavirus (Covid-19) patients. All operations deemed non-urgent, even the cancer clinics, have been cancelled. There is a lack of staff, a lack of critical care beds, a shortage of basic antibiotics and ventilators. All this, combined with the looming uncertainty of what will be the expected peak, estimated to hit the UK around 14-15 April, means hospital staff are already feeling the strain. However, nothing Dr Roberts describes is quite as alarming as the fact that these medical professionals, who continue to care for critically ill patients for 13 hours every day, are having to resort to fashioning personal protective equipment (PPE) out of clinical waste bags, plastic aprons and borrowed skiing goggles. Dr Roberts shown in the left picture, tying a bin bag covering the sides and back of her colleague's head While the public attempts to keep to a social distance of two metres, many NHS staff are being asked to examine patients suspected of coronavirus at a distance of 20cm - without the proper protection. With potentially fatal implications, Dr Roberts says several departments within her hospital are now so fearful of what's coming next, they have begun to hoard PPE for themselves. ""It's about being pragmatic. The nurses on ITU (Intensive Treatment Unit) need it now. They are doing procedures which risk aerosol spread of the virus. But they've been told to wear normal theatre hats, which have holes in them and don't provide any protection. ""It's wrong. And that's why we're having to put bin bags and aprons on our heads."" The government has acknowledged distribution problems, but says a national supply team, supported by the armed forces, is now ""working around the clock"" to deliver equipment. NHS England also said more thanone million respiratory face masks were delivered,externalon 1 April, but with no mention of much-needed head protection and long-sleeved gowns. Dr Roberts says her hospital has not received anything from the government, and what they do have is causing concern. ""The respiratory protection face masks we're using at the moment, they've all been relabelled with new best-before end dates. Yesterday I found one with three stickers on. The first said, expiry 2009. The second sticker, expiry 2013. And the third sticker on the very top said 2021."" Public Health England has saidall stockpiled pieces of PPE [personal protective equipment] labelled with new expiry dates have ""passed stringent tests"",externaland are ""safe for use by NHS staff"". But Dr Roberts says she is not convinced. Dr Roberts pulls expiry date stickers from the packaging on a face mask The Department of Health and Social Care also said it was ""working closely with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the Armyâ¦ If staff need to order more PPE there is a hotline in place"". It said its new guidance on PPE was in line with World Health Organization advice to ""make sure all clinicians are aware of what they should be wearing"". Currently ventilated and under Dr Roberts' care are three of her colleagues, all of whom have tested positive for coronavirus. One is an intensive care doctor working on a Covid ward, who, like Dr Roberts, only had access to inadequate protection. The other two were both working on non-Covid wards and therefore were wearing no PPE. However, given their symptoms, Dr Roberts believes both of them contracted the virus while at work. Although colleagues continue to visit, as with all other patients, no relatives are allowed anywhere within the hospital. ""The hardest thing at the moment is having to tell families you are withdrawing care, over the phone. Telling them their relatives are dying or have died but we can't let you come and see them,"" says Dr Roberts. ""Normally you can say to their relative who's at the bedside, 'We're going to do everything we can', but I haven't felt able to say that, because at the moment, I can't. ""I can't necessarily give them the best care on a ventilator, I can't guarantee the best nursing care, because the best nurses are being stretched four ways. We're running out of antibiotics, and I can't guarantee all the treatments that I know would help them."" NHS England says it has no record of how many medical professionals have been admitted to hospital after contracting coronavirus at work. Testing, PPE and ventilators - how has the government done? However, the two hardest-hit countries in Europe are counting. Spain's emergency health minister announced on 27 March that more than 9,400 health-care workers had tested positive, and in Italy, as of 30 March, more than 6,414 medical professionals were reported to have been infected. In the UK, several health workers are known to have died from coronavirus, including Areema Nasreen, a staff nurse in the West Midlands, Thomas Harvey, a health-care assistant in east London, Prof Mohamed Sami Shousha in central London, Dr Alfa Saadu in north London, Dr Habib Zaidi in Southend, Dr Adil El Tayar in west London and Dr Amged El-Hawrani in Leicester. Based on projections from Italy and Spain, Dr Roberts says health-care workers are bracing for the peak to hit in less than two weeks. ""If cases rise as quickly as they did in Spain and Italy, then quite frankly, we are screwed. All of our overspill areas will soon be full. ""The anaesthetic machines we have, which are designed to work for two to three hours at most, have been running for four to five days straight. We're already getting leaks and failures."" Also short of PPE, an intensive care nurse in Spain wears a bin bag and a protective plastic mask, donated by a local company Extra intensive care beds, set up in several operating theatres and wards, have nearly doubled the hospital's capacity to support critically ill patients, particularly those who can't breathe for themselves and need to be put on a ventilator. However, by expanding intensive care, Dr Roberts says it's the nursing staff who are disproportionately affected. ""Intensive care nurses are highly trained and normally deliver care one-to-one to those critically ill. Their patients may be asleep, but they have such a close relationship, they can describe every hair on a patient's head. ""But now, with these extra beds, nurses are under pressure to look after up to four patients, while delivering the same level of critical care. They are in tears and really struggling. They are the most important part of the system, but that's where it's going to fall down"". Outside in the hospital car park, Dr Roberts describes how a new temporary building has appeared in the ambulance bay with just one purpose - to vet all patients for symptoms of coronavirus before they are admitted. It is run by a clinician, who, Dr Roberts points out, could otherwise be looking after patients. She describes the unit as a ""lie detector"". ""It's really common for people to lie about their symptoms just to get seen. People who should have stayed at home, but they come to A&E. ""So now every single patient gets vetted in the car park, to make sure those with Covid symptoms go to the right part of the hospital and don't infect everyone else, like those who've come in with a broken arm."" But for Dr Roberts, it's not just about those turning up at A&E, it's everyone. ""Most hospital staff, we are isolating ourselves when we are not at work, so as not to put other people at risk. ""But the most frustrating thing for us is to see the parks full, or Tescos even busier than usual. Please stay at home."" Illustrations by Charlie Newland A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?
