So-called 'IS Beatles' dispute extradition,"This video can not be played Interview with so-called 'IS Beatles' duo Two Londoners accused of being members of the Islamic State group have called into question the British government's attempt to have them tried in the US. Speaking to the BBC from a jail in Syria, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey also denied they had been stripped of their British citizenship. The pair were captured in January. US officials believe the ""execution cell"" - dubbed ""The Beatles"" by their hostages because of their UK accents -  beheaded at least 27 Western hostages. They are currently being held in solitary confinement in northern Syria after being caught by US-backed Kurdish forces. Last month, UK government said it would demand no ""assurances"" that the pair will not receive the death penalty if they are tried in the US. ""What makes the British government want a British citizen to be tried in America? Like what's behind it?"" said Mr Elsheikh. Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? UK stance on IS duo 'a rare decision' When asked about having their UK citizenship revoked, Mr Elsheikh said: ""That has not been confirmed"". However, Security Minister Ben Wallace confirmed it in the House of Commons last month. Journalists and aid workers from the UK, US and Japan were among the cell's victims. The group created brutal propaganda videos, and are said to have tortured dozens of people. The other two cell members - also from London - wereMohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis. All four were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria. In 2017,Davis was jailed in Turkey, having been convicted of being a senior IS member. Emwazi, who was the alleged ringleader and appeared in videos showing hostages being beheaded, was killed by a drone strike in 2015. When asked about Emwazi, Mr Kotey told the BBC he would not say anything negative about him. ""He was a friend of mine,"" he said. In the past, Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. In this case, the UK initially shared intelligence with the US, but sought no such assurances. However, information sharing was halted last month afterMr Elsheikh's mother launched a legal challenge. The UK Home Office is now awaiting a judge's ruling on whether ministers can lawfully provide information to the US to be used to prosecute the men, without first seeking a guarantee that they will not be put to death. Some relatives of the victims have said they are against the death penalty for the pair. Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by cell in 2014 - previously told the BBC: ""I think that will just make them martyrs in their twisted ideology."" James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent The list of accusations against these two men, which they deny, is long and clear. But that does not mean they are likely to face a criminal trial any time soon. First, they are being held in northern Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces - an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters opposed to IS. They are not in the hands of the British or American authorities. Therefore much depends on what the SDF decide to do with them. Second, they are no longer British citizens. The UK authorities, we are assured, have had no contact with them. The pair are accused of being members of a group that killed westerners of several nationalities, not just Britons. So it is not automatically clear where the two men should be tried. And third, there is the simple problem that cases of foreign fighters like these can be extremely hard to prosecute. There is the difficulty in obtaining evidence, finding witnesses and establishing what crimes have been committed in which jurisdiction. Read more from James here.

Labour probe into Margaret Hodge dropped,"Dame Margaret Hodge is a vocal critic of Labour's issues with anti-Semitism Labour has dropped its inquiry into Dame Margaret Hodge despite her refusal to apologise over a confrontation with Jeremy Corbyn about anti-Semitism. Dame Margaret tweeted she was pleased the party had scrapped any action but added neither side had apologised. Journalists were briefed the decision had been taken after she expressed ""regret"" to Labour chief whip Nick Brown for her conduct. Dame Margaret hit back, insisting she had done no such thing. MPs criticise Labour's anti-Semitism code A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Anti-Semites don't speak for me - Corbyn A strongly-wordedresponse from her lawyers,externalto Labour general secretary Jennie Formby said that although the ""decision is welcomed, the basis on which you seek to explain your belated volte face is entirely disingenuous"". The letter said Dame Margaret ""did not express regret"" and that was a misrepresentation in order to ""save face in your necessary climb down"". The investigation was launched after a heated exchange last month in which Dame Margaret was said to have called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Mr Corbyn has been criticised by Jewish community leaders and some of his own MPs over what they see as his refusal to take allegations of anti-Semitism in the party seriously enough. It centres on the Labour Party's code of conduct - which includes an internationally recognised definition of anti-Semitism but omits four of the 11 examples of ""contemporary anti-Semitism"".

Labour says it has ""expanded and contextualised"" theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,externalexamples to provide ""legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"". And Mr Corbyn has insisted anti-Semites have no place in the Labour Party and acknowledged the party has not been quick enough to deal with those who have spread ""poison"" in the party's name. Labour MP Ian Austin is stillfacing disciplinary actionfrom Labour over claims - denied by him - that he screamed abuse during a row over the code of conduct.  He has called the new code of conduct a ""disgrace"". Mr Corbyn, a long-standing supporter of the rights of Palestinians, has defended Labour's decision not to include one of the IHRA examples - which warns against ""claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour"". He said this had ""sometimes been used by those wanting to restrict criticism of Israel that is not anti-Semitic"" Some Labour figures, including the shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith, had called for the investigation into Dame Margaret to be dropped - and shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour needed to ""move on"". Dame Margaret previously said she had chosen to confront Mr Corbyn in anger at what she said was the party's ""arrogance"" over its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism. She accused Labour of ""playing around"" with the international definition, and said she had gone to tell Mr Corbyn he was ""perceived as being anti-Semitic"". She denied reports she had sworn at him.

The battle against skin-whitening cream,"YouTubers Mariam Omotunde and Arlene Dihoulou used skin-lightening cream when they were younger, without knowing about the health consequences High Street shops that were prosecuted for selling illegal skin-whitening creams are continuing to do so, the BBC has found. Trading Standards acknowledged ""it's a really big problem"" and more could be done to regulate the industry. Substances containing hydroquinone and mercury are banned from being sold over-the-counter in the UK as they can cause liver, nerve and foetal damage. But a lack of resources and data is making the problem hard to tackle. A previous BBC investigation revealed the banned cosmetics were being sold across the UK. Trading Standards is responsible for seizing the creams and prosecuting businesses that sell them. However, it appears convicted shop owners are undeterred by these fines, and are continuing to sell the products. Watch the BBC Stories investigation on iPlayer Undercover journalists visited 17 shops across London, Leeds, Birmingham and Manchester to see how many illegal products they could purchase. Six of these shops had been previously prosecuted for selling the creams. A total of 13 shops were found to sell products containing illegal substances. Of the prosecuted shops, four out of the six resold banned products. This video can not be played Undercover journalists purchasing an illegal skin-whitening product Meg Chucks was fined Â£1,400 as well as Â£1,040 of legal costs in October 2017. She sold skin-bleaching products at her TM Cosmetics in Moston, Greater Manchester. Fifty-one products in her shop contained hydroquinone. Before being prosecuted, Ms Chucks had been warned by Trading Standards for importing similar types of products via Manchester Airport. But despite warnings and fines, the BBC has undercover footage of her still selling a skin-whitening cream. Funbeaut-A is was sold to undercover BBC reporters in a shop in Manchester. It contains hydroquinone, which cannot be sold over-the-counter in the UK Ms Chucks admitted to an undercover researcher that she used the product herself. She claimed she did not know it was illegal, despite hydroquinone being listed as an ingredient on the box. The Nigeria-manufactured product - Funbeaut-A - contained 3% hydroquinone, which is more than the strongest medicine containing hydroquinone licensed for prescription by UK doctors. In Manchester, a freedom of information request (FoI) revealed Ms Chucks was the only shop owner to be prosecuted in 2017-18 for selling skin-whiteners, despite BBC researchers finding prohibited substances in other Manchester shops. Ms Chucks refused our request for an interview. This video can not be played Safi George used the products for more than 10 years. She was hospitalised for a week from the effects Safi George used several illegal High Street bought bleaching cosmetics every day for 10 years. She spent more than Â£200 a month buying creams. Scared to tell her doctor because of the taboo surrounding these creams, Safi suffered in silence. She was eventually hospitalised for a week for extreme scarring and burning. ""I would have lost my life,"" she said. ""It's like taking drugs. It's not easy to tell someone to stop smoking, stop drinking, stop taking drugs."" Safi was so embarrassed about her use of skin-lightening creams that she began to treat her own scars, and did not seek medical assistance. Her sister Tutu said: ""When I saw her she was completely a white woman. ""All her stomach and all her hands were complete blisters. We went to A&E and they put her on antibiotics it was so bad."" The creams have left her with permanent scarring, and she thinks they are too readily available. ""If you can just display [skin whiteners] in a shop, I can just go there, [even] a 10-year-old, can pick it up and pay for it, that makes you think it's legal."" South London YouTubers Arlene Dihoulou and Mariam Omotunde used the skin-whitening creams when they were teenagers. They had no idea the products they were using were illegal. This video can not be played Arlene, 22, used illegal products when she was younger without realising Arlene started using the treatments at the age of 16 because she wanted to ""fit in"". ""I used to look at my skin as really ugly."" ""I just wanted to be desirable"". Mariam, 22, went to a local shop to purchase the creams. She did not read the ingredients, but just picked the products based on the skin colour of the lady on the bottle, assuming they were safe to use. Both girls stopped using the products before they had damaging health consequences, but were shocked the illegal products were sold so openly in the shops. Mariam added: ""Don't they have people who come check what you're selling? The regulations obviously aren't doing their jobs if this is so readily available."" ""We have the sugar tax now, because people see obesity as a big thing. A cause of that is fizzy drinks. So now the prices are higher and the sugar is less. ""So in the same way, this is something that needs to be highly monitored and regulated, because people can die from these creams."" Despite the damaging effects of the treatments, the BBC was told there is ""no central collection of data"" on the number of prosecutions, seizures or accusations across the country, resulting in a lack of understanding about the scale of the issue. Trading Standards officer Cenred Elworthy said that some traders do stop selling the products after being prosecuted, although the BBC has contrary evidence to this. He said ""secondary offenders are often not selling things that are blatantly, obviously full of illegal products"". Elworthy admits ""no-one has actually served jail time for selling them"" despite being caught still selling the illegal products while serving a suspended sentence. He suggested the industry could be better regulated through ""on-the-spot fines"" for businesses selling the skin-whitening products, and clearer sentencing guidelines. According to Mr Elworthy, Trading Standards could do more shop visits and seizures, but it struggles to after a 40% cut in resources over the past 10 years. He believes a team of 50 to 60 enforcers would be required in London alone to tackle the issue.

Star witness testifies in Manafort trial,"Gates - pictured here in February - has already pleaded guilty to two criminal charges The ex-deputy of Donald Trump's former  campaign manager Paul Manafort has told a court he committed crimes with his former boss and stole from him. Rick Gates, star prosecution witness in the fraud trial, said the defendant, Mr Manafort, directed most of the crimes. Both were indicted last October for hiding millions of dollars they made lobbying for Ukrainian politicians. This is the first criminal trial to come from the Department of Justice-led inquiry into alleged Russian meddling. President Donald Trump calls the investigation a political ""witch hunt"", and has argued Mr Manafort is being treated worse than Al Capone. Trump says son met Russian for information On day five of the trial in Alexandria, Virginia, Gates was asked by the prosecutor whether he had committed any crimes with Mr Manafort, and he said: ""Yes."" He testified that Mr Manafort had directed him to lower taxable income by reporting overseas income as loans. Gates told the jury of six women and six men on Monday that he had been ordered by Mr Manafort not to disclose foreign bank accounts in Cyprus. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? The witness also testified he had helped the defendant file false tax returns, concealing 15 foreign accounts from the US government despite knowing it was illegal. He added that he had stolen ""several hundred thousand"" dollars from Mr Manafort by submitting false expense reports. Gates - who served on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign with Mr Manafort - told the court he had stolen from other employers, too. A courtroom sketch shows Mr Manafort seated during the opening day of his trial Mr Manafort, 69, could spend the rest of his life in prison if found guilty of all the fraud charges. Gates, 46, is already facing up to six years in prison under the terms of a plea deal he struck with prosecutors in February when he pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Originally charged as a co-conspirator, he acknowledged in court on Monday he was co-operating with the prosecution in the hope of leniency. Trump ex-campaign chief's 'income altered' Tax accountant Cindy LaPorta testified last week and earlier on Monday Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether any Trump aides colluded with an alleged Moscow plot to help elect him as US president, and whether there was any obstruction of justice. But Mr Manafort is not charged with helping the Kremlin. Prosecutors say he dodged taxes on millions of dollars he made from his work for a Russia-friendly Ukrainian political party. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Who's who in Russia drama? How Trump-Russia scandal has unfolded What is the special counsel? Testimony from Mr Manafort's tax preparer continued on Monday. Accountant Cindy LaPorta - who was granted immunity from prosecution - was asked by prosecutors if she had been aware of a $10m (Â£7.7m) loan in 2006 from Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. She testified that she was unaware if the loan was categorised for tax purposes as income. Ms LaPorta told the court on Friday she had suspected Gates was misleading her about Mr Manafort's finances. But she said she was under the impression that Mr Manafort had been directing his deputies' actions and ""knew what was going on"".

"Gangsters jailed after man's ears cut offKisa Kasambara cut off the victim's ears after Michael Huxley ""served him up on a plate"".","Kisa Kasambara and Michael Huxley were jailed for 15 and 12 years respectively A man who hacked off his victim's ears in a ""horrific"" gangland assault has been jailed, along with an accomplice. Kisa Kasambara, 35, carried out the attack on Karl Warrilow over a Â£2,000 debt after Michael Huxley, 32, had lured him into a car in Liverpool. Kasambara and Huxley were jailed for 15 and 12 years respectively for kidnap and wounding with intent. Nicholas Thompson, the man behind the attack, called Mr Warrilow afterwards asking: ""How's life with no ears?"" Kasambara's and Huxley's trial at Liverpool Crown Court heard how Mr Warrilow had been asked to collect Â£2,000 by Thompson, who was serving a prison sentence. Mr Warrilow was kidnapped in West Derby in March 2017 after spending the money instead of passing it on. The court heard a dog chain was placed around his neck before he was driven to a disused railway siding where the attack took place. Thompson, 35, of Edge Lane Drive, Liverpool, and another man, Kenneth Dean, 34, of Upper Warwick Street, Liverpool, were jailed in March for 18 years and 15 years respectively at Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty of kidnap and wounding with intent. Judge Neil Flewitt QC said that Huxley, of Edge Lane, Old Swan, had played a subordinate role and showed remorse after the attack, but had tricked Mr Warrilow into his car and ""served him up on a plate for the others"". The judge described Kasambara, of St Joseph's Close, Huyton, as a ""dangerous offender"" and said he would continue to pose a risk to the public. Det Ch Insp John Webster said: ""This was a brutal and planned attack. ""The injuries sustained were horrific, including severed ears, and as a result he will face permanent facial disfigurement in addition to the devastating psychological impact this will have undoubtedly caused.""

Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite COÃ¢ÂÂ cuts,"It may sound like the title of a low budget sci-fi movie, but for planetary scientists, ""Hothouse Earth"" is a deadly serious concept. Researchers believe we could soon cross a threshold leading to boiling hot temperatures and towering seas in the centuries to come. Even if countries succeed in meeting their CO2 targets, we could still lurch on to this ""irreversible pathway"". Theirstudy shows,externalit could happen if global temperatures rise by 2C. An international team of climate researchers, writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says the warming expected in the next few decades could turn some of the Earth's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies. Human actions boosted heatwave odds The woman who found a new threat in plastic Young will pick up 'climate change bill' Each year the Earth's forests, oceans and land soak up about 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon that would otherwise end up in our atmosphere adding to temperatures. Many parts of the world would be significantly disrupted in a Hothouse Earth scenario But as the world experiences warming, these carbon sinks could become sources of carbon and make the problems of climate change significantly worse. So whether it is the permafrost in northern latitudes that now holds millions of tonnes of warming gases, or the Amazon rainforest, the fear is that the closer we get to 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the greater the chances that these natural allies will spew out more carbon than they currently now take in. Back in 2015, governments of the world committed themselves to keeping temperature rises well below 2 degrees, and to strive to keep them under 1.5. According to the authors, the current plans to cut carbon may not be enough if their analysis is correct. ""What we are saying is that when we reach 2 degrees of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself,"" co-author Prof Johan RockstrÃ¶m, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, told BBC News. ""We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2 degrees, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe. We totally hand over our fate to an Earth system that starts rolling out of equilibrium."" Melting ice in the Arctic will reduce the amount of sunlight reflected back into space Currently, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and they are rising by around 0.17C per decade. In their new study the authors looked at 10 natural systems, which they term ""feedback processes"". Right now, these help humanity to avoid the worst impacts of carbon and temperature rises, and include forests, Arctic sea-ice, and methane hydrates on the ocean floor. The worry is that if one of these systems tips over and starts pushing large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, the rest could follow like a row of dominoes. In short, it's not good. Flooding and coastal erosion may be a major problem in a warmer world According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years. The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now. Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable. The impacts would be ""massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive,"" say the authors. The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts. The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C. However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought. ""One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious,"" said Prof RockstrÃ¶m. ""It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought."" What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems. People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century. But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an ""irreversible pathway"" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution. Surprisingly, yes! We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet. ""Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions. ""This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so,"" says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen. So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air. Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as in this model, will be necessary, say the authors The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth. Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound. ""As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord',"" said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK. ""Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for â thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth."" Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced. ""Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,"" said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London. ""At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero.""

Law change call over online doctor sites,"This video can not be played Nicki and Eleanor both managed to buy prescription-only drugs through online doctor sites England's healthcare regulator is calling for a change in the law to protect patients using online doctor sites selling prescription-only drugs. It comes after a BBC Panorama investigation exposed safety concerns relating to websites using doctors from companies based outside England. The Care Quality Commission said these websites could be ""dangerous"". Currently, it can only inspect websites employing doctors contracted by companies in England. Former doctor Julian Eden set up the UK's first online doctor service called E-Med nearly 20 years ago. In 2009 he was struck off after prescribing through the service to a 16-year-old boy and a woman who became addicted to prescription drugs. Five years later, together with his now wife, he set up another company called EuroRX, a doctor hire company based in Romania. Mr Eden can no longer prescribe drugs, but the doctors contracted by his Romanian company can. Panorama put the quality of the service provided by his doctors to the test with the help of some volunteers. The programme asked them to see if they could buy drugs their own GPs would be highly unlikely to prescribe to them. Eleanor was able to purchase prescription slimming pills from an online doctor site Eleanor, who was treated for anorexia when she was a teenager and is completely well now, was able to order three months' worth of prescription slimming pills from one online doctor site. She filled in a questionnaire giving a false medical history and was asked to pay for the drugs via another Romanian company before her answers were reviewed by a doctor. The drugs were prescribed by a Romanian doctor hired through EuroRX and delivered within days. Eleanor said: ""I've got so many diet pills here and if I'd still been in the depths of my illness it would have been so dangerous for me."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, told Panorama: ""I'm horrified to see some of those sites that you showed me, to see that you click on the drug first, and then you go through the consultation, and just how easy it was to circumvent the process. ""This isn't right. It's not safe. It has to be sorted."" Dr Faye Kirkland speaking to Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard The site visited by Eleanor cannot be inspected by the CQC because the doctors it uses are contracted by a company based outside England. Prof Steve Field, chief inspector of general practice for the Care Quality Commission, said: ""You should look for the CQC logo because some of these websites, if they are not regulated by the CQC, can be very, very dangerous."" He said they were making sure that patients were safe and getting effective care when a company is based in England. But he said the law did not allow the CQC ""to have any oversight over companies outside England and that is a real problem"". Mr Eden has had several run-ins with the CQC. E-Med now only sells one drug following inspections by the regulator, prompted by patient safety concerns. Panorama went undercover posing as potential investors and filmed Mr Eden. Julian Eden speaking to Panorama's undercover reporter He described the CQC as ""idiots"" and said he was fed up with regulatory bodies and their auditing rules. ""I'm not gonna do that - if the patient whinges, you give them their money back,"" Mr Eden said. Mr Eden later told Panorama that he respects the CQC and has never sought to evade its oversight. He says his shareholding in EuroRX is simply a sensible business investment in wider markets, all of which are subject to their own regulators. Panorama has discovered another UK-based online doctor site using the same Romanian loophole. UK Meds cannot be regulated by the CQC because it hires doctors to do consultations and prescriptions through its sister company EU General Practitioners in Romania. The site, which has already made Â£1.7m profit since it was set up in 2016, is promoted by celebrity doctor Christian Jessen. Panorama showed the site to Gino Martini, chief scientist for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. He said: ""As a professional body we do not support promotion of prescription-only medicines. ""What I saw on that website was direct promotion to patients, so it is something we wouldn't support and is something we should really raise with the drug regulators as not being appropriate."" Dr Christian Jessen After Panorama wrote to Dr Jessen and UK Meds, the videos featuring him were ""temporarily unavailable"" before a ""clarification notice"" was added saying: ""This video is for information purposes only. If you have any specific concerns about your health please consult your GP."" UK Meds said the changes to their website were nothing to do with Panorama. A spokesperson for Dr Jessen told Panorama he was engaged by UK Meds to present short information videos about various medical conditions and that he does not prescribe medication, nor does he endorse a specific product, service or brand. UK Meds told the programme that patient care and safety is at the core of its business, it is regulated by the UK drug regulator, the MHRA and the General Pharmaceutical Council and complies with all their regulations. It added the doctors it contracts through the Romanian company, EU General Practitioners, are all GMC-registered. Panorama contacted all relevant UK regulators with the results of its investigation as well as the Department of Health and Social Care. Prof Field said: ""As a GP it makes me very angry that patients are put at risk and as a regulator it makes me even more certain that we need to try and get the legislation changed so that people can't just bypass our regulatory activities.""

Johnson burka 'letter box' jibe sparks anger,"Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has been accused of Islamophobia after saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"". He said he was against bans on face-covering veils in public places, in his Telegraph column, but that it was ""ridiculous"" people chose to wear them. The Muslim Council of Britain accused him of ""pandering to the far right"". Labour MP Jess Phillips said she would report Mr Johnson to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The Muslim Council of Britain said the comments were ""particularly regrettable in this current climate, where Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hatred is becoming worryingly pervasive"". Denmark woman fined for wearing veil Brexit dream dying, Johnson tells May Profile: Boris Johnson The group said that the government had shown ""little action"" to tackle anti-Muslim hate and repeated its call for an inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservative Party. The chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Mohammed Amin, said the article was ""anti-Muslim"" and would ""whip up hatred of women who wear the niqab and burqa"". ""Boris Johnson is a master of the English language - he must understand exactly what effect his language will have. I find it deplorable he chose to write such an article,"" he said. The imam of Finsbury Park mosque, Mohammed Mahmoud, has, meanwhile, accused the government of failing to show ""meaningful engagement"" with the Muslim community. In an article for the Evening Standard,external, Mr Mahmoud, who was praised forhis response to last year's terror attack on his mosque, criticised the government's ""lacklustre"" efforts to fight Islamophobia. Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet, accused Mr Johnson of indulging in ""dog whistle"" politics. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation"". Denmark has seen protests against the veil ban Labour MPs accused of him of stoking Islamophobia to boost his ambitions of becoming the next Conservative leader. Labour MP David Lammy said: ""Muslim women are having their burkas pulled off by thugs in our streets and Boris Johnson's response is to mock them for 'looking like letter boxes'. ""Our pound-shop Donald Trump is fanning the flames of Islamophobia to propel his grubby electoral ambitions."" Labour MP Stella Creasy said the former foreign secretary was in danger of ""going full Morrissey"" - a reference to the former Smiths singer whose comments on immigration have sparked controversy. Her advice to Mr Johnson was that ""being a buffoon, not being a racist and misogynist, [is] more British"". Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Christine Jardine said Mr Johnson had ""proven himself to be a xenophobe"". ""This desperate pitch to stay in the news completely disregards the women who are facing daily discrimination on our streets,"" she added. Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""The long-standing government position on this is clear, that we do not support a ban on the wearing of the veil in public. ""Such a prescriptive approach would be not in keeping with British values of religious tolerance and gender equality.""

Thousands relocated after Indonesia quake,"This video can not be played Moment the quake struck caught on camera About 20,000 people have lost their homes and many moved to unaffected areas of the Indonesian island of Lombok after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake left nearly 100 people dead. Boats were sent to evacuate about 2,000 tourists from the nearby Gili islands. Witnesses spoke of chaos and terror during Sunday's quake, with thousands of buildings damaged, and power and communication lines cut. Aid agencies said the priority was to provide shelter for residents. Many are said to be too scared to return to their homes. The agencies said the impact was far bigger than another quake that hitLombok last week, killing 16 people. In pictures: Damaged homes and evacuations in Lombok President Joko Widodo urged the speedy evacuation of casualties, calling for more flights to be sent to the affected areas. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, said that the northern area of Lombok had suffered massive damage. Three C-130 Hercules transporter aircraft and two helicopters have been deployed to deliver tents and medical aid, but the earthquake has brought down roads and bridges, making areas difficult to reach. Electricity supply in the worst-affected areas has been cut off and telecommunication networks are not working. Staff take patients outside as a safety measure at a hospital in Mataram The death toll stands at 98, all Indonesians, but Mr Sutopo said that number would ""definitely increase"". At least another 230 people have been injured. He pointed to the situation at a collapsed mosque in the village of Lading-Lading in north Lombok, where a lack of heavy lifting equipment had made it difficult to locate victims. One official said 80% of north Lombok had suffered damage. The main city of Mataram was also badly affected, with medical staff struggling to cope with the injured at the damaged hospitals. Situated off the north-west of Lombok and popular with backpackers and divers, they were badly hit, with a number of hotels damaged. Video and still images showed hundreds of tourists flocking to the beach to be evacuated. There have been reports of deaths on the islands but these have not been confirmed. British tourist Mike Bennett told the BBC that thousands of tourists had been taken off by boat, but not everyone had been evacuated by the time night fell on Monday. ""We're here with maybe about 100 people, it's getting dark now. There's no power, there's no water,"" he said. ""We're just going to hold out and see what happens tomorrow."" Tourists await evacuation on Gili Trawangan ""We cannot evacuate all of them all at once because we don't have enough capacity on the boats,"" Muhammad Faozal, of West Nusa Tenggara's tourism agency, told AFP. ""It's understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking."" The UK Foreign Office said it was working with Indonesian authorities to help British people affected, and that extra flights were being added for people who wished to leave Lombok. Helen Milne told the BBC that her daughter, Laura, from Oxfordshire in the UK, was on the island of Gili Trawangan. She said: ""They are stuck on the island and are reporting rioting, fighting, and people can't get on boats. There's no water, no food, the shops have been ransacked. It's a rapidly deteriorating situation out there for them."" Another Briton on Gili Trawangan, James Kelsall, told the Press Association the subsequent tsunami warning was the most terrifying part. ""All the locals were frantically running and screaming, putting on life jackets. We followed them up to higher ground, which was a steep, uneven climb to the top of a hill in darkness."" The tsunami warning was lifted after a few hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Margret Helgadottir, from Iceland, told Agence France-Presse people screamed as the roof of her hotel on Gili Air collapsed. ""We just froze, thankfully we were outside. Everything went black, it was terrible."" Phillipa Hodge told the BBC she was eating at the Katamaran Hotel Sengiggi just north of Mataram, with friends. ""The lights went out... that's when it became chaotic. People were falling over each other trying to get out, and glass was shattering. We felt debris fall on to us. ""I couldn't see my partner and I was shouting his name. Finally we found each other and he had blood all over his face and shirt."" Dini Widiastuti, executive director of Plan International Indonesia, told the BBC that the top priority was to provide shelter. ""Thousands of people, including children, are still just out in the fields, not properly protected.  The impact is very widespread in Lombok and actually this is bigger than the first earthquake last week, so it is difficult."" Meili Narti, from Oxfam, said the government was trying to set up centres to which people could safely evacuate, but colleagues were saying some people did not have sufficient food, water or shelter. At least one death has been reported unofficially but it has not been confirmed. The airport has suffered some damage but is operating. The quake was felt for several seconds. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" he said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"".

Flooding and coastal erosion may be a major problem in a warmer world According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years. The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now. Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable. The impacts would be ""massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive,"" say the authors. The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts. The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C. However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought. ""One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious,"" said Prof RockstrÃ¶m. ""It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought."" What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems. People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century. But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an ""irreversible pathway"" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution. Surprisingly, yes! We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet. ""Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions. ""This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so,"" says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen. So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air. Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as in this model, will be necessary, say the authors The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth. Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound. ""As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord',"" said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK. ""Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for â thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth."" Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced. ""Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,"" said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London. ""At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero.""

Warmer weather 'could last until October',"The UK's warmer than average weather could last until October, the Met Office says. In abriefing,externalfor local authorities it says above-average temperatures are more likely than below-average temperatures for the next three months. Fresher, cooler temperatures are expected from the middle of this week, lasting throughout the weekend. But the Met Office analysis suggests warm, dry conditions could return and continue into the autumn. The three-month outlook shows an increased chance of stable weather conditions, bringing warmer than average temperatures and below-average rainfall. However the increase could be just one or two degrees above average temperatures - which are 19C, 16C and 13C for August, September and October respectively. How long will it last? Your heatwave questions The side effects of the European heatwave Portugal battles blazes as Europe bakes Heatwave causing farmers 'serious concern' A Met Office spokesperson stressed the outlook gave a ""general trend"" for the period rather than a ""detailed forecast"". ""We need to remember that this is an average for the whole of the UK over a three-month period and so there will be variations in weather from day to day and week to week, over the whole of the UK,"" they said. ""Although temperatures are more likely to be warmer than average over the three months, this doesn't mean wall-to-wall sunshine, it can still be warm and cloudy."" This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 In the short term temperatures are set to top 30C in some parts of the UK on Monday. On Tuesday temperatures could peak at 34C in Essex or Norfolk, the Met Office said. However much of Scotland and Northern Ireland will start the week with some rain. And maximum temperatures are likely to dip to around the mid-20s by Wednesday. Police horses have a cooling drink from a fountain in Green Park, London Forecaster Dean Hall said there will be ""quite a marked change to the feel of things"" from the middle of the week as conditions turn ""fresher and more changeable"". It is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, he said, with ""no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days"". People flocked to Woolacombe Beach in North Devon over the weekend Canada geese at the Walthamstow Wetlands in east London It comes amid a sweltering European heatwave, with Portugal and Spain being hit by the hottest temperatures. British holidaymakers are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. Last week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, while Lisbon broke a 37-year-old record with temperatures reaching 44C on Sunday. Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country and hot, dry conditions have led to several wildfires. Portugal has been hit by wildfires as temperatures topped 40C In Spain, heat warnings were issued for 41 of the country's 50 provinces. The conditions played a part in the deaths of two men, one in Barcelona and the other in the southern region of Murcia, according to Spanish authorities. People cool off in a fountain in Madrid By David Shukman, BBC science editor Extreme heat is a challenge for millions of people in large parts of the world. Of course it can be a blessing for anyone on holiday. And it's certainly easier to tolerate if buildings are designed to cope with high temperatures - with Mediterranean-style shutters and deep balconies and bright reflective walls. But for the elderly and the very young and for people who have to work outside, such as construction workers and farmers, finding respite can be difficult. The obvious solution is air conditioning. The former leader of sweltering Singapore once said aircon was the key to his country's remarkable success. But chilling a room involves displacing the heat - it has to go somewhere, and that means boosting temperatures outdoors. In a city, already warmer than the surrounding countryside, it's like turning up an oven. For climate scientists, none of this is a big surprise. As far back as 1990, a UN panel warned that global warming would mean more extremes of heat of the kind we're seeing right now. How long will it last?

Girls self-harm hospital figures double,"Kay says there's still a lot of stigma around seeking help for self-harm Kay Ska self-harmed for two years and one of the reasons was because she didn't know how to deal with her feelings ""in a healthy way"". ""I think it was just a lot of confusion, hormones and a lot of image issues,"" she told Newsbeat. The 23-year-old is speaking out after figures from the NHS show the number of girls admitted to hospital for self-harm has almost doubled in two decades. The NSPCC says the statistics are  ""sadly unsurprising"". Kay, from Lancashire, has struggled with mental health issues, such as depression, eating disorders, self-harm and PTSD. She runs a blog where people share their mental health stories. ""I really didn't like myself at the time when I self-harmed, I was very negative and in a very low place and I was angry at myself and the world around me."" NHS figures show girls aged 18 and under were admitted to hospital 13,463 times in 2017 - up from 7,327 times in 1997. Common reasons behind self-harming include depression, bullying, pressure at school, emotional abuse, grieving or having relationship problems with family or friends, according to the NSPCC. The same rise hasn't been reflected in boys however - with figures showing admissions of around 2,000 have stayed the same in the last 20 years. Kay thinks the rise in admissions for girls has a lot to do with the pressure that the media puts on women. ""I think media has had such a huge and bad impact for women because you don't see them doing that to guys,"" she says. ""In almost every single magazine they are body shaming women."" She says social media has a significant part to play too. ""People are following perfect social media accounts and they think that the airbrushed photos are true and it's all real when it isn't."" Both Kay and the NSPCC say social media has a huge impact on teenage girls The NSPCC said the figures were ""heartbreaking"" but ""sadly unsurprising"". Chris Cloke, head of safeguarding in communities, also believes social media is a contributing factor as to why more girls are being admitted than boys. ""They're bombarded 24 hours a day with these perfect images and we know if you're a young person, if you're a girl, you're very conscious of what you look like, what you feel and what other people are doing and this of course also puts pressures on you. ""If you've got problems in one area, they can all add up and they may lead children to be very vulnerable and that may lead them to self-harm."" He said he would encourage anyone who is experiencing mental health issues or thinking about self-harming to tell someone. A Department of Health spokesman said an extra Â£300m will be invested to provide extra help in schools, including training staff to support children faster.

Gangsters jailed after man's ears cut off,"Kisa Kasambara and Michael Huxley were jailed for 15 and 12 years respectively A man who hacked off his victim's ears in a ""horrific"" gangland assault has been jailed, along with an accomplice. Kisa Kasambara, 35, carried out the attack on Karl Warrilow over a Â£2,000 debt after Michael Huxley, 32, had lured him into a car in Liverpool. Kasambara and Huxley were jailed for 15 and 12 years respectively for kidnap and wounding with intent. Nicholas Thompson, the man behind the attack, called Mr Warrilow afterwards asking: ""How's life with no ears?"" Kasambara's and Huxley's trial at Liverpool Crown Court heard how Mr Warrilow had been asked to collect Â£2,000 by Thompson, who was serving a prison sentence. Mr Warrilow was kidnapped in West Derby in March 2017 after spending the money instead of passing it on. The court heard a dog chain was placed around his neck before he was driven to a disused railway siding where the attack took place. Thompson, 35, of Edge Lane Drive, Liverpool, and another man, Kenneth Dean, 34, of Upper Warwick Street, Liverpool, were jailed in March for 18 years and 15 years respectively at Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty of kidnap and wounding with intent. Judge Neil Flewitt QC said that Huxley, of Edge Lane, Old Swan, had played a subordinate role and showed remorse after the attack, but had tricked Mr Warrilow into his car and ""served him up on a plate for the others"". The judge described Kasambara, of St Joseph's Close, Huyton, as a ""dangerous offender"" and said he would continue to pose a risk to the public. Det Ch Insp John Webster said: ""This was a brutal and planned attack. ""The injuries sustained were horrific, including severed ears, and as a result he will face permanent facial disfigurement in addition to the devastating psychological impact this will have undoubtedly caused.""

Panorama error broke broadcasting rules,"The BBC's Panorama broke broadcasting rules by mistakenly revealing the first name of a teenager who was meant to be anonymous, TV watchdog Ofcom has said. The 2016 episodeincluded undercover footage of alleged abuse at a secure training centre in Kent. The BBC said the ""genuine error"" was a result of ""extreme time pressures"" when the show was brought forward by a week. But Ofcom ruled the 14-year-old was named because the BBC ""failed to check and review its content sufficiently"". Panorama filmed at Medway Secure Training Centre in 2015, and the resulting programme was brought forward in the schedules when G4S, the company responsible for running the facility, issued a press release referring to ""serious allegations"". The boy in question was given the pseudonym Billy in the programme, but Ofcom said there was one ""clearly audible"" instance of his real name being used when the undercover reporter talked to camera about his alleged mistreatment. The BBC said the ""unfortunate consequence of the decision to bring forward the transmission date was that reference to the boy's real first name was inadvertently included"". The corporation said the oversight hadn't led to any negative consequences or to him being identified by anyone he didn't already know. However, Ofcom's ruling said it was ""a significant error which had the potential to undermine a vulnerable young person's care and lead to negative consequences for him"". In a statement, an Ofcom spokeswoman said there had been ""some serious lapses in the production process"". She said: ""Clearly there was significant public interest in the programme's exposure of the alleged mistreatment of young offenders, but the BBC had a responsibility to safeguard the privacy of all the young people involved."" Despite this, Ofcom said they would not be levying a sanction in this case. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We accept and regret that due to extreme time pressures, the programme team inadvertently broadcast the real first name of a minor in the initial transmission. The BBC said it 'accepted and regretted' the error ""Panorama took immediate steps to correct the programme on iPlayer and there have been no negative consequences as a result, with the boy's mother saying that he has not been identified by those who did not already know him. ""We are pleased that Ofcom have acknowledged the clear and significant public interest in this investigation which exposed the mistreatment and bullying of young people and led to G4S losing the contract to run Medway Secure Training Centre as well as a serious case review."" The serious case reviewis expected to report later this year. The programme resulted in seven members of staff being suspended and four being sacked. Police also took action, leading to a trial.In March, four men were clearedof misconduct in a public office over their actions at the facility.

US to fully enforce restored Iran sanctions,"President Donald Trump says the Iran nuclear accord was a ""horrible, one-sided deal"" President Donald Trump says he will fully enforce the sanctions being reimposed on Iran as a result of the US withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal. Measures targeting Iran's automotive sector as well as its trade in gold and other key metals will take effect from 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Trump believes the economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal,externaland end its ""malign"" activities. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said the act was ""psychological warfare"". Responding on Iranian state television, Mr Rouhani rejected the idea of last-minute talks. ""We are always in favour of diplomacy and talks... but talks need honesty,"" he said.

The UK, France and Germany - which were also parties to the 2015 accord along with Russia and China - have expressed ""deep regret"" at the US move. They have pledged to abide by their commitments under the deal. Iran has said it will also do so if it continues to receive the economic benefits.

Child abuse lawyer and policeman jailed,"John Ryan-Guess and Dean Roberts met in an online chat room A police officer who raped a toddler has been jailed along with a Welsh Government lawyer for his part in child sex abuse. South Wales Police officer Dean Roberts got 12 years after admitting one count of rape and five indecent assaults. Lawyer John Ryan-Guess was handed 20 years for 37 charges, including sexual assault and making indecent images. Cardiff Crown Court heard Ryan-Guess, 43, also admitted aiding and abetting Roberts to commit sexual assault. The pair had met on an online chat forum called Kik. Prosecutor James Wilson said Ryan-Guess also filmed young girls in public, including at a supermarket and a swimming pool. After police found videos on his phone of him carrying out sexual assaults on children, he told officers he had been interested in young girls all his life and found them arousing. Ryan-Guess, who no longer works for the Welsh Government, found out about the Kik online messenger service where he shared thousands of images, as well as one live stream of him abusing a child. The men were sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court He said he felt Kik ""normalised"" his behaviour because he could chat to and share material with like-minded people. Recorder of Cardiff Eleri Rees called him a ""sexual predator"" who took ""any opportunity"" to offend. She said his offences escalated from voyeurism to touching and ""it would have been a matter of time"" before he raped a child had he not been caught. In a victim impact statement, the mother of one of his victims said she felt ""tormented"" by the knowledge he had preyed on her daughter. She said her daughter was having therapy to try and come to terms with what happened. Roberts, 48, from Bridgend, who was a serving police officer when caught, also admitted possessing and distributing indecent material of his assaults. The court heard Ryan-Guess and Roberts discussed abusing a girl and indecent images of her were shared on the site. Roberts and Ryan-Guess also met for what was described as a ""sexual encounter"". The judge told Roberts: ""You are dangerous and pose a significant risk."" John Ryan-Guess during his days as a Welsh Government lawyer South Wales Police Det Supt Wendy Gunney said: ""The two people responsible for the appalling abuse of a number of very young children have now been brought to justice. ""The investigation uncovered extremely disturbing child abuse evidence and the guilty pleas have ensured that the jury were spared from viewing evidence that would have been extremely traumatic."" The NSPCC has called for ""tough measures"" to make social media companies do more to protect children online. A spokesman added: ""Abusers increasingly use the internet not only to target and groom their young victims, but to communicate with each other. ""This case shows again how sickening child abuse footage is often shared within groups of like-minded offenders.""

""I was not employed by the NHS, but by an advertising agency who hold a pre-agreed budget of the whole of the campaign,"" the Salford-based actress and playwrightwrote on Twitter.,external ""If I had refused the fee, the money wouldn't have been returned to the NHS, but to the commercial agency."" The ad was launched last month,externalto highlight the work of staff in the health service. Last year, she fronted a Labour Party election broadcast in which she said: ""Under the Tories, our NHS and social care has been pushed into a state of emergency."" In the Mail on Sunday, Mr Hart said: ""It is hypocritical to deliver attacks on the government for cutting public spending and then pocket taxpayers' money to voice over an advertisement for more nurses. ""I'd have more respect for Maxine if she had forgone the fee and left it with the health service to recruit another nurse."" The actress is patron of The Salford Foundation Trust, which gives grants to allow children and young people in the area to develop hobbies, interests, skills and talents. ""I chose to support the Trust as I believe strongly in the life-enhancing and life-changing work they do,"" Peake added in her Twitter message. ""Thank you to the Mail on Sunday for allowing me to highlight the wonderful and tireless work of The Salford Foundation Trust."" An NHS England spokesman said: ""We Are The NHS is a major multimillion pound campaign to encourage potential recruits to consider a career in the NHS and help fill the 100,000 vacancies that exist in the service. ""Maxine Peake offered her support at a significantly reduced rate to that which would normally apply for campaign of this scale."" A spokesman for Peake said: """"Maxine has participated in a number of charity voice overs over the last few years including MacMillan Nurses, the NSPCC and Cancer Research, which have either paid a nominal fee or in some cases no fee at all.

'No plans' for same-sex couples on Strictly,"Strictly Come Dancing has ""no plans"" to include same-sex couples on the show this year, the BBC has confirmed. A spokesman for the show said: ""Strictly has chosen the longstanding ballroom dancing format of mixed-sex couples."" The issue has previously divided opinion among former contestants. Last year,Judge Rinder said,external: ""Would it be a big step forward for the LGBTQI community if there were same-sex couples on Strictly? Do me a favour!"" But he now seems to have had a change of heart,telling The Telegraph,external: ""It would be great if it happens, visibility really does matter."" Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, who competed in 2014, said: ""It's all in the hands of the producers, although apparently [having same-sex couples] doesn't work as well in things like ballroom."" On Twitter, opinion was divided. One user agreed with the BBC's decision, adding that it would alienate some audiences: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last year, Strictly contestant Reverend Richard Coles said it made ""no sense that anybody resists the idea"" of same-sex contestants dancing together. His comments came after fellow contestant Susan Calman, who is openly gay, was criticised on social media by LGBT activists for not having a female professional partner. Calman responded: ""I wanted to dance with a man. I am not being held hostage by the BBC. I'm still well gay and proud of it."" Susan Calman admitted to Tess Daly she was a Kevin Clifton superfan Calman was partnered with Kevin Clifton whilst Coles was partnered with Dianne Buswell during their time on the contest. Last year, Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood said he was ""hopeful"" that there would be same-sex couples in the show. ""I think same-sex couples can exist,"" he told ITV's Lorraine. ""You only have to decide who's going to go backwards really, that's the only difference. ""If you consider the tango was originally danced between two men anyway... It's powerful, explosive, and the same can happen between two women."" Same-sex couples get the head judge's approval Another judge who was in favour of same-sex couples appearing on the show was the head judge, Shirley Ballas who called the idea ""marvellous"" earlier this year. She also mentioned US show Dancing with the Stars, where Cher's son Chaz Bono, who was born female, performed with a woman in 2011. ""If they were to do that I would embrace it. Whatever choices people make I'll be fine with,"" Ballas said. In 2010, Israel's version of Dancing with the Stars included a same-sex couple which featured TV presenter Gili Shem Tov who was partnered with professional dancer Dorit Milman. The couple took turns on the traditional male role of leading the dances. ""Because I share my life with a woman and have a family with her, to me this is the most natural thing to do."" Tov said.

Women-only network appoints male head,"AllBright co-founders Debbie Wosskow and Anna Jones A networking group with the aim of supporting female leaders has been criticised for appointing a male chairman. AllBright announced that Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-operative Group, had taken the role. The privately-run group describes itself as ""the network for working women in the UK"". Co-founder Debbie Wosskow defended the decision, saying that to create change you ""need to bring men with you"". The group was founded in 2016 by Debbie Wosskow OBE, who launched home exchange website LoveHomeSwap, and Anna Jones, former chief executive of publishing house Hearst. The London-based group's activities include a private members' club and an academy for helping women grow their businesses. It has attracted well-known members, including actress Naomie Harris and newsreader Sarah-Jane Mee. AllBright's women-only focus extends to exclusively sourcing the wine and art in its club from female producers. ""Of course we need men on board,"" comedian Kate Smurthwaite told the BBC's Today Programme. ""How can we get anywhere until men are willing to share their power? What I'm not entirely convinced about is having men in charge."" She suggested that by appointing a man, AllBright is allowing him to ""take the public glory as it were, and have that high-profile role"". Ms Wosskow, also speaking on Today, emphasised that the group's female co-founders remained in charge. ""There's a very, very interesting dynamic that takes place when women are signing men into a club that celebrates women,"" she said. To support women with their business ideas, AllBright also manages an ""angel syndicate network"". An angel investor is an early backer of a company that puts up money in return for a stake in the business. Highlighting how early business investing is a male-dominated field, she added: ""Only 14% of angel investors are women."" According to a recent report, the number of women in executive positions in the UK declined in 2018. Cranfield School of Management'sFemale FTSE Index,externalfound just 30 women in full-time executive roles at FTSE 250 firms, down from 38 in 2017. The figures for FTSE 100 firms stayed the same, with 25 women holding executive roles at 22 companies. The Women's Equality Party told the Times newspaper that the decision to appoint Mr Leighton ""seems at odds with [AllBright's] mission to change the way the world thinks about female-led businesses"".

On Monday, Facebook removed the InfoWars page on its platform for ""using hate speech"", and Alex Jones' channel on YouTube was ""terminated"".

He has also claimed that many of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre were actors. The parents of two children shot in that attack are suing him for defamation, saying he had made ""false, cruel, and dangerous assertions"".

World's most Michelin-starred chef dies,"French celebrity chef JoÃ«l Robuchon will be remembered for many reasons: earning more than 30 Michelin stars, creating the world's best mashed potato, and hurling a plate at a young and ""difficult"" Gordon Ramsay. The chef, who has died aged 73, later revealed it was the only plate he had ever thrown during a decades-long career that saw him open restaurants across the world. But it could have been quite different. He initially wanted to be a priest. Luckily for food-lovers everywhere, Robuchon discovered a passion for cooking while working alongside the nuns as a student at a seminary, and at the age of 15 entered his first kitchen as an apprentice. The rest, as they say, is history. Robuchon died from cancer in Switzerland on Monday, according to Le Figaro newspaper, more than a year after being treated for a pancreatic tumour. He was born in Poitiers in 1945, the son of a mason and a stay-at-home mother. The luxurious dishes he would go on to create - langoustine and truffle ravioli, or slow-cooked pigeon with foie gras - would give no hint of this humble beginning. But one of his most famous and beloved recipes was for the humble mashed potato -  or pommes purÃ©e - which, rumour has it, is a 50-50 mix of potato and butter. Robuchon made his name in the early 1980s His dedication to creating the world's best mashed potato is perhaps not surprising. Robuchon was renowned for his perfectionism and for using few ingredients, keeping preparation simple and moving away from the excesses of French nouvelle cuisine - a healthier form of cooking. ""The older I get the more I realise the truth is: the simpler the food, the more exceptional it can be,"" he told Business Insider in 2014. ""I never try to marry more than three flavours in one dish. I like walking into a kitchen and knowing that the dishes are identifiable and the ingredients within them easy to detect."" Is there such a thing as 'the world's best chef'? France mourns star chef Paul Bocuse Why Anthony Bourdain had such global appeal Tributes paid to food critic Jonathan Gold Robuchon made his name in the early 1980s after opening his restaurant Jamin at the age of 36. Within a year it had won a Michelin star. Over his career, Robuchon would amass 31 such stars - the most of any chef, ever. Less than a decade later, in 1989, he was named ""Chef of the Century"" by Michelin's rival restaurant guide, Gault Millau. It was around this time that an aspiring Scottish chef joined his kitchen. Gordon Ramsay, Robuchon later told The Telegraph, was a talented chef,,externalbut had a ""difficult"" attitude - and did not apparently take kindly to being told he had not made a dish of langoustine ravioli properly. ""I told him so and Gordon reacted in a very arrogant manner,"" he recalled. ""This time, it really got on my nerves and so I threw a plate at him."" It was, he added, the only plate he threw in his career. Ramsay does not appear to harbour any hard feelings, posting a tribute to his former mentor after hearing of his death.

In 1995, at the age of 50, Robuchon decided to retire - but that did not seem to mean taking things easy. Instead, he turned his attention to television and hosted several culinary shows on French TV. But he couldn't keep away from the kitchen and a few years later he unveiled plans to open more affordable eateries inspired by Japanese sushi counters. Over time, trends change. In more recent years, he told the Michelin Guide in June 2018, he had created healthier dishes. Last year,the French chef revealed he had lost more than four stone (27kg) in weight,externalafter ditching butter and oil from his diet to deal with high cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. The ""Chef of the Century"" was influenced by Asian - especially Japanese - cuisine He leaves behind a legacy not only in his restaurants - there are currently 12 branches of L'Atelier, including in London, Tokyo, Las Vegas and Beijing - but also in the cooking school he created near the town where he was born. It was, he told the Michelin Guide, something very close to his heart. ""There is a very famous proverb that goes something like this, 'when an old man dies, a library burns down',"" he said.,external""I have seen so many good chefs - some famous, some not - who have gone and, with them, a part of knowledge and tradition is lost and nobody can take it back."" His legacy was at the forefront of many people's minds as they paid tribute to him on Monday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thousands evacuated from Indonesia quake,"This video can not be played Moment the quake struck caught on camera About 20,000 people have lost their homes and many moved to unaffected areas of the Indonesian island of Lombok after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake left nearly 100 people dead. Boats were sent to evacuate about 2,000 tourists from the nearby Gili islands. Witnesses spoke of chaos and terror during Sunday's quake, with thousands of buildings damaged, and power and communication lines cut. Aid agencies said the priority was to provide shelter for residents. Many are said to be too scared to return to their homes. The agencies said the impact was far bigger than another quake that hitLombok last week, killing 16 people. In pictures: Damaged homes and evacuations in Lombok President Joko Widodo urged the speedy evacuation of casualties, calling for more flights to be sent to the affected areas. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, said that the northern area of Lombok had suffered massive damage. Three C-130 Hercules transporter aircraft and two helicopters have been deployed to deliver tents and medical aid, but the earthquake has brought down roads and bridges, making areas difficult to reach. Electricity supply in the worst-affected areas has been cut off and telecommunication networks are not working. Staff take patients outside as a safety measure at a hospital in Mataram The death toll stands at 98, all Indonesians, but Mr Sutopo said that number would ""definitely increase"". At least another 230 people have been injured. He pointed to the situation at a collapsed mosque in the village of Lading-Lading in north Lombok, where a lack of heavy lifting equipment had made it difficult to locate victims. One official said 80% of north Lombok had suffered damage. The main city of Mataram was also badly affected, with medical staff struggling to cope with the injured at the damaged hospitals. Situated off the north-west of Lombok and popular with backpackers and divers, they were badly hit, with a number of hotels damaged. Video and still images showed hundreds of tourists flocking to the beach to be evacuated. There have been reports of deaths on the islands but these have not been confirmed. British tourist Mike Bennett told the BBC that thousands of tourists had been taken off by boat, but not everyone had been evacuated by the time night fell on Monday. ""We're here with maybe about 100 people, it's getting dark now. There's no power, there's no water,"" he said. ""We're just going to hold out and see what happens tomorrow."" Tourists await evacuation on Gili Trawangan ""We cannot evacuate all of them all at once because we don't have enough capacity on the boats,"" Muhammad Faozal, of West Nusa Tenggara's tourism agency, told AFP. ""It's understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking."" The UK Foreign Office said it was working with Indonesian authorities to help British people affected, and that extra flights were being added for people who wished to leave Lombok. Helen Milne told the BBC that her daughter, Laura, from Oxfordshire in the UK, was on the island of Gili Trawangan. She said: ""They are stuck on the island and are reporting rioting, fighting, and people can't get on boats. There's no water, no food, the shops have been ransacked. It's a rapidly deteriorating situation out there for them."" Another Briton on Gili Trawangan, James Kelsall, told the Press Association the subsequent tsunami warning was the most terrifying part. ""All the locals were frantically running and screaming, putting on life jackets. We followed them up to higher ground, which was a steep, uneven climb to the top of a hill in darkness."" The tsunami warning was lifted after a few hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Margret Helgadottir, from Iceland, told Agence France-Presse people screamed as the roof of her hotel on Gili Air collapsed. ""We just froze, thankfully we were outside. Everything went black, it was terrible."" Phillipa Hodge told the BBC she was eating at the Katamaran Hotel Sengiggi just north of Mataram, with friends. ""The lights went out... that's when it became chaotic. People were falling over each other trying to get out, and glass was shattering. We felt debris fall on to us. ""I couldn't see my partner and I was shouting his name. Finally we found each other and he had blood all over his face and shirt."" Dini Widiastuti, executive director of Plan International Indonesia, told the BBC that the top priority was to provide shelter. ""Thousands of people, including children, are still just out in the fields, not properly protected.  The impact is very widespread in Lombok and actually this is bigger than the first earthquake last week, so it is difficult."" Meili Narti, from Oxfam, said the government was trying to set up centres to which people could safely evacuate, but colleagues were saying some people did not have sufficient food, water or shelter. At least one death has been reported unofficially but it has not been confirmed. The airport has suffered some damage but is operating. The quake was felt for several seconds. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" he said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"". Gary Barlow, best known as lead singer of Take That, said he had been in seven quakes and this was the worst: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theearthquake was of magnitude 6.9, according to the US Geological Survey,external. It struck at 19:46 local time (11:46 GMT) on Sunday at a fairly shallow depth of 31km (19 miles). Are earthquake warnings effective? History of deadly earthquakes There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.

Fentanyl and cocaine drug deaths rise,"The number of deaths in England and Wales due to the synthetic opioid fentanyl rose by 29% in 2017,Office for National Statistics data shows,external. Forms of the drug - used to treat cancer pain - are often imported illegally from Chinese laboratories and sold to users via the dark web. Deaths from psychoactive substances like spice or mephedrone halved. Drug policy campaigners called on the government to fund drug treatment and stop criminalising users. ""The UK government has nowhere left to hide. They are responsible for vulnerable people dying in droves,"" Martin Powell from Transform Drug Policy Foundation said. He accused politicians of blocking, or refusing to fund, measures proven to save lives in other countries. Last year heroin and morphine related deaths decreased for the first time since 2012, while cocaine deaths rose. In total, 3,756 people were recorded as dying from legal and illegal drugs in England and Wales in 2017. The ONS said this figure had ""remained stable"", with only 12 more deaths than the year previous. Two thirds of these deaths were accidental, related to drug misuse, the ONS added. This video can not be played Robert Fraser died just weeks after his 18th birthday, having taken fentanyl The number of fentanyl deaths increased from 58 in 2016 to 75 in 2017. The drug has been found mixed with heroin, causing accidental overdoses in users. The most dangerous version of the opioid, known as carfentanyl, was behind 27 accidental fatalities during the year - the first time it has been recorded in death certificates. Harry Shapiro, director of DrugWise, said the fentanyl creeping into UK drug supplies was at least 100 times stronger than other class A drugs and that a tiny amount can be fatal. Fentanyl: The painkiller that killed my son Inside Leeds gang's Fentanyl factory The people who are really using cocaine Reality Check: Is UK the 'drugs market of Europe'? Meanwhile there were 432 deaths related to cocaine in 2017 - the highest amount ever recorded. Earlier this year, security minister Ben Wallace warned the UK was ""fast becomingthe biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe"". England and Wales's rate of 66.1 drug deaths per 1 million, is now more than three times the rate for the EU, Turkey and Norway (according to figures from theEuropean Drug Report,external). The latest data showed the north east of England had a significantly higher rate of drug deaths than other regions - 83 per million people - followed by the north west of England and Wales. London had the lowest number of deaths. In Scotland,drug deaths hit a record highin 2017 and were the worst in Europe, figures revealed last month. By BBC Home Editor, Mark Easton Behind the record numbers of deaths from drug poisoning is a row over cuts. In 2016, the government's official drugs advisory body told ministers the most important way to reduce drug deaths was to protect funding for opioid substitution therapy (OST) - prescribing medicines such as methadone or diamorphine (pharmaceutical heroin) to street heroin users. More than half the drug deaths last year were from overdoses of opiates, including heroin, and OST is credited with saving hundreds of lives every year. Responding to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommendations last year, the Home Office accepted the advice on OST ""in full"", agreeing it ""has a widely-recognised and evidenced protective effect in helping to reduce deaths from overdoses"". However, funding for such drug therapy comes from the public health grant distributed to local councils, and that has been cut by hundreds of millions of pounds a year, as part of the government's measures to reduce the deficit. It is estimated that council spending on adult drug treatment will have fallen 26% since 2014. Consultant addiction psychiatrist Dr Emily Finch told the Today programme there's been around a 30% loss in funding for drug and alcohol treatment services in the last 5-10 years. ""Generally speaking, the system is less and less fit for purpose,"" she said. ""Being in treatment protects against deaths."" Prof Fiona Measham who, along with Dr Finch, is a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, also called for an increase for drug treatment funding. She said that for many, drug use is a ""symptom"" of past trauma, abuse or current problems in their lives, rather than ""the core of the problem itself"". ""The big concern for us in relation to recreational drug users is the five-fold increase in ecstasy deaths and the three-fold increase in cocaine related deaths,"" she said, adding that these were being caused by higher purity or contaminated substances being sold.

Rapist cop's prison release sparks outcry,"Mitchell resigned from the Northumbria police force when he was convicted in 2011 A Northumbria Police officer handed two life sentences in prison in 2011 for rape has been released, it has emerged. Stephen Mitchell was found guilty of carrying out sex attacks on vulnerable women he met when on duty in Newcastle. The sentencing judge at Newcastle Crown Court had warned the ""ruthless sexual predator"" he may never be released. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee has called upon the justice secretary for an ""urgent update"" into the decision to free him. His trial heard that Mitchell targeted vulnerable women, including heroin addicts and shoplifters, by offering to help them while they were in custody at Newcastle's Pilgrim Street police station and then asked them for sexual favours. He told one of his victims that if she complained, ""no-one would believe a junkie"". Sentencing him, Mr Justice Wilkie said the officer had ""ruthlessly exploited"" his victims for his own pleasure and ""degraded them repeatedly"". He said Mitchell would serve at least seven-and-a-half years in jail before being considered for parole. ""Thereafter, you will only be released, if at all, if the parole board has concluded it is safe and in the public interest ... that may not be for many years, if for ever."" Ms Cooper said: ""This case is disturbing and incomprehensible. ""For someone who has committed such appalling crimes and been told that they may not be released for many years, if ever, to then be subject to release on parole after only seven-and-a-half years is just impossible to understand. ""We urgently need to know what the Parole Board's reasons were because to most people this really does not look like justice for victims."" Some of the offences took place at the former police station in Pilgrim Street The Parole Board said in a statement: ""We can confirm that a panel of the Parole Board directed the release of Mr Stephen Mitchell, following an oral hearing in September 2017. ""Parole Board decisions are solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release. The panel will have carefully looked at a whole range of evidence, including details of the original evidence and any evidence of behaviour change. ""We do that with great care and public safety is our number one priority."" It said it was unable to provide details of Mitchell's actual release date.

BA boss demands action on Heathrow queues,"The boss of British Airways has criticised long queues at Heathrow, saying arrivals face two-hour waits to get through border control. Alex Cruz haswritten a letter to the Times,externalsaying queues at the London airport are ""significantly worse"" than other major hubs across the world. The letter is in response to proposals for ""UK-only"" lines after Brexit. The Home Office said most of those arriving at Heathrow passed border control within agreed time limits. These are 25 minutes for EEA (European Economic Area) nationals, and 45 minutes for those coming in from outside that region. Mr Cruz said UK-only lines were a matter for government, but its priority should be preventing long queues now. The airline chief executive called on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to ""take immediate action to address this border farce"". Cabinet approves new Heathrow runway Reality Check: Would a 'no deal' Brexit prevent planes flying? Mr Cruz said although the target wait for non-EEA travellers coming into Heathrow was 45 minutes, two hours was ""fast becoming the norm"". The BA boss said the target was missed 8,298 times last year and the number had already reached more than 6,000 for 2018. He also said that those from within the EEA wait almost an hour. Adrian Felton, 45, and his family from West Sussex were frustrated by queue times when they arrived at Terminal 5 from Nice last Friday. ""We queued for well over an hour to get through passport control. As we have young children we could not use the e-gates. There were only four border control desks open for a full arrivals hall. After about an hour more desks were opened, but too late. ""I can understand that we can't take children through e-gates but Heathrow is not catering for families. It is an airport and should be better prepared for scheduled flights coming in."" ""This is unacceptable,"" said Mr Cruz - quoting the head of the UK's Border Force, Nick Jariwalla as saying it was unlikely to change, or for his teams to meet their targets. He added: ""What kind of message does this send as we try to build links outside the EU? ""We need more than UK-only lanes to show Britain is open for business, and that includes Sajid Javid taking immediate action to address this border farce once and for all."" A Heathrow spokeswoman also said delays at border control were too long. ""Heathrow is Britain's front door and it should be welcoming, as well as secure. It takes far too long for low-risk passengers who have a right to be here to get through the border, which is unacceptable,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We are calling on the home secretary to allow low-risk passengers from non-EU countries such as the US and Canada to use e-gates, in the same way as our EU friends can."" A Home Office spokeswoman said from January to June 2018, more than 95% of people arriving at Heathrow passed border control within the agreed time limits. However, she added: ""We understand the frustration for those who have experienced longer waits and remain fully committed to working with our partners to reduce waiting times as far as is possible. ""At the same time, we will not compromise the essential checks we carry out at the border which keep our country safe. ""We are making sure Border Force has the resources it needs and are deploying 200 additional staff at Heathrow over the summer.""

Ben Stokes trial told star 'lost control',"Ben Stokes leaves Bristol Crown Court after the first day of the trial England cricketer Ben Stokes mocked two gay men and flicked a cigarette butt at one of them before brawling with two other men, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder, who will miss the second Test against India at Lord's, denies affray. Bristol Crown Court heard Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27, were knocked unconscious by Mr Stokes in Bristol on 25 September 2017. They also deny affray and are on trial alongside Mr Stokes. The fight outside a nightclub was ""a sustained episode of significant violence"" in which Mr Stokes ""lost control"", jurors were told. Nicholas Corsellis, prosecuting, said Mr Stokes, 27, had ""knocked Mr Hale unconscious and then - after time to pause for thought, to calm - he did exactly the same to Mr Ali"". The prosecutor described Mr Stokes's actions as ""well beyond acting in self-defence or defence of another"". The cricketer has maintained that ""at all times he acted in self-defence of himself or others"" and believed the force he used was ""reasonable and entirely justified"". An altercation took place in the Clifton Triangle area of the city just after 02:00 BST after the three defendants had left a nightclub, Mr Corsellis said. The court heard Mr Ali had sustained ""significant injuries"", including a broken eye socket. Ryan Ali (left) and Ryan Hale have both pleaded not guilty to affray Mr Corsellis told the jury a bottle was used at the beginning by Mr Ali, and a broken street sign brought into the fray towards the end by Mr Hale. The defendants had been drinking in Mbargo nightclub, with the fight taking place after it closed, jurors heard. Mr Stokes and his team-mate Alex Hales had left the nightclub at 00:46 but returned at 02:08. Bouncer Andrew Cunningham explained to the pair the club was closed and they would not be allowed in. However, an ""obviously upset"" Mr Stokes became ""aggressive"" and insulted Mr Cunningham about his appearance, jurors heard. Mr Cunningham said Mr Stokes's attention then turned to two ""openly gay"" men - Kai Barry and William O'Connor - outside the venue. He claimed the cricketer had mimicked their voices and mannerisms in what he described as ""a derogatory way"". The fight took place after Mr Stokes was turned away from Mbargo nightclub, the court heard Mr Corsellis said footage showed Mr Stokes ""copying hand gestures made by the men"", while the bouncer claimed the cricketer had flicked a cigarette butt at Mr O'Connor. ""Mr Stokes's behaviour outside the nightclub sets an important tone for what happened that night,"" the prosecutor said. ""He was clearly frustrated and annoyed.  He took to acting in a provocative and offensive way."" Only the defendants know precisely how the fight started, Mr Corsellis told the court, which was shown further footage of the incident. A video showed Mr Ali hitting Mr Barry on the shoulder with a bottle. Mr Stokes threw a punch at Mr Ali, and the pair fell to the ground, the jury were told. Then Mr Hale tried to drag Mr Stokes off Mr Ali, the court heard. Mr Hale told police he had been ""smashed to the floor"". Mr Corsellis alleged Mr Stokes did not act in self-defence but had pursued the other men in ""retaliation"". ""Everybody except him wants it to stop,"" he told the jury. He said that in the footage Mr Stokes' England team-mate Mr Hales could be heard to say: ""Stokes, Stokes, that's enough."" Ben Stokes, Ryan Hale and Ryan Ali all deny affray Mr Ali said ""move away, move away"" and Mr Hale said ""stop, stop"", Mr Corsellis told the court. An eyewitness, Laura Sweeney, said she saw Mr Hale pull a metal leg from a road sign and run towards the other men. After he was arrested Mr Stokes was interviewed by police, and in a prepared statement said he saw two men speaking to two gay men in a ""harsh and abusive"" way. The statement said he ""took exception to this and said 'leave it out'"". Mr Hale then ""grabbed and pulled"" him, and Mr Stokes ""felt the need to defend himself as he thought he was going to be attacked"" and hit him ""more than once"", jurors were told. In a second statement Mr Stokes denied being ""aggressive"" towards Mr Cunningham, accusing him of being ""rude"" and suggested he had a ""chip on his shoulder"". ""He denied mimicking or behaving in a derogatory manner towards Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor, saying that they had engaged in joking with each other and denied flicking a cigarette butt at anyone,"" the court heard. Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol. The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against West Indies at the city's County Ground. The trial continues.

Hot weather 'could last until October',"The UK's warmer than average weather could last until October, the Met Office says. In abriefing,externalfor local authorities it says above-average temperatures are more likely than below-average temperatures for the next three months. Fresher, cooler temperatures are expected from the middle of this week, lasting throughout the weekend. But the Met Office analysis suggests warm, dry conditions could return and continue into the autumn. The three-month outlook shows an increased chance of stable weather conditions, bringing warmer than average temperatures and below-average rainfall. However the increase could be just one or two degrees above average temperatures - which are 19C, 16C and 13C for August, September and October respectively. How long will it last? Your heatwave questions The side effects of the European heatwave Portugal battles blazes as Europe bakes Heatwave causing farmers 'serious concern' A Met Office spokesperson stressed the outlook gave a ""general trend"" for the period rather than a ""detailed forecast"". ""We need to remember that this is an average for the whole of the UK over a three-month period and so there will be variations in weather from day to day and week to week, over the whole of the UK,"" they said. ""Although temperatures are more likely to be warmer than average over the three months, this doesn't mean wall-to-wall sunshine, it can still be warm and cloudy."" This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 In the short term temperatures are set to top 30C in some parts of the UK on Monday. On Tuesday temperatures could peak at 34C in Essex or Norfolk, the Met Office said. However much of Scotland and Northern Ireland will start the week with some rain. And maximum temperatures are likely to dip to around the mid-20s by Wednesday. Police horses have a cooling drink from a fountain in Green Park, London Forecaster Dean Hall said there will be ""quite a marked change to the feel of things"" from the middle of the week as conditions turn ""fresher and more changeable"". It is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, he said, with ""no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days"". People flocked to Woolacombe Beach in North Devon over the weekend Canada geese at the Walthamstow Wetlands in east London It comes amid a sweltering European heatwave, with Portugal and Spain being hit by the hottest temperatures. British holidaymakers are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. Last week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, while Lisbon broke a 37-year-old record with temperatures reaching 44C on Sunday. Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country and hot, dry conditions have led to several wildfires. Portugal has been hit by wildfires as temperatures topped 40C In Spain, heat warnings were issued for 41 of the country's 50 provinces. The conditions played a part in the deaths of two men, one in Barcelona and the other in the southern region of Murcia, according to Spanish authorities. People cool off in a fountain in Madrid By David Shukman, BBC science editor Extreme heat is a challenge for millions of people in large parts of the world. Of course it can be a blessing for anyone on holiday. And it's certainly easier to tolerate if buildings are designed to cope with high temperatures - with Mediterranean-style shutters and deep balconies and bright reflective walls. But for the elderly and the very young and for people who have to work outside, such as construction workers and farmers, finding respite can be difficult. The obvious solution is air conditioning. The former leader of sweltering Singapore once said aircon was the key to his country's remarkable success. But chilling a room involves displacing the heat - it has to go somewhere, and that means boosting temperatures outdoors. In a city, already warmer than the surrounding countryside, it's like turning up an oven. For climate scientists, none of this is a big surprise. As far back as 1990, a UN panel warned that global warming would mean more extremes of heat of the kind we're seeing right now. How long will it last?

Trump says son met Russian for information,"Controversy surrounds Donald Trump Jr's meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016 US President Donald Trump has admitted his son met a Russian lawyer in June 2016 ""to get information on an opponent"", but argues it was legal. Donald Trump Jr's meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower could constitute a breach of US campaign rules, experts say. And the meeting is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into Russia's alleged role to help Mr Trump win. President Trump denies any collusion. He has called the ongoing investigations in the US ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". Russia has repeatedly denied claims it interfered in the November 2016 presidential elections, where Mr Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Key players in Trump Jr meeting scandal What Trump Tower documents tell us Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered On Sunday, US media including the Washington Post, CNN and AP reported that Mr Trump was worried Donald Trump Jr could be in legal trouble because of the 9 June 2016 meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya in New York. They cited several unnamed sources. Mr Trump tweeted: ""Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. ""This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. ""I did not know about it!"" On Monday, the president quoted a Fox and Friends interview about alleged Democratic collusion with Russia. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump has spoken out before about links between Moscow and Mrs Clinton while saying it is ""commonly agreed"" that there was no collusion between Russia and him. Trump rages at Clinton and Russia inquiry Why does hisTrump Towertweet matter? Mr Trump's Sunday tweet appears to contradict a previous statement from the Trump camp about the meeting. When the meeting was first reported by the New York Times, Donald Trump Jr said in a statement that he and Ms Veselnitskaya had mostly discussed a suspended programme for Americans to adopt Russian children. However, he subsequently admitted he had agreed to the meeting after being told he would be offered information that would prove detrimental to Mrs Clinton. He also released the email exchange that brought about the meeting. Did Donald Trump Jr break the law? Four explosive lines in Trump Jr emails US media then reported that the US president had been involved in the initial statement his son issued on the meeting. This was initially denied by Mr Trump's team, but his lawyers later confirmed that he had in fact dictated his son's statement. US commentators have argued that Mr Trump's new admission that the meeting was to gain information about Mrs Clinton shows that the earlier statement was misleading. Mr Trump again denied knowing about the meeting in Sunday's tweet. 8 July 2017:The New York Times reveals the June 2016 meeting took place and Mr Trump Jr releases a statement describing it as a ""short introductory meeting"" that focused on Russian adoptions 9 July 2017:The Times reports that Mr Trump Jr was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before the meeting. He confirmed the report but said in a second statement that ""no meaningful information"" came from the meeting 11 July 2017: Mr Trump Jr tweets screenshots of his email correspondence that discussed setting up the meeting just minutes before the email chain was revealed in a Times story.

The special counsel is currently investigating whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Under US law, obstruction cases require proving ""corrupt intent"" - so while Mr Trump's tweet does not prove anything illegal, it could serve as evidence of the president's intent. The meeting involved Mr Trump's son, his son-in-law, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort It is common for US politicians to research their opponents during a campaign. However, legal experts say that Mr Trump Jr could fall foul of campaign finance laws, which prohibit accepting anything of value from a foreign government or foreign national. Mr Trump Jr's apparently enthusiastic response to the offer of information about Mrs Clinton could also breach conspiracy laws. The Trump team has argued that Mr Trump Jr ultimately did not receive any damaging information about Mrs Clinton at the meeting. Some analysts say that by having the meeting at all, Mr Trump Jr broke the law. But others say it is unclear as no information reportedly exchanged hands at the meeting. One of Mr Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said on Sunday that the meeting had not broken any laws. ""The question is what law, statute or rule or regulation's been violated? Nobody's pointed to one,"" Mr Sekulow told ABC News. US media reported last year that some of the president's advisers feared the extent of the president's intervention could place him and some of his inner circle in legal jeopardy.

Starving US children rescued from caravan,"Police described the location where the children were found as a ""makeshift compound"" near the community of Amalia in the north of New Mexico Police in the US state of New Mexico have rescued 11 malnourished children who were being kept in squalid conditions in a remote desert compound. They said the children, aged one to 15, had no shoes, were wearing rags and ""looked like Third World refugees"". Five adults were found at the scene, including two heavily armed men. Police searched the site after receiving a message from a third party that read: ""We are starving and need food and water."" On Sunday, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe ""swore an affidavit for arrest warrants charging 11 counts of child abuse for all five adults related to the neglect and abuse of the children involved"". Each count of child abuse is a felony. It is not clear how the group ended up at the compound in Amalia, near the state's border with Colorado. Police described the compound as a small underground caravan covered by plastic, with no running water or electricity. Sheriff Hogrefe told ABC News the children were hungry, thirsty and filthy. ""I've been a cop for 30 years. I've never seen anything like this. Unbelievable,"" he said. ""They were skinny, their ribs showed, they were in very poor hygiene and very scared."" From left to right: Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj No fresh water was found at the site, and the only food there was a few potatoes and a box of rice, police said. Two armed men, Siraj Wahhaj and Lucas Morton, were arrested at the scene,external, and charged with several counts of child abuse. Three women, believed to be the children's mothers, were ""arrested without incident"" and booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center,according to the Sheriff's Office,external. Police have not explained what connection the women - named as Jany Leveille, 35, Hujrah Wahhaj, 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj, 35, - have to each other. Police said the children were living in ""Third World"" conditions Mr Hogrefe told ABC it appeared the women and children ""were brainwashed and feel great intimidation from the men that were in control of this facility"". The 11 children have been taken into care by local social services. Mr Wahhaj is also wanted on suspicion of abducting his three-year-old son, but the boy was not among the group found at the compound, US media report. It was the search for the boy that led to the arrests on Friday. According to the sheriff's office, law enforcement officials are still searching for the boy, who turned four on Monday. Police said they had been aware of the compound for some time but had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before entering, as the occupants were ""most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief"". Mr Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15 rifle and four pistols when they encountered him, they said. There were bullet casings covering the ground on site, as well as a makeshift shooting range and 150ft tunnel,KOB 4 News,externalreported. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton.

InfoWars dropped from Facebook and iTunes,"Alex Jones created InfoWars Apple has removed hundreds of podcasts by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his InfoWars brand from its iTunes and Podcasts apps. It said in a statement that it ""does not tolerate hate speech"". On Monday, Facebook removed the InfoWars page on its platform for ""using hate speech"", and Alex Jones' channel on YouTube was ""terminated"". In a livestream on Twitter, Mr Jones said InfoWars had become the ""most censored"" channel on Earth. Spotify also told the BBC that it had removed The Alex Jones Show from its podcast listings on Monday. It said in a statement: ""We take reports of hate content seriously. ""Due to repeated violations of Spotify's prohibited content policies, The Alex Jones Show has lost access to the Spotify platform."" Mr Jones has been widely criticised for repeating conspiracy theories that the 9/11 attacks in New York were staged by the US government. He has also claimed that many of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre were actors. The parents of two children shot in that attack are suing him for defamation, saying he had made ""false, cruel, and dangerous assertions"". Several right-wing commentators have, however, suggested the tech firms' ability to block a publisher posed a challenge to the US' free speech laws. In addition, Wikileaks referred to the move as being ""San Francisco cultural imperialism"". While Apple did not host the InfoWars podcasts on its own servers, its iTunes and Podcasts apps made the programmes easily accessible to millions of people. Five of the six InfoWars-related shows are no longer available on iTunes, with all episodes removed. Apple no longer links to series such as The Alex Jones Podcast and War Room in its apps. However, the Real News series remains on iTunes. Facebook stops InfoWars host posting for 30 days YouTube removes 'hate speech' videos from InfoWars In a statement, Apple toldBuzzfeed News:,external""We have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users. ""We believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions."" Several other apps and social media platforms have also taken action against InfoWars content. In July, YouTube removed four videos from Mr Jones' channel, which has more than 2.4 million followers. In the deleted videos, Mr Jones criticised Muslim immigrants to Europe and also denounced a transgender cartoon. YouTube said it had ""long-standing policies against child endangerment and hate speech"" but InfoWars claimed the the videos had been deleted because they were ""critical of liberalism"".

"Women-only network appoints male headAllBright, a group promoting female leadership. defends its decision to give a man the role.Business","AllBright co-founders Debbie Wosskow and Anna Jones A networking group with the aim of supporting female leaders has been criticised for appointing a male chairman. AllBright announced that Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-operative Group, had taken the role. The privately-run group describes itself as ""the network for working women in the UK"". Co-founder Debbie Wosskow defended the decision, saying that to create change you ""need to bring men with you"". The group was founded in 2016 by Debbie Wosskow OBE, who launched home exchange website LoveHomeSwap, and Anna Jones, former chief executive of publishing house Hearst. The London-based group's activities include a private members' club and an academy for helping women grow their businesses. It has attracted well-known members, including actress Naomie Harris and newsreader Sarah-Jane Mee. AllBright's women-only focus extends to exclusively sourcing the wine and art in its club from female producers. ""Of course we need men on board,"" comedian Kate Smurthwaite told the BBC's Today Programme. ""How can we get anywhere until men are willing to share their power? What I'm not entirely convinced about is having men in charge."" She suggested that by appointing a man, AllBright is allowing him to ""take the public glory as it were, and have that high-profile role"". Ms Wosskow, also speaking on Today, emphasised that the group's female co-founders remained in charge. ""There's a very, very interesting dynamic that takes place when women are signing men into a club that celebrates women,"" she said. To support women with their business ideas, AllBright also manages an ""angel syndicate network"". An angel investor is an early backer of a company that puts up money in return for a stake in the business. Highlighting how early business investing is a male-dominated field, she added: ""Only 14% of angel investors are women."" According to a recent report, the number of women in executive positions in the UK declined in 2018. Cranfield School of Management'sFemale FTSE Index,externalfound just 30 women in full-time executive roles at FTSE 250 firms, down from 38 in 2017. The figures for FTSE 100 firms stayed the same, with 25 women holding executive roles at 22 companies. The Women's Equality Party told the Times newspaper that the decision to appoint Mr Leighton ""seems at odds with [AllBright's] mission to change the way the world thinks about female-led businesses"".

Australia anger at 'Hitler fan' interview,"Blair Cottrell was convicted last year of inciting contempt of Muslims An Australian TV network has said it was ""wrong"" to interview a far-right figure with a criminal past, after the segment set off a widespread backlash. Blair Cottrell appeared in a one-on-one studio interview on Sky News Australia on Sunday to speak about immigration. Viewers pointed out that Cottrell was last year convicted of inciting contempt of Muslims, and that he has previously called for schools to display pictures of Adolf Hitler. Sky News Australia responded on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cottrell is the former leader of anti-immigration group United Patriots Front. He was interviewed by Adam Giles, a programme host and former chief minister of the Northern Territory. Other presenters at the network were among those to criticise the interview. ""Blair Cottrell is a far right-wing fascist who's a self confessed Hitler fan. He's boasted about using 'violence and terror' to manipulate women,"" tweeted one host, Laura Jayes. A regular commentator and former Australian government minister, Craig Emerson, said it was ""another step in a journey to normalising racism and bigotry in our country"".

Fentanyl drug deaths rise by nearly a third,"The number of deaths in England and Wales due to the synthetic opioid fentanyl rose by 29% in 2017,Office for National Statistics data shows,external. Forms of the drug - used to treat cancer pain - are often imported illegally from Chinese laboratories and sold to users via the dark web. Deaths from psychoactive substances like spice or mephedrone halved. Drug policy campaigners called on the government to fund drug treatment and stop criminalising users. ""The UK government has nowhere left to hide. They are responsible for vulnerable people dying in droves,"" Martin Powell from Transform Drug Policy Foundation said. He accused politicians of blocking, or refusing to fund, measures proven to save lives in other countries. Last year heroin and morphine related deaths decreased for the first time since 2012, while cocaine deaths rose. In total, 3,756 people were recorded as dying from legal and illegal drugs in England and Wales in 2017. The ONS said this figure had ""remained stable"", with only 12 more deaths than the year previous. Two thirds of these deaths were accidental, related to drug misuse, the ONS added. This video can not be played Robert Fraser died just weeks after his 18th birthday, having taken fentanyl The number of fentanyl deaths increased from 58 in 2016 to 75 in 2017. The drug has been found mixed with heroin, causing accidental overdoses in users. The most dangerous version of the opioid, known as carfentanyl, was behind 27 accidental fatalities during the year - the first time it has been recorded in death certificates. Harry Shapiro, director of DrugWise, said the fentanyl creeping into UK drug supplies was at least 100 times stronger than other class A drugs and that a tiny amount can be fatal. Fentanyl: The painkiller that killed my son Inside Leeds gang's Fentanyl factory The people who are really using cocaine Reality Check: Is UK the 'drugs market of Europe'? Meanwhile there were 432 deaths related to cocaine in 2017 - the highest amount ever recorded. Earlier this year, security minister Ben Wallace warned the UK was ""fast becomingthe biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe"". England and Wales's rate of 66.1 drug deaths per 1 million, is now more than three times the rate for the EU, Turkey and Norway (according to figures from theEuropean Drug Report,external). The latest data showed the north east of England had a significantly higher rate of drug deaths than other regions - 83 per million people - followed by the north west of England and Wales. London had the lowest number of deaths. In Scotland,drug deaths hit a record highin 2017 and were the worst in Europe, figures revealed last month. By BBC Home Editor, Mark Easton Behind the record numbers of deaths from drug poisoning is a row over cuts. In 2016, the government's official drugs advisory body told ministers the most important way to reduce drug deaths was to protect funding for opioid substitution therapy (OST) - prescribing medicines such as methadone or diamorphine (pharmaceutical heroin) to street heroin users. More than half the drug deaths last year were from overdoses of opiates, including heroin, and OST is credited with saving hundreds of lives every year. Responding to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommendations last year, the Home Office accepted the advice on OST ""in full"", agreeing it ""has a widely-recognised and evidenced protective effect in helping to reduce deaths from overdoses"". However, funding for such drug therapy comes from the public health grant distributed to local councils, and that has been cut by hundreds of millions of pounds a year, as part of the government's measures to reduce the deficit. It is estimated that council spending on adult drug treatment will have fallen 26% since 2014. Consultant addiction psychiatrist Dr Emily Finch told the Today programme there's been around a 30% loss in funding for drug and alcohol treatment services in the last 5-10 years. ""Generally speaking, the system is less and less fit for purpose,"" she said. ""Being in treatment protects against deaths."" Prof Fiona Measham who, along with Dr Finch, is a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, also called for an increase for drug treatment funding. She said that for many, drug use is a ""symptom"" of past trauma, abuse or current problems in their lives, rather than ""the core of the problem itself"". ""The big concern for us in relation to recreational drug users is the five-fold increase in ecstasy deaths and the three-fold increase in cocaine related deaths,"" she said, adding that these were being caused by higher purity or contaminated substances being sold.

InfoWars podcasts dropped from iTunes,"Alex Jones created InfoWars Apple has removed hundreds of podcasts by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his InfoWars brand from its iTunes and Podcasts apps. It said in a statement that it ""does not tolerate hate speech"". On Monday, Facebook removed the InfoWars page on its platform for ""using hate speech"", and Alex Jones' channel on YouTube was ""terminated"". In a livestream on Twitter, Mr Jones said InfoWars had become the ""most censored"" channel on Earth. Spotify also told the BBC that it had removed The Alex Jones Show from its podcast listings on Monday. It said in a statement: ""We take reports of hate content seriously. ""Due to repeated violations of Spotify's prohibited content policies, The Alex Jones Show has lost access to the Spotify platform."" Mr Jones has been widely criticised for repeating conspiracy theories that the 9/11 attacks in New York were staged by the US government. He has also claimed that many of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre were actors. The parents of two children shot in that attack are suing him for defamation, saying he had made ""false, cruel, and dangerous assertions"". Several right-wing commentators have, however, suggested the tech firms' ability to block a publisher posed a challenge to the US' free speech laws. In addition, Wikileaks referred to the move as being ""San Francisco cultural imperialism"". While Apple did not host the InfoWars podcasts on its own servers, its iTunes and Podcasts apps made the programmes easily accessible to millions of people. Five of the six InfoWars-related shows are no longer available on iTunes, with all episodes removed. Apple no longer links to series such as The Alex Jones Podcast and War Room in its apps. However, the Real News series remains on iTunes. Facebook stops InfoWars host posting for 30 days YouTube removes 'hate speech' videos from InfoWars In a statement, Apple toldBuzzfeed News:,external""We have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users. ""We believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions."" Several other apps and social media platforms have also taken action against InfoWars content. In July, YouTube removed four videos from Mr Jones' channel, which has more than 2.4 million followers. In the deleted videos, Mr Jones criticised Muslim immigrants to Europe and also denounced a transgender cartoon. YouTube said it had ""long-standing policies against child endangerment and hate speech"" but InfoWars claimed the the videos had been deleted because they were ""critical of liberalism"".

Affordable homes on green belt 'a lie',"Plans to build 460,000 homes on land released from the green belt will not help young families get on to the property ladder, say campaigners. The Campaign to Protect Rural England said 78% of planned developments on greenfield sites do not fall under the government's ""affordable"" definition. Its director said people are ""being sold a lie"" and will ""go on struggling to afford a place to live"". A government spokesman said green belt protections were being strengthened. He added that the green belt is around 30,000 hectares larger than in 1997 and councils can only make changes to its boundaries in ""exceptional circumstances"". What is affordable housing? Will it be easier to build on green belt? What if Britain had no green belt? CPRE argues that more brownfield sites should be used instead - claiming they could accommodate more than one million homes in England. It also said local authorities with green belt land have enough brownfield sites for 720,000 homes. Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. There are tight controls on building in these areas. About 13% of England is now covered and the 14 green belt areas are meant to be permanently protected - and are only reviewed in exceptional circumstances. They include scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs. But it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful. Brownfield sites are often on disused or derelict land, but they are often more expensive to build on as the land needs to be cleared first. New analysis by the CPRE claimed that 72% of homes built on sites within the green belt last year could not be classed as ""affordable"" under the government's own definition. They now warn this will rise by 6% this year as the government ups the number of homes it is building. The group also claimed 7,600 affordable homes needed to be built in the countryside annually - but its figures showed only 990 were built last year. The CPRE's director of campaigns and policy, Tom Fyans, said: ""We are being sold a lie by many developers. ""As they sell off and gobble up the green belt to build low density, unaffordable housing, young families go on struggling to afford a place to live."" Mr Fyans said the affordable housing crisis must be addressed ""with increasing urgency"", but that building on green belt sites does not provide the solution, instead ""entrenching the issue."" He added: ""The government is failing in its commitment to protect the green belt - it is being eroded at an alarming rate. ""But it is essential, if the green belt is to fulfil its main purposes and provide 30 million of us with access to the benefits of the countryside, that the redevelopment of brownfield land is prioritised, and green belt protection strengthened."" This video can not be played Green belt land accounts for 13% of the land area of England The government said it was protecting green belt sites in the countryside. A spokesman from the Housing, Communities and Local Government department said: ""We are clear that building the homes our country needs does not mean tearing up our countryside. ""Last year the number of new homes built was the highest in a decade, and only 0.02% of the green belt was developed for residential use. ""We are adding more certainty to the planning system and our new planning rulebook strengthens national protections for the green belt, and says that councils may only alter boundaries in exceptional circumstances once they have looked at all other options.""

"Starving US children rescued from caravanPolice raided the site after getting a message that read: ""We are starving and need food and water.""US & Canada","Police described the location where the children were found as a ""makeshift compound"" near the community of Amalia in the north of New Mexico Police in the US state of New Mexico have rescued 11 malnourished children who were being kept in squalid conditions in a remote desert compound. They said the children, aged one to 15, had no shoes, were wearing rags and ""looked like Third World refugees"". Five adults were found at the scene, including two heavily armed men. Police searched the site after receiving a message from a third party that read: ""We are starving and need food and water."" On Sunday, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe ""swore an affidavit for arrest warrants charging 11 counts of child abuse for all five adults related to the neglect and abuse of the children involved"". Each count of child abuse is a felony. It is not clear how the group ended up at the compound in Amalia, near the state's border with Colorado. Police described the compound as a small underground caravan covered by plastic, with no running water or electricity. Sheriff Hogrefe told ABC News the children were hungry, thirsty and filthy. ""I've been a cop for 30 years. I've never seen anything like this. Unbelievable,"" he said. ""They were skinny, their ribs showed, they were in very poor hygiene and very scared."" From left to right: Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj No fresh water was found at the site, and the only food there was a few potatoes and a box of rice, police said.

The 11 children have been taken into care by local social services. Mr Wahhaj is also wanted on suspicion of abducting his three-year-old son, but the boy was not among the group found at the compound, US media report. It was the search for the boy that led to the arrests on Friday. According to the sheriff's office, law enforcement officials are still searching for the boy, who turned four on Monday. Police said they had been aware of the compound for some time but had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before entering, as the occupants were ""most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief"".

He accused politicians of blocking, or refusing to fund, measures proven to save lives in other countries. Last year heroin and morphine related deaths decreased for the first time since 2012, while cocaine deaths rose. In total, 3,756 people were recorded as dying from legal and illegal drugs in England and Wales in 2017. The ONS said this figure had ""remained stable"", with only 12 more deaths than the year previous. Two thirds of these deaths were accidental, related to drug misuse, the ONS added. This video can not be played Robert Fraser died just weeks after his 18th birthday, having taken fentanyl The number of fentanyl deaths increased from 58 in 2016 to 75 in 2017. The drug has been found mixed with heroin, causing accidental overdoses in users. The most dangerous version of the opioid, known as carfentanyl, was behind 27 accidental fatalities during the year - the first time it has been recorded in death certificates. Harry Shapiro, director of DrugWise, said the fentanyl creeping into UK drug supplies was at least 100 times stronger than other class A drugs and that a tiny amount can be fatal.

Meanwhile there were 432 deaths related to cocaine in 2017 - the highest amount ever recorded. Earlier this year, security minister Ben Wallace warned the UK was ""fast becomingthe biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe"". England and Wales's rate of 66.1 drug deaths per 1 million, is now more than three times the rate for the EU, Turkey and Norway (according to figures from theEuropean Drug Report,external). The latest data showed the north east of England had a significantly higher rate of drug deaths than other regions - 83 per million people - followed by the north west of England and Wales. London had the lowest number of deaths. In Scotland,drug deaths hit a record highin 2017 and were the worst in Europe, figures revealed last month. By BBC Home Editor, Mark Easton Behind the record numbers of deaths from drug poisoning is a row over cuts. In 2016, the government's official drugs advisory body told ministers the most important way to reduce drug deaths was to protect funding for opioid substitution therapy (OST) - prescribing medicines such as methadone or diamorphine (pharmaceutical heroin) to street heroin users. More than half the drug deaths last year were from overdoses of opiates, including heroin, and OST is credited with saving hundreds of lives every year. Responding to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommendations last year, the Home Office accepted the advice on OST ""in full"", agreeing it ""has a widely-recognised and evidenced protective effect in helping to reduce deaths from overdoses"". However, funding for such drug therapy comes from the public health grant distributed to local councils, and that has been cut by hundreds of millions of pounds a year, as part of the government's measures to reduce the deficit. It is estimated that council spending on adult drug treatment will have fallen 26% since 2014. Consultant addiction psychiatrist Dr Emily Finch told the Today programme there's been around a 30% loss in funding for drug and alcohol treatment services in the last 5-10 years. ""Generally speaking, the system is less and less fit for purpose,"" she said. ""Being in treatment protects against deaths."" Prof Fiona Measham who, along with Dr Finch, is a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, also called for an increase for drug treatment funding. She said that for many, drug use is a ""symptom"" of past trauma, abuse or current problems in their lives, rather than ""the core of the problem itself"". ""The big concern for us in relation to recreational drug users is the five-fold increase in ecstasy deaths and the three-fold increase in cocaine related deaths,"" she said, adding that these were being caused by higher purity or contaminated substances being sold.

"Rural crime prompts 'medieval' defencesAs the cost of crime rises to ÃÂ£44.5m, farmers are building up fortifications, a report says.","Farmers are digging trenches and earth banks to prevent thieves driving 4x4s onto farms The cost of rural crime has risen to Â£44.5m as organised criminal gangs target farm machinery. Farmers are resorting to ""medieval"" fortifications such as earthworks to protect their property, according to NFU Mutual, which produced the figures. Police said that the global demand for agricultural equipment was attracting organised crime to the countryside. Thefts of quad bikes, agricultural vehicles and 4x4s have driven the 13.4% increase in crime over the last year. NFU Mutual, which provides insurance to farmers, said in its annual rural crime report that the cost to farmers is at its highest point since 2013. While rural crime has fallen in Scotland and the north west of England, there have been sharp rises of more than 30% in the Midlands, Wales and the south east of England. Tim Price, NFU Mutual's rural affairs specialist, said this year's spike in crime was driven by a ""new breed"" of determined thieves, using technology and brute force to steal from farms and prompting farmers to bolster their defences. He said: ""This year we're seeing people bring in things like earth banks - the medieval fortifications last used a thousand years ago."" Farmers are combining these ancient deterrents with modern technology, such as CCTV, floodlighting and motion sensors. James Gregory, a farmer in Gloucestershire, is installing more than a mile of earth banks Gloucestershire Police have begun helping local landowners to dig trenches and earth banks to stop thieves from driving 4x4s onto farmland. One farm has an earth wall 3ft tall followed by a 2ft-deep ditch, with barriers extending for more than a mile. Another farmer, James Gregory from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, said he was installing an earth bank in order to deter joyriders and opportunistic thieves. He said: ""It's early days but it's like putting a padlock on a shed: if you were really determined you could still probably break in, but if it just deters a casual person then you're saving a lot of hassle."" Others are creating a single point of entry, reinforced gates, barricaded strong rooms for high-value goods and tall fences to deter thieves. Stolen farm machinery is also being used to commit further crimes, NFU Mutual said, with farm loaders used to smash into village shops and steal from cash machines. And farmers are suffering long-term anxiety from the fear that they are being watched by criminals who are waiting for an opportunity, the report said. David Airey, a farmer in Sutton-in-Craven in North Yorkshire, said crime rates were the worst he had seen in 52 years of farming. He has lost almost Â£20,000 in three quad bikes, trailers, metal, a tonne of sugar beet, drills, chainsaws, milk kits and nearly 100 ewes in repeated thefts. ""It's relentless,"" he said. ""It's scary, you wake up every morning, expecting to go outside and find something disappeared."" Mr Price at NFU Mutual said there had been some successful police initiatives, such as the Scottish Partnership Against Rural Crime. But he called for more collaboration between police forces, to prevent crime being displaced across county borders. The lead officer for rural affairs at the National Police Chiefs' Council, Deputy Chief Constable Craig Naylor, said police have createdthe first UK-wide strategy to tackle rising rural crime,external, with a focus on organised gangs. He said: ""Crime in rural communities can have devastating consequences on residents and businesses alike."" The strategy paper says the rise in crime has been caused by the ""collapse"" of close-knit rural communities and the growth of modern transport links that allow thieves to export stolen machinery in a matter of hours. Det Con Chris Piggott, from the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service, said: ""Organised crime has realised that there's big revenue to be made exporting this stuff across the world."" Police were constantly developing new methods to counter rural crime, he said, but thieves often adapted their approach in response. He added: ""They'll learn how to evade our tactics. What we need to do is to keep developing.""

"Australia anger at 'Hitler fan' interviewSky News Australia says it was ""wrong"" to give airtime to a far-right figure with a criminal past.Australia","Blair Cottrell was convicted last year of inciting contempt of Muslims An Australian TV network has said it was ""wrong"" to interview a far-right figure with a criminal past, after the segment set off a widespread backlash.

The body of Ms Eastwood was discovered when police searched rural ground near Caverswall, Staffordshire, on Saturday, eight days after she was last seen. Two men, aged 60 and 28, arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have been released on conditional bail.

Scores killed in Indonesia island quake,"This video can not be played Moment the quake struck caught on camera At least 91 people are now known to have died after a powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Lombok. Hundreds of people have been wounded by Sunday's quake, officials say, mostly in the north of the island. The 6.9 magnitude tremor was fairly shallow, occurring only 30km (18 miles) underground. It damaged thousands of buildings and triggered power cuts. About 1,000 foreign tourists are being evacuated from the nearby Gili islands and at least one person died on Bali. Video footage from Bali, to the west of Lombok, showed people running from their homes screaming. There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit on Sunday morning. A tsunami warning was issued but was lifted after a few hours. It comes a week afteranother quake hit Lombok, popular with tourists who visit its beaches and hiking trails. That quake killed at least 16 people. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. In pictures: Damaged homes and evacuations in Lombok The two islands are home to about three and four million people respectively, but each year are visited by millions of tourists from around the globe. A spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency told the AFP news agency that many buildings had been affected in Lombok's main city of Mataram. Most of them had been built with weak construction materials. Are earthquake warnings effective? History of deadly earthquakes Mataram residents described a powerful jolt that sent people fleeing into the streets. ""Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking,"" one resident named as Iman said. This video can not be played 'Expect strong Lombok quake aftershocks' In several parts of Mataram, there were electricity blackouts. Patients at the city hospital, and also at Denpasar hospital in Bali, were evacuated and tended to by doctors in the streets. Hospital patients were looked after in the streets after the earthquake There was a feeling of panic as the earthquake hit Debris littered the streets of Lombok and Bali, which local people sought to clean up in the hours after the quake. The quake was felt for several seconds in Bali. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" the unnamed man said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"". Allow Twitter content?

Airports on both Lombok and Bali are both operating normally despite some minor damage - at Bali's Denpasar airport some ceiling panels were shaken loose by the tremors. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.

"University chief wants to bring back grantsThe Russell Group head says maintenance grants could make a ""substantial difference"" for poorer students.Family & Education","The head of an elite group of universities has called for maintenance grants to be restored to help improve diversity in higher education. Tim Bradshaw, who leads the Russell Group,told the Independent the grant could make a ""substantial difference"",externalto young people ""nervous"" about debt. He said it could also encourage more people to consider applying at all. The government says it has made significant progress in getting disadvantaged students into university. Are universities letting down black students? Does it matter which university you go to? The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Maintenance grants used to be given to students in England from lower income backgrounds - families with annual incomes of Â£25,000 or less got the full grant of Â£3,387 a year. In 2015, the then-Chancellor George Osborne announced they would be scrapped from September 2016. He said the grants had become ""unaffordable"" and there was a ""basic unfairness in asking taxpayers to fund grants for people who are likely to earn a lot more than them"". But critics said many low and middle income students could be put off university by the measure. In Wales, a new system of maintenance grants is being introduced from September. All Welsh students will get a Â£1,000 maintenance grant no matter where they study in the UK. On top of that, a mean tested element means the poorest students will get up to Â£8,100 ( and more if the study in London). The Russell Group - a collection of 24 prestigious ""research-intensive"" universities including Oxford and Cambridge - has been criticised for failing to attract enough students from ethnic minority and less privileged backgrounds. But Mr Bradshaw said the government should make more funding available to help improve access to higher education, instead of ""putting all the blame on universities"". The group is due to submit proposals to the government on how maintenance grants could be restored as part of a review into post-18 education funding Their options include a ""living wage"" for students who had been eligible for school meals during their school years. The Â£8,192 grant would reduce the debt of a student by Â£27,800, according to the proposal. Mr Bradshaw said: ""It could be very targeted, really cost-effective and actually make quite a substantial difference to those from disadvantaged backgrounds who may inherently be very nervous about taking on an additional loan."" Universities - including Oxford (pictured) - have been criticised for failing to attract enough students from less privileged backgrounds A Department for Education spokesman said poorer undergraduates will get more help than ever when they go to university in the autumn. He said: ""Finance should never be a barrier to a young person's education, and we are seeing real progress, with disadvantaged 18-year-olds 50% more likely to enter full-time university in 2017 compared with 2009. ""We have increased the maximum grants and loans available to support students with costs, and disadvantaged students starting their courses this year will have access to the largest ever amounts of cash-in-hand support for their living costs.""

University chief wants to bring back grants,"The head of an elite group of universities has called for maintenance grants to be restored to help improve diversity in higher education. Tim Bradshaw, who leads the Russell Group,told the Independent the grant could make a ""substantial difference"",externalto young people ""nervous"" about debt. He said it could also encourage more people to consider applying at all. The government says it has made significant progress in getting disadvantaged students into university. Are universities letting down black students? Does it matter which university you go to? The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Maintenance grants used to be given to students in England from lower income backgrounds - families with annual incomes of Â£25,000 or less got the full grant of Â£3,387 a year. In 2015, the then-Chancellor George Osborne announced they would be scrapped from September 2016. He said the grants had become ""unaffordable"" and there was a ""basic unfairness in asking taxpayers to fund grants for people who are likely to earn a lot more than them"". But critics said many low and middle income students could be put off university by the measure. In Wales, a new system of maintenance grants is being introduced from September. All Welsh students will get a Â£1,000 maintenance grant no matter where they study in the UK. On top of that, a mean tested element means the poorest students will get up to Â£8,100 ( and more if the study in London).

Starving US children rescued from compound,"Police described the location where the children were found as a ""makeshift compound"" near the community of Amalia in the north of New Mexico Police in the US state of New Mexico have rescued 11 malnourished children who were being kept in squalid conditions in a remote desert compound. They said the children, aged one to 15, had no shoes, were wearing rags and ""looked like Third World refugees"". Five adults were found at the scene, including two heavily armed men. Police searched the site after receiving a message from a third party that read: ""We are starving and need food and water."" On Sunday, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe ""swore an affidavit for arrest warrants charging 11 counts of child abuse for all five adults related to the neglect and abuse of the children involved"". Each count of child abuse is a felony. It is not clear how the group ended up at the compound in Amalia, near the state's border with Colorado. Police described the compound as a small underground caravan covered by plastic, with no running water or electricity. Sheriff Hogrefe told ABC News the children were hungry, thirsty and filthy. ""I've been a cop for 30 years. I've never seen anything like this. Unbelievable,"" he said. ""They were skinny, their ribs showed, they were in very poor hygiene and very scared."" From left to right: Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj No fresh water was found at the site, and the only food there was a few potatoes and a box of rice, police said. Two armed men, Siraj Wahhaj and Lucas Morton, were arrested at the scene,external, and charged with several counts of child abuse. Three women, believed to be the children's mothers, were ""arrested without incident"" and booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center,according to the Sheriff's Office,external. Police have not explained what connection the women - named as Jany Leveille, 35, Hujrah Wahhaj, 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj, 35, - have to each other. Police said the children were living in ""Third World"" conditions Mr Hogrefe told ABC it appeared the women and children ""were brainwashed and feel great intimidation from the men that were in control of this facility"". The 11 children have been taken into care by local social services. Mr Wahhaj is also wanted on suspicion of abducting his three-year-old son, but the boy was not among the group found at the compound, US media report. It was the search for the boy that led to the arrests on Friday. According to the sheriff's office, law enforcement officials are still searching for the boy, who turned four on Monday. Police said they had been aware of the compound for some time but had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before entering, as the occupants were ""most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief"". Mr Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15 rifle and four pistols when they encountered him, they said. There were bullet casings covering the ground on site, as well as a makeshift shooting range and 150ft tunnel,KOB 4 News,externalreported. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton.

'Reckless' driver hunted over cyclist row,"This video can not be played IT consultant Dave Clifton was nearly struck by the car during the row A ""reckless"" driver is being hunted by police after he drove ""at speed"" at a cyclist during a row in London. Footage on social media shows how cyclist Dave Clifton was almost hit by the black Audi A3 on a road in Clapham. The Met Police has appealed to find the ""dangerous"" driver, who sped away in reverse from an officer during the row, at about 08:00 BST last Wednesday. ""Luckily no-one was seriously injured or even killed by this reckless driver,"" Det Con James Preston said. The row began at traffic lights close to Clapham North Station, when the driver stopped and started yelling. Police want to speak to the man driving the black Audi A3 Mr Clifton said the driver appeared to be ""picking on everybody"" in the ""bizarre"" altercation After driving off he swerved into a bus lane, where he nearly hit IT consultant Mr Clifton, 50, before stopping at another set of lights and throwing debris out of the car window at him. ""When the lights turned green, the driver turned his car towards the victim and drove at him at speed before changing direction,"" a police spokesman said. Seconds later the Audi was driven onto a side street where a witness told the force he almost hit another cyclist. The driver then mounted the pavement where a group of cyclists had gathered and he drove at them, apparently telling them ""it's a stolen car"". He fled the scene by reversing down Dorset Road ""at speed"", after a police officer in an unmarked car arrived. ""It's worrying having drivers on the road like that,"" Mr Clifton, of Wimbledon, said. ""It's all just really bizarre. I don't know if he's just having a bad morning or what. He seems to be picking on everybody."" The driver reversed ""at speed"" away from a police officer during the row Det Con Preston said officers were continuing to try to trace the driver. ""[We] urge anyone who recognises him to contact the police as soon as possible,"" he added.

Grandfather grows giant cucumberLove Island: 10 best momentsPhone etiquette: How not to lose friendsVideoVideo'How do breasts have so much power?',"The beast grown by Raghbir Singh Sanghera could be an Armenian cucumber, one expert suggested A grandfather in Derby says praying to his cucumber has helped it grow to a potential world-record size. Raghbir Singh Sanghera, who worked as a farmer in India before coming to the UK in 1991, grew the 51in (129.54cm) ribbed vegetable in his greenhouse. Mr Sanghera said the cucumber - whose species has not yet been determined - continues to grow in girth and length.

""We have seen these presented before at giant veg shows only to be rejected,"" Mr Glazebrook said. ""However, it is a fine specimen of its type, and he has done well.""

Confused perhaps by the cutting down comment, Hayley responds: ""So does that mean we won't have any trees?"" ""Cheese?"" says Samira, adding to the general farce of the conversation. ""Why wouldn't we have trees?"" chimes in Dani. Things finally take a serious turn for Hayley when it's mooted that it may become more difficult for Brits to travel abroad. ""So it would be harder to go on holidays?"" says Hayley. ""Oh, I love my holidays!"" This Brexit thingy is serious stuff indeed. Rosie splitting up with Adam provided the show's first major drama One of the first truly explosive scenes came when Rosie Williams confronted Adam Collard over the way he had treated her following the arrival of newcomer Zara McDermott. After spending 10 days coupled up, Rosie told Adam he had ""hurt her"" and broken her heart, after ignoring her all day. Adam denied he'd done anything wrong and generally looked smug during the whole conversation. Cue Adam becoming public enemy number one - even prompting charityWomen's Aid to issue a warningabout his emotional abuse and gaslighting behaviour towards both Rosie and Kendall. Georgia Steel and Jack Fowler shared a brief kiss after a date If you didn't know after the (approximate) 2,643 times she mentioned it, Georgia is loyal. Babe. She even mentioned it four times back-to-back, so it must be true. Speaking - as she's cracking on with Idris - she says: ""Obviously I am very loyal. I'm a very loyal girl. Very loyal. And when I am with someone, I am completely loyal unless I am honest with them, tell them how I feel, then I crack on."" Got it? Even during one of the other biggest moments of the series, when she may or may not have planted THAT KISS on Jack Fowler, she was - of course - still loyal. And that cheeky little peck went on to cause more trouble than it could possibly have been worth. Laura broke up with Jack (for not being loyal); Georgia and Laura fell out (over Laura questioning G's loyalty); and Ellie and Georgia had a bitter kitchen exchange (with Ellie claiming Georgia was, in fact, NOT loyal. Gasp!) In the words of Dua Lipa: One kiss is all it takes. Ofcom received more than 2,600 complaints over the video shown to Dani Dyer One of the biggest - and most complained about - must-see moments on television this year was the moment Dani saw footage of boyfriend Jack in Casa Amor with his ex Ellie. Dyer burst into tears at the video and took to the Love Island beach hut to share her agony. ""I just knew it was too good to be true,"" she sobbed. But the scenessparked more than 2,600 complaintsto Ofcom, as many thought the video Dyer was shown was misleading. In reality, Jack had also taken his bedding outside into the garden because he refused to share a bed with another girl, and told Adam he was in love with Dyer - but these excerpts had not been shown to her. Safe to say, they were happily reunited and it all turned out right in the end. Megan played with fire when she entreated Wes to kiss her while he was still coupled up with Laura. In so doing, all manner of rules from the girl code could be heard smashing. To his credit, Wes didn't cheat on Laura, but told her he'd be ""getting to know Megan a whole lot more"" following the conversation. Understandably, Laura and Meg never really saw eye to eye afterwards. Love Island winners revealed Your Love Island questions answered Jack proved to be a master of impersonations In a scene that could have come straight from Emmerdale, the boys offered some light relief from all the drama when, out of nowhere, they allpretended to be from Yorkshire,externalfor a whole conversation. A sign of cabin fever perhaps, but it had us in hysterics. Likewise, Jack proved he was a dab hand at doing impressions of his fellow Islanders - with his and Dani's take-off of Eyal a real highlight. Allow Twitter content?

Hitherto unlucky-in-love Samira finally found her Prince Charming in Frankie, but was left bereft when he was voted off the show. She told her fellow Islanders: ""So, these past couple of days I haven't been myself and I've struggled to be happy in here and have fun and I had a taste of what I've wanted and it's gone."" So off she skipped out of the villa's front door in a tiny fuchsia bikini with her enormous suitcase. Wonder what airport security made of her outfit? Allow Twitter content?

There was a lot of asking to be each other's significant others in the series. But the hands down most inventive example goes to Charlie Brake, who pulled off a master plan in cahoots with Wes, Jack Fincham and Alex. Operation Chellie involved derring-do in the guise of covert use of a lipstick, strategic spillage of red wine and copious usage of the word ""muggy"". One ""I've never been so shocked in my life"" and a ""yes"" later from Ellie and they had all jumped in the pool. Romeo done.

When tasked with the baby challenge, Dr Alex showed he wasn't quite cut out for fatherhood yet. During the task, in which the Islanders were given a baby doll to care for, the A&E doctor catapulted himself and his baby onto the floor during an impromptu buggy race with Jack Fincham. It left the 27-year old sprawling and the baby with (presumably) multiple serious injuries. Meanwhile, Josh proved to be the worst dad ever after pulling his baby's arm off. Fatherhood should definitely be put off a few years for this lot. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

After a rocky time together, Alexandra's mum showed her true sass when she came into the villa and called out Alex for his treatment of her daughter. ""He thought he could just drop you and pick you up at a whim, and that's not how life works,"" she fired. ""What did you expect a girl to feel like after she'd been rejected and then you deigned to bring her back to your side? I thought, 'hey young man, I'll have words with you!'""

Phone etiquette: How not to lose friendsVideoVideo'How do breasts have so much power?',"They're the first thing many of us look at in the morning and the last thing at night. Our phones are never far from our side and we're checking them every 12 minutes,according to Ofcom. It's a love affair that looks set to last so we've come up with five rules of phone use worth observing - from no phones at dinnertime to turning it off at the checkout. An absolute no-no for most (81%) of us - yet half of us have been with others who've done it. And more than a quarter (26%) of young adults admit to it. ""They should always be off and out of sight during meals, meetings and parties,"" insists Diana Mather, of The English Manner consultancy. ""The person you're with is the person who's the most important. None of us is indispensable."" And, if you need proof of what it can do for relationships, Gareth Southgate's boys - hailed for their team ethos - put their phones to one side during team meals and unexpectedly made it to the World Cup semi-finals. A coincidence? Well, maybe. No phones at the table for England But even looking at the screen at the dinner table is not on - for some. More than four in five people aged 55 and over think it's unacceptable to check notifications, compared with around half (46%) of 18 to 34-year-olds. Read more about the UK's phone use That tinny drone from the top deck of the bus screeching out of a mobile speaker - it's known as sodcasting. And it applies to watching videos and playing video games loudly, as well as listening to music. Three-quarters (76%) of us object to it - but it doesn't stop us doing it. Allow Twitter content?

You're at the till but on the phone mid-conversation. Do you hang up, say a polite ""hello"" and graciously pack away your bread and clementines - or chat on regardless? It's a source of frustration for many a shop worker, receptionist and waiter. One Sainsbury's checkout worker was so incensed when a customer refused to end her call that she refused to serve her.The supermarket apologised. This video can not be played When should you hang up your phone? ""Texting and talking is so rude,"" says manners expert Diana Mather. ""We're still animals - the pheromones, the charisma, the aura - if we're not concentrating on each other, we're wasting a huge opportunity to get to know each other better."" John McDonnell's colleagues might have missed out on getting to know the shadow chancellor a little better during this Commons session. He had something to say on the 2016 Autumn Statement - but not all his colleagues were catching those pheromones. Is it wrong for MPs to use mobiles in the Commons? They've got their head down, eyes peeled to the screen - and they're right in your path. Internally you're screaming Look up! Look up! But no - it's the pavement slalom again - dodging in and out of pedestrians in the phone zone. And Twitter user @tiredhorizon has a public warning for them. Put away your phones in public buildings, hospitals and near reversing lorries. He describes having to push huge bins around them and has seen them get in the way of porters pushing patients in hospital beds. Not good. Allow Twitter content?

Four in 10 (41%) adults think it's unacceptable to use a phone while curled up with the family on the sofa in front of Strictly. For the older generation (those over 55) it's more of an issue - 62% object to it - than for younger adults - only one in five have a problem with it.
