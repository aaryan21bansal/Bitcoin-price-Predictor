Abramovich had secret stakes in rival players,"Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich held secret investments in footballers not owned by his club, an investigation has discovered. The players included the Peruvian winger Andre Carrillo, who turned out against Chelsea in Champions League matches in 2014. He held rights in the players through a company based in the British Virgin Islands. Mr Abramovich's spokeswoman stressed no rules or regulations were broken. But former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman has questioned whether it was ""proper"" for the owner of a football club to have an interest in players in other teams. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak Your guide to eight years of finance leaks A leak of documents - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - that have been called the FinCEN Files and seen by BBC Panorama has revealed that Mr Abramovich is behind an offshore company called Leiston Holdings. Leiston was taking stakes in footballers overseas through third-party ownership (TPO). This is where investors buy a share of a footballer's future transfer value from cash-strapped clubs. The practice was banned in the English Premier League in 2008 but notinternationally until 2015. Andre Carrillo at Stamford Bridge in 2014 - he played against Chelsea in two matches Chelsea faced Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League group stage in 2014. And Carrillo lined up for Sporting in both matches. So inLisbon in SeptemberandStamford Bridge in December,Mr Abramovich had an interest in 12 players on the pitch. Lord Triesman told Panorama: ""I don't think it can possibly be proper for the owner of a football club to own players in other football clubs. That is precisely why third-party ownership is banned."" ""It casts suspicion and a shadow right across football. On the documents I've seen I would've wanted, as chairman of the FA, to investigate them."" It comes as Mr Abramovich appears to be makingheavy investments in Chelseaagain this year. In December 2016, a suspicious activity report (SAR) was filed by a bank about Mr Abramovich. It identified more than $1bn of ""suspicious payments involving offshore shell companies"" - firms functioning only to manage the money put in them. The SAR said many of the shell companies were ""owned by Roman Abramovichâ¦ one of Russia's most powerful oligarchs with close ties to Moscow & Vladimir Putin"". The money seemed to be going around in circles between the companies. Among the transactions were a series of nine payments from a Cypriot company. This money was split between four other companies before $156m ended up in Leiston Holdings. Leiston became the subject of public attention in 2018, when it was revealed by German website Der Spiegel as part of the Football Leaks investigation to be an investment vehicle for TPO. Panorama discovered both the company in Cyprus and Leiston Holdings are Roman Abramovich companies. As well as being funded with $156m of his money, Chelsea had first option of signing some of Leiston's players. In 2011, Leiston Holdings secured 50% of Andre Carrillo's ""economic rights"" when it loaned Sporting â¬1m (about Â£850,000) to help them purchase the player from Alianza Lima. The financial deal contained a number of clauses, as was common in TPO agreements. It said that if a transfer offer of more than â¬6m was made for Carrillo and Sporting Lisbon did not accept it, they would have to pay Leiston 45% of the value of the offer. And Sporting agreed to pay Leiston a ""risk fee"" of more than â¬127,000 for each season Carrillo played for the club. ThePortuguese club's accounts,externalshowed it owed Leiston â¬2.6m in 2014-15. Leiston also owned stakes in two other Sporting players - Gael Etock, who played for the club between 2012 and 2013, and Valentim Viola who was in the squad between 2012 and 2016. Former England and Liverpool striker John Barnes told Panorama that while third-party ownership could not really influence what happens on the pitch, it was important players had an identity and loyalty to the club they played for and their supporters. ""From a moral point of view, and from an integrity of the sport point of view - when you sign for a club, your integrity and your loyalty should be to that club 100%."" Mr Abramovich's spokeswoman said: ""The fact that transactions may have been confidential, does not mean that they were unlawful or otherwise in breach of then applicable rules or regulations."" She said they ""relate to the period before Fifa changed their rules"". The spokeswoman added that suspicious activity reports do not mean laws or rules have been broken, saying: ""The fact that we are not aware of this issue, confirms that there has been no wrongdoing as no action was taken.""

Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter,"People are being advised to get a flu jab to help protect against the ""double danger"" of flu and coronavirus. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. More peoplewill be offered a free flu vaccine this year - anyone over 50 in England is eligible. Avaccine for coronavirusis not available yet and experts are worried the UK could see the virus rip through the population this winter. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu: Why we still need to worry about it this winter How bad will winter really be? Research from Public Health England looking at Covid-19 illness between January and April among nearly 20,000 hospital patients suggests risk of death is more than doubled for people who catch flu on top of coronavirus, compared to coronavirus alone. Flu by itself can also be a serious condition - it kills around 11,000 people in England each year and hospitalises many more. People at high risk from flu are also most at risk from Covid-19. people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s healthcare and social care staff people living in a residential or nursing home people who are the main carer for an elderly or disabled person The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,externalare running flu campaigns. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said: ""Flu can be deadly and it is easily spread in children and adults. The vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from becoming ill with the flu, especially if you are in a vulnerable group. ""This winter with Covid still circulating, and the increased risk to life if you are ill with both viruses simultaneously, it is even more vital to get the free jab as soon as you can."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? People who are not eligible for a free jab could pay for one at pharmacies and supermarkets, although availability is limited currently while stocks are prioritised to those who need it the most. Boots has temporarilysuspended its bookings for anyone under the age of 65,externaland is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest risk - people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. It is unclear how bad flu might be this winter - some years are worse than others - but experts say the vaccine is a good match for the strain of flu that will be circulating. Flu, like coronavirus, is a viral infection that is passed on through coughs and sneezes. Social distancing, masks and handwashing should help reduce the spread of both. Most people with flu recover at home in a week, but people with chronic conditions or who are over 65 should call NHS 111. If you think you have either flu or Covid-19, stay at home and self-isolate.

May 'cannot support' government's Brexit bill,"Former Prime Minister Theresa May has said she ""cannot support"" the government's plan to override parts of its Brexit agreement with the EU. She told MPs the move, which breaks international law, would damage ""trust in the United Kingdom"". The Internal Market Bill will be voted on in the Commons on Tuesday, having passed its first hurdle last week. Ministers say it contains vital safeguards to protect Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union on 1 January. But it gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of the UK's exit from the EU earlier this year. PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons PM in compromise with Tory critics over Brexit bill What is the row over 'internal markets' all about? Ministers say this is a failsafe mechanism in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The section -know as the protocol- is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, As well as Mrs May, the other four living former prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron - have spoken out against the bill. Labour is opposing it and some Conservative MPs have raised concerns over its legal implications. Amid all this, Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week agreed to amend the bill so that the Commons would get a vote before he could use the powers involved in breaking international law. But Mrs May, whose own withdrawal agreement with the EU was repeatedly rejected by the Commons when she was prime minister, told MPs: ""Frankly, my view is to the outside world it makes no difference as to whether a decision to break international law is taken by a minister or by this Parliament - it is still a decision to break international law. ""This can only weaken the UK in the eyes of the world."" She added that, if the Internal Market Bill were passed, ""our reputation as a country that sticks by its word will have been tarnished"". The Conservative MP for Maidenhead added that governments around the world had ""trust in the United Kingdom"", asking: ""Where will that trust be in future if they see a United Kingdom willing to break its word and break international law?"" Mrs May also said there would be ""untold damage to the United Kingdom's reputation"". Northern Ireland Minister Robin Walker said the government still hoped to reach a trade agreement with the EU. He added: ""Through this bill, we are acting to uphold those priorities and deliver commitments we made in our election manifesto that we will provide unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market."" Mr Walker also said there were ""harmful legal defaults in some interpretations"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""The consequences of this for Northern Ireland in that scenario would be very damaging,"" he told MPs. ""We cannot and will not run that risk."" For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Paul Blomfield said giving MPs the power to decide whether to use measures in the bill the Commons did not ""resolve the issue"", which was ""the breach of international law"". SNP Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald called the legislation ""a grubby power-grab which we cannot and will not support"" and that sections of it hung ""like a badge of dishonour around this prime minister's term of office"".

Starmer to appeal to patriotism in leader speech,"This video can not be played Sir Keir: ""We still have a lot of work to do"" Sir Keir Starmer has told Labour to ""get serious about winning"" in his first conference speech as leader. Sir Keir attacked Boris Johnson's ""serial incompetence"" and said he was ""just not up to the job"" of being PM. But he said Labour had work to do win back voters' trust - and had deserved to lose the 2019 general election. In an online broadcast, he set out his vision for the UK and urged voters to ""take another look at Labour"", adding: ""We are under new leadership."" And he assured voters who deserted the party in droves in some of its traditional heartlands: ""We love this country as you do."" Starmer speech reaction Starmer faces challenges over patriotism call Labour aims to build trust with new slogan A guide to party conferences in a Covid world The speech was delivered to a near-empty room, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, because of social distancing restrictions, and was greeted with silence instead of the usual applause and ovations. He criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and said the crisis had revealed Boris Johnson as being ""just not serious"" and ""not up to the job"". ""It makes me angry that, just when the country needs leadership, we get serial incompetence,"" said the Labour leader. But he said Labour had to be ""brutally honest"" with itself about why had it had lost four general elections in a row. ""When you lose an election in a democracy you deserve to. You don't look at the electorate and ask them: 'what were you thinking?',"" he told the party. He said Labour was ""becoming a competent, credible Opposition but that's not enough"". And he vowed that ""never again will Labour go into an election not being trusted on national security, with your job, with your community and with your money. That's what being under new leadership means."" Keir Starmer literally stood in front of a red wall in Doncaster, and his key message was to those who had abandoned Labour in 2019 - we hear you. He has something of an innovative policy chief in Claire Ainsley - one who doesn't believe in setting out detailed policies. So he was blatant - clever policy offers aren't enough to win trust. Far more important are values. He emphasised the classic Labour values of ""compassion"" and ""opportunity"", but also stressed the importance of family and security - seen as a weak spot for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. His message to his own party was more brutal than anticipated - suggesting that it would be a ""betrayal"" to be anything other than relentless in seeking power. But he was also brutal towards the prime minister - Starmer was a serious lawyer when Boris Johnson was writing flippant columns. So far, Starmer's focus as Labour leader has been on competence. Polling suggests this has been successful  - but he has been accused of being managerial, even funereal, in his approach. Today he succeeded in injecting passion into a speech in a near empty hall. His ""new leadership"" is ambitious for change, but he was also ""angry"" that he wasn't in power to achieve it. Labour's four-day online event replaced the party's traditional party conference due to be held in Liverpool, which was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In his speech, Sir Keir said the policies on which Labour will fight the next election in 2024 ""won't sound like anything you've heard before"". ""It will sound like the future arriving,"" he said of the party's next manifesto. On Brexit, Sir Keir, who campaigned for a second referendum, declared that Labour would not be a party ""that keeps banging on about Europe"". ""Let me absolutely clear,"" he said, ""the debate between Leave and Remain is over."" He called on the prime minister to secure a trade deal with the EU, and said he would be ""failing Britain"" if he failed to achieve one. He also pledged to fight for the Union, saying: ""We must make the case much more persuasively that we achieve more together than we do alone. ""To stop the Nationalists ripping our country apart by design, and to stop the Tories dismantling it by neglect."" Sir Keir replaced Jeremy Corbyn as leader in the contest that followed December's general election, where the party won fewer Commons seats than any election since 1935. The broadcast Sir Keir's first Labour conference speech since becoming leader in April. On the economy, the Labour leader repeated calls for ""properly funded"" public services and ""huge investment"" in skills to create work opportunities. He also called for action to tackle climate change, and for the government to develop a new strategy to close gaps in education inequality. And he pledged to work ""hand-in-hand"" with both the private sector and trade unions in a bid to create ""high quality jobs"". Momentum, the left wing campaign group originally set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, said Sir Keir's speech was a ""missed opportunity to show substance"". The group's co-chair, and West Midlands regional secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Andrew Scattergood, said: ""If Starmer wants to appeal to working class voters, his pitch should be based on solidarity with the working class and defending their interests, not just slogans and platitudes."" He accused the Labour leader of being silent on key issues, including Black Lives Matter and the end of the evictions ban in England - and suggested he was ""rowing back"" on promises made during his leadership campaign, such as taxing the ""super rich"". But Nathan Yeowell, director of Progress, which was originally set up to campaign for Blairite values, tweeted: ""It is so refreshing to have a Labour leader who wants to win."" In a message to supporters after the Labour leader's speech, the Conservative Party said: ""Sir Keir Starmer was a key member of Jeremy Corbyn's top team. ""Even now whilst he pretends to be showing 'new leadership' he can't even name a single one of Corbyn's polices he'd drop.""

Local lockdowns in four more counties in Wales,"This video can not be played ""Everyone will be affected financially"" Four more counties in south Wales will go into lockdown from 18:00 BST on Tuesday, meaning more than a quarter of the Welsh population will be under tighter restrictions. Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent and Newport follow Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly county into lockdown. People will not be able to enter or leave those areas except for a limited number of exemptions, such as work. Licensed premises such as pubs and bars will need to shut by 23:00 every night. People will only be able to mix with those not in their own household outdoors - meeting people from extended households indoors will be banned in the four areas. The pub rule will also be extended to Caerphilly county borough. Vaughan Gething, Welsh Government health minister, said there had been a ""worrying and rapid rise in cases in four other south Wales council areas - Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport"". ""It's always a difficult decision to introduce restrictions but coronavirus has not gone away - it is still circulating in communities across Wales and, as we are seeing in parts of south Wales, small clusters can quickly cause real issues in local communities."" It comes as the UK's four chief medical officers agreed to upgrade the coronavirus alert level from three to four,meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". What can I do during local lockdowns? Live: Welsh Government coronavirus update The new measures affect 431,000 people, meaning that just over 850,000 people in Wales will be under local lockdown from Tuesday. The rules mean you cannot visit or leave the six counties affected without a ""reasonable excuse"". That includes: For work, if you cannot work from home For education For buying essentials like food or medicine To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm To visit family or close friends on compassionate grounds Motorists can continue to travel through the areas on the M4 and other roads. People can continue to meet outdoors in groups of up to 30 people, but cannot meet other households indoors at home or in pubs or restaurants. Rebecca James says the pub curfew will not have much of an impact during the week Customers at the The Pen and Wig pub in Newport on Monday were not convinced a pub curfew would help to control the virus. Richard Wooding said the earlier closing time could encourage people to have house parties: ""If the bars shut earlier, then people just come out earlier. ""I came out last Saturday, I was appalled at the number of people out. The bar staff can't police it. But I don't think you can stop it. People are just going to party in their own houses."" Another customer, Rebecca James, said: ""I don't think there's much of a nightlife here anyway. On the weekends it will affect people, going home early, but during the week everything closes around 11 anyway."" But Justin Cliffe, who runs events for Le Pub, was concerned: ""For us as a pub, to close at 11, it's not good. This venue runs until 1am so it's a nightlife spot rather than [somewhere for a] pub lunch. ""So the options that we're discussing are whether the pub closes completely or whether we just revert to doing take out or food for delivery. We're going over the options, but it doesn't look good."" Newport bar owner Jack Bannister fears some customers will stay away Jack Bannister, who owns Newport bar Breeze, said he was hoping people would make up for the curfew by starting their night earlier, but feared some may stay away altogether. He said: ""Inevitably, I think it will be quieter. In a lot of people's eyes, there will be no point in going out. And with this rule of one household - well that's going to be impossible."" The bar had to shut earlier this month after a customer tested positive for Covid-19. ""We were doing really well before that happened,"" he said. ""We did the responsible thing we felt, by informing our Facebook page"". ""But there's always going to that stigma - that Breeze had a case, do I want to go there and catch it? Even though it's not our fault."" Newport Live, which runs Newport council's leisure facilities, said it will turn away people who are not from the city with the exceptions for elite athletes and people with specific health or mobility issues. On Monday, Public Health Wales (PHW) said there had beena further 234 cases of people with coronavirus, but no new deaths. Of these, 40 were in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 20 in Blaenau Gwent, 15 in Caerphilly, 14 in Bridgend, 12 in Merthyr and 11 in Newport. In the past seven days, the number of people with the virus per 100,000 of the population was 102.8 in Merthyr, 83.3 in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 60.1 in Blaenau Gwent, 53 in Caerphilly and Bridgend and 45.3 in Newport. The threshold for the UK government to considertriggering quarantine conditionsfor people returning from countries outside of the UK is 20. PHW figures showed in the week from 16-22 March, whennational lockdown was announced, there were 393 cases in Wales, with a case rate of 12.5 per 100,00 people. Last week, 14-20 September, there were 921 cases and a case rate of 29.2 per 100,000 people. On Monday, speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said the rising case numbers could not be blamed on an increase in testing as there was also an""increase in positivity of the tests done"". At a press conference Mr Gething said he would hold ""an urgent meeting"" on Tuesday with councils, health boards and police forces from Bridgend to the English border. It will discuss the wider regional situation and whether further measures are needed. Earlier, senior UK government advisers warned of a ""six-month problem"" ofrising cases. Mr Gething said he could not ""definitively"" give a timescale of how long lockdown measures would be needed. He said ""all-Wales"" measures may be needed to tackle the virus. But Mr Gething said such action may be short of the full lockdown imposed on 23 March. Newport is seeing a ""wide spread of cases"", Mr Gething said A call between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford took place on Monday afternoon. A Welsh Government spokesman said the pair ""agreed on the need to work on a four-nation basis to discuss UK-wide measures where these were necessary"". Mr Drakeford is due to take part in a Cobra meeting on coronavirus with UK and devolved government ministers on Tuesday. Downing Street, which also held calls with senior ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland, said the prime minister was taking the rising infection rate ""very seriously"". ""He reiterated his unwavering commitment to working with the devolved administrations as we continue to tackle the virus,"" a spokesman said. ""They all agreed to act with a united approach, as much as possible, in the days and weeks ahead tomorrow to discuss next steps for the country."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies called for ""smart, hyper-local lockdowns"". ""Ministers and governments must do everything possible to avoid another blanket national lockdown as the other public health and economic impacts would be disastrous,"" he said. His Plaid Cymru counterpart Helen Mary Jones called for furlough to be extended to support local lockdowns. ""If Westminster won't extend furlough scheme to support local lockdowns, then the Welsh Government needs to look at what support they might be able to provide,"" she said. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK government would be introducing a new isolation support payment for people on low incomes in England who could not work because they had tested positive or were asked to self-isolate. He said funding would be provided to the devolved administrations so similar support could be offered to people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Gething said once the Welsh Government had seen the detail of the funding, it would decide how to spend the money. What can I do during local lockdowns?

Countryside improvements fund 'could be raided',"In the UK, wheat is the largest arable crop A plan to use all of England's farm grants to protect the environment is being diluted, the BBC has learned. Currently, farmers get a guaranteed EU grant based on the amount of land they farm. Ministers said that after Brexit they must earn grants by doing things that benefit Nature, like planting forests or capturing flood waters. But those with smaller farms said the new nature-friendly system wouldn't offer them enough to stay in business. So, to the alarm of environmentalists, they've persuaded ministers to create a new scheme rewarding them for simple actions such as conserving soil, or keeping pesticides out of streams. Environmentalists say farmers shouldn't be paid extra for enhancing soil which benefits their business anyway - or for obeying the laws prohibiting water pollution. But the government has accepted the need for those working on small farms - particularly in the uplands - to be cushioned as the old EU grant system is phased out over the next seven years. Why do farmers get paid by taxpayers? Ministers will replace the EU policy with a new system known as ELMS, the Environmental Land Management Scheme. The new system demands ""public money for public goods"", and it's won applause from people on both sides of the Brexit debate. Agriculture Bill: Soil at heart of UK farm grant revolution UK farms plan for going 'carbon neutral'. But under pressure from farmers, ministers are now drawing up a parallel easy-to-enter scheme - the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) - to reward farmers for basic activities round the farm such as crop rotation. Environmentalists say actions like this are normal good practice and shouldn't be funded by the taxpayer. They say the easy-to-do actions under the SFI will divert taxpayers' cash from bigger landscape-scale changes such as re-wilding under the more ambitious ELMS. But farmers are relieved - they say with Brexit uncertainty it's important for them to secure some income without too much difficulty. Those with small farms take a very different view - they're relieved that the government is looking to find a way of keeping their businesses afloat - for the time being, at least. Phil Stocker from the National Sheep Association told BBC News: ""Most livestock businesses have ended up through the years being dependent on support (subsidy). Any change is going to cause a lot of uncertainty. ""We'd like to be paid for really good soil management that protects soil life; for good management that stops nutrients and soil going into water courses; for managing hedgerows and looking after trees. They cost the business, and we know the public love these environments."" The head of Natural England, Tony Juniper, added: ""It's right to have some level of the scheme available to all to contribute something through soil management, water management, maybe trees. These are all things pretty much all farmers can join in with."" Britain has a long history of sheep farming Some farmers are also pushing the government to reward them for contributing to secure supplies of food - so-called food security; or for producing artisanal local foods. They argue that the public also wants to see small farms stay in business, so this should also be regarded as a public good. A debate is bubbling about whether these constitute public goods or not. Farmers and campaigners alike agree on the need for urgent decisions from a government preoccupied with Covid-19. Tom Bradshaw from the farmers' union NFU told BBC News: ""We are just lacking clarity now at an incredibly important time in terms of a new trade agreements; Brexit deal; new immigration policy; and (farm grants)  transition. There's so much uncertainty in the industry. Farmers can't plan. We desperately need clarity."" A Defra spokesperson said: ""The Environmental Land Management scheme will create cleaner, greener landscapes, helping build towards the government's environmental goals and net zero commitments. ""As we phase out direct payments ahead of the full roll out in 2024, we will offer financial assistance to help farmers prepare, and invest in ways to improve their productivity and manage the environment sustainably.""

Sports bodies warn of 'lost generation',"Plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues was placed under review earlier this month after a rise in Covid-19 cases The leaders of more than 100 sports bodies have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for emergency funding, warning of ""a lost generation of activity"" because of coronavirus. The coalition of organisations says they are ""united in our concern that at a time when our role should be central to the nation's recovery, the future of the sector is perilous"". In a letter seen by BBC Sport, the group urges the government to provide a ""sports recovery fund"" so the sector can ""survive and stabilise"". The governmentannounced on Tuesdaythat plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues from 1 October will not go ahead. The letter written by the organisations, which include the Football Association, Premier League, Rugby Football Union, England and Wales Cricket Board and Lawn Tennis Association, adds: ""We require a comprehensive support package for the sport and physical sector to aid its recovery. ""This package must combine investment, tax incentives, and regulatory reform. ""Covid-19 has undermined our commercial revenue streams with both stadiums and leisure facilities closed or greatly reduced in capacity. ""The impact of this will potentially lead to a lost generation of sport and activity. ""We are particularly concerned about the impact on those whose participation has been limited during the pandemic. Physical activity levels, especially in the most vulnerable groups, are significantly below where they were tracking pre-Covid-19."" The arts industry was given a Â£1.57bn support package by the government in July. Although Sport England has handed out Â£200m for emergency cases, many in the sector believe more is needed. A series of sports bodies have announced job losses in recent weeks and warned they face major mounting losses if turnstiles are not opened soon. The government is to ask sports bodies to assess the financial impact of several more months without paying spectators, and is understood to be preparing to work with organisations on what support might be needed to help them survive. In the letter, the prime minister is told that sport and physical activity contributes more than Â£16bn and 600,000 jobs to the UK economy. ""Our sector will be at the forefront of your plans to improve the health and wellbeing of all communitiesâ¦to solving societal issuesâ¦including reducing health inequalities, tackling obesity, cutting crime, easing loneliness, and enhancing social cohesion,"" the group adds. ""But to do so effectively, we require your government's backing."" Lisa Wainwight, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: ""The strength of this coalition from the sports, recreation and activity sector cannot be ignored in its public call to the prime minister. ""The pandemic has put an incredible strain on our sector, which was forced to close for a prolonged period. ""It is imperative that our sector gets the support it requires from the government to get back to business, in order to ease the pressures on the NHS and play a central role in our nation's recovery."" Swim England has reported that 22% of public pools remain closed and all those that are open have reduced capacity. Some 36% of clubs remain without access to pools. Industry bodies Community Leisure UK and UK Active estimate leisure centres, swimming pools and community services face a shortfall of more than Â£800m this year. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""This isn't just about the number of people on a pitch, field, court or in a pool or gym. ""This is about the whole ecosystem that supports sport, fitness and leisure and, if we're not careful, historic clubs and the jobs that support them will be lost, potentially for good. If government is going to shut sport down then it needs to provide a package of support to stop its decimation."" Tricky Podcast:Has cancel culture gone too far?

Pubs in England to have 10pm closing times,"All pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues in England must have a 22:00 closing time from Thursday, to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The sector will also be restricted by law to table service only. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said people should also work from home ""if they can"" andtrials of spectators at sports fixtures would be ""paused"". The full measures will be set out by the prime minister in the House of Commons later. Boris Johnson will also address the nation in a live broadcast at 20:00 BST on Tuesday. It comes asthe UK's Covid-19 alert level moved to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast that there was evidence the 22:00 closing time has a ""beneficial effect"" on the spread of the virus in areas where the restriction has already been tried. How does the Covid-19 alert level system work? How many cases are there in your area? He denied the government was wrong to relax coronavirus measures against the virus in the summer, describing the new restrictions as a ""recalibration which we hope and believe will be enough to check the spread"". ""We're not going back to the sorts of measures that we had in the spring,"" he said. ""If people can work from home they should"", he added. ""But I stress that it's very important that those people whose jobs require them to be in a specific workplace do so."" Mr Gove said plans for sport with live audiences to return from 1 October were being halted ""for the moment"" because of the risk of fans mixing on the way to the stadium or during half-time. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance haswarned there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-Octoberwithout further action - which, he said, could lead to more than 200 deaths per day by mid-November. Prof Calum Semple, an expert in outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told BBC Breakfast current data was ""tracking the worst-case scenario quite accurately"". He said there was now a rise in hospital admissions, including among women aged 20 to 40, who were at risk of exposure to the virus because of their work in hospitality, caring roles or because they were parents of schoolchildren. The UK needed ""quite a lot more"" restrictions in place to prevent the spread, and the hospitality industry will probably have to take another ""hit"", Prof Semple said. Andy Wood, chief executive of the Adnams brewery, told the Today programme that the pub industry had taken health messages seriously and it seemed ""incongruous"" to be singled out. He said the industry was still ""on life support"" with about 900,000 jobs at risk. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases and 11 deaths were reported in the UK. Also: Further restrictions will also be announcedin Scotlandon Tuesday Restrictions on households mixing indoorswill be extended to all of Northern Ireland Also from 18:00 on Tuesday,four more counties in south Wales will face new measures, including a 23:00 curfew for pubs and bars New measureswill also come into force in Lancashire, Merseyside, parts of the Midlands and West Yorkshirefrom Tuesday. Other areas of England, Scotland and Wales are already underlocal lockdown, with restrictions including a ban on mixing with other households. People are understandably asking what difference closing at 22:00 makes. Coupled with the table service law, it will be little more than a marginal gain. But what ministers hope is that the move, along with the rule of six, will act as a warning to the public that efforts to curb the virus need to be redoubled. What remains to be seen is whether any other restrictions will accompany this move. It seems inevitable that the virus will continue to spread - that's what respiratory viruses do during winter, especially one for which there is limited immunity and no vaccine. But how quickly and widely - no one knows. The risk of trying to suppress the virus is the government will soon find itself having to make another decision about further steps. How far are ministers prepared to go? Every restriction that is taken has a negative consequence to society. But the nature of the virus means lives will undoubtedly be lost the more it spreads. Balancing those two harms will define the next six months. The cabinet will meet on Tuesday morning and Boris Johnson will also chair a Cobra emergency meeting - which will be attended by the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Speaking about the new closing times, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""We know this won't be easy, but we must take further action to control the resurgence in cases of the virus and protect the NHS."" Tighter restrictions on pub and restaurant opening times are already in place in parts of north-east and north-west England, and Wales. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the new rules as ""a step backwards"", as he urged the government to fix the test and trace system and help the hospitality sector. ""After people have already been through so much hardship, we cannot allow thousands of jobs to disappear overnight,"" he said. There were also calls for support from within the hospitality sector. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said the new rules should be ""applied with flexibility"", and that a 22:00 closing time was ""bad for business and bad for controlling the virus"". She added: ""Table service has been widely adopted in some parts of the sector since reopening, but it is not necessary across all businesses, such as coffee shops."" Meanwhile, Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night-Time Industries Association, warned the move would result in a ""surge of unregulated events and house parties"". If Boris Johnson had decreed a year ago that he was going to call last orders on the pub at 22:00, the ravens might have left the Tower. But given the terrible warnings from the government's top scientists on Monday, thekind of strict measures that ministers had been discussing- and the extent of restrictions that many people are already living with in some of our towns and cities - you might wonder if what the prime minister has ended up deciding is less stringent than it might have been. As we have talked about many times, Downing Street is all too aware of the economic havoc the restrictions around the pandemic have caused. Logically, therefore, it has always only wanted to take action when it has felt absolutely urgent. It is also the case that, as we enter a second surge, more is understood about the virus itself. That means the government ought to be able to take a more sophisticated approach to managing the spread, rather than blunt, blunderbuss nationwide measures. At least for now, the prime minister has concluded there is a narrow, but real chance to put the brakes on the outbreak before taking more draconian steps. Read more from Laura. It comes as Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the latest restrictions seemed ""to have emerged from a random policy generator"" as he called on the government to publish the evidence upon which it was based. ""While mandatory table service has been part of the successful Swedish approach and may have merit, the new closing time will be devastating to a hospitality sector that was already suffering after the first lockdown,"" he said. The prime minister's announcement on closing times comes after a series of meetings over the weekend, including with the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

What can I do during local lockdowns?,"Conwy is one of the counties in north Wales under local lockdown restrictions People living in 17 areas around Wales are now facing local lockdown restrictions. The city of Bangor in Gwynedd becomes the second place in Wales to face hyper-local restrictions to deal with a massive spike in Covid cases. It is the only part of Gwynedd being told to enforce stricter coronavirus measures. It joins four other areas in north Wales, while 12 areas in south and south-west Wales are in local lockdown. That includes Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, where the hyper-local restrictions were imposed on the town on 25 September. It means more than two million people will be subject to tighter local restrictions. Here's a guide to what you can and can't do. The city of Bangor in Gwynedd has been placed under a local lockdown Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave a total of 15 entire council areas, the town of Llanelli, and from 18:00 on Saturday, 10 October, the city of Bangor, without a ""reasonable excuse"". There are a number of excuses listed in the law used to enforce the regulations. These include travelling to school, to give care or to work if you are unable to work from home. You can only go to your place of work and then back home again, although you are allowed to use cafes and shops there if needed, such as to buy lunch. You can travel to buy food and medical supplies, seek medical assistance or go to the vets, and move home. If you are buying essential items and there is no reasonable alternative to using shops within these counties, you can do so. However, in most cases there are expected to be alternative options, even if this involves travelling a bit further than you would normally. Other reasons include: Obtaining supplies for the essential upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household, or the household of a vulnerable person Children travelling in order to play sport Elite athletic training and competitions To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm Otherwise, the borders are effectively closed. BBC Wales has been told the Welsh Government considers compassionate visits to a loved one as a reasonable excuse, although it is not listed in the legislation. Swansea has been added to the list of local lockdown areas Rules for meeting indoors have changed. Friends and family can no longer meet indoors, while overnight stays are also banned. Soextended householdsare unable to meet, essentially meaning you cannot enter anyone else's home in the affected counties. Meeting people from outside your extended household indoors remains banned in the rest of Wales. All licensed premises across Walesmust stop selling all alcohol at 22:00every day. That includes pubs, cafes, restaurants and supermarkets. You can still go for a drink or a meal indoors, but only with members of your immediate household. You can eat and drink with people from other households outdoors as long as you maintain social distancing. Rules against meeting other people from outside your household indoors still apply in pubs and restaurants. Pubs must stop serving alcohol at 22:00 with 20 minutes to drink-up In shops, yes you have to. People in Walesmust wear face masks in shops, other indoor public spacesand public transport as coronavirus cases rise. UK virus increase 'concerning', says minister Highest reported cases in Wales since June Five bars warned over social distancing measures Yes. Schools, which have only just returned from the summer holidays, will stay open. However,a number of schools across Wales have told pupils to isolateafter positive tests, so any changes will be done on a case-by-case basis. Students can still attend school and colleges No. In a Facebook question and answer video about local lockdown in Caerphilly, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said if residents had booked holidays already they should speak to their providers, explain it would be a breach of the law for them to attend, and seek a refund. Officials would be in touch with package holiday providers and insurers ""to explain to them the seriousness of the position and the risk to them and their business if people from Caerphilly were nevertheless to go on holiday"", he added. Yes, but with restrictions. Marriages and civil partnerships can take still take place under the local lockdowns with small receptions, but guests from outside the area cannot attend the reception. It is the same for funerals and wakes. Those living in the boroughs can attend a wedding ceremony or funeral outside the area, but not a reception or a funeral wake. People can leave if they cannot work from home, to give care, go to school or for essential shopping We don't know exactly. The lockdown measures in each area will be reviewed two weeks after they began, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said there were ""cautious reasons"" for optimism, based on how lockdown measures were working in Caerphilly county borough, the first area to be targeted for new restrictions. The county has seen a ""levelling off and a slight reduction in new cases"" thoughlockdown will last at least another week, the Welsh Government announced on Thursday. By the end of that period, Caerphilly would have been in local lockdown for three weeks. Children whose parents do not live in the same home can continue to move between homes, whether inside or outside the affected area, the Welsh Government said. It said parents can continue to rely on wider family for childcare while they are in work, but only when""no other methods are available"",external. Yes. People who breach new laws could face fixed penalty notices of Â£60 for a first offence. Penalties will double with every subsequent offence, to a maximum of Â£1,920. Fixed penalty notices are used as an alternative to prosecution - if a case reached the courts, fines could be unlimited. The rules will be enforced by local authorities as well as the police. A senior officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said.

"UK 'could see 50,000 cases a day by mid-October'","This video can not be played Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance says measures must be taken to stop the spread of Covid-19 The UK could see 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action, the government's chief scientific adviser has warned. Sir Patrick Vallance said that would be expected to lead to about ""200-plus deaths per day"" a month after that. It comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency committee meeting on Tuesday morning, then make a statement in the House of Commons. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899. A further 11 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test, although these figures tend to be lower over the weekend and on Mondays due to reporting delays. Speaking at Downing Street alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick stressed the figures given were not a prediction, but added: ""At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. ""If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. ""Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day. ""The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. ""That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down."" What are the rules for meeting my friends? Scotland faces tighter restrictions 'within days' Four more counties in Wales face local lockdown Is it time we learnt to live with the virus? Prof Whitty added that if cases continued to double every seven days as Sir Patrick had set out, then the UK could ""quickly move from really quite small numbers to really very large numbers because of that exponential process"". ""So we have, in a bad sense, literally turned a corner, although only relatively recently,"" he said. Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said: The rising case numbers can not be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an ""increase in positivity of the tests done"" Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study) Less than 8% of the population has been infected, although the figure could be as high as 17% in London The rising transmission is a serious ""six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively"" - but science will eventually ""ride to our rescue"" The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contrary It is possible ""that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups"" but ""the first half of next year"" is much more likely The government's most senior science and medical advisers are clearly concerned about the rise in cases that have been seen in recent weeks. The warning about 50,000 cases a day by mid-October is stark. We don't know for sure how many cases there were at the peak in spring (as there was very limited testing in place) although some estimates put it at 100,000. However, they were also at pains to point out it was not a prediction - for one thing the 'rule of six' which came in just a week ago has not had time to have an impact. Even among the government's own advisers there is disagreement over whether what we are seeing is the start of an exponential rise or just a gradual increase in cases, which is what you would expect at this time of year as respiratory viruses tend to circulate more with the reopening of society. Spain and France, which both started seeing rises earlier than the UK, have not seen the sort of rapid trajectory that was presented by the advisers. Instead, what was quite telling was the clear social messaging. Even those who are not at a high risk of complications should, they say, play their part in curbing the spread of the virus - because if it spreads then difficult decisions will be needed that have profound societal consequences. But the big unanswered question is what ministers will do next. There is talk of further restrictions being introduced. A couple of things are in our favour that were not in the spring. Better treatments for those who get very sick are now available, while the government is in a stronger position to protect the vulnerable groups. Should ministers wait and see what happens? Or should they crack down early, knowing that will have a negative impact in other ways? Prof Whitty also said that even though different parts of the UK were seeing cases rising at different rates, and even though some age groups were affected more than others, the evolving situation was ""all of our problem"". He added that evidence from other countries showed infections were ""not staying just in the younger age groups"" but were ""moving up the age bands"". He said mortality rates from Covid-19 were ""significantly greater"" than seasonal flu, which killed around 7,000 annually or 20,000 in a bad year. Meanwhile, restrictions on households mixing indoorswill be extended to all of Northern Ireland from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. Areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will also face further local restrictions from Tuesday. And additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that,"" she said. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: ""It may be the case that UK-wide measures will be taken but that will require all four governments to exercise our varying share of power and responsibility to do so."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with leaders of the devolved administrations on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancockannounced a new exemption to local restrictions in England for formal and informal childcare arrangements, covering those looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults. ""It does not allow for play-dates or parties, but it does mean that a consistent childcare relationship that is vital for somebody to get to work is allowed,"" he told the Commons. It is not a question of ""if"". Downing Street will have to introduce extra restrictions to try to slow down the dramatic resurgence of coronavirus. You would only have to have dipped into a minute or two of the sober briefing from the government's most senior doctor and scientist on Monday morning to see why. What is not yet settled however, is exactly what, exactly when, and indeed, exactly where these restrictions will be. Here's what it is important to know: The government is not considering a new lockdown across the country right now. The prime minister is not about to tell everyone to stay at home as he did from the Downing Street desk in March. Ministers have no intention at all to close schools again. Nor, right now, are they planning to tell every business, other than the non-essential, to close again. What is likely is some kind of extra limits on our huge hospitality sector. Read more from Laura here. On Sunday, the prime minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Prof Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss possible further measures for England. Asked about reports of disagreements among cabinet ministers about whether or not to impose a second lockdown, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""A conversation, a debate, is quite proper and that is exactly what you'd expect. ""Everyone recognises there is a tension between... the virus and the measures we need to take, and the economy and ensuring people's livelihoods are protected."" Prof Peter Horby, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said there was a risk the UK could face a repeat of the ""catastrophic events"" around the world early this year, with intensive care units ""rammed full of very sick patients"". ""I really don't buy that argument that we should slow down... the mistakes that were made in March were nearly all being too cautious and too slow,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. However, Prof Karol Sikora, from the University of Buckinghamshire and former director of the World Health Organization's cancer programme, said blanket restrictions were ""not the way forward"". ""The most important thing is to target the groups that we need to protect and to let everybody else get on with their business - schools, shops and so on,"" he told the programme. Labour, meanwhile, has also urged the government to avoid a second national lockdown. ""This rapid spike in infections was not inevitable, but a consequence of the government's incompetence and failure to put in place an adequate testing system,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. ""The government must do what it takes to prevent another lockdown, which would cause unimaginable damage to our economy and people's wellbeing.""

UK Covid-19 alert level raised amid virus warnings,"The UK's coronavirus alert level is being upgraded from 3 to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"", its chief medical officers have said. It comes after the government's scientific adviser warnedthere could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a dayby mid-October without further action. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899. The prime minister will make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it sounded ""very likely"" that pubs and other venues in England will be forced to have 22:00 closing times, alongside other measures. How does the Covid-19 alert level system work? Is it time we learned to live with the virus? How many cases are there in my area? In a statement confirming their recommendation on moving to level 4, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said cases were now ""rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations"". They urged people to follow government guidelines ""to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS"" over the autumn and winter. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move reflected ""the significant shift in the current threat posed by coronavirus"". ""This country now faces a tipping point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop the spread of the virus and protect lives,"" he said. The alert level, which is recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, was reduced from level 4 to 3 on 19 June - which indicated the virus was ""in general circulation"" but there could be a ""gradual relaxation of restrictions"". The proposed upgrading comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday morning - which will be attended by the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amid data showing London was ""catching up"" with Covid-19 hotspots in northern England, the capital's Mayor Sadiq Khan said he believed acting early, ""rather than having to impose more stringent measures later"", was the right thing to do both for public health and the economy. Speaking at Downing Street earlier, alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick Vallance said: ""At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. ""If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. ""Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day. ""The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. ""That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down."" The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said: The rising case numbers cannot be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an ""increase in positivity of the tests done"" Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study) Less than 8% of the population has been infected to date, although the figure could be as high as 17% in London Even though different parts of the UK are seeing cases rising at different rates, and some age groups are affected more than others, the evolving situation has to be seen as a problem for everyone without exception Evidence from other countries shows infections are ""not staying just in the younger age groups"" but are ""moving up the age bands"" The rising transmission is a serious ""six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively"" - but science will eventually ""ride to our rescue"" The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contrary It is possible ""that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups"" but ""the first half of next year"" is much more likely On Sunday, the prime minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Prof Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss possible further measures for England, ahead of an expected announcement on Tuesday. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said Labour did not want to see another lockdown but it would be understandable if new measures were introduced as the ""exponential growth of the virus cannot be ignored"". It is not a question of ""if"". Downing Street will have to introduce extra restrictions to try to slow down the dramatic resurgence of coronavirus. You would only have to have dipped into a minute or two of the sober briefing from the government's most senior doctor and scientist on Monday morning to see why.

Areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will also face further local restrictions from Tuesday. And additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that,"" she said. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: ""It may be the case that UK-wide measures will be taken but that will require all four governments to exercise our varying share of power and responsibility to do so."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with leaders of the devolved administrations on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, the health secretaryannounced a new exemption to local restrictions in England for formal and informal childcare arrangements, covering those looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults.

Coronavirus: Evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening.UK,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning. TheUK is upgrading its Covid alert level,amid a rising number of cases, the country's chief medical officers have said. They are moving the level from 3 - meaning an epidemic is in general circulation - to 4, to signify an ""epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high or rising exponentially"".

This video can not be played Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance says measures must be taken to stop the spread of Covid-19 Tighter restrictions are to beextended to all of Northern Irelandfrom 18:00 BST on Tuesday. Health Minister Robin Swann said there would be no mixing of households indoors, with some exceptions. Four more areas in Wales are alsoto face local lockdowns. Meanwhile,additional restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotlandthis week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. Local lockdown restrictions in England will be eased to allow people to look after children under the age of 14, or vulnerable adults,from outside their household. Announcing the change, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""For many, informal childcare arrangements are a lifeline without which they couldn't do their jobs."" The move will, for example, allow grandparents to look after grandchildren, even in areas where households can't mix.

"Sports bodies warn of 'lost generation'More than 100 sports bodies write to the prime minister to ask for emergency funding amid the Covid-19 crisis, warning of ""a lost generation of activity"".BBC Sport","Plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues was placed under review earlier this month after a rise in Covid-19 cases The leaders of more than 100 sports bodies have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for emergency funding, warning of ""a lost generation of activity"" because of coronavirus. The coalition of organisations says they are ""united in our concern that at a time when our role should be central to the nation's recovery, the future of the sector is perilous"". In a letter seen by BBC Sport, the group urges the government to provide a ""sports recovery fund"" so the sector can ""survive and stabilise"". The governmentannounced on Tuesdaythat plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues from 1 October will not go ahead. The letter written by the organisations, which include the Football Association, Premier League, Rugby Football Union, England and Wales Cricket Board and Lawn Tennis Association, adds: ""We require a comprehensive support package for the sport and physical sector to aid its recovery. ""This package must combine investment, tax incentives, and regulatory reform. ""Covid-19 has undermined our commercial revenue streams with both stadiums and leisure facilities closed or greatly reduced in capacity. ""The impact of this will potentially lead to a lost generation of sport and activity. ""We are particularly concerned about the impact on those whose participation has been limited during the pandemic. Physical activity levels, especially in the most vulnerable groups, are significantly below where they were tracking pre-Covid-19."" The arts industry was given a Â£1.57bn support package by the government in July. Although Sport England has handed out Â£200m for emergency cases, many in the sector believe more is needed. A series of sports bodies have announced job losses in recent weeks and warned they face major mounting losses if turnstiles are not opened soon. The government is to ask sports bodies to assess the financial impact of several more months without paying spectators, and is understood to be preparing to work with organisations on what support might be needed to help them survive. In the letter, the prime minister is told that sport and physical activity contributes more than Â£16bn and 600,000 jobs to the UK economy. ""Our sector will be at the forefront of your plans to improve the health and wellbeing of all communitiesâ¦to solving societal issuesâ¦including reducing health inequalities, tackling obesity, cutting crime, easing loneliness, and enhancing social cohesion,"" the group adds. ""But to do so effectively, we require your government's backing."" Lisa Wainwight, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: ""The strength of this coalition from the sports, recreation and activity sector cannot be ignored in its public call to the prime minister. ""The pandemic has put an incredible strain on our sector, which was forced to close for a prolonged period. ""It is imperative that our sector gets the support it requires from the government to get back to business, in order to ease the pressures on the NHS and play a central role in our nation's recovery."" Swim England has reported that 22% of public pools remain closed and all those that are open have reduced capacity. Some 36% of clubs remain without access to pools. Industry bodies Community Leisure UK and UK Active estimate leisure centres, swimming pools and community services face a shortfall of more than Â£800m this year. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""This isn't just about the number of people on a pitch, field, court or in a pool or gym. ""This is about the whole ecosystem that supports sport, fitness and leisure and, if we're not careful, historic clubs and the jobs that support them will be lost, potentially for good. If government is going to shut sport down then it needs to provide a package of support to stop its decimation."" Tricky Podcast:Has cancel culture gone too far?

"May 'cannot support' government's Brexit billThe former PM argues the legislation will ""damage trust"", but ministers say it will protect the UK.UK Politics","Former Prime Minister Theresa May has said she ""cannot support"" the government's plan to override parts of its Brexit agreement with the EU. She told MPs the move, which breaks international law, would damage ""trust in the United Kingdom"". The Internal Market Bill will be voted on in the Commons on Tuesday, having passed its first hurdle last week. Ministers say it contains vital safeguards to protect Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union on 1 January. But it gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of the UK's exit from the EU earlier this year. PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons PM in compromise with Tory critics over Brexit bill What is the row over 'internal markets' all about? Ministers say this is a failsafe mechanism in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The section -know as the protocol- is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, As well as Mrs May, the other four living former prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron - have spoken out against the bill. Labour is opposing it and some Conservative MPs have raised concerns over its legal implications. Amid all this, Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week agreed to amend the bill so that the Commons would get a vote before he could use the powers involved in breaking international law. But Mrs May, whose own withdrawal agreement with the EU was repeatedly rejected by the Commons when she was prime minister, told MPs: ""Frankly, my view is to the outside world it makes no difference as to whether a decision to break international law is taken by a minister or by this Parliament - it is still a decision to break international law. ""This can only weaken the UK in the eyes of the world."" She added that, if the Internal Market Bill were passed, ""our reputation as a country that sticks by its word will have been tarnished"". The Conservative MP for Maidenhead added that governments around the world had ""trust in the United Kingdom"", asking: ""Where will that trust be in future if they see a United Kingdom willing to break its word and break international law?"" Mrs May also said there would be ""untold damage to the United Kingdom's reputation"". Northern Ireland Minister Robin Walker said the government still hoped to reach a trade agreement with the EU. He added: ""Through this bill, we are acting to uphold those priorities and deliver commitments we made in our election manifesto that we will provide unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market."" Mr Walker also said there were ""harmful legal defaults in some interpretations"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""The consequences of this for Northern Ireland in that scenario would be very damaging,"" he told MPs. ""We cannot and will not run that risk."" For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Paul Blomfield said giving MPs the power to decide whether to use measures in the bill the Commons did not ""resolve the issue"", which was ""the breach of international law"". SNP Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald called the legislation ""a grubby power-grab which we cannot and will not support"" and that sections of it hung ""like a badge of dishonour around this prime minister's term of office"".

As it happened: Warning of UK virus 'accelerating'The health secretary outlines a new plan to prioritise tests after problems with the UK system.World,"UK chief medical officers say coronavirus alert level will move to level 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"" The UK could be facing 50,000 new Covid-19 cases a day by mid-October, if the current infection rate is not halted Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns that UK faces 'tipping point' on coronavirus cases UK PM Boris Johnson will address Commons on Tuesday about pandemic France changes rules around coronavirus cases in nurseries and primary schools to try to keep more open Parts of the Spanish capital Madrid are going into a tough new lockdown - more than 800,000 residents have been asked to stay at home There have been 31 million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Paul Gribben We are pausing our live coverage for now. Today's live page has been edited by Robert Greenall and Paul Gribben and written by Penny Spiller, Francesca Gillett, Ashita Nagesh and Doug Faulkner. Thank you for joining us and we will be back again on Tuesday. Here are some of the headlines from today: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for additional measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the capital as he said the testing system was a ""mess"". He told BBC London: ""We want additional measures to pre-empt further hospital admissions and deaths and to prevent a second lockdown."" He pointed to cities in the North East of England and in Birmingham as an example and said some things which had been done there could be done in London, including reducing the time bars, pubs and restaurants are open, and making sure events like weddings do not inadvertently lead to an increase in the spread of the virus. He said testing in London ""had been a mess"" with contact tracing ""collapsing"", adding that it appeared patterns of the virus being transmitted were different in the capital to other parts of the country. Mr Khan also said he hoped to be part of Tuesday's Cobra meeting but had not spoken to the prime minister since the last one on 10 May. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organisation says 156 countries, covering two-thirds of the worldâs population, have signed up to its joint facility aimed atdeveloping vaccines against coronavirus, and ensuring they are distributed fairly. The facility, known as Covax, hopes to have two billion doses of vaccine available by the end of next year but some key countries, among them the United States, have not signed up. The WHO says joining Covax makes sense: four out of five candidate vaccines fail and even the richest countries may pick the wrong ones, while joining forces to invest together in multiple possible vaccines (there are currently almost 200 in development) raises the chances of success for everyone. Sixty-four high income countries have signed up, including most of Europe, and 92 lower income countries but the US and China have not. The US says it will do bilateral deals to supply its own population. The WHOâs plan is different: the first two billion doses from Covax will be distributed globally, withpriority likely to be given to healthcare workers,  the elderly, and those with pre-existing health risks. Four St Andrews University students have contracted coronavirus after afreshers' week party. More than 40 people are now self-isolating following the gathering in a hall of residence, which broke national coronavirus restrictions. Sally Mapstone, principal of the Scottish university, said: ""The ripples from this single incident have consequences for all of us."" More generally, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing on Tuesday thatadditional lockdown restrictionswill ""almost certainly"" be put in place in coming days across the country. Madridâs famous opera house Teatro Real
was forced to cancel a performance on Sunday night after some people in the âcheap
seatsâ complained they were not socially-distanced enough. There were shouts and jeers of âsuspensionâ
even as the performance of Verdiâs aptly-named A Masked Ball began. Video circulating of the event showed full
rows of people in the upper sections where seats are cheaper, and empty
seats in the more expensive ground-level area. The theatre defended itself saying a âminorityâ
of the audience loudly objected despite being offered the chance to relocate to
different seats or have their tickets reimbursed. Spokesman Gregorio Maranon said
the theatre had met, and in some cases exceeded, all official health and safety requirements needed to open safely. Parts of Madrid are facing new
lockdown restrictions from Monday as cases of the coronavirus surge in
the Spanish capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

taking any new bookings for flu vaccinations for people under 65 â both the
free NHS jabs and privately paid for ones. It says itâs seen unprecedented demand for the vaccine in
recent weeks and is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest
risk â people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu
jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in
phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. Some 30 million people - more than ever before - will get
invites from the NHS programme this winter as the population faces the dual
threat of flu and coronavirus.  For the first time, people over 50 in

Two hotels in York and Middlesborough and a theatre in Salford will be used as Nightingale courts in an attempt to clear the backlog of cases which has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Justice has said. Five more courts are also earmarked for Chester, Liverpool, Bristol, Winchester and Cirencester but the buildings set to be used have not been confirmed. The courts, including atThe Lowry in Salford, will hear non-custodial crime cases, as well as civil, family and tribunals work and the announcement takes the total number of Nightingale courts to 18. Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said it was an important step and added that the number of outstanding cases in magistrates' courts was now falling as a result of measures.

A group of African American physicians are setting up an expert panel to independently vet regulators' decisions about drugs and vaccines for Covid-19,Stat News reports,external. The panel is being set up through theNational Medical Association,external, which calls itself the collective voice of African American physicians and the leading force for parity and justice in medicine and the elimination of disparities in health. Its president, Leon McDougle, was quoted by Stat News as saying: âItâs necessary to provide a trusted messenger of vetted information to the African American community. There is a concern that some of the recent decisions by the Food and Drug Administration have been unduly influenced by politicians.â He also hopes their reassurance will persuade more African Americans - who have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus - to take part in vaccine trials.  The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level for the UK should be increased to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"", the UK's chief medical officers have said. The move comes as the number of cases of coronavirus continues to rise, with experts warning that theUK could see 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October without further action. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland confirmed that all four nations of the UK should move to Level 4. The statement said: ""After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations. ""If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS and other health services over the autumn and winter everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly. ""We know this will be concerning news for many people; please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this."" Read morehere. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris Some 81 primary schools have had to close because of cases Franceâs education ministry is changing the rules around coronavirus
cases in nurseries and primary schools in an attempt to keep more of them
open.  From Tuesday, classes will only be cancelled if
three or more children test positive for Covid-19. Until now, if even one child in a class tested positive for coronavirus,
all his or her classmates would have to self-isolate.  That meant almost
2,000 classrooms standing empty across France at the start of this week,
and 81 primary schools completely closed. Under the rule changes,
classes with one case of coronavirus will continue as normal with the rest
of their pupils unless three children from different households all test
positive. Franceâs Public Health Council said last week that transmissions
were mainly occurring within families or at social gatherings outside
school premises. Teachers are obliged to wear masks, and Education
Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that the risk of transmission between
children was low. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster says that restrictions announced for certain local postcodes last week will now apply across NI as a whole from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. It means that people from different households cannot mix indoors unless they are in a social bubble. More than six people cannot meet outdoors. Mrs Foster says doing nothing was not an option but neither was returning to a full lockdown. Read morehere. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, responding to the health secretary in the Commons, said he welcomed the childcare lockdown exemptions and said he agreed that the country was at a ""perilous moment"". He said the tone of remarks from Matt Hancock on Sunday ""gave the impression he was blaming people for breaking the rules and allowing the virus to grow"". Mr Ashworth said: ""But the reality is people have done everything they have been asked to do. They have missed birthday celebrations, missed weddings, funerals. They have sent their children back to school, quite rightly, they have gone back to work. ""They did what they were asked to do. In return ministers were meant to fix test, trace and isolate so we could, in the words of his own government advert, get back to the things we love."" It's the afternoon here in London, but if you're joining us from the US - good morning. A lot has happened. To help you catch up, here's a summary of the latest US headlines. There has been an increase of 4,638 cases of coronavirus across the UK with 11 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. It takes the total number of deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the country to 41,788. The number of deaths reported at the start of the week tends to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Further restrictions are also being introduced in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston as well as in Bradford, Kirklees, and Calderdale, where residents are asked not to socialise outside their household or support bubble. The health secretary said: ""We know from experience local action can work when local communities come together to follow the rules, tackle the virus and keep themselves safe."" Mr Hancock said that the virus was increasing across the country and that ""we are at a tipping point"". He added the prime minister would address the House of Commons with any further action that needed to be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs about some of the new measures which have come into force as part of local lockdowns in areas of England, including the North East. The local lockdown rules ban people from socialising with others outside of their own household or support bubble. Mr Hancock says he has heard concerns about the impact that has been having on childcare arrangements. ""Today I'm able to announce a new exemption,"" he says. People looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults are exempt from that ban, when it's necessary for caring purposes. He says it covers formal and informal arrangements for childcare - but not playdates or parties. ""A consistent childcare relationship is allowed,"" he said. There had beencalls for such an exemption last week- afterfamilies warned that peoplewould have no other choice to break the rules. Mr Hancock announced that stronger restrictions would be brought in from Tuesday in parts of Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington. He said: ""In the summer when the virus was in retreat we were able to relax some of the measures we had put in place, now the virus is spreading once more, I have to act."" The health secretary said there would be restrictions on hospitality and socialising, including hospitality venues closing from 22:00. He said the overall strategy was to protect education and employment as much as possible. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thank you for joining us and we will be back again on Tuesday. Here are some of the headlines from today: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for additional measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the capital as he said the testing system was a ""mess"". He told BBC London: ""We want additional measures to pre-empt further hospital admissions and deaths and to prevent a second lockdown."" He pointed to cities in the North East of England and in Birmingham as an example and said some things which had been done there could be done in London, including reducing the time bars, pubs and restaurants are open, and making sure events like weddings do not inadvertently lead to an increase in the spread of the virus. He said testing in London ""had been a mess"" with contact tracing ""collapsing"", adding that it appeared patterns of the virus being transmitted were different in the capital to other parts of the country. Mr Khan also said he hoped to be part of Tuesday's Cobra meeting but had not spoken to the prime minister since the last one on 10 May. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organisation says 156 countries, covering two-thirds of the worldâs population, have signed up to its joint facility aimed atdeveloping vaccines against coronavirus, and ensuring they are distributed fairly. The facility, known as Covax, hopes to have two billion doses of vaccine available by the end of next year but some key countries, among them the United States, have not signed up. The WHO says joining Covax makes sense: four out of five candidate vaccines fail and even the richest countries may pick the wrong ones, while joining forces to invest together in multiple possible vaccines (there are currently almost 200 in development) raises the chances of success for everyone. Sixty-four high income countries have signed up, including most of Europe, and 92 lower income countries but the US and China have not. The US says it will do bilateral deals to supply its own population. The WHOâs plan is different: the first two billion doses from Covax will be distributed globally, withpriority likely to be given to healthcare workers,  the elderly, and those with pre-existing health risks. Four St Andrews University students have contracted coronavirus after afreshers' week party. More than 40 people are now self-isolating following the gathering in a hall of residence, which broke national coronavirus restrictions. Sally Mapstone, principal of the Scottish university, said: ""The ripples from this single incident have consequences for all of us."" More generally, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing on Tuesday thatadditional lockdown restrictionswill ""almost certainly"" be put in place in coming days across the country. Madridâs famous opera house Teatro Real
was forced to cancel a performance on Sunday night after some people in the âcheap
seatsâ complained they were not socially-distanced enough. There were shouts and jeers of âsuspensionâ
even as the performance of Verdiâs aptly-named A Masked Ball began. Video circulating of the event showed full
rows of people in the upper sections where seats are cheaper, and empty
seats in the more expensive ground-level area. The theatre defended itself saying a âminorityâ
of the audience loudly objected despite being offered the chance to relocate to
different seats or have their tickets reimbursed. Spokesman Gregorio Maranon said
the theatre had met, and in some cases exceeded, all official health and safety requirements needed to open safely. Parts of Madrid are facing new
lockdown restrictions from Monday as cases of the coronavirus surge in
the Spanish capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The high street pharmacy chain Boots says it is pausing
taking any new bookings for flu vaccinations for people under 65 â both the
free NHS jabs and privately paid for ones. It says itâs seen unprecedented demand for the vaccine in
recent weeks and is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest
risk â people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu
jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in
phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. Some 30 million people - more than ever before - will get
invites from the NHS programme this winter as the population faces the dual
threat of flu and coronavirus.  For the first time, people over 50 in
England will be eligible as well as secondary
school pupils in year 7. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says that raising the coronavirus alert level for the UK ""reflects the significant shift in the current threat
posed"". âThis country now faces a tipping
point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop

Mr Hancock said that the virus was increasing across the country and that ""we are at a tipping point"". He added the prime minister would address the House of Commons with any further action that needed to be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs about some of the new measures which have come into force as part of local lockdowns in areas of England, including the North East. The local lockdown rules ban people from socialising with others outside of their own household or support bubble. Mr Hancock says he has heard concerns about the impact that has been having on childcare arrangements. ""Today I'm able to announce a new exemption,"" he says. People looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults are exempt from that ban, when it's necessary for caring purposes. He says it covers formal and informal arrangements for childcare - but not playdates or parties. ""A consistent childcare relationship is allowed,"" he said. There had beencalls for such an exemption last week- afterfamilies warned that peoplewould have no other choice to break the rules. Mr Hancock announced that stronger restrictions would be brought in from Tuesday in parts of Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington. He said: ""In the summer when the virus was in retreat we were able to relax some of the measures we had put in place, now the virus is spreading once more, I have to act."" The health secretary said there would be restrictions on hospitality and socialising, including hospitality venues closing from 22:00. He said the overall strategy was to protect education and employment as much as possible. Â© 2025 BBC.

As it happened: Warning of UK virus 'accelerating'The health secretary outlines a new plan to prioritise tests after problems with the UK system.,"UK chief medical officers say coronavirus alert level will move to level 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"" The UK could be facing 50,000 new Covid-19 cases a day by mid-October, if the current infection rate is not halted Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns that UK faces 'tipping point' on coronavirus cases UK PM Boris Johnson will address Commons on Tuesday about pandemic France changes rules around coronavirus cases in nurseries and primary schools to try to keep more open Parts of the Spanish capital Madrid are going into a tough new lockdown - more than 800,000 residents have been asked to stay at home There have been 31 million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Paul Gribben We are pausing our live coverage for now. Today's live page has been edited by Robert Greenall and Paul Gribben and written by Penny Spiller, Francesca Gillett, Ashita Nagesh and Doug Faulkner. Thank you for joining us and we will be back again on Tuesday. Here are some of the headlines from today: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for additional measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the capital as he said the testing system was a ""mess"". He told BBC London: ""We want additional measures to pre-empt further hospital admissions and deaths and to prevent a second lockdown."" He pointed to cities in the North East of England and in Birmingham as an example and said some things which had been done there could be done in London, including reducing the time bars, pubs and restaurants are open, and making sure events like weddings do not inadvertently lead to an increase in the spread of the virus. He said testing in London ""had been a mess"" with contact tracing ""collapsing"", adding that it appeared patterns of the virus being transmitted were different in the capital to other parts of the country. Mr Khan also said he hoped to be part of Tuesday's Cobra meeting but had not spoken to the prime minister since the last one on 10 May. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organisation says 156 countries, covering two-thirds of the worldâs population, have signed up to its joint facility aimed atdeveloping vaccines against coronavirus, and ensuring they are distributed fairly. The facility, known as Covax, hopes to have two billion doses of vaccine available by the end of next year but some key countries, among them the United States, have not signed up. The WHO says joining Covax makes sense: four out of five candidate vaccines fail and even the richest countries may pick the wrong ones, while joining forces to invest together in multiple possible vaccines (there are currently almost 200 in development) raises the chances of success for everyone. Sixty-four high income countries have signed up, including most of Europe, and 92 lower income countries but the US and China have not. The US says it will do bilateral deals to supply its own population. The WHOâs plan is different: the first two billion doses from Covax will be distributed globally, withpriority likely to be given to healthcare workers,  the elderly, and those with pre-existing health risks. Four St Andrews University students have contracted coronavirus after afreshers' week party. More than 40 people are now self-isolating following the gathering in a hall of residence, which broke national coronavirus restrictions. Sally Mapstone, principal of the Scottish university, said: ""The ripples from this single incident have consequences for all of us."" More generally, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing on Tuesday thatadditional lockdown restrictionswill ""almost certainly"" be put in place in coming days across the country. Madridâs famous opera house Teatro Real
was forced to cancel a performance on Sunday night after some people in the âcheap
seatsâ complained they were not socially-distanced enough. There were shouts and jeers of âsuspensionâ
even as the performance of Verdiâs aptly-named A Masked Ball began. Video circulating of the event showed full
rows of people in the upper sections where seats are cheaper, and empty
seats in the more expensive ground-level area. The theatre defended itself saying a âminorityâ
of the audience loudly objected despite being offered the chance to relocate to
different seats or have their tickets reimbursed. Spokesman Gregorio Maranon said
the theatre had met, and in some cases exceeded, all official health and safety requirements needed to open safely. Parts of Madrid are facing new
lockdown restrictions from Monday as cases of the coronavirus surge in
the Spanish capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The high street pharmacy chain Boots says it is pausing
taking any new bookings for flu vaccinations for people under 65 â both the
free NHS jabs and privately paid for ones. It says itâs seen unprecedented demand for the vaccine in
recent weeks and is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest
risk â people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu
jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in
phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. Some 30 million people - more than ever before - will get
invites from the NHS programme this winter as the population faces the dual
threat of flu and coronavirus.  For the first time, people over 50 in
England will be eligible as well as secondary
school pupils in year 7. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says that raising the coronavirus alert level for the UK ""reflects the significant shift in the current threat
posed"". âThis country now faces a tipping
point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop
the spread of the virus and protect lives"". Confirmation of the new alert level follows experts warning that there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. Read morehere.   Two hotels in York and Middlesborough and a theatre in Salford will be used as Nightingale courts in an attempt to clear the backlog of cases which has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Justice has said. Five more courts are also earmarked for Chester, Liverpool, Bristol, Winchester and Cirencester but the buildings set to be used have not been confirmed. The courts, including atThe Lowry in Salford, will hear non-custodial crime cases, as well as civil, family and tribunals work and the announcement takes the total number of Nightingale courts to 18. Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said it was an important step and added that the number of outstanding cases in magistrates' courts was now falling as a result of measures.

A group of African American physicians are setting up an expert panel to independently vet regulators' decisions about drugs and vaccines for Covid-19,Stat News reports,external. The panel is being set up through theNational Medical Association,external, which calls itself the collective voice of African American physicians and the leading force for parity and justice in medicine and the elimination of disparities in health. Its president, Leon McDougle, was quoted by Stat News as saying: âItâs necessary to provide a trusted messenger of vetted information to the African American community. There is a concern that some of the recent decisions by the Food and Drug Administration have been unduly influenced by politicians.â He also hopes their reassurance will persuade more African Americans - who have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus - to take part in vaccine trials.  The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level for the UK should be increased to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"", the UK's chief medical officers have said. The move comes as the number of cases of coronavirus continues to rise, with experts warning that theUK could see 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October without further action. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland confirmed that all four nations of the UK should move to Level 4. The statement said: ""After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations. ""If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS and other health services over the autumn and winter everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly. ""We know this will be concerning news for many people; please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this."" Read morehere. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris Some 81 primary schools have had to close because of cases Franceâs education ministry is changing the rules around coronavirus
cases in nurseries and primary schools in an attempt to keep more of them
open.  From Tuesday, classes will only be cancelled if
three or more children test positive for Covid-19. Until now, if even one child in a class tested positive for coronavirus,
all his or her classmates would have to self-isolate.  That meant almost
2,000 classrooms standing empty across France at the start of this week,
and 81 primary schools completely closed. Under the rule changes,
classes with one case of coronavirus will continue as normal with the rest
of their pupils unless three children from different households all test
positive. Franceâs Public Health Council said last week that transmissions
were mainly occurring within families or at social gatherings outside
school premises. Teachers are obliged to wear masks, and Education
Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that the risk of transmission between
children was low. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster says that restrictions announced for certain local postcodes last week will now apply across NI as a whole from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. It means that people from different households cannot mix indoors unless they are in a social bubble. More than six people cannot meet outdoors. Mrs Foster says doing nothing was not an option but neither was returning to a full lockdown. Read morehere. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, responding to the health secretary in the Commons, said he welcomed the childcare lockdown exemptions and said he agreed that the country was at a ""perilous moment"". He said the tone of remarks from Matt Hancock on Sunday ""gave the impression he was blaming people for breaking the rules and allowing the virus to grow"". Mr Ashworth said: ""But the reality is people have done everything they have been asked to do. They have missed birthday celebrations, missed weddings, funerals. They have sent their children back to school, quite rightly, they have gone back to work. ""They did what they were asked to do. In return ministers were meant to fix test, trace and isolate so we could, in the words of his own government advert, get back to the things we love."" It's the afternoon here in London, but if you're joining us from the US - good morning. A lot has happened. To help you catch up, here's a summary of the latest US headlines. There has been an increase of 4,638 cases of coronavirus across the UK with 11 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. It takes the total number of deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the country to 41,788. The number of deaths reported at the start of the week tends to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Further restrictions are also being introduced in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston as well as in Bradford, Kirklees, and Calderdale, where residents are asked not to socialise outside their household or support bubble. The health secretary said: ""We know from experience local action can work when local communities come together to follow the rules, tackle the virus and keep themselves safe.""

Microsoft buys Fallout creator Bethesda for $7.5bn,"Xbox-owner Microsoft has acquired the games company behind blockbuster titles including Doom, Fallout, Skyrim and Wolfenstein. It is paying $7.5bn (Â£5.85bn) for Bethesda's parent ZeniMax Media. Xbox has said that the publisher's franchises would be added to its Game Pass subscription package for consoles and PCs. This could help make the forthcoming Xbox Series X more attractive than the PlayStation 5 to some players. Both machines are due to launch in November. Game Pass already gives players access to more than 200 games. Microsoft includes first-party titles at point of launch to those signed up to its ""ultimate"" package without further cost. By contrast, Sony has opted to charge players up to Â£70 for its own major releases and does not intend to include new titles in its PlayStation Plus Collection service. It is not yet clear how the takeover affects Bethesda's plans to create The Elder Scrolls 6, Starfield and other unfinished games as cross-platform titles. In a statement, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the two firms ""shared similar visions for the opportunities for creators and their games to reach more players in more ways"". Pete Hynes, senior vice president at Bethesda Softworks, said the deal offered ""access to resources that will make us a better publisher and developer"". ""We're still working on the same games we were yesterday, made by the same studios we've worked with for years, and those games will be published by us,""he wrote in a blog,external. In addition to the games titles, Microsoft will now also own the id Tech games engine, developed by Bethesda's sister firm id Software. Doom Eternal, which was released this year and received praise for the quality of its graphics, was built using the most recent version of id Tech. Piers Harding-Rolls, research director from Ampere Analysis, described the deal as ""a major coup"". ""Microsoft has often been criticised for its lack of heavy-hitting first-party games franchises when compared to Sony and Nintendo. This deal catapults Microsoft's games portfolio into a much stronger position,"" he told the BBC. Legendary games developer John Carmack - who pioneered some of the technologies behind the original Doom, Wolfenstein and Quake games - has also suggested the acquisition could bring him back to some of those franchises. Until recently, he had served as the chief technology officer of Facebook's Oculus virtual reality division. His return would build further excitement for future Xbox games, and thus benefit the brand.

May to vote against government's Brexit bill,"Former Prime Minister Theresa May has said she ""cannot support"" the government's plan to override parts of its Brexit agreement with the EU. She told MPs the move, which breaks international law, would damage ""trust in the United Kingdom"". The Internal Market Bill will be voted on in the Commons on Tuesday, having passed its first hurdle last week. Ministers say it contains vital safeguards to protect Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union on 1 January. But it gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of the UK's exit from the EU earlier this year. PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons PM in compromise with Tory critics over Brexit bill What is the row over 'internal markets' all about? Ministers say this is a failsafe mechanism in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The section -know as the protocol- is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, As well as Mrs May, the other four living former prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron - have spoken out against the bill. Labour is opposing it and some Conservative MPs have raised concerns over its legal implications. Amid all this, Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week agreed to amend the bill so that the Commons would get a vote before he could use the powers involved in breaking international law. But Mrs May, whose own withdrawal agreement with the EU was repeatedly rejected by the Commons when she was prime minister, told MPs: ""Frankly, my view is to the outside world it makes no difference as to whether a decision to break international law is taken by a minister or by this Parliament - it is still a decision to break international law. ""This can only weaken the UK in the eyes of the world."" She added that, if the Internal Market Bill were passed, ""our reputation as a country that sticks by its word will have been tarnished"". The Conservative MP for Maidenhead added that governments around the world had ""trust in the United Kingdom"", asking: ""Where will that trust be in future if they see a United Kingdom willing to break its word and break international law?"" Mrs May also said there would be ""untold damage to the United Kingdom's reputation"". Northern Ireland Minister Robin Walker said the government still hoped to reach a trade agreement with the EU. He added: ""Through this bill, we are acting to uphold those priorities and deliver commitments we made in our election manifesto that we will provide unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market."" Mr Walker also said there were ""harmful legal defaults in some interpretations"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""The consequences of this for Northern Ireland in that scenario would be very damaging,"" he told MPs. ""We cannot and will not run that risk."" For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Paul Blomfield said giving MPs the power to decide whether to use measures in the bill the Commons did not ""resolve the issue"", which was ""the breach of international law"". SNP Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald called the legislation ""a grubby power-grab which we cannot and will not support"" and that sections of it hung ""like a badge of dishonour around this prime minister's term of office"".

Theatre to stage real legal dramas in court deal,"The Lowry's Quays Theatre will stage real-life legal dramas Two theatres in The Lowry arts centre in Salford are being converted into makeshift courtrooms to help clear the current backlog of cases. It's one of the latest venues to be taken over as a so-calledNightingale Courtby the Ministry of Justice. The arts venue will host trials in three temporary courtrooms during the daytimes from Monday to Fridays. In the evenings and weekends, the venue will stage shows and open its galleries again using funds from the court deal. The Lowry saw about 95% of its income disappear overnight when it shut in March, and has now lost Â£16m income, chief executive Julia Fawcett told BBC News. The Lowry will be a courthouse during weekdays, and an arts centre in the evenings and weekends The real-life courtroom drama will subsidise socially-distanced performances, which wouldn't be otherwise financially viable, she said. Two shows - Six, the musical about Henry VIII's wives, and The Gruffalo - will be on the main stage at evenings over Christmas. During the day, trials will take place in the building's two smaller auditoria, the Quays and the Studio, as well as a conference suite. ""We won't be having everyone sitting in the stalls and the judge being up on stage, it won't be like that,"" Fawcett said. The building also houses art galleries dedicated to LS Lowry. ""Being able to enter into this partnership with the courts is absolutely key to us being able to begin the engagement with our audiences, to be able to put work back on the stages, to open up our galleries,"" Fawcett said. ""That would not be possible without this partnership at this point in time."" Lloyd Webber says arts are at 'point of no return' Weeds, leaks, and four-year waits for justice Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say 10 Nightingale courts in England and Wales to open From 28 September, The Lowry's temporary courts will host non-custodial criminal cases plus civil, family and tribunal hearings. Pre-lockdown, the crown court backlog in England and Wales stood at some 37,000. It is now over 46,000. The venue approached the Ministry of Justice several months ago after realising full audiences would not be able to return for some time, meaning ""we had to consider very seriously the financial sustainability of our organisation"", Fawcett said. ""Although it sounds unlikely at first pass, it seemed to us that the courts have a need for capacity because of social distancing, we have a desire to get our buildings and programmes open, and taking the two challenges together allows us to begin to see the building reopened."" The first 10 Nightingale Courts were announced in July. The Lowry is one of a further eight revealed on Monday. The others are: York, Hilton Hotel - opening 28 September Middlesbrough, Jury's Inn - 28 September Chester, venue TBC - October Liverpool, venue TBC - October Winchester, venue TBC - October Cirencester, venue TBC - October Bristol, venue TBC - October Meanwhile, The Lowry is planning its own job retention scheme after furlough ends at the end of October, under which staff will have the option to stay on in a reduced capacity, working only 20% of their contracts on 20% of their pre-pandemic pay. That will avoid mass redundancies, Fawcett said.

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK virus alert level âshould be raised to level 4âThe recommendation from chief medical officers means transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"".UK","The UK's coronavirus alert level is being upgraded from 3 to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"", its chief medical officers have said. It comes after the government's scientific adviser warnedthere could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a dayby mid-October without further action. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899. The prime minister will make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it sounded ""very likely"" that pubs and other venues in England will be forced to have 22:00 closing times, alongside other measures. How does the Covid-19 alert level system work? Is it time we learned to live with the virus? How many cases are there in my area? In a statement confirming their recommendation on moving to level 4, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said cases were now ""rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations"". They urged people to follow government guidelines ""to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS"" over the autumn and winter. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move reflected ""the significant shift in the current threat posed by coronavirus"". ""This country now faces a tipping point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop the spread of the virus and protect lives,"" he said. The alert level, which is recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, was reduced from level 4 to 3 on 19 June - which indicated the virus was ""in general circulation"" but there could be a ""gradual relaxation of restrictions"". The proposed upgrading comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday morning - which will be attended by the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amid data showing London was ""catching up"" with Covid-19 hotspots in northern England, the capital's Mayor Sadiq Khan said he believed acting early, ""rather than having to impose more stringent measures later"", was the right thing to do both for public health and the economy. Speaking at Downing Street earlier, alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick Vallance said: ""At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. ""If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. ""Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day. ""The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. ""That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down."" The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society.

It comes after the government's scientific adviser warnedthere could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a dayby mid-October without further action. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899. The prime minister will make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it sounded ""very likely"" that pubs and other venues in England will be forced to have 22:00 closing times, alongside other measures. How does the Covid-19 alert level system work? Is it time we learned to live with the virus? How many cases are there in my area? In a statement confirming their recommendation on moving to level 4, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said cases were now ""rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations"". They urged people to follow government guidelines ""to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS"" over the autumn and winter. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move reflected ""the significant shift in the current threat posed by coronavirus"". ""This country now faces a tipping point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop the spread of the virus and protect lives,"" he said. The alert level, which is recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, was reduced from level 4 to 3 on 19 June - which indicated the virus was ""in general circulation"" but there could be a ""gradual relaxation of restrictions"". The proposed upgrading comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday morning - which will be attended by the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amid data showing London was ""catching up"" with Covid-19 hotspots in northern England, the capital's Mayor Sadiq Khan said he believed acting early, ""rather than having to impose more stringent measures later"", was the right thing to do both for public health and the economy. Speaking at Downing Street earlier, alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick Vallance said: ""At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. ""If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. ""Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day. ""The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. ""That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down."" The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society.

"Scotland faces tighter restrictions 'within days'Additional measures will ""almost certainly"" be announced in the next 48 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says.Scotland","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM says tighter restrictions expected 'within days' Additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Speaking at her daily briefing, the first minister said ""fast and urgent action"" was needed to tackle the growth of the virus. Ms Sturgeon indicated that a package of new restrictions would be announced within the next 48 hours. A total of 255 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. That represented 6.3% of those tested, the third day running the ""positivity rate"" has exceeded 5% - which the World Health Organization has said is a key benchmark for a virus to be considered under control. Covid in Scotland - Latest updates Coronavirus in Scotland: Four numbers to watch Covid curbs of six months 'more realistic position' While no new deaths were reported, the number of people treated in hospital rose to 73, an increase of 10. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I need to be absolutely straight with people across Scotland, that additional restrictions will almost certainly be put in place in Scotland over the next couple of days. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that."" She said a meeting of the UK government's Cobra emergency committee would take place, and that she would be speaking to Prime Minister Boris Johnson directly after the briefing. Ms Sturgeon added: ""In that call, I will impress upon the prime minister my view that we need decisive, urgent and, as far as possible given our individual responsibilities, co-ordinated action across the UK. ""I will be clear that I am willing to allow a bit more time for four-nations discussions to take place before making final decisions for Scotland, but I will be equally clear that the urgency of this situation will mean that we cannot, must not and will not wait too long."" Later on Monday the UK's chief medical officers said the coronavirus alert level should move to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus was ""high or rising exponentially"". Downing Street confirmed Boris Johnson had spoken on the phone to the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and that they would be taking part in a Cobra meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning. A spokesperson said: ""They all agreed to act with a united approach, as much as possible, in the days and weeks ahead."" Ms Sturgeon tweeted that she would make a statement to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. It is indeed a critical time in the trajectory of this virus.  Cases are going up at a time when we are heading towards winter and the NHS will also have to deal with seasonal flu. The first minister says ""difficult decisions"" are to be made in this trade-off. We are being told to prepare for further restrictions on daily life. The government says keeping schools open and protecting the NHS are priorities, so what else will have to give? One of the government's own advisers has said travel restrictions and pub curfews could feature. We are in uncharted waters and no-one can predict what the winter will bring. What is clear is that we are all going to have to find ways to live with this virus for much longer than the next six months. Ms Sturgeon gave no detail of what new restrictions would be introduced, but said the government was ""very close to a point of decision"". ""At the heart of this decision is a simple truth - the longer we wait to introduce new measures, the longer these measures are likely to be in place,"" she said. ""If we move sharply now to get the virus back under control we can minimise the time we all spend under any new restrictions."" Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the likely options could include travel restrictions and curfews or restrictions on hospitality. This video can not be played Prof Linda Bauld: Hospitality curfews and travel curbs 'likely options' Ms Sturgeon added that there would be financial support for people required to self-isolate, particularly those on low incomes. While larger fines for non-compliance were under consideration, she said a better approach was to ""remove barriers"" to self-isolation. She said: ""Nobody should be forced to choose between self-isolating for the collective good and paying their rent and feeding their families. ""If that is the choice people face, then it shouldn't be a surprise to us that compliance levels will be lower than we need them to be."" The first minister added that the ""collective action"" of the summer months had not been in vain, and without it the number of deaths would have been ""significantly higher"". ""We are in a much stronger position now than we would have been without that - but none of it was a magic wand that made the virus go away,"" she said. ""So as we face winter, as we face an acceleration of cases again, we must act to keep that under control."" The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance earlier warned that without further restrictionsthere could be 50,000 new coronavirus a day by mid-October.This could lead to about 200 deaths a day UK-wide by the middle of November. Scotland's interim chief medical officer, Gregor Smith, said cases in Scotland were roughly doubling every seven to nine days. Asked about suggestions that new restrictions might last for six months, Mr Sturgeon said this was ""the length of time we all likely to be living with some restrictions, but it is not necessarily going to be the same restrictions, of the same severity, for that period"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people needed to heed the ""stark warnings"" about the virus. ""It is right that our governments work together to tackle this, because this is an issue that we need to get on top of,"" he said. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"UK could face 50,000 cases a day by mid-October without action""Speed"" and ""action"" are required to halt the rise in cases, the UK's chief scientific adviser warns.UK","This video can not be played Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance says measures must be taken to stop the spread of Covid-19 The UK could see 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action, the government's chief scientific adviser has warned. Sir Patrick Vallance said that would be expected to lead to about ""200-plus deaths per day"" a month after that. It comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency committee meeting on Tuesday morning, then make a statement in the House of Commons. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899. A further 11 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test, although these figures tend to be lower over the weekend and on Mondays due to reporting delays. Speaking at Downing Street alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick stressed the figures given were not a prediction, but added: ""At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. ""If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. ""Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day. ""The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. ""That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down."" What are the rules for meeting my friends? Scotland faces tighter restrictions 'within days' Four more counties in Wales face local lockdown Is it time we learnt to live with the virus? Prof Whitty added that if cases continued to double every seven days as Sir Patrick had set out, then the UK could ""quickly move from really quite small numbers to really very large numbers because of that exponential process"". ""So we have, in a bad sense, literally turned a corner, although only relatively recently,"" he said. Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said: The rising case numbers can not be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an ""increase in positivity of the tests done"" Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study) Less than 8% of the population has been infected, although the figure could be as high as 17% in London The rising transmission is a serious ""six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively"" - but science will eventually ""ride to our rescue"" The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contrary It is possible ""that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups"" but ""the first half of next year"" is much more likely The government's most senior science and medical advisers are clearly concerned about the rise in cases that have been seen in recent weeks. The warning about 50,000 cases a day by mid-October is stark. We don't know for sure how many cases there were at the peak in spring (as there was very limited testing in place) although some estimates put it at 100,000. However, they were also at pains to point out it was not a prediction - for one thing the 'rule of six' which came in just a week ago has not had time to have an impact. Even among the government's own advisers there is disagreement over whether what we are seeing is the start of an exponential rise or just a gradual increase in cases, which is what you would expect at this time of year as respiratory viruses tend to circulate more with the reopening of society. Spain and France, which both started seeing rises earlier than the UK, have not seen the sort of rapid trajectory that was presented by the advisers. Instead, what was quite telling was the clear social messaging. Even those who are not at a high risk of complications should, they say, play their part in curbing the spread of the virus - because if it spreads then difficult decisions will be needed that have profound societal consequences. But the big unanswered question is what ministers will do next. There is talk of further restrictions being introduced. A couple of things are in our favour that were not in the spring. Better treatments for those who get very sick are now available, while the government is in a stronger position to protect the vulnerable groups. Should ministers wait and see what happens? Or should they crack down early, knowing that will have a negative impact in other ways? Prof Whitty also said that even though different parts of the UK were seeing cases rising at different rates, and even though some age groups were affected more than others, the evolving situation was ""all of our problem"". He added that evidence from other countries showed infections were ""not staying just in the younger age groups"" but were ""moving up the age bands"". He said mortality rates from Covid-19 were ""significantly greater"" than seasonal flu, which killed around 7,000 annually or 20,000 in a bad year. Meanwhile, restrictions on households mixing indoorswill be extended to all of Northern Ireland from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. Areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will also face further local restrictions from Tuesday. And additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that,"" she said. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: ""It may be the case that UK-wide measures will be taken but that will require all four governments to exercise our varying share of power and responsibility to do so."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with leaders of the devolved administrations on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancockannounced a new exemption to local restrictions in England for formal and informal childcare arrangements, covering those looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults. ""It does not allow for play-dates or parties, but it does mean that a consistent childcare relationship that is vital for somebody to get to work is allowed,"" he told the Commons. It is not a question of ""if"". Downing Street will have to introduce extra restrictions to try to slow down the dramatic resurgence of coronavirus. You would only have to have dipped into a minute or two of the sober briefing from the government's most senior doctor and scientist on Monday morning to see why. What is not yet settled however, is exactly what, exactly when, and indeed, exactly where these restrictions will be. Here's what it is important to know: The government is not considering a new lockdown across the country right now. The prime minister is not about to tell everyone to stay at home as he did from the Downing Street desk in March. Ministers have no intention at all to close schools again. Nor, right now, are they planning to tell every business, other than the non-essential, to close again. What is likely is some kind of extra limits on our huge hospitality sector. Read more from Laura here. On Sunday, the prime minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Prof Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss possible further measures for England. Asked about reports of disagreements among cabinet ministers about whether or not to impose a second lockdown, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""A conversation, a debate, is quite proper and that is exactly what you'd expect. ""Everyone recognises there is a tension between... the virus and the measures we need to take, and the economy and ensuring people's livelihoods are protected."" Prof Peter Horby, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said there was a risk the UK could face a repeat of the ""catastrophic events"" around the world early this year, with intensive care units ""rammed full of very sick patients"". ""I really don't buy that argument that we should slow down... the mistakes that were made in March were nearly all being too cautious and too slow,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. However, Prof Karol Sikora, from the University of Buckinghamshire and former director of the World Health Organization's cancer programme, said blanket restrictions were ""not the way forward"". ""The most important thing is to target the groups that we need to protect and to let everybody else get on with their business - schools, shops and so on,"" he told the programme. Labour, meanwhile, has also urged the government to avoid a second national lockdown. ""This rapid spike in infections was not inevitable, but a consequence of the government's incompetence and failure to put in place an adequate testing system,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. ""The government must do what it takes to prevent another lockdown, which would cause unimaginable damage to our economy and people's wellbeing.""

But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said: The rising case numbers cannot be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an ""increase in positivity of the tests done"" Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study) Less than 8% of the population has been infected to date, although the figure could be as high as 17% in London Even though different parts of the UK are seeing cases rising at different rates, and some age groups are affected more than others, the evolving situation has to be seen as a problem for everyone without exception Evidence from other countries shows infections are ""not staying just in the younger age groups"" but are ""moving up the age bands"" The rising transmission is a serious ""six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively"" - but science will eventually ""ride to our rescue"" The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contrary It is possible ""that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups"" but ""the first half of next year"" is much more likely On Sunday, the prime minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Prof Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss possible further measures for England, ahead of an expected announcement on Tuesday. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said Labour did not want to see another lockdown but it would be understandable if new measures were introduced as the ""exponential growth of the virus cannot be ignored"". It is not a question of ""if"". Downing Street will have to introduce extra restrictions to try to slow down the dramatic resurgence of coronavirus. You would only have to have dipped into a minute or two of the sober briefing from the government's most senior doctor and scientist on Monday morning to see why. What is not yet settled however, is exactly what, exactly when, and indeed, exactly where these restrictions will be. Here's what it is important to know: The government is not considering a new lockdown across the country right now. The prime minister is not about to tell everyone to stay at home as he did from the Downing Street desk in March. Ministers have no intention at all to close schools again. Nor, right now, are they planning to tell every business, other than the essential, to close again. What is likely is some kind of extra limits on our huge hospitality sector. Read more from Laura here. Restrictions on households mixing indoorswill be extended to all of Northern Ireland from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. Areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will also face further local restrictions from Tuesday. And additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that,"" she said. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: ""It may be the case that UK-wide measures will be taken but that will require all four governments to exercise our varying share of power and responsibility to do so."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with leaders of the devolved administrations on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, the health secretaryannounced a new exemption to local restrictions in England for formal and informal childcare arrangements, covering those looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults.

Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows,"The government has scrapped rail franchising and announced plans to extend support for train firms. After passenger numbers fell during lockdown, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues. So far, the bill has run to more than Â£3.5bn and the Department for Transport has said ""significant"" support will still be needed. Although passenger numbers have edged up since lockdown, they are still less than half pre-pandemic levels. As a result, emergency measures to cover the losses of train firms have been extended by 18 months. They reduce the fees that can be earned by the companies but will mean that trains are still able to run, even with fewer passengers. Throughout that period ministers hope to carry out broader reforms to Britain's railways. They will consider adopting a concessions-based system in the longer term, whereby train companies are paid a fixed fee to run services. It marks the end of rail franchises, which have been in place since the 1990s. Is it safe to use public transport? What has gone wrong with rail franchising? In a statement, Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps said: ""The model of privatisation adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working."" He said the move to a new system would end ""uncertainty and confusion about whether you are using the right ticket or the right train company"". The government and the train companies are painting this as a good deal. But in reality, because of Covid, it's a fairly unsatisfactory scenario for all those concerned. The taxpayer will be liable for the losses on the railways for a much longer period of time. And with the virus spreading, passenger levels might remain suppressed - so the losses could continue for some time to come. Meanwhile, train companies who operated franchises that were losing money before the pandemic, still owe money to the Department for Transport from those contracts. Although that thorny issue has been kicked down the road and the negotiations over past payments now need to be resolved by December. Private train companies have no easy option. The emergency deals keep them in the game but they're a metaphorical straitjacket, which make them commercially un-enticing. For now, no train company has ""handed back the keys"", which would force the government to take on the running of a route. Doing so carries financial penalties and does nothing for a firm's reputation. Instead, all of them have, in the short-term, opted for the least bad option there is. And there is still no consensus within government over what the railways will look like after the pandemic so the detail on that is pretty thin. Train companies have welcomed the plans to replace Britain's often-criticised system of rail franchising. Paul Plummer, the boss of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train firms, called for a simpler-to-use fare system. He said: ""These transitional contracts should be a stepping-stone to a better railway."" But rail expert Sir Michael Holden, who used to run South West Trains, said: The big issue is, what is that something else to look like?"" He told the BBC's Today programme that the current emergency measures were ""the worst possible arrangement to run the railways"". ""We've got the dead hand of the government on the helm... controlling all of the detailed decisions of the railway."" ""And yet, they're still paying for public sector operators to run the railway for them."" Labour said the government was trying to ""paper over the cracks of a broken rail system"". Shadow rail minister Tan Dhesi said: ""Today's agreements mean taxpayers are set to continue paying hundreds of millions of pounds in profit to private rail companies to run the network. This is completely unacceptable."" But Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams, who was commissioned to carry out a review of the railways, said the companies would have to give more value under the new agreements, which represented the end of the ""complicated"" franchising arrangement. He said they demanded ""more from the expertise and skills of the private sector"" and ""ensure passengers return to a more punctual and co-ordinated railway"". However, Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash claimed ""private rail companies are a waste of time and a waste of money"". He insisted that ""public ownership is the only model that works"". And Unite's national officer for rail Harish Patel said: ""Instead of the proposed new model which will allow privateers a renewed opportunity to feed off the taxpayer and passengers, the government should be permanently re-nationalising rail services to increase services, improve punctuality and reduce tickets prices.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK virus alert level âshould move to level 4âUK coronavirus alert level should move to level 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"", chief medical officers sayUKScotland faces tighter restrictions 'within days'Additional measures will ""almost certainly"" be announced in the next 48 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says.Scotland","The UK's coronavirus alert level is being upgraded from 3 to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"", its chief medical officers have said. It comes after the government's scientific adviser warnedthere could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a dayby mid-October without further action. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899. The prime minister will make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it sounded ""very likely"" that pubs and other venues in England will be forced to have 22:00 closing times, alongside other measures. How does the Covid-19 alert level system work? Is it time we learned to live with the virus? How many cases are there in my area? In a statement confirming their recommendation on moving to level 4, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said cases were now ""rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations"". They urged people to follow government guidelines ""to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS"" over the autumn and winter. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move reflected ""the significant shift in the current threat posed by coronavirus"". ""This country now faces a tipping point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop the spread of the virus and protect lives,"" he said. The alert level, which is recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, was reduced from level 4 to 3 on 19 June - which indicated the virus was ""in general circulation"" but there could be a ""gradual relaxation of restrictions"". The proposed upgrading comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday morning - which will be attended by the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amid data showing London was ""catching up"" with Covid-19 hotspots in northern England, the capital's Mayor Sadiq Khan said he believed acting early, ""rather than having to impose more stringent measures later"", was the right thing to do both for public health and the economy. Speaking at Downing Street earlier, alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick Vallance said: ""At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. ""If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. ""Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day. ""The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. ""That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down."" The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward.

"Lockdown fears hit travel, hotel and pub shares","Travel firms, pubs and airlines were among the worst hit Fears that a renewed rise in coronavirus cases will blight economic prospects have wiped more than Â£50bn off UK shares, and caused similar falls across European and US stock markets. London's FTSE 100 share index closed down 3.4%, with airlines, travel firms, hotel groups and pubs leading the rout. Worst hit was British Airways owner IAG, down 12%. Markets in Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid also dived, while the US Dow Jones index lost 1.8% after paring losses. It comes amid fears that major economies could see second lockdowns as they struggle to regain control of the virus. Banking shares were affected by an extra set of concerns asallegations of money-laundering surfaced in leaked secret files. HSBC, the bank at the centre of the scandal, saw its share price fall 5.3% in London, but the revelations dragged down the entire sector, with other big banks dropping by a similar amount. On Wall Street, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon saw their share prices fall 3% and 4% respectively in response to the reports. The downward trend affected all but a handful of stocks on the UK's 100-share index. Only online delivery service Just Eat and supermarkets Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's made it into positive territory. The FTSE 250 index, seen as a better reflection of the health of the UK economy, closed nearly 4% lower. One of its biggest fallers was pub and restaurant owner Mitchells & Butlers, which dropped more than 15% as concerns grow that the hospitality industry would have most to lose from a fresh lockdown. The pound also lost ground against the dollar, falling 1% to $1.2790. It fell 0.4% against the euro to â¬1.0897. Many people are more affected by stock market falls than they might think. There are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow and a proportion will be in shares. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for these investments, although pension investors stress these are long-term investments and are designed to ride out bouts of weakness. Why should I care if share prices fall? There has certainly been an element of European unity on the markets today, with the FTSE 100 index in London, the Cac 40 in Paris, the Dax in Frankfurt and the Ibex in Madrid all suffering similar falls. The reason behind the gloom seems pretty clear. With the number of Covid-19 cases multiplying rapidly here and in many European countries, there's a real prospect of new restrictions on daily life. In some regions - such as Madrid, for example - they're already in place. The fear is that although these measures are unlikely to be as severe as the lockdowns in spring, they will nonetheless weigh on economic activity and could stifle the post-lockdown recovery. Shares are down across the board, but inevitably, the companies which rely on people being able to get out and about and mingle are among the worst affected. Airlines, tourism firms and hospitality businesses have already had a dreadful year - and investors know they can ill afford further setbacks. Coronavirus cases have been surging in many European countries, as governments strive to avoid another round of national lockdowns. In the UK, top scientists are warning thatthe country is at a ""critical point"" in the pandemicand ""heading in the wrong direction"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson is understood to be considering a two-week mini-lockdown in England - being referred to as a ""circuit-breaker"" - in an effort to stem widespread growth of the virus. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ''The FTSE 100 is worst hit among its European peers with a storm of pessimistic news swirling, affecting sectors across the board."" She added that concerns for the travel industry had had a ""domino effect"", with aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls Royce hit, as investors saw no end to the falling demand for new planes. At the same time, the prospect of evening coronavirus curfews, after a summer of recovering sales, was ""a bitter pill to swallow"" for the hospitality industry, If you add the prospect of a no-deal Brexit into the murky mix, there is little surprise so many investors seem to have caught a severe case of the jitters today.''

"Local lockdowns in four more counties in WalesNewport, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent face new restrictions from 18:00 BST on Tuesday.","This video can not be played ""Everyone will be affected financially"" Four more counties in south Wales will go into lockdown from 18:00 BST on Tuesday, meaning more than a quarter of the Welsh population will be under tighter restrictions. Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent and Newport follow Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly county into lockdown. People will not be able to enter or leave those areas except for a limited number of exemptions, such as work. Licensed premises such as pubs and bars will need to shut by 23:00 every night. People will only be able to mix with those not in their own household outdoors - meeting people from extended households indoors will be banned in the four areas. The pub rule will also be extended to Caerphilly county borough. Vaughan Gething, Welsh Government health minister, said there had been a ""worrying and rapid rise in cases in four other south Wales council areas - Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport"". ""It's always a difficult decision to introduce restrictions but coronavirus has not gone away - it is still circulating in communities across Wales and, as we are seeing in parts of south Wales, small clusters can quickly cause real issues in local communities."" It comes as the UK's four chief medical officers agreed to upgrade the coronavirus alert level from three to four,meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". What can I do during local lockdowns? Live: Welsh Government coronavirus update The new measures affect 431,000 people, meaning that just over 850,000 people in Wales will be under local lockdown from Tuesday. The rules mean you cannot visit or leave the six counties affected without a ""reasonable excuse"". That includes: For work, if you cannot work from home For education For buying essentials like food or medicine To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm To visit family or close friends on compassionate grounds Motorists can continue to travel through the areas on the M4 and other roads. People can continue to meet outdoors in groups of up to 30 people, but cannot meet other households indoors at home or in pubs or restaurants. Rebecca James says the pub curfew will not have much of an impact during the week Customers at the The Pen and Wig pub in Newport on Monday were not convinced a pub curfew would help to control the virus. Richard Wooding said the earlier closing time could encourage people to have house parties: ""If the bars shut earlier, then people just come out earlier. ""I came out last Saturday, I was appalled at the number of people out. The bar staff can't police it. But I don't think you can stop it. People are just going to party in their own houses."" Another customer, Rebecca James, said: ""I don't think there's much of a nightlife here anyway. On the weekends it will affect people, going home early, but during the week everything closes around 11 anyway."" But Justin Cliffe, who runs events for Le Pub, was concerned: ""For us as a pub, to close at 11, it's not good. This venue runs until 1am so it's a nightlife spot rather than [somewhere for a] pub lunch. ""So the options that we're discussing are whether the pub closes completely or whether we just revert to doing take out or food for delivery. We're going over the options, but it doesn't look good."" Newport bar owner Jack Bannister fears some customers will stay away Jack Bannister, who owns Newport bar Breeze, said he was hoping people would make up for the curfew by starting their night earlier, but feared some may stay away altogether. He said: ""Inevitably, I think it will be quieter. In a lot of people's eyes, there will be no point in going out. And with this rule of one household - well that's going to be impossible."" The bar had to shut earlier this month after a customer tested positive for Covid-19. ""We were doing really well before that happened,"" he said. ""We did the responsible thing we felt, by informing our Facebook page"". ""But there's always going to that stigma - that Breeze had a case, do I want to go there and catch it? Even though it's not our fault."" Newport Live, which runs Newport council's leisure facilities, said it will turn away people who are not from the city with the exceptions for elite athletes and people with specific health or mobility issues. On Monday, Public Health Wales (PHW) said there had beena further 234 cases of people with coronavirus, but no new deaths. Of these, 40 were in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 20 in Blaenau Gwent, 15 in Caerphilly, 14 in Bridgend, 12 in Merthyr and 11 in Newport. In the past seven days, the number of people with the virus per 100,000 of the population was 102.8 in Merthyr, 83.3 in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 60.1 in Blaenau Gwent, 53 in Caerphilly and Bridgend and 45.3 in Newport. The threshold for the UK government to considertriggering quarantine conditionsfor people returning from countries outside of the UK is 20. PHW figures showed in the week from 16-22 March, whennational lockdown was announced, there were 393 cases in Wales, with a case rate of 12.5 per 100,00 people. Last week, 14-20 September, there were 921 cases and a case rate of 29.2 per 100,000 people. On Monday, speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said the rising case numbers could not be blamed on an increase in testing as there was also an""increase in positivity of the tests done"". At a press conference Mr Gething said he would hold ""an urgent meeting"" on Tuesday with councils, health boards and police forces from Bridgend to the English border. It will discuss the wider regional situation and whether further measures are needed. Earlier, senior UK government advisers warned of a ""six-month problem"" ofrising cases. Mr Gething said he could not ""definitively"" give a timescale of how long lockdown measures would be needed. He said ""all-Wales"" measures may be needed to tackle the virus. But Mr Gething said such action may be short of the full lockdown imposed on 23 March. Newport is seeing a ""wide spread of cases"", Mr Gething said A call between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford took place on Monday afternoon. A Welsh Government spokesman said the pair ""agreed on the need to work on a four-nation basis to discuss UK-wide measures where these were necessary"". Mr Drakeford is due to take part in a Cobra meeting on coronavirus with UK and devolved government ministers on Tuesday. Downing Street, which also held calls with senior ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland, said the prime minister was taking the rising infection rate ""very seriously"". ""He reiterated his unwavering commitment to working with the devolved administrations as we continue to tackle the virus,"" a spokesman said. ""They all agreed to act with a united approach, as much as possible, in the days and weeks ahead tomorrow to discuss next steps for the country."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies called for ""smart, hyper-local lockdowns"". ""Ministers and governments must do everything possible to avoid another blanket national lockdown as the other public health and economic impacts would be disastrous,"" he said. His Plaid Cymru counterpart Helen Mary Jones called for furlough to be extended to support local lockdowns. ""If Westminster won't extend furlough scheme to support local lockdowns, then the Welsh Government needs to look at what support they might be able to provide,"" she said. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK government would be introducing a new isolation support payment for people on low incomes in England who could not work because they had tested positive or were asked to self-isolate. He said funding would be provided to the devolved administrations so similar support could be offered to people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Gething said once the Welsh Government had seen the detail of the funding, it would decide how to spend the money. What can I do during local lockdowns?

Microsoft buys Fallout creator Bethesda for $7.5bnXbox's owner confirms it has bought the game developer ahead of the launch of the new Xbox console.,"Xbox-owner Microsoft has acquired the games company behind blockbuster titles including Doom, Fallout, Skyrim and Wolfenstein. It is paying $7.5bn (Â£5.85bn) for Bethesda's parent ZeniMax Media. Xbox has said that the publisher's franchises would be added to its Game Pass subscription package for consoles and PCs. This could help make the forthcoming Xbox Series X more attractive than the PlayStation 5 to some players. Both machines are due to launch in November. Game Pass already gives players access to more than 200 games. Microsoft includes first-party titles at point of launch to those signed up to its ""ultimate"" package without further cost. By contrast, Sony has opted to charge players up to Â£70 for its own major releases and does not intend to include new titles in its PlayStation Plus Collection service. It is not yet clear how the takeover affects Bethesda's plans to create The Elder Scrolls 6, Starfield and other unfinished games as cross-platform titles. In a statement, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the two firms ""shared similar visions for the opportunities for creators and their games to reach more players in more ways"". Pete Hynes, senior vice president at Bethesda Softworks, said the deal offered ""access to resources that will make us a better publisher and developer"". ""We're still working on the same games we were yesterday, made by the same studios we've worked with for years, and those games will be published by us,""he wrote in a blog,external. In addition to the games titles, Microsoft will now also own the id Tech games engine, developed by Bethesda's sister firm id Software. Doom Eternal, which was released this year and received praise for the quality of its graphics, was built using the most recent version of id Tech. Piers Harding-Rolls, research director from Ampere Analysis, described the deal as ""a major coup"". ""Microsoft has often been criticised for its lack of heavy-hitting first-party games franchises when compared to Sony and Nintendo. This deal catapults Microsoft's games portfolio into a much stronger position,"" he told the BBC. Legendary games developer John Carmack - who pioneered some of the technologies behind the original Doom, Wolfenstein and Quake games - has also suggested the acquisition could bring him back to some of those franchises. Until recently, he had served as the chief technology officer of Facebook's Oculus virtual reality division. His return would build further excitement for future Xbox games, and thus benefit the brand.

Theatre to stage trials to help court backlog,"The Lowry's Quays Theatre will stage real-life legal dramas Two theatres in The Lowry arts centre in Salford are being converted into makeshift courtrooms to help clear the current backlog of cases. It's one of the latest venues to be taken over as a so-calledNightingale Courtby the Ministry of Justice. The arts venue will host trials in three temporary courtrooms during the daytimes from Monday to Fridays. In the evenings and weekends, the venue will stage shows and open its galleries again using funds from the court deal. The Lowry saw about 95% of its income disappear overnight when it shut in March, and has now lost Â£16m income, chief executive Julia Fawcett told BBC News. The Lowry will be a courthouse during weekdays, and an arts centre in the evenings and weekends The real-life courtroom drama will subsidise socially-distanced performances, which wouldn't be otherwise financially viable, she said. Two shows - Six, the musical about Henry VIII's wives, and The Gruffalo - will be on the main stage at evenings over Christmas. During the day, trials will take place in the building's two smaller auditoria, the Quays and the Studio, as well as a conference suite. ""We won't be having everyone sitting in the stalls and the judge being up on stage, it won't be like that,"" Fawcett said. The building also houses art galleries dedicated to LS Lowry. ""Being able to enter into this partnership with the courts is absolutely key to us being able to begin the engagement with our audiences, to be able to put work back on the stages, to open up our galleries,"" Fawcett said. ""That would not be possible without this partnership at this point in time."" Lloyd Webber says arts are at 'point of no return' Weeds, leaks, and four-year waits for justice Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say 10 Nightingale courts in England and Wales to open From 28 September, The Lowry's temporary courts will host non-custodial criminal cases plus civil, family and tribunal hearings. Pre-lockdown, the crown court backlog in England and Wales stood at some 37,000. It is now over 46,000. The venue approached the Ministry of Justice several months ago after realising full audiences would not be able to return for some time, meaning ""we had to consider very seriously the financial sustainability of our organisation"", Fawcett said. ""Although it sounds unlikely at first pass, it seemed to us that the courts have a need for capacity because of social distancing, we have a desire to get our buildings and programmes open, and taking the two challenges together allows us to begin to see the building reopened."" The first 10 Nightingale Courts were announced in July. The Lowry is one of a further eight revealed on Monday. The others are: York, Hilton Hotel - opening 28 September Middlesbrough, Jury's Inn - 28 September Chester, venue TBC - October Liverpool, venue TBC - October Winchester, venue TBC - October Cirencester, venue TBC - October Bristol, venue TBC - October Meanwhile, The Lowry is planning its own job retention scheme after furlough ends at the end of October, under which staff will have the option to stay on in a reduced capacity, working only 20% of their contracts on 20% of their pre-pandemic pay. That will avoid mass redundancies, Fawcett said.

"Scotland faces tighter restrictions 'within days'Additional lockdown rules will ""almost certainly"" be announced in the next 48 hours, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says.Scotland","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM says tighter restrictions expected 'within days' Additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Speaking at her daily briefing, the first minister said ""fast and urgent action"" was needed to tackle the growth of the virus. Ms Sturgeon indicated that a package of new restrictions would be announced within the next 48 hours. A total of 255 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. That represented 6.3% of those tested, the third day running the ""positivity rate"" has exceeded 5% - which the World Health Organization has said is a key benchmark for a virus to be considered under control. Covid in Scotland - Latest updates Coronavirus in Scotland: Four numbers to watch Covid curbs of six months 'more realistic position' While no new deaths were reported, the number of people treated in hospital rose to 73, an increase of 10. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I need to be absolutely straight with people across Scotland, that additional restrictions will almost certainly be put in place in Scotland over the next couple of days. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that."" She said a meeting of the UK government's Cobra emergency committee would take place, and that she would be speaking to Prime Minister Boris Johnson directly after the briefing. Ms Sturgeon added: ""In that call, I will impress upon the prime minister my view that we need decisive, urgent and, as far as possible given our individual responsibilities, co-ordinated action across the UK. ""I will be clear that I am willing to allow a bit more time for four-nations discussions to take place before making final decisions for Scotland, but I will be equally clear that the urgency of this situation will mean that we cannot, must not and will not wait too long."" Later on Monday the UK's chief medical officers said the coronavirus alert level should move to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus was ""high or rising exponentially"". Downing Street confirmed Boris Johnson had spoken on the phone to the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and that they would be taking part in a Cobra meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning. A spokesperson said: ""They all agreed to act with a united approach, as much as possible, in the days and weeks ahead."" Ms Sturgeon tweeted that she would make a statement to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. It is indeed a critical time in the trajectory of this virus.  Cases are going up at a time when we are heading towards winter and the NHS will also have to deal with seasonal flu. The first minister says ""difficult decisions"" are to be made in this trade-off. We are being told to prepare for further restrictions on daily life. The government says keeping schools open and protecting the NHS are priorities, so what else will have to give? One of the government's own advisers has said travel restrictions and pub curfews could feature. We are in uncharted waters and no-one can predict what the winter will bring. What is clear is that we are all going to have to find ways to live with this virus for much longer than the next six months. Ms Sturgeon gave no detail of what new restrictions would be introduced, but said the government was ""very close to a point of decision"". ""At the heart of this decision is a simple truth - the longer we wait to introduce new measures, the longer these measures are likely to be in place,"" she said. ""If we move sharply now to get the virus back under control we can minimise the time we all spend under any new restrictions."" Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the likely options could include travel restrictions and curfews or restrictions on hospitality. This video can not be played Prof Linda Bauld: Hospitality curfews and travel curbs 'likely options' Ms Sturgeon added that there would be financial support for people required to self-isolate, particularly those on low incomes. While larger fines for non-compliance were under consideration, she said a better approach was to ""remove barriers"" to self-isolation. She said: ""Nobody should be forced to choose between self-isolating for the collective good and paying their rent and feeding their families. ""If that is the choice people face, then it shouldn't be a surprise to us that compliance levels will be lower than we need them to be."" The first minister added that the ""collective action"" of the summer months had not been in vain, and without it the number of deaths would have been ""significantly higher"". ""We are in a much stronger position now than we would have been without that - but none of it was a magic wand that made the virus go away,"" she said. ""So as we face winter, as we face an acceleration of cases again, we must act to keep that under control."" The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance earlier warned that without further restrictionsthere could be 50,000 new coronavirus a day by mid-October.This could lead to about 200 deaths a day UK-wide by the middle of November. Scotland's interim chief medical officer, Gregor Smith, said cases in Scotland were roughly doubling every seven to nine days. Asked about suggestions that new restrictions might last for six months, Mr Sturgeon said this was ""the length of time we all likely to be living with some restrictions, but it is not necessarily going to be the same restrictions, of the same severity, for that period"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people needed to heed the ""stark warnings"" about the virus. ""It is right that our governments work together to tackle this, because this is an issue that we need to get on top of,"" he said. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

Schitt's Creek and Succession sweep Emmy Awards,"This video can not be played Schitt's Creek wins first of six awards at the Emmys Schitt's Creek, Succession and Watchmen were the big winners at this year's Emmy Awards, which were held virtually amid the coronavirus pandemic. Schitt's Creek won nine prizes - breaking the Emmys record for most wins in a single season for a comedy. It was a glowing send-off for the Canadian series, which broadcast its sixth and final season this year. Succession took home the night's top prize, best drama series, as well as best actor for Jeremy Strong. The HBO series also won prizes in the drama categories for best writing and best directing during the virtual ceremony. ""This is such a very nice moment,"" said the show's British creator Jesse Armstrong from London. ""But it's sad not to be with the cast and crew to share it."" Armstrong listed a number of ""un-thank yous"" during his acceptance speech, criticising President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson for their respective responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Eugene Levy received his best comedy actor award from a presenter in a hazmat suit Another HBO series, Watchmen, won best limited series, as well as acting gongs for its stars Regina King and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Zendaya, 24, became the youngest ever winner of best drama actress for her performance in Euphoria, a teen drama which follows a group high school students as they grapple with issues of love, sex, drugs and identity. It was a significantly lower-key event this year, with most winners dialling in to make their acceptance speeches from home. Jimmy Kimmel hosted the show, with the nominees dialling in from home The ceremony was presented from an eerily empty Staples Center in Los Angeles by comedian Jimmy Kimmel, with only a few guest presenters joining him in the studio. Schitt's Creek won the best comedy series prize, with the show's creators, father and son Eugene and Daniel Levy, picking up best comedy actor and best supporting comedy actor respectively. Catherine O'Hara was named best comedy actress, with Annie Murphy winning best supporting actress in a comedy series. The show, which is on Netflix in the UK, follows the wealthy Rose family, who are forced to move to a motel in a small town after losing their fortune. Catherine O'Hara won best comedy actress for Schitt's Creek It launched on CBC in 2015 but developed a strong fan following around the world after later being added to Netflix. Its wins also included outstanding directing for a comedy series for Andrew Cividino and Daniel Levy, with the latter also winning outstanding writing for the finale episode Happy Ending. Schitt's Creek 'normalises LGBTQ relationships' Zendaya makes history and spreads 'hope in young people' Friends stars reunite and 6 other highlights from the 'Pandemmys' ""Our show, at its core, is about the transformational effects of love and acceptance, and that is something we need more of now than we've ever needed before,"" said Dan Levy as he accepted the prize for best comedy series. Paying tribute to his son, Eugene Levy added: ""I want to thank this young man who took our fish-out-of-water story and transformed it into a story of inclusivity, a castigation of homophobia, and a declaration of the power of love, so thank you Daniel."" Regina King wore a T-shirt with a picture of Breonna Taylor Zendaya beat stiff competition from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Laura Linney and Olivia Colman in her category. Regina King was named best actress in a limited series for her performance in Watchmen. ""This is freakin' weird!"" joked the star as the Emmy was presented to her at her home. In her acceptance speech, she paid tribute to US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died over the weekend, and encouraged viewers to register vote in the forthcoming presidential election. King wore a T-shirt bearing the image of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot and killed by police in Kentucky in March. Uzo Aduba, who won best supporting actress in a limited series for Mrs America, also wore a shirt displaying Taylor's name during her speech. King's co-star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was also named best supporting actor for his performance in the show. Watchmen, an innovative reimagining of a superhero graphic novel that tackled racism in America, scored the most nominations this year. It won a loyal following and critical acclaim last year during its nine-episode run. Elsewhere, Ozark's Julia Garner won best supporting drama actress while Billy Crudup won in the male category for his portrayal of a conniving network executive in Apple TV's The Morning Show. Succession's Jeremy Strong was named best drama actor for his portrayal of Kendall Roy Succession's creator Jesse Armstrong also won best writing for a drama, while Andrij Parekh won best directing. ""I want to dedicate this award to all the kids whose names, like mine, are difficult to pronounce,"" Parekh said in his acceptance speech. ""To those who don't look like their classmates, and are defined as outsiders... This is proof that you belong, and this Emmy is ours."" What's the secret of Succession's success? The key winners and nominees Several winners used their acceptance speeches to encourage Americans to register to vote in November's election, including Mark Ruffalo, who won best actor in a limited series for I Know This Much Is True. ""Get out and vote, and vote for love and compassion and kindness,"" the Hollywood star said. After the huge success of Fleabag in 2019, this year's ceremony was a disappointing night for British and Irish talent. Olivia Colman, Jodie Comer, Brian Cox, Jeremy Irons, Helena Bonham Carter and Paul Mescal all ended up empty handed in their respective acting categories. 11 - Watchmen 9 - Schitt's Creek 7 - Succession 7 - The Mandalorian 6 - RuPaul's Drag Race 6 - Saturday Night Live Includes Creative Arts Emmys This year marked Kimmel's third time hosting the Emmys, after he fronted the ceremony in 2012 and 2016. The in memoriam section honoured stars including Chadwick Boseman, Naya Rivera, Caroll Spinney, Kirk Douglas, Sir Ian Holm and Dame Diana Rigg. The Creative Arts Emmys took place earlier this week, with winners announced in categories such as casting, hair, make-up, lighting and sound design. More than 25,000 members of the Television Academy vote for the awards, which were first presented in 1949.

"Lockdown fears hit travel, hotel and pub sharesShares across Europe fall sharply but supermarkets and food delivery firms buck the trend.Business","Travel firms, pubs and airlines were among the worst hit Fears that a renewed rise in coronavirus cases will blight economic prospects have wiped more than Â£50bn off UK shares, and caused similar falls across European and US stock markets. London's FTSE 100 share index closed down 3.4%, with airlines, travel firms, hotel groups and pubs leading the rout. Worst hit was British Airways owner IAG, down 12%. Markets in Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid also dived, while the US Dow Jones index lost 1.8% after paring losses. It comes amid fears that major economies could see second lockdowns as they struggle to regain control of the virus. Banking shares were affected by an extra set of concerns asallegations of money-laundering surfaced in leaked secret files. HSBC, the bank at the centre of the scandal, saw its share price fall 5.3% in London, but the revelations dragged down the entire sector, with other big banks dropping by a similar amount. On Wall Street, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon saw their share prices fall 3% and 4% respectively in response to the reports. The downward trend affected all but a handful of stocks on the UK's 100-share index. Only online delivery service Just Eat and supermarkets Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's made it into positive territory. The FTSE 250 index, seen as a better reflection of the health of the UK economy, closed nearly 4% lower. One of its biggest fallers was pub and restaurant owner Mitchells & Butlers, which dropped more than 15% as concerns grow that the hospitality industry would have most to lose from a fresh lockdown. The pound also lost ground against the dollar, falling 1% to $1.2790. It fell 0.4% against the euro to â¬1.0897. Many people are more affected by stock market falls than they might think. There are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow and a proportion will be in shares. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for these investments, although pension investors stress these are long-term investments and are designed to ride out bouts of weakness. Why should I care if share prices fall? There has certainly been an element of European unity on the markets today, with the FTSE 100 index in London, the Cac 40 in Paris, the Dax in Frankfurt and the Ibex in Madrid all suffering similar falls. The reason behind the gloom seems pretty clear. With the number of Covid-19 cases multiplying rapidly here and in many European countries, there's a real prospect of new restrictions on daily life. In some regions - such as Madrid, for example - they're already in place. The fear is that although these measures are unlikely to be as severe as the lockdowns in spring, they will nonetheless weigh on economic activity and could stifle the post-lockdown recovery. Shares are down across the board, but inevitably, the companies which rely on people being able to get out and about and mingle are among the worst affected. Airlines, tourism firms and hospitality businesses have already had a dreadful year - and investors know they can ill afford further setbacks. Coronavirus cases have been surging in many European countries, as governments strive to avoid another round of national lockdowns. In the UK, top scientists are warning thatthe country is at a ""critical point"" in the pandemicand ""heading in the wrong direction"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson is understood to be considering a two-week mini-lockdown in England - being referred to as a ""circuit-breaker"" - in an effort to stem widespread growth of the virus. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ''The FTSE 100 is worst hit among its European peers with a storm of pessimistic news swirling, affecting sectors across the board."" She added that concerns for the travel industry had had a ""domino effect"", with aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls Royce hit, as investors saw no end to the falling demand for new planes. At the same time, the prospect of evening coronavirus curfews, after a summer of recovering sales, was ""a bitter pill to swallow"" for the hospitality industry, If you add the prospect of a no-deal Brexit into the murky mix, there is little surprise so many investors seem to have caught a severe case of the jitters today.''

"LiveLiveWhitty says rise in cases is ""all of our problem""2 minutes ago","UK chief medical officers say coronavirus alert level will move to level 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"" The UK could be facing 50,000 new Covid-19 cases a day by mid-October, if the current infection rate is not halted Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns that UK faces 'tipping point' on coronavirus cases UK PM Boris Johnson will address Commons on Tuesday about pandemic France changes rules around coronavirus cases in nurseries and primary schools to try to keep more open Parts of the Spanish capital Madrid are going into a tough new lockdown - more than 800,000 residents have been asked to stay at home There have been 31 million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Paul Gribben We are pausing our live coverage for now. Today's live page has been edited by Robert Greenall and Paul Gribben and written by Penny Spiller, Francesca Gillett, Ashita Nagesh and Doug Faulkner. Thank you for joining us and we will be back again on Tuesday. Here are some of the headlines from today: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for additional measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the capital as he said the testing system was a ""mess"". He told BBC London: ""We want additional measures to pre-empt further hospital admissions and deaths and to prevent a second lockdown."" He pointed to cities in the North East of England and in Birmingham as an example and said some things which had been done there could be done in London, including reducing the time bars, pubs and restaurants are open, and making sure events like weddings do not inadvertently lead to an increase in the spread of the virus. He said testing in London ""had been a mess"" with contact tracing ""collapsing"", adding that it appeared patterns of the virus being transmitted were different in the capital to other parts of the country. Mr Khan also said he hoped to be part of Tuesday's Cobra meeting but had not spoken to the prime minister since the last one on 10 May. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organisation says 156 countries, covering two-thirds of the worldâs population, have signed up to its joint facility aimed atdeveloping vaccines against coronavirus, and ensuring they are distributed fairly. The facility, known as Covax, hopes to have two billion doses of vaccine available by the end of next year but some key countries, among them the United States, have not signed up. The WHO says joining Covax makes sense: four out of five candidate vaccines fail and even the richest countries may pick the wrong ones, while joining forces to invest together in multiple possible vaccines (there are currently almost 200 in development) raises the chances of success for everyone. Sixty-four high income countries have signed up, including most of Europe, and 92 lower income countries but the US and China have not. The US says it will do bilateral deals to supply its own population. The WHOâs plan is different: the first two billion doses from Covax will be distributed globally, withpriority likely to be given to healthcare workers,  the elderly, and those with pre-existing health risks. Four St Andrews University students have contracted coronavirus after afreshers' week party. More than 40 people are now self-isolating following the gathering in a hall of residence, which broke national coronavirus restrictions. Sally Mapstone, principal of the Scottish university, said: ""The ripples from this single incident have consequences for all of us."" More generally, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing on Tuesday thatadditional lockdown restrictionswill ""almost certainly"" be put in place in coming days across the country. Madridâs famous opera house Teatro Real
was forced to cancel a performance on Sunday night after some people in the âcheap
seatsâ complained they were not socially-distanced enough. There were shouts and jeers of âsuspensionâ
even as the performance of Verdiâs aptly-named A Masked Ball began. Video circulating of the event showed full
rows of people in the upper sections where seats are cheaper, and empty
seats in the more expensive ground-level area. The theatre defended itself saying a âminorityâ
of the audience loudly objected despite being offered the chance to relocate to
different seats or have their tickets reimbursed. Spokesman Gregorio Maranon said
the theatre had met, and in some cases exceeded, all official health and safety requirements needed to open safely. Parts of Madrid are facing new
lockdown restrictions from Monday as cases of the coronavirus surge in
the Spanish capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The high street pharmacy chain Boots says it is pausing
taking any new bookings for flu vaccinations for people under 65 â both the
free NHS jabs and privately paid for ones. It says itâs seen unprecedented demand for the vaccine in
recent weeks and is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest
risk â people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu
jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in
phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. Some 30 million people - more than ever before - will get
invites from the NHS programme this winter as the population faces the dual
threat of flu and coronavirus.  For the first time, people over 50 in
England will be eligible as well as secondary
school pupils in year 7. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says that raising the coronavirus alert level for the UK ""reflects the significant shift in the current threat
posed"". âThis country now faces a tipping
point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop
the spread of the virus and protect lives"". Confirmation of the new alert level follows experts warning that there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. Read morehere.   Two hotels in York and Middlesborough and a theatre in Salford will be used as Nightingale courts in an attempt to clear the backlog of cases which has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Justice has said. Five more courts are also earmarked for Chester, Liverpool, Bristol, Winchester and Cirencester but the buildings set to be used have not been confirmed. The courts, including atThe Lowry in Salford, will hear non-custodial crime cases, as well as civil, family and tribunals work and the announcement takes the total number of Nightingale courts to 18. Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said it was an important step and added that the number of outstanding cases in magistrates' courts was now falling as a result of measures.

A group of African American physicians are setting up an expert panel to independently vet regulators' decisions about drugs and vaccines for Covid-19,Stat News reports,external. The panel is being set up through theNational Medical Association,external, which calls itself the collective voice of African American physicians and the leading force for parity and justice in medicine and the elimination of disparities in health. Its president, Leon McDougle, was quoted by Stat News as saying: âItâs necessary to provide a trusted messenger of vetted information to the African American community. There is a concern that some of the recent decisions by the Food and Drug Administration have been unduly influenced by politicians.â He also hopes their reassurance will persuade more African Americans - who have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus - to take part in vaccine trials.  The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level for the UK should be increased to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"", the UK's chief medical officers have said. The move comes as the number of cases of coronavirus continues to rise, with experts warning that theUK could see 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October without further action. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland confirmed that all four nations of the UK should move to Level 4. The statement said: ""After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations. ""If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS and other health services over the autumn and winter everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly. ""We know this will be concerning news for many people; please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this."" Read morehere. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris Some 81 primary schools have had to close because of cases Franceâs education ministry is changing the rules around coronavirus
cases in nurseries and primary schools in an attempt to keep more of them
open.  From Tuesday, classes will only be cancelled if
three or more children test positive for Covid-19. Until now, if even one child in a class tested positive for coronavirus,
all his or her classmates would have to self-isolate.  That meant almost
2,000 classrooms standing empty across France at the start of this week,
and 81 primary schools completely closed. Under the rule changes,
classes with one case of coronavirus will continue as normal with the rest
of their pupils unless three children from different households all test
positive. Franceâs Public Health Council said last week that transmissions
were mainly occurring within families or at social gatherings outside
school premises. Teachers are obliged to wear masks, and Education
Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that the risk of transmission between
children was low. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster says that restrictions announced for certain local postcodes last week will now apply across NI as a whole from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. It means that people from different households cannot mix indoors unless they are in a social bubble. More than six people cannot meet outdoors. Mrs Foster says doing nothing was not an option but neither was returning to a full lockdown. Read morehere. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, responding to the health secretary in the Commons, said he welcomed the childcare lockdown exemptions and said he agreed that the country was at a ""perilous moment"". He said the tone of remarks from Matt Hancock on Sunday ""gave the impression he was blaming people for breaking the rules and allowing the virus to grow"". Mr Ashworth said: ""But the reality is people have done everything they have been asked to do. They have missed birthday celebrations, missed weddings, funerals. They have sent their children back to school, quite rightly, they have gone back to work. ""They did what they were asked to do. In return ministers were meant to fix test, trace and isolate so we could, in the words of his own government advert, get back to the things we love."" It's the afternoon here in London, but if you're joining us from the US - good morning. A lot has happened. To help you catch up, here's a summary of the latest US headlines. There has been an increase of 4,638 cases of coronavirus across the UK with 11 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. It takes the total number of deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the country to 41,788. The number of deaths reported at the start of the week tends to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Further restrictions are also being introduced in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston as well as in Bradford, Kirklees, and Calderdale, where residents are asked not to socialise outside their household or support bubble. The health secretary said: ""We know from experience local action can work when local communities come together to follow the rules, tackle the virus and keep themselves safe."" Mr Hancock said that the virus was increasing across the country and that ""we are at a tipping point"". He added the prime minister would address the House of Commons with any further action that needed to be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs about some of the new measures which have come into force as part of local lockdowns in areas of England, including the North East. The local lockdown rules ban people from socialising with others outside of their own household or support bubble. Mr Hancock says he has heard concerns about the impact that has been having on childcare arrangements. ""Today I'm able to announce a new exemption,"" he says. People looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults are exempt from that ban, when it's necessary for caring purposes. He says it covers formal and informal arrangements for childcare - but not playdates or parties. ""A consistent childcare relationship is allowed,"" he said. There had beencalls for such an exemption last week- afterfamilies warned that peoplewould have no other choice to break the rules. Mr Hancock announced that stronger restrictions would be brought in from Tuesday in parts of Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington. He said: ""In the summer when the virus was in retreat we were able to relax some of the measures we had put in place, now the virus is spreading once more, I have to act."" The health secretary said there would be restrictions on hospitality and socialising, including hospitality venues closing from 22:00. He said the overall strategy was to protect education and employment as much as possible. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK faces 50,000 cases a day by mid-October without actionThe UK could see 50,000 Covid cases a day by mid-October if the infection rate is not halted - top scientist.","This video can not be played Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance says measures must be taken to stop the spread of Covid-19 The UK could see 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action, the government's chief scientific adviser has warned. Sir Patrick Vallance said that would be expected to lead to about ""200-plus deaths per day"" a month after that. It comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency committee meeting on Tuesday morning, then make a statement in the House of Commons. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899. A further 11 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test, although these figures tend to be lower over the weekend and on Mondays due to reporting delays. Speaking at Downing Street alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick stressed the figures given were not a prediction, but added: ""At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days. ""If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day. ""Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day. ""The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. ""That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down."" What are the rules for meeting my friends? Scotland faces tighter restrictions 'within days' Four more counties in Wales face local lockdown Is it time we learnt to live with the virus? Prof Whitty added that if cases continued to double every seven days as Sir Patrick had set out, then the UK could ""quickly move from really quite small numbers to really very large numbers because of that exponential process"". ""So we have, in a bad sense, literally turned a corner, although only relatively recently,"" he said. Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said: The rising case numbers can not be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an ""increase in positivity of the tests done"" Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study) Less than 8% of the population has been infected, although the figure could be as high as 17% in London The rising transmission is a serious ""six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively"" - but science will eventually ""ride to our rescue"" The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contrary It is possible ""that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups"" but ""the first half of next year"" is much more likely The government's most senior science and medical advisers are clearly concerned about the rise in cases that have been seen in recent weeks. The warning about 50,000 cases a day by mid-October is stark. We don't know for sure how many cases there were at the peak in spring (as there was very limited testing in place) although some estimates put it at 100,000. However, they were also at pains to point out it was not a prediction - for one thing the 'rule of six' which came in just a week ago has not had time to have an impact. Even among the government's own advisers there is disagreement over whether what we are seeing is the start of an exponential rise or just a gradual increase in cases, which is what you would expect at this time of year as respiratory viruses tend to circulate more with the reopening of society. Spain and France, which both started seeing rises earlier than the UK, have not seen the sort of rapid trajectory that was presented by the advisers. Instead, what was quite telling was the clear social messaging. Even those who are not at a high risk of complications should, they say, play their part in curbing the spread of the virus - because if it spreads then difficult decisions will be needed that have profound societal consequences. But the big unanswered question is what ministers will do next. There is talk of further restrictions being introduced. A couple of things are in our favour that were not in the spring. Better treatments for those who get very sick are now available, while the government is in a stronger position to protect the vulnerable groups. Should ministers wait and see what happens? Or should they crack down early, knowing that will have a negative impact in other ways? Prof Whitty also said that even though different parts of the UK were seeing cases rising at different rates, and even though some age groups were affected more than others, the evolving situation was ""all of our problem"". He added that evidence from other countries showed infections were ""not staying just in the younger age groups"" but were ""moving up the age bands"". He said mortality rates from Covid-19 were ""significantly greater"" than seasonal flu, which killed around 7,000 annually or 20,000 in a bad year. Meanwhile, restrictions on households mixing indoorswill be extended to all of Northern Ireland from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. Areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will also face further local restrictions from Tuesday. And additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that,"" she said. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: ""It may be the case that UK-wide measures will be taken but that will require all four governments to exercise our varying share of power and responsibility to do so."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with leaders of the devolved administrations on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancockannounced a new exemption to local restrictions in England for formal and informal childcare arrangements, covering those looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults. ""It does not allow for play-dates or parties, but it does mean that a consistent childcare relationship that is vital for somebody to get to work is allowed,"" he told the Commons. It is not a question of ""if"". Downing Street will have to introduce extra restrictions to try to slow down the dramatic resurgence of coronavirus. You would only have to have dipped into a minute or two of the sober briefing from the government's most senior doctor and scientist on Monday morning to see why. What is not yet settled however, is exactly what, exactly when, and indeed, exactly where these restrictions will be. Here's what it is important to know: The government is not considering a new lockdown across the country right now. The prime minister is not about to tell everyone to stay at home as he did from the Downing Street desk in March. Ministers have no intention at all to close schools again. Nor, right now, are they planning to tell every business, other than the non-essential, to close again. What is likely is some kind of extra limits on our huge hospitality sector. Read more from Laura here. On Sunday, the prime minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Prof Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss possible further measures for England. Asked about reports of disagreements among cabinet ministers about whether or not to impose a second lockdown, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""A conversation, a debate, is quite proper and that is exactly what you'd expect. ""Everyone recognises there is a tension between... the virus and the measures we need to take, and the economy and ensuring people's livelihoods are protected."" Prof Peter Horby, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said there was a risk the UK could face a repeat of the ""catastrophic events"" around the world early this year, with intensive care units ""rammed full of very sick patients"". ""I really don't buy that argument that we should slow down... the mistakes that were made in March were nearly all being too cautious and too slow,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. However, Prof Karol Sikora, from the University of Buckinghamshire and former director of the World Health Organization's cancer programme, said blanket restrictions were ""not the way forward"". ""The most important thing is to target the groups that we need to protect and to let everybody else get on with their business - schools, shops and so on,"" he told the programme. Labour, meanwhile, has also urged the government to avoid a second national lockdown. ""This rapid spike in infections was not inevitable, but a consequence of the government's incompetence and failure to put in place an adequate testing system,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. ""The government must do what it takes to prevent another lockdown, which would cause unimaginable damage to our economy and people's wellbeing.""

Today's live page has been edited by Robert Greenall and Paul Gribben and written by Penny Spiller, Francesca Gillett, Ashita Nagesh and Doug Faulkner. Thank you for joining us and we will be back again on Tuesday. Here are some of the headlines from today: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for additional measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the capital as he said the testing system was a ""mess"". He told BBC London: ""We want additional measures to pre-empt further hospital admissions and deaths and to prevent a second lockdown."" He pointed to cities in the North East of England and in Birmingham as an example and said some things which had been done there could be done in London, including reducing the time bars, pubs and restaurants are open, and making sure events like weddings do not inadvertently lead to an increase in the spread of the virus. He said testing in London ""had been a mess"" with contact tracing ""collapsing"", adding that it appeared patterns of the virus being transmitted were different in the capital to other parts of the country. Mr Khan also said he hoped to be part of Tuesday's Cobra meeting but had not spoken to the prime minister since the last one on 10 May. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organisation says 156 countries, covering two-thirds of the worldâs population, have signed up to its joint facility aimed atdeveloping vaccines against coronavirus, and ensuring they are distributed fairly. The facility, known as Covax, hopes to have two billion doses of vaccine available by the end of next year but some key countries, among them the United States, have not signed up. The WHO says joining Covax makes sense: four out of five candidate vaccines fail and even the richest countries may pick the wrong ones, while joining forces to invest together in multiple possible vaccines (there are currently almost 200 in development) raises the chances of success for everyone. Sixty-four high income countries have signed up, including most of Europe, and 92 lower income countries but the US and China have not. The US says it will do bilateral deals to supply its own population. The WHOâs plan is different: the first two billion doses from Covax will be distributed globally, withpriority likely to be given to healthcare workers,  the elderly, and those with pre-existing health risks. Four St Andrews University students have contracted coronavirus after afreshers' week party. More than 40 people are now self-isolating following the gathering in a hall of residence, which broke national coronavirus restrictions. Sally Mapstone, principal of the Scottish university, said: ""The ripples from this single incident have consequences for all of us."" More generally, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing on Tuesday thatadditional lockdown restrictionswill ""almost certainly"" be put in place in coming days across the country. Madridâs famous opera house Teatro Real
was forced to cancel a performance on Sunday night after some people in the âcheap
seatsâ complained they were not socially-distanced enough. There were shouts and jeers of âsuspensionâ
even as the performance of Verdiâs aptly-named A Masked Ball began. Video circulating of the event showed full
rows of people in the upper sections where seats are cheaper, and empty
seats in the more expensive ground-level area. The theatre defended itself saying a âminorityâ
of the audience loudly objected despite being offered the chance to relocate to
different seats or have their tickets reimbursed. Spokesman Gregorio Maranon said
the theatre had met, and in some cases exceeded, all official health and safety requirements needed to open safely. Parts of Madrid are facing new
lockdown restrictions from Monday as cases of the coronavirus surge in
the Spanish capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The high street pharmacy chain Boots says it is pausing
taking any new bookings for flu vaccinations for people under 65 â both the
free NHS jabs and privately paid for ones. It says itâs seen unprecedented demand for the vaccine in
recent weeks and is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest
risk â people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu
jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in
phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. Some 30 million people - more than ever before - will get
invites from the NHS programme this winter as the population faces the dual
threat of flu and coronavirus.  For the first time, people over 50 in
England will be eligible as well as secondary
school pupils in year 7. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says that raising the coronavirus alert level for the UK ""reflects the significant shift in the current threat
posed"". âThis country now faces a tipping
point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop
the spread of the virus and protect lives"". Confirmation of the new alert level follows experts warning that there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. Read morehere.   Two hotels in York and Middlesborough and a theatre in Salford will be used as Nightingale courts in an attempt to clear the backlog of cases which has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Justice has said. Five more courts are also earmarked for Chester, Liverpool, Bristol, Winchester and Cirencester but the buildings set to be used have not been confirmed. The courts, including atThe Lowry in Salford, will hear non-custodial crime cases, as well as civil, family and tribunals work and the announcement takes the total number of Nightingale courts to 18. Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said it was an important step and added that the number of outstanding cases in magistrates' courts was now falling as a result of measures.

A group of African American physicians are setting up an expert panel to independently vet regulators' decisions about drugs and vaccines for Covid-19,Stat News reports,external. The panel is being set up through theNational Medical Association,external, which calls itself the collective voice of African American physicians and the leading force for parity and justice in medicine and the elimination of disparities in health. Its president, Leon McDougle, was quoted by Stat News as saying: âItâs necessary to provide a trusted messenger of vetted information to the African American community. There is a concern that some of the recent decisions by the Food and Drug Administration have been unduly influenced by politicians.â He also hopes their reassurance will persuade more African Americans - who have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus - to take part in vaccine trials.  The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level for the UK should be increased to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"", the UK's chief medical officers have said. The move comes as the number of cases of coronavirus continues to rise, with experts warning that theUK could see 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October without further action. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland confirmed that all four nations of the UK should move to Level 4. The statement said: ""After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations. ""If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS and other health services over the autumn and winter everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly. ""We know this will be concerning news for many people; please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this."" Read morehere. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris Some 81 primary schools have had to close because of cases Franceâs education ministry is changing the rules around coronavirus
cases in nurseries and primary schools in an attempt to keep more of them
open.  From Tuesday, classes will only be cancelled if
three or more children test positive for Covid-19. Until now, if even one child in a class tested positive for coronavirus,
all his or her classmates would have to self-isolate.  That meant almost
2,000 classrooms standing empty across France at the start of this week,
and 81 primary schools completely closed. Under the rule changes,
classes with one case of coronavirus will continue as normal with the rest
of their pupils unless three children from different households all test
positive. Franceâs Public Health Council said last week that transmissions
were mainly occurring within families or at social gatherings outside
school premises. Teachers are obliged to wear masks, and Education
Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that the risk of transmission between
children was low. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster says that restrictions announced for certain local postcodes last week will now apply across NI as a whole from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. It means that people from different households cannot mix indoors unless they are in a social bubble. More than six people cannot meet outdoors. Mrs Foster says doing nothing was not an option but neither was returning to a full lockdown. Read morehere. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, responding to the health secretary in the Commons, said he welcomed the childcare lockdown exemptions and said he agreed that the country was at a ""perilous moment"". He said the tone of remarks from Matt Hancock on Sunday ""gave the impression he was blaming people for breaking the rules and allowing the virus to grow"". Mr Ashworth said: ""But the reality is people have done everything they have been asked to do. They have missed birthday celebrations, missed weddings, funerals. They have sent their children back to school, quite rightly, they have gone back to work. ""They did what they were asked to do. In return ministers were meant to fix test, trace and isolate so we could, in the words of his own government advert, get back to the things we love."" It's the afternoon here in London, but if you're joining us from the US - good morning. A lot has happened. To help you catch up, here's a summary of the latest US headlines. There has been an increase of 4,638 cases of coronavirus across the UK with 11 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. It takes the total number of deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the country to 41,788. The number of deaths reported at the start of the week tends to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Further restrictions are also being introduced in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston as well as in Bradford, Kirklees, and Calderdale, where residents are asked not to socialise outside their household or support bubble. The health secretary said: ""We know from experience local action can work when local communities come together to follow the rules, tackle the virus and keep themselves safe."" Mr Hancock said that the virus was increasing across the country and that ""we are at a tipping point"". He added the prime minister would address the House of Commons with any further action that needed to be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs about some of the new measures which have come into force as part of local lockdowns in areas of England, including the North East. The local lockdown rules ban people from socialising with others outside of their own household or support bubble. Mr Hancock says he has heard concerns about the impact that has been having on childcare arrangements. ""Today I'm able to announce a new exemption,"" he says. People looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults are exempt from that ban, when it's necessary for caring purposes. He says it covers formal and informal arrangements for childcare - but not playdates or parties. ""A consistent childcare relationship is allowed,"" he said. There had beencalls for such an exemption last week- afterfamilies warned that peoplewould have no other choice to break the rules. Mr Hancock announced that stronger restrictions would be brought in from Tuesday in parts of Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington. He said: ""In the summer when the virus was in retreat we were able to relax some of the measures we had put in place, now the virus is spreading once more, I have to act."" The health secretary said there would be restrictions on hospitality and socialising, including hospitality venues closing from 22:00. He said the overall strategy was to protect education and employment as much as possible. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tory donor linked to $8m Putin ally fundingLeaked files reveal the husband of a woman who gave the Conservative Party Â£1.7m received money from a Russian oligarch who has close ties to the president.,"Lubov Chernukhin started donating to the Conservative Party in 2012 The husband of one of the Conservative Party's biggest donors was secretly funded by a Russian oligarch with close ties to President Putin. Lubov Chernukhin has given Â£1.7m to the Tories, including paying to spend time with the last three prime ministers. Leaked files show her husband received $8m (Â£6.1m). The money initially came from a politician facing US sanctions due to his closeness to the Kremlin. Her lawyers say the donations are not tainted by Kremlin influence. A leak of banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - called the FinCEN Files and seen by BBC Panorama - shows Vladimir Chernukhin was sent the money in 2016 from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Suleyman Kerimov. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak One of the world's 'dodgiest addresses', in leafy Hertfordshire HSBC moved Ponzi scam millions despite warning Officials at Deutsche Bank in New York reported it as being among $278.5m of transactions involving the offshore company. There has been an increasing focus on donations to political parties from wealthy UK-based Russians in recent years, with July'sparliamentary report by the Intelligence and Security Committee,externalreferring to the possibility they could allow people to ""assist Russian influence operations"". Billionaire Mr Kerimov is a member of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. He has been under investigation in France over allegations of tax fraud since 2016. In 2018 he was sanctioned by the US authorities, who were targeting those they said ""play a key role in advancing Russia's malign activities"". Mr Chernukhin, 52, is a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin, who left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president. The Chernukhins - one of the UK's most prominent Russian-born couples - are now both British citizens and live in London. Vladimir Chernukhin with Vladimir Putin - he was sacked as deputy finance minister in 2004 Mrs Chernukhin's donations to the Conservative Party began in 2012. The majority - more than Â£1.5m - came after the $8m payment linked to Mr Kerimov was made to her husband on 29 April 2016, although it is not clear if any of that cash went to the Tories. Journalist and Russia expert Edward Lucas, who gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into Russian influence, told Panorama: ""The Chernukhins, pleasant people that they might beâ¦ are not fit and proper people to make donations to a British political party."" Mr Lucas said he was ""profoundly concerned by the access that, not only Lubov Chernukhin but also other rich Russians have to the heights of the Conservative Party, and to the government"".

Mrs Chernukhin's donations to the Tories have given her access to figures at the top of UK government. In return for Â£135,000 she was invited to a ladies' night dinner at a luxury hotel with Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet in April 2019. She is pictured above, fourth from the right. And the 47-year-old has twice made winning bids at auction for tennis matches with Boris Johnson. The last, in February this year, cost her Â£45,000. In 2014 she paid Â£160,000 to play tennis with Prime Minister David Cameron and then London Mayor Mr Johnson. In 2014 Mrs Chernukhin paid to play tennis with Prime Minister David Cameron and Boris Johnson (Pictures from 2013 and 2008) As of this year she is the biggest female donor in British history to the Tories. According to Electoral Commission records, she has given about Â£1.7m in total over the past eight years, including Â£335,000 between last January and July. When in 2018, Boris Johnson - then foreign secretary - was asked about the Chernukhins and the Â£160,000 tennis match donation,he told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show:""If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way that gentlemanâ¦ obtained his wealth... then it's possible for our law enforcement agencies to deprive him of his wealth."" But he added ""all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made"" on donations. The $8m payment to Mr Chernukhin was made by an offshore company called Definition Services, which was controlled by Mr Kerimov's children. The documents show their funding came from their father and it was Mr Kerimov who had the personal relationship with Mr Chernukhin. As Deutsche Bank was processing the money, it sent questions to officials at another bank involved in the transaction. The $8m payment came from an offshore company linked to Suleyman Kerimov They said it was a ""loan between the two parties aiming to support further immovable property projects of the borrower"" and that Definition was involved in real estate investments. Despite the response, Deutsche Bank filed a suspicious activity report (SAR), noting the link to Mr Kerimov and the payment to Mr Chernukhin. Deutsche said Definition was ""registered and banking out of high risk jurisdictions and the commercial purpose of the transactions and the relationship between the parties could not be determined"". Some of Mr Chernukhin's financial affairs have been made public as part of a long running legal battle with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska over the ownership of a former industrial site in Moscow. Proceedings at the High Court in London revealed he set up a trust for his wife, and another trust for the benefit of the couple together. Vladimir Chernukhin has been involved in a long-running legal battle in London Mrs Chernukhin has been described as a former banker. She is listed as a director of four UK companies. One of them shares the same London correspondence address detailed in a bank document concerning the $8m payment to her husband from Definition Services. Lawyers for the Chernukhins declined to say whether Mr Chernukhin had received the $8m. But they said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from Mr Kerimov or any company related to him"" and her ""donations to the Conservative Party have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence"". They added all her donations have been declared in accordance with Electoral Commission rules. Lawyers for Suleyman Kerimov said he denies all the allegations made by Panorama, and had ""no dealings with Ms Chernukhin whatsoever"". A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""There are people in this country of Russian origin who are British citizens and have the democratic right to donate to a political party. Many have been vocal critics of Putin and it is completely wrong and discriminatory to smear them all with the same brush."" The FinCEN Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed ""dirty money"" to be moved around the world. They also expose how US intelligence sees the UK as a ""higher risk jurisdiction"" and show it is awash with Russian cash from unexplained sources. The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world.

More generally, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing on Tuesday thatadditional lockdown restrictionswill ""almost certainly"" be put in place in coming days across the country. Madridâs famous opera house Teatro Real
was forced to cancel a performance on Sunday night after some people in the âcheap
seatsâ complained they were not socially-distanced enough. There were shouts and jeers of âsuspensionâ
even as the performance of Verdiâs aptly-named A Masked Ball began. Video circulating of the event showed full
rows of people in the upper sections where seats are cheaper, and empty
seats in the more expensive ground-level area. The theatre defended itself saying a âminorityâ
of the audience loudly objected despite being offered the chance to relocate to
different seats or have their tickets reimbursed. Spokesman Gregorio Maranon said
the theatre had met, and in some cases exceeded, all official health and safety requirements needed to open safely. Parts of Madrid are facing new
lockdown restrictions from Monday as cases of the coronavirus surge in
the Spanish capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The high street pharmacy chain Boots says it is pausing
taking any new bookings for flu vaccinations for people under 65 â both the
free NHS jabs and privately paid for ones. It says itâs seen unprecedented demand for the vaccine in
recent weeks and is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest
risk â people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu
jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in
phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. Some 30 million people - more than ever before - will get
invites from the NHS programme this winter as the population faces the dual
threat of flu and coronavirus.  For the first time, people over 50 in
England will be eligible as well as secondary
school pupils in year 7. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says that raising the coronavirus alert level for the UK ""reflects the significant shift in the current threat
posed"". âThis country now faces a tipping
point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop
the spread of the virus and protect lives"". Confirmation of the new alert level follows experts warning that there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. Read morehere.   Two hotels in York and Middlesborough and a theatre in Salford will be used as Nightingale courts in an attempt to clear the backlog of cases which has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Justice has said. Five more courts are also earmarked for Chester, Liverpool, Bristol, Winchester and Cirencester but the buildings set to be used have not been confirmed. The courts, including atThe Lowry in Salford, will hear non-custodial crime cases, as well as civil, family and tribunals work and the announcement takes the total number of Nightingale courts to 18. Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said it was an important step and added that the number of outstanding cases in magistrates' courts was now falling as a result of measures.

A group of African American physicians are setting up an expert panel to independently vet regulators' decisions about drugs and vaccines for Covid-19,Stat News reports,external. The panel is being set up through theNational Medical Association,external, which calls itself the collective voice of African American physicians and the leading force for parity and justice in medicine and the elimination of disparities in health. Its president, Leon McDougle, was quoted by Stat News as saying: âItâs necessary to provide a trusted messenger of vetted information to the African American community. There is a concern that some of the recent decisions by the Food and Drug Administration have been unduly influenced by politicians.â He also hopes their reassurance will persuade more African Americans - who have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus - to take part in vaccine trials.  The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level for the UK should be increased to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"", the UK's chief medical officers have said. The move comes as the number of cases of coronavirus continues to rise, with experts warning that theUK could see 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October without further action. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland confirmed that all four nations of the UK should move to Level 4. The statement said: ""After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations. ""If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS and other health services over the autumn and winter everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly. ""We know this will be concerning news for many people; please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this."" Read morehere. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris Some 81 primary schools have had to close because of cases Franceâs education ministry is changing the rules around coronavirus
cases in nurseries and primary schools in an attempt to keep more of them
open.  From Tuesday, classes will only be cancelled if
three or more children test positive for Covid-19. Until now, if even one child in a class tested positive for coronavirus,
all his or her classmates would have to self-isolate.  That meant almost
2,000 classrooms standing empty across France at the start of this week,
and 81 primary schools completely closed. Under the rule changes,
classes with one case of coronavirus will continue as normal with the rest
of their pupils unless three children from different households all test
positive. Franceâs Public Health Council said last week that transmissions
were mainly occurring within families or at social gatherings outside
school premises. Teachers are obliged to wear masks, and Education
Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that the risk of transmission between
children was low. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster says that restrictions announced for certain local postcodes last week will now apply across NI as a whole from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. It means that people from different households cannot mix indoors unless they are in a social bubble. More than six people cannot meet outdoors. Mrs Foster says doing nothing was not an option but neither was returning to a full lockdown. Read morehere. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, responding to the health secretary in the Commons, said he welcomed the childcare lockdown exemptions and said he agreed that the country was at a ""perilous moment"". He said the tone of remarks from Matt Hancock on Sunday ""gave the impression he was blaming people for breaking the rules and allowing the virus to grow"". Mr Ashworth said: ""But the reality is people have done everything they have been asked to do. They have missed birthday celebrations, missed weddings, funerals. They have sent their children back to school, quite rightly, they have gone back to work. ""They did what they were asked to do. In return ministers were meant to fix test, trace and isolate so we could, in the words of his own government advert, get back to the things we love."" It's the afternoon here in London, but if you're joining us from the US - good morning. A lot has happened. To help you catch up, here's a summary of the latest US headlines. There has been an increase of 4,638 cases of coronavirus across the UK with 11 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. It takes the total number of deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the country to 41,788. The number of deaths reported at the start of the week tends to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Further restrictions are also being introduced in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston as well as in Bradford, Kirklees, and Calderdale, where residents are asked not to socialise outside their household or support bubble. The health secretary said: ""We know from experience local action can work when local communities come together to follow the rules, tackle the virus and keep themselves safe."" Mr Hancock said that the virus was increasing across the country and that ""we are at a tipping point"". He added the prime minister would address the House of Commons with any further action that needed to be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs about some of the new measures which have come into force as part of local lockdowns in areas of England, including the North East. The local lockdown rules ban people from socialising with others outside of their own household or support bubble. Mr Hancock says he has heard concerns about the impact that has been having on childcare arrangements. ""Today I'm able to announce a new exemption,"" he says. People looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults are exempt from that ban, when it's necessary for caring purposes. He says it covers formal and informal arrangements for childcare - but not playdates or parties. ""A consistent childcare relationship is allowed,"" he said. There had beencalls for such an exemption last week- afterfamilies warned that peoplewould have no other choice to break the rules. Mr Hancock announced that stronger restrictions would be brought in from Tuesday in parts of Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington. He said: ""In the summer when the virus was in retreat we were able to relax some of the measures we had put in place, now the virus is spreading once more, I have to act."" The health secretary said there would be restrictions on hospitality and socialising, including hospitality venues closing from 22:00. He said the overall strategy was to protect education and employment as much as possible. Â© 2025 BBC.

"One of the world's 'dodgiest addresses', in leafy HertsAll you need to know about FinCEN documents leakPutin associate âmoved millionsâ through BarclaysYour guide to eight years of finance leaks","Suite 2B is on floor two of this building in Potters Bar Leaked banking documents have given a glimpse into international money-laundering. They show that it happens in some unlikely places. No one answers the door when you press the buzzer for suite 2B on the second floor of 175 Darkes Lane. It is a red brick building, just off the High Street in the Hertfordshire commuter town of Potters Bar. And suite 2B is the official home of more than 1,000 UK-registered companies. Many were set up to move billions of dollars' worth of ill-gotten gains around the globe in such a way as to make them near-impossible to trace. The firms are part of what has been described as a ""global money-laundering conveyor belt"". Criminals' money passes through a labyrinthine network of tax havens and bank accounts en route from being ""dirty"" to ""clean"". It ends up in financial centres such as New York, where the crooks can spend it without fear of prosecution. The banks make money from the transactions and often not enough questions are asked about who owns and runs the companies, or where the money has come from. On Friday, the UK government announced reforms designed to clamp down on this type of fraud and money laundering. A leak of more than 2,000 ""suspicious activity reports"" sent by banks to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) names more than 100 companies registered to suite 2B. Unbeknown to the shoppers frequenting the nearby Superdrug or buying a pasty at Greggs, the room is a virtual thoroughfare for international financial crime. The US Treasury, which houses FinCEN, believes it is one of the dodgiest addresses in the world. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak HSBC moved Ponzi scam millions Tory donor linked to $8m Putin ally funding ""If I were in charge of money laundering [detection] at a UK bank, all systems would be instructed that we do not process any payments to or from companies registered at that address,"" said financial crime consultant Martin Woods. The way the schemes work is intentionally complex. Criminals in Russia and other countries who want to launder their money take advantage of limited partnerships (LPs) and limited-liability partnerships (LLPs). These are UK companies, used perfectly legitimately by thousands of businesses, that require the owners to file very limited information about their operations. Criminals can use them to move large amounts of money anonymously. They pay ""formation agents"" as little as Â£50 to register the LPs and LLPs with Companies House, where all UK firms are registered on their behalf. Doing so gives a UK address through which to move their money - such as suite 2B, floor two, 175 Darkes Lane. But LPs and LLPs can be managed from abroad, with the criminals' details very difficult to detect. Often information given about the person setting up the company is not checked, so criminals can hide behind false names and aliases. Using businesses registered in the UK helps legitimise the money on its way to being ""clean"". LPs and LLPs have hugely multiplied in number. In 2004 there were 20,000 in the UK. By 2017 there were 100,000. Two of the firms registered at suite 2B were Ergoinvest and Chadborg Trade. Both had accounts with Danske Bank in Estonia, which was involved in one of the world'sbiggest money-laundering scandals,externalbetween 2005 and 2017. Ergoinvest and Chadborg Trade reported identical income of just Â£21,353 for one year. They also reported the same figures as each other for operating expenses and profit. These were fictitious figures. The difference between these accounts and reality is revealed in documents seen by the BBC's Panorama, showing that $700m (Â£535m) went through Ergoinvest and $2.6bn (Â£1.99bn) went through Chadborg. Aleksej Strukov, who runs suite 2B, said he had no access to companies' financial records and could not verify the information filed with Companies House. ""Our only role is the provision of the Darkes Lane address as their nominated registered office address, and in doing so, ensure we comply with the AML [anti-money laundering] regulations for that service,"" he said. Mr Strukov also said he conducted standard due diligence checks to verify the identities of company directors, shareholders and beneficial owners. What happens in suite 2B is just one particularly large-scale example of the part the UK plays in global money laundering. A total of 3,282 British companies were named in the leaked suspicious activity reports - that's more than any other country in the world. And the flood of dirty money is damaging the UK's international reputation. A leaked US Treasury report describes Britain as a ""higher-risk jurisdiction"" and compares it to notorious financial centres ""such as Cyprus"" in its role. Banks around the world are supposed to ask the ""source of funds"" handled by them. But in recent years, they have been criticised for not doing so properly and governments, their resources stretched, have struggled to detect wrongdoing. ""Money-laundering schemes are put together to make that difficult,"" said Graham Barrow, author of Dark Money. ""Money launderers know this, and complexity is their friend. ""If it's gone through 17 bank accounts before you see it, it's hard [to track]. And that's what they do: they have multiple companies in multiple countries with multiple accounts and move the money backwards and forwards between them."" The United Nations estimates the annual value of international money laundering to be between $800bn (Â£607bn) and $1trillion (Â£760bn). That is between 2% and 5% of everything produced in every economy in the world. Facing these revelations last week, the UK announced reforms to Companies House. Under the plans, directors will not be able to be appointed until their identity has been verified. Companies House will also be given greater powers to query, investigate and remove false information, with the aim of increasing the reliability of the data showing who is behind each company. The changes will give ""law enforcement and the private sector more accurate information to crack down on dirty money and financial exploitation"", said Security Minister James Brokenshire. In 2018, the UK government promised to bring in stronger controls over registering LPs and to give officials powers to ask for more information while they are operating. But the use of these companies in money laundering is ""vanishingly difficult to investigate"", said Mr Barrow. And much of it happens in places like suite 2B in leafy Potters Bar.

All you need to know about FinCEN documents leakPutin associate âmoved millionsâ through BarclaysYour guide to eight years of finance leaks,"Leaked documents involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. They also show how Russian oligarchs have used banks to avoid sanctions that were supposed to stop them getting their money into the West. It's the latest in a string of leaks over the past five years that have exposed secret deals, money laundering and financial crime. The FinCEN files are more than 2,500 documents, most of which were files that banks sent to the US authorities between 2000 and 2017. They raise concerns about what their clients might be doing. These documents are some of the international banking system's most closely guarded secrets. Banks use them to report suspicious behaviour but they are not proof of wrongdoing or crime. They were leaked to Buzzfeed News and shared with a group that brings together investigative journalists from around the world, which distributed them to 108 news organisations in 88 countries, including the BBC's Panorama programme. Hundreds of journalists have been sifting through the dense, technical documentation, uncovering some of the activities that banks would prefer the public not to know about.  2,657documents including 2,121Suspicious Activity Reports FinCEN is the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These are the people at the US Treasury who combat financial crime. Concerns about transactions made in US dollars need to be sent to FinCEN, even if they took place outside the US. Suspicious activity reports, or SARs, are an example of how those concerns are recorded. A bank must fill in one of these reports if it is worried one of its clients might be up to no good. The report is sent to the authorities. If you are planning to profit from a criminal enterprise, one of the most important things to have in place is a way of laundering the money. Laundering money is the process of taking dirty money - the proceeds of crimes such as drug dealing or corruption - and getting it into an account at a respected bank where it will not be linked with the crime. The same process is needed if you are a Russian oligarch whom Western countries have taken sanctions against to stop you getting your money into the West. Banks are supposed to make sure they don't help clients to launder money or move it around in ways that break the rules. By law, they have to know who their clients are - it's not enough to file SARs and keep taking dirty money from clients while expecting the authorities to deal with the problem. If they have evidence of criminal activity they should stop moving the cash. Fergus Shiel from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) said the leaked files were an ""insight into what banks know about the vast flows of dirty money across the globe"". He said the documents also highlighted the extraordinarily large amounts of money involved. The documents in the FinCEN files cover about $2tn of transactions and they are only a tiny proportion of the SARs submitted over the period. HSBC allowed fraudsters to move millionsof dollars of stolen money around the world, even after it learned from US investigators the scheme was a scam. JP Morgan allowed a company to move more than $1bnthrough a London account without knowing who owned it. The bank later discovered the company might be owned by a mobster on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.

Some of the cash was used to buy works of art. The husband of a woman who has donated Â£1.7m to the UK's governing Conservative Party's wassecretly funded by a Russian oligarchwith close ties to President Putin. TheUK is called a ""higher risk jurisdiction""and compared to Cyprus, by the intelligence division of FinCEN. That's because of the number of UK registered companies that appear in the SARs. Over 3,000 UK companies are named in the FinCEN files - more than any other country.

They highlight a range of potentially suspicious activity involving companies and individuals and also raise questions about why the banks which had noticed this activity did not always act on their concerns. Once a bank has filed a report to the authorities, it is very difficult to prosecute it or its executives, even if it carries on helping with the suspicious activities and collecting the fees. FinCEN said the leak could impact on US national security, compromise investigations, and threaten the safety of institutions and individuals who file the reports.

Putin associate âmoved millionsâ through BarclaysYour guide to eight years of finance leaks,"Vladimir Putin and Arkady Rotenberg have been friends since childhood One of Vladimir Putin's closest friends may have used Barclays Bank in London to launder money and dodge sanctions, leaked documents suggest. Billionaire Arkady Rotenberg has known the Russian president since childhood. Financial restrictions, orsanctions, were imposed on Mr Rotenberg by the US and the EU in 2014,which means Western banks could face serious consequences for doing business with him. Barclays says it met all its legal and regulatory duties. A leak of confidential files - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - reveal how companies believed to be controlled by Mr Rotenberg kept the secret accounts. The documents, known as the FinCEN Files, have been seen by the BBC's Panorama programme. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak In March 2014 the US hit Russia with economic sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in Ukraine. The Treasury Department designated Mr Rotenberg, 68, and his brother Boris, 63, ""members of the Russian leadership's inner circle"". The pair had sparred and trained in the same judo gym as Putin when they were young. The businessman and Russian president attending judo training in Sochi last year In recent years, Arkady Rotenberg's companies built roads, a gas pipeline and a power station through contracts awarded by the Russian state. The US Treasury said the brothers ""provided support to Putin's pet projects"" and ""made billions of dollars in contracts for Gazprom and the Sochi Winter Olympics awarded to them by Putin"". In 2018, the US added Arkady Rotenberg's son Igor to its list of sanctioned individuals. The aim of the sanctions is to cut off named people from the entire Western financial system. Yet the Rotenbergs appear to have continued moving cash through the UK and US. In 2008, Barclays opened an account for a company called Advantage Alliance. The leaked documents show the company moved Â£60m between 2012 and 2016. Many of the transactions occurred after the Rotenberg brothers had been sanctioned. In July this year, an investigation by the US Senate accused the Rotenbergs of using secretive purchases of expensive art to evade sanctions - one of the companies involved in the scheme was Advantage Alliance. US investigators concluded there was strong evidence that Advantage Alliance was owned by Arkady Rotenberg, and that the company had used its Barclays account in London to buy millions of dollars of art for him. A report,externalnoted how ""secrecy, anonymity, and a lack of regulation create an environment ripe for laundering money and evading sanctions"". Auction houses in the US and UK ""failed to ask basic questions"" about the buyers of the art. Despite the sanctions, Arkady appears to have paid $7.5m to acquire the RenÃ© Magritte painting La Poitrine. In 17 June 2014 a company linked to Arkady sent the cash from Moscow to Alliance's Barclays account in London. The following day Barclays sent the cash to the seller in New York. In April 2016, Barclays began an internal investigation of multiple accounts it suspected of being linked to the Rotenbergs. Six months later, the bank closed Advantage's account after becoming concerned that it was being used to move suspect funds. But the leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) show that other Barclays accounts with suspected links to the Rotenbergs remained open until 2017. One such company was Ayrton Development Limited. According to the files, Barclays were suspicious of Ayrton's activities and concluded that ""[Arkady] Rotenberg is the true owner of Ayrton"". Barclays did not comment when asked by Panorama about how many accounts it suspects were owned by the Rotenbergs. A spokesperson for Barclays said: ""We believe that we have complied with all our legal and regulatory obligations including in relation to US sanctions."" ""Given the filing of a SAR is not itself evidence of any actual wrongdoing, we would only terminate a client relationship after careful and objective investigation and analysis of the evidence, balancing potential financial crime suspicions with the risk of 'de-banking' an innocent customer."" The Rotenbergs declined to comment. The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money around the world.

It ends up in financial centres such as New York, where the crooks can spend it without fear of prosecution. The banks make money from the transactions and often not enough questions are asked about who owns and runs the companies, or where the money has come from. On Friday, the UK government announced reforms designed to clamp down on this type of fraud and money laundering. A leak of more than 2,000 ""suspicious activity reports"" sent by banks to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) names more than 100 companies registered to suite 2B. Unbeknown to the shoppers frequenting the nearby Superdrug or buying a pasty at Greggs, the room is a virtual thoroughfare for international financial crime. The US Treasury, which houses FinCEN, believes it is one of the dodgiest addresses in the world. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak HSBC moved Ponzi scam millions Tory donor linked to $8m Putin ally funding ""If I were in charge of money laundering [detection] at a UK bank, all systems would be instructed that we do not process any payments to or from companies registered at that address,"" said financial crime consultant Martin Woods. The way the schemes work is intentionally complex. Criminals in Russia and other countries who want to launder their money take advantage of limited partnerships (LPs) and limited-liability partnerships (LLPs). These are UK companies, used perfectly legitimately by thousands of businesses, that require the owners to file very limited information about their operations. Criminals can use them to move large amounts of money anonymously. They pay ""formation agents"" as little as Â£50 to register the LPs and LLPs with Companies House, where all UK firms are registered on their behalf. Doing so gives a UK address through which to move their money - such as suite 2B, floor two, 175 Darkes Lane. But LPs and LLPs can be managed from abroad, with the criminals' details very difficult to detect. Often information given about the person setting up the company is not checked, so criminals can hide behind false names and aliases. Using businesses registered in the UK helps legitimise the money on its way to being ""clean"". LPs and LLPs have hugely multiplied in number. In 2004 there were 20,000 in the UK. By 2017 there were 100,000. Two of the firms registered at suite 2B were Ergoinvest and Chadborg Trade. Both had accounts with Danske Bank in Estonia, which was involved in one of the world'sbiggest money-laundering scandals,externalbetween 2005 and 2017. Ergoinvest and Chadborg Trade reported identical income of just Â£21,353 for one year. They also reported the same figures as each other for operating expenses and profit. These were fictitious figures. The difference between these accounts and reality is revealed in documents seen by the BBC's Panorama, showing that $700m (Â£535m) went through Ergoinvest and $2.6bn (Â£1.99bn) went through Chadborg. Aleksej Strukov, who runs suite 2B, said he had no access to companies' financial records and could not verify the information filed with Companies House. ""Our only role is the provision of the Darkes Lane address as their nominated registered office address, and in doing so, ensure we comply with the AML [anti-money laundering] regulations for that service,"" he said. Mr Strukov also said he conducted standard due diligence checks to verify the identities of company directors, shareholders and beneficial owners. What happens in suite 2B is just one particularly large-scale example of the part the UK plays in global money laundering. A total of 3,282 British companies were named in the leaked suspicious activity reports - that's more than any other country in the world. And the flood of dirty money is damaging the UK's international reputation. A leaked US Treasury report describes Britain as a ""higher-risk jurisdiction"" and compares it to notorious financial centres ""such as Cyprus"" in its role. Banks around the world are supposed to ask the ""source of funds"" handled by them. But in recent years, they have been criticised for not doing so properly and governments, their resources stretched, have struggled to detect wrongdoing. ""Money-laundering schemes are put together to make that difficult,"" said Graham Barrow, author of Dark Money. ""Money launderers know this, and complexity is their friend. ""If it's gone through 17 bank accounts before you see it, it's hard [to track]. And that's what they do: they have multiple companies in multiple countries with multiple accounts and move the money backwards and forwards between them."" The United Nations estimates the annual value of international money laundering to be between $800bn (Â£607bn) and $1trillion (Â£760bn). That is between 2% and 5% of everything produced in every economy in the world. Facing these revelations last week, the UK announced reforms to Companies House. Under the plans, directors will not be able to be appointed until their identity has been verified. Companies House will also be given greater powers to query, investigate and remove false information, with the aim of increasing the reliability of the data showing who is behind each company. The changes will give ""law enforcement and the private sector more accurate information to crack down on dirty money and financial exploitation"", said Security Minister James Brokenshire. In 2018, the UK government promised to bring in stronger controls over registering LPs and to give officials powers to ask for more information while they are operating. But the use of these companies in money laundering is ""vanishingly difficult to investigate"", said Mr Barrow. And much of it happens in places like suite 2B in leafy Potters Bar. The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. They also show how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world.

Emergency measures to help train firms extended,"The government has scrapped rail franchising and announced plans to extend support for train firms. After passenger numbers fell during lockdown, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues. So far, the bill has run to more than Â£3.5bn and the Department for Transport has said ""significant"" support will still be needed. Although passenger numbers have edged up since lockdown, they are still less than half pre-pandemic levels. As a result, emergency measures to cover the losses of train firms have been extended by 18 months. They reduce the fees that can be earned by the companies but will mean that trains are still able to run, even with fewer passengers. Throughout that period ministers hope to carry out broader reforms to Britain's railways. They will consider adopting a concessions-based system in the longer term, whereby train companies are paid a fixed fee to run services. It marks the end of rail franchises, which have been in place since the 1990s. Is it safe to use public transport? What has gone wrong with rail franchising? In a statement, Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps said: ""The model of privatisation adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working."" He said the move to a new system would end ""uncertainty and confusion about whether you are using the right ticket or the right train company"". The government and the train companies are painting this as a good deal. But in reality, because of Covid, it's a fairly unsatisfactory scenario for all those concerned. The taxpayer will be liable for the losses on the railways for a much longer period of time. And with the virus spreading, passenger levels might remain suppressed - so the losses could continue for some time to come. Meanwhile, train companies who operated franchises that were losing money before the pandemic, still owe money to the Department for Transport from those contracts. Although that thorny issue has been kicked down the road and the negotiations over past payments now need to be resolved by December. Private train companies have no easy option. The emergency deals keep them in the game but they're a metaphorical straitjacket, which make them commercially un-enticing. For now, no train company has ""handed back the keys"", which would force the government to take on the running of a route. Doing so carries financial penalties and does nothing for a firm's reputation. Instead, all of them have, in the short-term, opted for the least bad option there is. And there is still no consensus within government over what the railways will look like after the pandemic so the detail on that is pretty thin. Train companies have welcomed the plans to replace Britain's often-criticised system of rail franchising. Paul Plummer, the boss of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train firms, called for a simpler-to-use fare system. He said: ""These transitional contracts should be a stepping-stone to a better railway."" But rail expert Sir Michael Holden, who used to run South West Trains, said: The big issue is, what is that something else to look like?"" He told the BBC's Today programme that the current emergency measures were ""the worst possible arrangement to run the railways"". ""We've got the dead hand of the government on the helm... controlling all of the detailed decisions of the railway."" ""And yet, they're still paying for public sector operators to run the railway for them."" Labour said the government was trying to ""paper over the cracks of a broken rail system"". Shadow rail minister Tan Dhesi said: ""Today's agreements mean taxpayers are set to continue paying hundreds of millions of pounds in profit to private rail companies to run the network. This is completely unacceptable."" But Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams, who was commissioned to carry out a review of the railways, said the companies would have to give more value under the new agreements, which represented the end of the ""complicated"" franchising arrangement. He said they demanded ""more from the expertise and skills of the private sector"" and ""ensure passengers return to a more punctual and co-ordinated railway"". However, Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash claimed ""private rail companies are a waste of time and a waste of money"". He insisted that ""public ownership is the only model that works"". And Unite's national officer for rail Harish Patel said: ""Instead of the proposed new model which will allow privateers a renewed opportunity to feed off the taxpayer and passengers, the government should be permanently re-nationalising rail services to increase services, improve punctuality and reduce tickets prices.""

LiveLiveUK faces 'very challenging winter period'5 minutes ago,"UK chief medical officers say coronavirus alert level will move to level 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"" The UK could be facing 50,000 new Covid-19 cases a day by mid-October, if the current infection rate is not halted Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns that UK faces 'tipping point' on coronavirus cases UK PM Boris Johnson will address Commons on Tuesday about pandemic France changes rules around coronavirus cases in nurseries and primary schools to try to keep more open Parts of the Spanish capital Madrid are going into a tough new lockdown - more than 800,000 residents have been asked to stay at home There have been 31 million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Paul Gribben We are pausing our live coverage for now. Today's live page has been edited by Robert Greenall and Paul Gribben and written by Penny Spiller, Francesca Gillett, Ashita Nagesh and Doug Faulkner. Thank you for joining us and we will be back again on Tuesday. Here are some of the headlines from today: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for additional measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the capital as he said the testing system was a ""mess"". He told BBC London: ""We want additional measures to pre-empt further hospital admissions and deaths and to prevent a second lockdown."" He pointed to cities in the North East of England and in Birmingham as an example and said some things which had been done there could be done in London, including reducing the time bars, pubs and restaurants are open, and making sure events like weddings do not inadvertently lead to an increase in the spread of the virus. He said testing in London ""had been a mess"" with contact tracing ""collapsing"", adding that it appeared patterns of the virus being transmitted were different in the capital to other parts of the country. Mr Khan also said he hoped to be part of Tuesday's Cobra meeting but had not spoken to the prime minister since the last one on 10 May. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organisation says 156 countries, covering two-thirds of the worldâs population, have signed up to its joint facility aimed atdeveloping vaccines against coronavirus, and ensuring they are distributed fairly. The facility, known as Covax, hopes to have two billion doses of vaccine available by the end of next year but some key countries, among them the United States, have not signed up. The WHO says joining Covax makes sense: four out of five candidate vaccines fail and even the richest countries may pick the wrong ones, while joining forces to invest together in multiple possible vaccines (there are currently almost 200 in development) raises the chances of success for everyone. Sixty-four high income countries have signed up, including most of Europe, and 92 lower income countries but the US and China have not. The US says it will do bilateral deals to supply its own population. The WHOâs plan is different: the first two billion doses from Covax will be distributed globally, withpriority likely to be given to healthcare workers,  the elderly, and those with pre-existing health risks. Four St Andrews University students have contracted coronavirus after afreshers' week party. More than 40 people are now self-isolating following the gathering in a hall of residence, which broke national coronavirus restrictions. Sally Mapstone, principal of the Scottish university, said: ""The ripples from this single incident have consequences for all of us."" More generally, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing on Tuesday thatadditional lockdown restrictionswill ""almost certainly"" be put in place in coming days across the country. Madridâs famous opera house Teatro Real
was forced to cancel a performance on Sunday night after some people in the âcheap
seatsâ complained they were not socially-distanced enough. There were shouts and jeers of âsuspensionâ
even as the performance of Verdiâs aptly-named A Masked Ball began. Video circulating of the event showed full
rows of people in the upper sections where seats are cheaper, and empty
seats in the more expensive ground-level area. The theatre defended itself saying a âminorityâ
of the audience loudly objected despite being offered the chance to relocate to
different seats or have their tickets reimbursed. Spokesman Gregorio Maranon said
the theatre had met, and in some cases exceeded, all official health and safety requirements needed to open safely. Parts of Madrid are facing new
lockdown restrictions from Monday as cases of the coronavirus surge in
the Spanish capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The move to level 4 should not come as a surprise given the warning from the UK's two most senior pandemic advisers this morning. Infections are rising - although some experts question whether the situation is as dire as Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance set out when they raised the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by mid-October. Cases were always expected to increase at this time of year when respiratory viruses tend to circulate more coupled with the continued re-opening of society. Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But it is clear the government wants to act early this time - one of the big criticisms is that they were slow to introduce lockdown in March, which resulted in more deaths. Level 4 paves the way for extra restrictions to be introduced with an announcement expected on Tuesday. Officials are very aware a fine balance needs to be navigated, which is why a full lockdown is not on the cards. Schools will certainly be protected. But any restrictions have a cost to society. Go too far and the risk is the cure becomes worse than the disease. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The high street pharmacy chain Boots says it is pausing
taking any new bookings for flu vaccinations for people under 65 â both the
free NHS jabs and privately paid for ones. It says itâs seen unprecedented demand for the vaccine in
recent weeks and is temporarily limiting existing stocks to those at highest
risk â people 65 and over. NHS England confirmed there is no nationwide shortage of flu
jabs, but that those eligible for the free vaccine would be immunised in
phases, with the highest risk groups receiving it first. Some 30 million people - more than ever before - will get
invites from the NHS programme this winter as the population faces the dual
threat of flu and coronavirus.  For the first time, people over 50 in
England will be eligible as well as secondary
school pupils in year 7. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says that raising the coronavirus alert level for the UK ""reflects the significant shift in the current threat
posed"". âThis country now faces a tipping
point in its response and it is vital everybody plays their part now to stop
the spread of the virus and protect lives"". Confirmation of the new alert level follows experts warning that there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to make a statement in the Commons on Tuesday. Read morehere.   Two hotels in York and Middlesborough and a theatre in Salford will be used as Nightingale courts in an attempt to clear the backlog of cases which has grown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Justice has said. Five more courts are also earmarked for Chester, Liverpool, Bristol, Winchester and Cirencester but the buildings set to be used have not been confirmed. The courts, including atThe Lowry in Salford, will hear non-custodial crime cases, as well as civil, family and tribunals work and the announcement takes the total number of Nightingale courts to 18. Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said it was an important step and added that the number of outstanding cases in magistrates' courts was now falling as a result of measures.

A group of African American physicians are setting up an expert panel to independently vet regulators' decisions about drugs and vaccines for Covid-19,Stat News reports,external. The panel is being set up through theNational Medical Association,external, which calls itself the collective voice of African American physicians and the leading force for parity and justice in medicine and the elimination of disparities in health. Its president, Leon McDougle, was quoted by Stat News as saying: âItâs necessary to provide a trusted messenger of vetted information to the African American community. There is a concern that some of the recent decisions by the Food and Drug Administration have been unduly influenced by politicians.â He also hopes their reassurance will persuade more African Americans - who have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus - to take part in vaccine trials.  The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level for the UK should be increased to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"", the UK's chief medical officers have said. The move comes as the number of cases of coronavirus continues to rise, with experts warning that theUK could see 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October without further action. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland confirmed that all four nations of the UK should move to Level 4. The statement said: ""After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations. ""If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the NHS and other health services over the autumn and winter everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly. ""We know this will be concerning news for many people; please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this."" Read morehere. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris Some 81 primary schools have had to close because of cases Franceâs education ministry is changing the rules around coronavirus
cases in nurseries and primary schools in an attempt to keep more of them
open.  From Tuesday, classes will only be cancelled if
three or more children test positive for Covid-19. Until now, if even one child in a class tested positive for coronavirus,
all his or her classmates would have to self-isolate.  That meant almost
2,000 classrooms standing empty across France at the start of this week,
and 81 primary schools completely closed. Under the rule changes,
classes with one case of coronavirus will continue as normal with the rest
of their pupils unless three children from different households all test
positive. Franceâs Public Health Council said last week that transmissions
were mainly occurring within families or at social gatherings outside
school premises. Teachers are obliged to wear masks, and Education
Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that the risk of transmission between
children was low. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster says that restrictions announced for certain local postcodes last week will now apply across NI as a whole from 18:00 BST on Tuesday. It means that people from different households cannot mix indoors unless they are in a social bubble. More than six people cannot meet outdoors. Mrs Foster says doing nothing was not an option but neither was returning to a full lockdown. Read morehere. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, responding to the health secretary in the Commons, said he welcomed the childcare lockdown exemptions and said he agreed that the country was at a ""perilous moment"". He said the tone of remarks from Matt Hancock on Sunday ""gave the impression he was blaming people for breaking the rules and allowing the virus to grow"". Mr Ashworth said: ""But the reality is people have done everything they have been asked to do. They have missed birthday celebrations, missed weddings, funerals. They have sent their children back to school, quite rightly, they have gone back to work. ""They did what they were asked to do. In return ministers were meant to fix test, trace and isolate so we could, in the words of his own government advert, get back to the things we love."" It's the afternoon here in London, but if you're joining us from the US - good morning. A lot has happened. To help you catch up, here's a summary of the latest US headlines. There has been an increase of 4,638 cases of coronavirus across the UK with 11 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. It takes the total number of deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the country to 41,788. The number of deaths reported at the start of the week tends to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Further restrictions are also being introduced in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston as well as in Bradford, Kirklees, and Calderdale, where residents are asked not to socialise outside their household or support bubble. The health secretary said: ""We know from experience local action can work when local communities come together to follow the rules, tackle the virus and keep themselves safe."" Mr Hancock said that the virus was increasing across the country and that ""we are at a tipping point"". He added the prime minister would address the House of Commons with any further action that needed to be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells MPs about some of the new measures which have come into force as part of local lockdowns in areas of England, including the North East. The local lockdown rules ban people from socialising with others outside of their own household or support bubble. Mr Hancock says he has heard concerns about the impact that has been having on childcare arrangements. ""Today I'm able to announce a new exemption,"" he says. People looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults are exempt from that ban, when it's necessary for caring purposes. He says it covers formal and informal arrangements for childcare - but not playdates or parties. ""A consistent childcare relationship is allowed,"" he said. There had beencalls for such an exemption last week- afterfamilies warned that peoplewould have no other choice to break the rules. Mr Hancock announced that stronger restrictions would be brought in from Tuesday in parts of Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington. He said: ""In the summer when the virus was in retreat we were able to relax some of the measures we had put in place, now the virus is spreading once more, I have to act."" The health secretary said there would be restrictions on hospitality and socialising, including hospitality venues closing from 22:00. He said the overall strategy was to protect education and employment as much as possible. Â© 2025 BBC.

Judge blocks US attempts to ban China's WeChatThe ban on the Chinese-owned messaging and payments apps was to come in on Sunday night.,"A judge has blocked a US government attempt to ban the Chinese messaging and payments app, WeChat. US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler said the ban raised serious questions related to the constitution's first amendment, guaranteeing free speech. The Department of Commerce had announced a bar on WeChat appearing in US app stores from Sunday, effectively shutting it down. The Trump administration has alleged it threatens national security. It says the app could pass user data to the Chinese government. Is the US about to split the internet? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat Both WeChat and China have strongly denied the claim. Tencent, the conglomerate that owns WeChat, had previously described the US ban as ""unfortunate"". The ruling comes just afterTikTok, which was also named in the Department of Commerce order, reached a deal with US firms Oracle and Walmartto hopefully allow them to keep operating. The case came to court after a group of US WeChat users challengedPresident Donald Trump's executive order,externalthat sought to shut WeChat down in the country. The US Justice Department argued that blocking the executive order would ""frustrate and displace the president's determination of how best to address threats to national security"". However Judge Beeler, sitting in San Francisco, noted that ""while the general evidence about the threat to national security related to China (regarding technology and mobile technology) is considerable, the specific evidence about WeChat is modest"". In a statement, the US Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saidthe decision to block the app was taken ""to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data"".,external The department said WeChat collected ""vast swathes of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories"". This video can not be played 'We are not happy with China' - US President Donald Trump Friday's statement from the commerce department said the governing Chinese Communist Party ""has demonstrated the means and motives to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the US"". Tencent, which owns WeChat, has said that messages on its app are private. WeChat is used by nearly 20 million people in the US - and pretty much exclusively by the Chinese and South East Asian diaspora. It is hard to describe how important it is in people's lives. It is not just an app, for many people WeChat IS their mobile phone. It is like Amazon, Facebook, WhatsApp, Tinder and much more, rolled into one. One Malaysian expat told me she would ""cry"" if the app was blocked. She told me her family had spent time showing her elderly mother how to use WeChat - and worried she would be unable to communicate with her if the ban came into force. Interestingly though, we have not heard much from WeChat's owners - Tencent. Why? Well, Tencent is one of the biggest games companies in the world - and has a huge market in America. If President Trump were to go further and target that section of the business it would really sting. WeChat was set up in 2011. It is a multi-purpose app allowing users to send messages, make mobile payments and use local services. It has been described as an ""app for everything"" in China and has more than one billion monthly users. Like all Chinese social media platforms, WeChat must censor content the government deems illegal. In March,a report said WeChat was censoring key words about the coronavirus outbreakfrom as early as 1 January. But WeChat insists encryption means others cannot ""snoop"" on your messages, and that content such as text, audio and images are not stored on its servers - and are deleted once all intended recipients have read them.

"UK at 'critical point', top scientists to warn","The UK is at a ""critical point"" in the coronavirus pandemic and ""heading in the wrong direction"", the government's chief medical adviser will warn. Prof Chris Whitty believes the country is facing a ""very challenging winter period"" and is to hold a televised briefing at 11:00 BST. It comes after the prime minister spent the weekend considering whether to introduce further measures in England. On Sunday, a further 3,899 daily cases and 18 deaths were reported in the UK. The prime minister is understood to be considering a two-week mini lockdown in England - being referred to as a ""circuit breaker"" - in an effort to stemwidespread growth of the virus. He held a meeting at Downing Street on Sunday, along with Prof Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, to discuss possible measures. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the view from No 10 was that while doing nothing ""was not an option"", neither was a full national lockdown, and that whatever measures are imposed could be turned ""off and on"" throughout the winter. PM considers new measures amid second virus wave Can a 'circuit break' halt the second Covid wave?  Asked about reports of disagreements among cabinet ministers about whether or not to impose a second lockdown, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""A conversation, a debate, is quite proper and that is exactly what you'd expect. ""Everyone recognises there is a tension between... the virus and the measures we need to take, and the economy and ensuring people's livelihoods are protected."" He added it was ""very clear when you follow the data"" that the UK is ""at this tipping point where we may need to go further"". At the briefing later, Prof Whitty will be joined by the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, to present the latest data. Prof Whitty is expected to say: ""The trend in the UK is heading in the wrong direction and we are at a critical point in the pandemic. ""We are looking at the data to see how to manage the spread of the virus ahead of a very challenging winter period."" The two scientists are expected to explain how the virus is spreading and the potential scenarios as the winter approaches. They are also expected to share data on other countries who are experiencing a second wave, and explain how the UK could face similar situations. Commenting on the upcoming announcement, Mr Shapps said: ""I've heard their briefing and it is very stark."" Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance were the mainstays of the Downing Street press conferences when the virus was at its peak. So you can assume that their briefing on the latest data will not convey good news. The two men spent much of Sunday afternoon behind Downing Street's black door, poring over the data with the health secretary, the chancellor, senior officials and the prime minister himself. What has been concerning some of those inside No 10 are predictions that there could be a significant number of deaths a day from Covid by the end of next month unless further action is taken. Ministers agree that there should not be a full national lockdown, but there are tensions around the cabinet table over precisely which, more limited measures, to take. On Sunday, Mr Hancock said that with hospital admissions for the disease doubling ""every eight days or so"", further action was needed to prevent more deaths. He warned the country was facing a ""tipping point"", as the government considers further restrictions. ""If everybody follows the rules then we can avoid further national lockdown,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would support any new measures but warned that a second national lockdown was becoming more likely because the Test and Trace programme wasin a state of ""near collapse"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan saidhe would meet council leaders on Mondayand then recommend any London-specific measures to ministers. He believes the capital city may be just ""two or three days"" behind the hotspots of the North West and North East of England. More areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire and the Midlands, will face further local restrictions from Tuesday, takingthe number of people affected by increased local measures in the UK to around 13.5 million. The development comes as, nationally, daily case numbers approach the 5,000 new cases a day the UK saw in April, at the peak of the epidemic. However, back then, there was no mass testing so it is not known exactly how many cases there really were. Best estimates suggest there were actually around 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March. Over the weekend the government announced that people in England who refuse an order to self-isolatecould be fined up to Â£10,000 from 28 September. However, the government is facing resistance from some senior Conservative MPs who are concerned that ministers are imposing new coronavirus restrictions without giving Parliament a say. The Coronavirus Act 2020, which became law in March, gave the government wide-ranging powers in order to manage the pandemic. But Sir Graham Brady, who represents Tory backbenchers, said he would table an amendment which would require the government to put any new measures to a vote of MPs. Sir Grahamsaid ministers had ""got into the habit of ruling by decree""on the issue, citing the ""imposition"" of the rule of six limit on social gatherings. Meanwhile, Lady Hale, the former president of the Supreme Court, said Parliament had ""surrendered"" control to ministers during the pandemic,in an essay seen by the Guardian.,external LITTLE MIX: THE SEARCH:Coming soon - a brand new show to solve your entertainment needs HOW CAN I RELAX?:Soothe your soul with Mindful Escapes Hancock: Follow Covid rules or they will get tougher PM considers new measures amid second virus wave Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Virtual Emmy Awards kick off in Los Angeles,"This video can not be played Schitt's Creek wins first of six awards at the Emmys Schitt's Creek, Succession and Watchmen were the big winners at this year's Emmy Awards, which were held virtually amid the coronavirus pandemic. Schitt's Creek won nine prizes - breaking the Emmys record for most wins in a single season for a comedy. It was a glowing send-off for the Canadian series, which broadcast its sixth and final season this year. Succession took home the night's top prize, best drama series, as well as best actor for Jeremy Strong. The HBO series also won prizes in the drama categories for best writing and best directing during the virtual ceremony.

Eugene Levy received his best comedy actor award from a presenter in a hazmat suit Another HBO series, Watchmen, won best limited series, as well as acting gongs for its stars Regina King and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Zendaya, 24, became the youngest ever winner of best drama actress for her performance in Euphoria, a teen drama which follows a group high school students as they grapple with issues of love, sex, drugs and identity. It was a significantly lower-key event this year, with most winners dialling in to make their acceptance speeches from home. Jimmy Kimmel hosted the show, with the nominees dialling in from home The ceremony was presented from an eerily empty Staples Center in Los Angeles by comedian Jimmy Kimmel, with only a few guest presenters joining him in the studio. Schitt's Creek won the best comedy series prize, with the show's creators, father and son Eugene and Daniel Levy, picking up best comedy actor and best supporting comedy actor respectively. Catherine O'Hara was named best comedy actress, with Annie Murphy winning best supporting actress in a comedy series. The show, which is on Netflix in the UK, follows the wealthy Rose family, who are forced to move to a motel in a small town after losing their fortune.

Schitt's Creek 'normalises LGBTQ relationships' Zendaya makes history and spreads 'hope in young people' Friends stars reunite and 6 other highlights from the 'Pandemmys' ""Our show, at its core, is about the transformational effects of love and acceptance, and that is something we need more of now than we've ever needed before,"" said Dan Levy as he accepted the prize for best comedy series. Paying tribute to his son, Eugene Levy added: ""I want to thank this young man who took our fish-out-of-water story and transformed it into a story of inclusivity, a castigation of homophobia, and a declaration of the power of love, so thank you Daniel."" Regina King wore a T-shirt with a picture of Breonna Taylor Zendaya beat stiff competition from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Laura Linney and Olivia Colman in her category. Regina King was named best actress in a limited series for her performance in Watchmen. ""This is freakin' weird!"" joked the star as the Emmy was presented to her at her home. In her acceptance speech, she paid tribute to US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died over the weekend, and encouraged viewers to register vote in the forthcoming presidential election. King wore a T-shirt bearing the image of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot and killed by police in Kentucky in March. Uzo Aduba, who won best supporting actress in a limited series for Mrs America, also wore a shirt displaying Taylor's name during her speech. King's co-star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was also named best supporting actor for his performance in the show. Watchmen, an innovative reimagining of a superhero graphic novel that tackled racism in America, scored the most nominations this year.

The key winners and nominees Several winners used their acceptance speeches to encourage Americans to register to vote in November's election, including Mark Ruffalo, who won best actor in a limited series for I Know This Much Is True. ""Get out and vote, and vote for love and compassion and kindness,"" the Hollywood star said. After the huge success of Fleabag in 2019, this year's ceremony was a disappointing night for British and Irish talent. Olivia Colman, Jodie Comer, Brian Cox, Jeremy Irons, Helena Bonham Carter and Paul Mescal all ended up empty handed in their respective acting categories. 11 - Watchmen 9 - Schitt's Creek 7 - Succession 7 - The Mandalorian 6 - RuPaul's Drag Race 6 - Saturday Night Live Includes Creative Arts Emmys This year marked Kimmel's third time hosting the Emmys, after he fronted the ceremony in 2012 and 2016.
