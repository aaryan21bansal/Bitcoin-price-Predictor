West Belfast residents take Casement Park legal action,"Planning permission for the 34,500-capacity stadium was granted in July A west Belfast residents' group has confirmed it is taking legal action to try to stop plans to build a new stadium at Casement Park. The Mooreland and Owenvarragh Residents Association is attempting to overturnplanning permission granted in July. A 34,500-capacity Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) stadium is planned. The residents' group succeeded ina legal challenge against a previous plan to build a bigger stadium, with a 38,000 capacity, in 2014. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon announced in July the completion of the planning process for the latest proposed stadium. Her department is aware it is now facing a legal challenge. ""The department has received leave papers on behalf of Mooreland and Owenvarragh Residents Association in respect of the decision to grant planning permission for Casement Park,"" a Department of Infrastructure spokesperson said. ""Judicial review proceedings are ongoing."" The residents' group circulated a letter to people living in the vicinity of the proposed stadium outlining its concerns about the granting of planning permission. The letter states: ""We believe it is flawed to the point of being unlawful. ""For that reason, we sought legal advice regarding the minister's decision. Our legal advisors have identified various grounds on which to challenge the legality of the decision."" The letter describes the proposed stadium as ""over-sized"" and states that a judicial review is the only way to stop it being built. The GAA had been hoping that work on the new stadium could be completed by summer 2024. The legal challenge could potentially delay or scupper the project. If the project survives the legal challenge, it is not clear yet exactly how it will be funded asthe new stadium is expected to cost much more than the original estimate. In July, First Minister Paul Givan suggested the final bill could be more than Â£140m. The original estimate was Â£77.5m. The redevelopment of Casement Park is part of a sports investment plan which began a decade ago, involving upgrades to the Ulster Rugby ground at Ravenhill and Windsor Park football stadium.

Facebook's new name ridiculed by Hebrew speakers,"Facebook announced the company's name change on Thursday Facebook's announcement that it is changing its name to Meta has caused quite the stir in Israel where the word sounds like the Hebrew word for ""dead"". To be precise, Meta is pronounced like the feminine form of the Hebrew word. A number of people have taken to Twitter to share their take on the name under the hashtag #FacebookDead. The emergency rescue volunteers Zaka even got involved, telling their followers on Twitter: ""Don't worry, we're on it"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here are a few examples of when things got lost in translation. When KFC arrived in China during the 80s, its motto ""finger lickin' good"" didn't exactly go down well with the locals. The motto's translation in Mandarin was ""eat your fingers off"". But it didn't harm the company too much. KFC is one of the largest fast food chains in the country. The phrase 'finger lickin' good' did not translate well in Mandarin Rolls-Royce changed the name of its Silver Mist car as mist translates as ""excrement"" in German. The car was named Silver Shadow instead. Meanwhile when Nokia released its Lumia phone in 2011, it didn't exactly get the reaction it was expecting. In Spanish, Lumia is a synonym for a prostitute, although it apparentlyonly appears in dialects with a heavy Gypsy (Roma) influence,external. Honda however had a lucky escape. It almost named its new car the Fitta, which is a vulgar description for vagina in Swedish. It apparently did not translate well in a number of other languages.

Bin strikes during COP26 suspended after pay offer,"Threatened bins strikes during the COP26 climate summit have been called off after a Â£48m offer to unions. The planned walk out by council staff in Glasgow and across Scotland is now suspended while unions consult members. Local authority body Cosla proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a Â£1,062 increase for all staff earning below Â£25,000. The deal is understood to involve Â£30m from the Scottish government and Â£18.5m from local government. Members of GMB, Unison and Unite unions have been asked to vote on whether to accept the offer. Strikes and disruption during COP26 climate summit Rail strike action during COP26 called off Bus strike called off after pay deal agreed GMB had planned a week-long strike beginning for cleansing and refuse staff on Monday, the first full day of the UN climate change summit. Glasgow City Council previously urged the workers to think again about causing disruption during a ""busy and difficult time"" for the city. About 120 world leaders and 25,000 delegates would have been presented with a city where 1,500 council staff in refuse, cleansing, school janitorial and catering roles were on strike.

The GMB, along with the Unison and Unite unions, called for a Â£2,000 pay rise and previously rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 from local authority umbrella body Cosla. Bin strikes during COP26 were threatened after Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken was criticised for saying the city needed a ""spruce up"" before the conference. Drew Duffy, of GMB Scotland, said the union would hold a two-week consultation from Monday 1 November, and had agreed to suspend strike action during this time. ""While we are pleased that more money for key workers has been found at the 11th hour, the fact it's taken to the brink of the COP to get this offer speaks volumes to our members,"" he said. The GMB previously denied workers were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip but said staff had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their efforts during the pandemic. Mr Duffy toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime: ""We have been trying to get a negotiated settlement on this for 10 months now and got nowhere and it has taken COP26, it's taken the international world and it's taken the refuse workers of Glasgow through their social media campaign, the pressure they've put on to actually force politicians to finally recognise the work they do. ""Our working-class members have decided to use an international event to highlight the work they do because they are fed up of being disrespected and undervalued by the government."" He added: ""It worked."" Unison, which represents school cleaners, school caterers, school janitors, waste, recycling and fleet maintenance service workers, has suspended five days of strike action across Scotland while members are consulted. Johanna Baxter, from Unison Scotland, said: ""This improved pay offer rightly puts more money into the pockets of those on the lowest pay - it is just disappointing that Unison members had to threaten to go on strike for their employer to recognise their worth."" She said told BBC Scotland the issue was ""bigger than COP26"". ""This is a national dispute and we, between the three trade unions, secured legal mandate for industrial action in half of local authority areas,"" she said. She said that ""demonstrated how fed-up members were with the Scottish government and Cosla treating them like the poor relations of the public sector"" and added that the ""endemic low pay"" meant 55% of local government workers earned less than Â£25,000 per year. Chris Mitchell said the GMB knew the Â£2,000 pay increase was ""not going to be achievable"" Chris Mitchell, GMB convenor for refuse and cleansing, said the union had asked for a Â£2,000 flat rate ""across the board for everybody"", but knew it was ""not going to be achievable"". He said workers had expected to be offered something in the region of Â£1,200 to Â£1,300. ""We are open to all negotiations because at the end of the day it's our members who will decide to accept or reject,"" he added. A spokesman for Cosla said the offer had been agreed by council leaders, who ""acknowledged the dedication and work done by our workforce over the last 18 months and that is why they have explored every option to get to a position that allows this improved offer to be put to the trade unions today"". Councillor Gail Macgregor, Cosla's resources spokesperson said:  ""We are pleased that as a result of this improved offer our trade union colleagues have notified us this afternoon that they will suspend strike action."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We welcome the news that the immediate prospect of strike action has been averted. ""Given that local authorities are the employers we were not party to negotiations but we supported the search for a solution with a one-off offer of additional funding of Â£30m. ""We recognise and respect that union processes must now proceed but we hope that today's progress heralds a formal agreement."" The strike is not the first to be announced for the COP26 summit, when the eyes of the world will be on the city. Another strike which threatened to cripple rail services in Scotland was called off on Wednesday after the RMT accepted a pay deal. The union said the offer would provide workers with a one-year 2.5% pay rise, improved conditions and a Â£300 COP payment for all ScotRail staff. A planned strike by Stagecoach bus workers in the west of Scotland was cancelled on Monday, also after a reaching a deal on pay. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Queen advised to rest for two more weeks,"The Queen has been advised by doctors to rest for two further weeks and will not undertake official visits during this time, Buckingham Palace has said. The palace said the monarch, 95, could undertake some light duties during that time, including virtual audiences. It said it is her ""firm intention"" to attend the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph on 14 November. The Queen underwent preliminary medical checks in hospital on 20 October after cancelling a visit to Northern Ireland. Who gives the Queen medical advice? Queen will miss COP26 climate summit In pictures: The Queen's busy October She resumed public engagements on Tuesday this week by meeting ambassadors via video link from Windsor Castle. But it was announced that she will not attend the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow. The palace said she would deliver her address to delegates using a recorded video message instead. She recorded the speech on Friday afternoon. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""The doctors have advised that Her Majesty can continue to undertake light, desk-based duties during this time, including some virtual audiences, but not to undertake any official visits. ""Her Majesty regrets that this means she will be unable to attend the Festival of Remembrance on Saturday, November 13."" The commemorative event takes place in the presence of members of the royal family at the Royal Albert Hall every year. The Queen was seen using a walking stick at a Westminster Abbey service recently The Queen hosted a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on 19 October. The next day a spokesman said a planned trip to Northern Ireland had been cancelled, and the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". Then, in a later statement, Buckingham Palace said she had stayed in hospital on Wednesday night after attending for ""some preliminary investigations"" and had returned the following day to Windsor Castle, where she was ""in good spirits"". Her stay at King Edward VII's Hospital was her first overnight hospital stay in eight years The sovereign had maintained a typically busy schedule in October but was recently seen using a walking stick at a Westminster Abbey service, the first time she has done so at a major event. A ""sensible precaution"" is the message from the palace, but officials know that concerns will deepen as a result of the third in a series of cancellations - the withdrawal from a service of commemoration in Northern Ireland last week, the withdrawal from COP26 this week, and now this. And yet, and yet, the Queen has carried out three ""virtual"" engagements in the last three days and she certainly seemed to enjoy them, at times smiling broadly. She is far from incapacitated. Indeed she is not what many would think of as unwell. Fatigue, not illness, seems to be the issue. What's really notable about this announcement is the absolute determination to attend the Remembrance Sunday service in Whitehall. It is the most important day in her calendar. It is also, for a 95-year-old, a fair amount of standing on what can be a bitterly cold day. She will want her strength. So she is taking it a little bit easy in the run up.

Strikes and disruption during COP26 climate summit,"Kelvingrove Museum and other attractions will be closed throughout the conference Scotland is hosting thousands of delegates for the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. But they face a city where tourist attractions are closed, rail services are cancelled and cleaners and refuse collectors are out on strike. About 120 world leaders are expected to attend the United Nations summit, which runs from 31 October to 12 November. What is the impact on the city itself, during talks that could bring major change for lives across the world? The summit is based at the SEC campus in the centre of Glasgow Glasgow's main tourist attractions are closed to the public for the duration of the summit, which is hosted at the city's SEC campus. The Riverside Museum, Kelvingrove Museum, Gallery of Modern Art and others venues are all affected as some staff are moved to work on the city's COP26 team. Glasgow Life, which runs culture and leisure venues for the city council, said this was necessary to support the delivery of the conference. Venue closures Riverside Museum:23 October to 15 November Gallery of Modern Art:31 October to 14 November Kelvingrove Museum:28 October to 14 November Kelvin Hall:28 October to 1 November People's Palace:Ongoing closure for ""essential maintenance"" The Emirates Arena sports venue remains open, but it is expected to be busy as areas are used for COP26 delivery. A Glasgow Life spokeswoman said: ""The significance of COP26 means that, inevitably, there will be an impact on how the city operates during the event. ""In supporting the delivery of COP26 activity, a small number of Glasgow Life venues will be closed to the public, either for part of or the duration of the conference. ""Across the wider venues we have reopened, it is our intention to minimise disruption and operate business as usual as far as possible."" Unions are urging council staff to strike in an ongoing pay dispute About 1,500 Glasgow City Council staff in refuse, cleansing, school janitorial and catering roles confirmed they wouldstrike over an ongoing pay dispute. A joint trade union group, including Unison, Unite and the GMB, is seeking a Â£2,000 pay increase from Scotland's local authority umbrella body Cosla. They are calling on staff to take ""targeted"" strike action during the second week of the summit. Cosla has offered an Â£850 flat rate rise for the lowest paid staff and 2% for those paid less than Â£40,000 a year. Wendy Dunsmore, of Unite, said: ""The incredible professionalism and sacrifice by local government workers has not been recognised during the Covid-19 pandemic."" Johanna Baxter, of Unison, said more than half of local government workers earned under Â£25,000 a year and many were at ""breaking point"". The call for industrial action came as council leader Susan Aitken wascriticised for the mess of the cityahead of the climate conference. ScotRail staff are set to strike and bring disruption to train services Rail workers said they would strike during the UN summit, in a separate dispute over pay and conditions - but action was called off after the RMT accepted a pay deal. The union initially said members who work for ScotRail would strike from Monday 1 November until Friday 12 November. However days before the summit began,RMT members agreed to the offerwhich they would provide them with a one year 2.5% pay rise, improved conditions and a Â£300 COP payment for all ScotRail staff. It brings an end to strikes that have been ongoing since March. COP26 delegates have been encouraged to travel by train to reach the SEC conference venue, which is served by its own station, Exhibition Centre. Staff on the Caledonian Sleeper will holdfour 24-hour strikes,external. These are on Sunday 31 October, Monday 1 November, Thursday 11 November and Friday 12 November. Many roads in the city have also been closedfrom Saturday 23 October until Monday 15 November. Transport Scotland warned drivers to avoid the SEC area and expect delays on the M8 as this will be the main route for delegates travelling to the summit. The area around the SEC site will see the greatest impact. More than 9,000 people living in Glasgow's Finnieston, Anderston and Yorkhill areas are affected by road closures, parking restrictions and security measures. The Glasgow Gaelic School will be closed for two days during COP26 Five schools near the SEC site will be closed in Glasgow on 1 and 2 November due to road restrictions impacting travel. The closures affect the Glasgow Gaelic School - which has a nursery, primary and secondary - Anderston Primary, Cranstonhill Nursery, St Patrick's Primary and the adjoining Sandyford Day Nursery. Glasgow City Council has notified the families of the children affected, outlining ""alternative learning"" arrangements. A council spokeswoman said: ""We apologise for any inconvenience to families, but we feel that our children's learning will be better spent at home on these days instead of potentially being stuck on a long journey to and from school.""

PM fears EU-UK trade deal breach over fishing row,"Boris Johnson says he fears the EU-UK trade agreement may have been breached in a dispute with France over post-Brexit fishing rights. It comes after France said it could stop UK boats landing in its ports if the row over licences was not resolved. The prime minister said the UK government would do ""whatever is necessary to ensure UK interests"". The French president said the fishing row and disputes over Northern Ireland were a test of the UK's credibility. The argument - essentially over how many French fishing boats are allowed to fish in UK waters - began when the UK and Jersey denied fishing licences to dozens of French boats last month. Mr Johnson said: ""British fishermen should be confident in going about their lawful business and they should be encouraged to continue fishing in accordance with the [EU-UK trade] agreement. ""France is one of our oldest, closest allies and friends. The ties that bind us together are far stronger than the turbulence that currently exists in the relationship."" French President Emmanuel Macron told theFinancial Times,external: ""Make no mistake, it is not just for the Europeans but all of their partners. Because when you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility."" The leaders' comments come ahead of a ""brush by"" meeting they are expected to have at the G20 summit in Rome this weekend. Meanwhile, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says she has seen a letter which appears to show the French prime minister Jean Castex appealing to the EU to demonstrate there is ""more damage to leaving the EU than to remaining there"". Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? How serious is summoning the French ambassador? France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to French boats, arguing it a breach of the Brexit deal. The country then warned it would block British boats from landing their catches in some French ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute was not resolved by Tuesday. On Friday morning, Environment Secretary George Eusticesaid if necessary the UK would respond in turn, saying ""two can play at that game"". The government also said it was considering launching ""dispute settlement proceedings"" with the EU if France goes ahead with the ""unjustified measures"". Earlier, French ambassador Catherine Colonna was summoned to a meeting with foreign office minister Wendy Morton. At the meeting - which lasted around 15 minutes - Ms Morton ""expressed disappointment over the confrontational language that has been consistently used by the French government, which makes this situation no easier to resolve."" The French people are deeply attached to their fishing industry, suspicious of the British government, and share the general confusion about why some French boats are being given licences and others refused. They take at face value their own government's claim that it is all grossly unfair, and that the planned retaliation against the UK is simply a defence of the national interest. Which is not to say there aren't also worried voices urging caution. The big fish and seafood traders based in Boulogne-sur-Mer depend heavily on British produce either unloaded at the quayside or brought in by lorry. If those imports dry up, hundreds of jobs could be at stake - not to mention the valuable Christmas market for coquille saint-jacques and other shellfish. It's commonplace in the UK to hear that by acting tough President Macron is merely playing to the gallery with an eye on next April's presidential elections. And it's commonplace in France to hear that Boris Johnson is merely playing to his political gallery by baiting the oh-so-baitable French. Suffice to say that right now neither side seems particularly inclined to do the other any favours. Fishing was one of the final sticking points in the post-Brexit trade agreement. As part of the agreement, licences would be given to vessels that could show they had fished in each other's waters for years. But there have been disputes about how much evidence is needed. The UK says this was the case for the rejected applications which sparked the latest row. The UK has also been seeking to change the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland - known as the protocol - because it says it is affecting trade, businesses and has led to a ""brewing political crisis"". Tensions rose after a British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday. French authorities say the Cornelis Gert Jan vessel did not have a licence - something the boat's owners deny. The captain of the scallop dredger faces a court hearing in August next year. The UK environment secretary said the trawler had been granted a licence earlier this year and the government was ""trying to get to the bottom"" of why it had subsequently been taken off the list given to the EU. Andrew Brown, from the boat's owners Macduff Shellfish, said: ""We don't know where the error of interpretation of the licence lies... but I would believe that under normal circumstances a misunderstanding like this could be sorted out with a phone call.""

Wife guilty of murdering husband in dinner row,"David Jackson was stabbed at his home on 13 February A woman has been found guilty of murder after stabbing her husband to death following a row over a birthday meal. Penelope Jackson, 66, attacked 78-year-old David Jackson with a kitchen knife at their home in Somerset in February. Jackson claimed her husband was violent and coercively controlling and that he had ""ruined"" her special occasion by belittling her. At Bristol Crown Court she was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 18 years. Jurors found her guilty by a majority verdict of 10-2 after almost 11 hours of deliberation. The calculated murder sparked by bubble and squeak She stabbed Mr Jackson, her fourth husband, three times with a kitchen knife at their home in Berrow. The killing followed a row over a serving of bubble and squeak with a gourmet meal bought for them by their daughter. Penelope Jackson was David Jackson's third wife. She claimed he was coercive, controlling and physically violent The pair had eaten the meal with their daughter and son-in-law, Isabelle and Tom Potterton, on a Zoom call as the birthday took place in lockdown. Mr and Mrs Potterton told the court they believed the row had blown over before the call ended. But later, Mr Jackson called the emergency services after he had been wounded, and his wife stabbed him again while he was on the phone. This video can not be played Murder accused tells police 'I stabbed him, I've had enough' He was heard screaming in pain as she drove the knife into him for the final time. Jackson then took over the call, saying: ""I've killed my husband, or tried to, because I've had enough."" She then told a call handler her husband of 24 years was ""bleeding to death with any luck"". And in bodyworn footage, released by the police when they went to the couple's home on 13 February, she told officers ""I stabbed him, I've had enough"" and that she ""should have stabbed him a bit more"". Mrs Potterton said ""my whole world fell away from my feet"" when police knocked on her door to tell her what had happened. ""I had not only lost my dad but I had lost my mum too. My life was changed forever,"" she said. ""I have lost the man that I looked up to and loved. I have lost the man that was always there for me no matter what,"" she added. She said she still loved her mother but that their relationship would never be the same. ""I have lost the woman who always knew how to make me feel better. Yes I know mum is here but she's not the same person I knew,"" said Ms Potterton. The murder was committed inside the home where the couple lived in the coastal village of Berrow in Somerset Her husband Tom said he could never forgive Jackson for the pain she had caused his wife. ""This did not have to happen. It was a selfish act with no regard to how it may affect those who were close to yourself and David, you could have walked away but you chose not,"" he added. As he jailed Jackson, Judge Martin Picton said that she had shown ""not a shred of remorse"" for the killing and had sought to portray her husband as a ""monster"". ""Whilst there was no doubt, as in any marriage, points of friction that the lockdown would have exacerbated. I have no doubt that he was nothing like the person you have claimed. ""You took the life of another human being. That is a terrible thing to do and it represents a burden you and all the other family members will have to bear for the rest of their lives,"" he said. David Jackson's estranged daughter Jane Calverley accused the defendant of being the abuser in the relationship and that her father would never have asked for help because he would have been too proud to admit to being bullied and abused by his wife.

Bridges collapse as river level hits 50-year high,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows extent of Dumfries flooding Two historic footbridges have been washed away as water levels on the River Annan hit a 50-year high. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) recorded the figure at its Brydekirk station near Annan. The rail line between Dumfries and Carlisle has been shut for safety checks on a viaduct in the town. Four people also had to be rescued from premises on the Whitesands in Dumfries as heavy rains continued to hit southern Scotland. Two bridges were washed away over the River Annan as it rose to record levels A major incident was declared in Hawick on Thursday as water levels rose but police said it had now been stood down. Emergency services were called out early on Thursday evening to the Whitesands as the River Nith poured out across nearby car parks and roads. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service helped four people out of premises - they were all said to be safe and well. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather Some of the worst issues were suffered in Annan where two footbridges were washed away. Annandale South councillor Richard Brodie said the town was ""still in shock"" at the loss of the Diamond Jubilee Bridge and the Cuthbertson Memorial Bridge. ""They are so much a part of our DNA in the town, that it is essential that they are replaced as soon as possible,"" he said. Four people had to be taken to safety from properties in Dumfries The two bridges lost have allowed people to cross the River Annan for decades. The Diamond Jubilee Bridge was the older of the pair - built in 1897 to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne. The 19th century suspension bridge was a B-listed structure. The Cuthbertson Memorial Bridge dated back to 1957 to commemorate Lt William Cuthbertson but was dedicated to everyone from Annan who lost their lives in World War Two. Network Rail Scotland said the viaduct had been shut after the two bridges north of the railway had been washed away. It tweeted: ""We're unable to allow trains to pass over the Annan Viaduct pending a daylight safety inspection. ""The line between Dumfries and Carlisle will remain closed until further notice."" Divers will be needed to go and check the structure but they will be unable to do so until the flow of water in the area slows. Lucy Woods and Ayla Fudala had to take steps to protect their home Among those affected by the Dumfries flooding were Lucy Woods and Ayla Fudala. ""I had to go and lug 20 sandbags and meanwhile the rain kept coming down,"" said Ms Fudala. ""The water level kept getting higher and higher. ""We had to lift up the fridges and put them on chairs and the power went out for a while."" However, they also had one more pleasant surprise. ""Our roommate saw an otter swim down the street yesterday,"" said Ms Fudala. ""We saw an otter right outside our window - that was nice,"" added Ms Woods. A Met Office amber warning for rain was in place for much of southern Scotland earlier in the week anda yellow alert was in place until 15:00 on Friday.,external A number of fresh warnings have been issued for the coming days - one from midnight to noon on Saturday and another from 03:00 on Sunday until 06:00 on Monday.

Banks must not fund climate destruction - Thunberg,"This video can not be played Climate change activist Greta Thunberg says it is ""very unclear"" if she has been officially invited to the COP26 summit. Greta Thunberg has called on banks to ""stop funding our destruction"", ahead of the UN COP26 climate summit. The teenage Swedish climate activist is in London to take part in protests demanding the financial system stops funding fossil fuel projects. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr that ""change is possible"" at the summit, if pressure on politicians is maintained. But she added she has not been ""officially"" invited to speak at the event in Glasgow. The demonstrations against investment in fossil fuel projects come as world leaders gather in the Scottish city ahead of COP26's opening on Sunday. The protest in London is part of a series taking place on Friday at financial centres around the world, including New York, San Francisco and Nairobi. Campaigners are calling on banks not to lend money to companies and projects that use fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? COP26: Has Johnson got what it takes to get a deal? The COP26 conference will see more than 200 countries asked to set out their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The summit is seen as crucial if countries are to implement a pledge made in 2015 keep global warming ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. As the host country, the UK is under pressure to get them to make ambitious commitments to reduce the greenhouse gases they emit. Ms Thunbergconfirmed this weekshe will travel to Glasgow to join a ""climate strike"" taking place during the summit. But asked whether she had been asked to speak at the event, she replied: ""I don't know. It's very unclear. Not, like, officially."" In itsofficial summit programme,external, the UK said it wanted to ""elevate youth voices"" during a series of events arranged on one of the summit days alongside the UN's official youth climate arm. There will also be a discussion on the outcomes of September's Youth4Climate summit in Milan, where Ms Thunbergdelivered a speech in which she mocked politicians' use of climate slogans. The interview was recorded at the Natural History Museum, where the activist examined a newly discovered species of beetlenamed after her in 2019. The interview will be shown on Sunday's Andrew Marr Show on BBC One. Greta Thunberg joined activists protesting outside major banks in the City of London on Friday Matt Graveling, BBC News reporter Today's protest had a sense of community, with young activists from different countries converging on London ahead of COP26 and sharing their message on a communal mic. While today's protest was aimed at the banking industry's financial support of companies who mine fossil fuels, it also offered the first chance for different global movements to meet face-to-face, having previously only ever communicated online. Different groups told me that as young individuals they struggle to be recognised, but are optimistic that by joining forces their voice will now to be heard. Elsewhere in her interview, Ms Thunberg said poorer countries most affected by climate change should have a bigger presence at COP26. She added it was ""not fair"" that some nations would send ""lots and lots"" of delegates, while nations from the so-called Global South would be ""under-represented"". And she added that the talks would not succeed if the world ""continues to ignore"" the ""historical responsibility"" of industrialised countries to cut their carbon emissions. The United States is seen as a key player in the success of the summit, with President Joe Bidenarriving in Europe on Friday ahead of the event. His $1.75 trillion (Â£1.2tn) Build Back Better social welfare package includes more than $500bn of spending on green policies. Mr Biden has described the measures as historic - but Ms Thunberg called on the US to go further. Asked whether the US could be seen as a world leader on climate change, she replied: ""Of course, everyone has the possibility, but if they continue like now, no"". ""We all understand, activists, that this doesn't fall on one single person. ""But of course, when you are a leader of the most powerful country in the world, you have lots of responsibility. ""When the US is in fact expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, that is a clear sign that they are not really treating the climate crisis as an emergency.""

he Queen's busy October,"The Queen has been told by her doctors to rest for two weeks and only undertake light duties until mid-November. Earlier this month, she spent a night in hospital for some medical investigations - her first overnight hospital stay in eight years. But that followed a particularly busy few weeks of public engagements across the UK for the 95-year-old monarch. The Queen began the month at her Balmoral Estate in Scotland, where she helped to plant a tree with the Prince of Wales. The pair were promoting their campaign urging people across the UK to plant a tree ahead of the Platinum Jubilee next year. She and Prince Charles met primary school children during the event. Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, planted a tree with his mother for the Queen's Green Canopy campaign The monarch spoke with schoolchildren from Crathie Primary at the event The following day, the Queen was more than 100 miles away in Edinburgh forthe opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament. It was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. During her speech, she spoke of her deep affection for Scotland. A few days later, the Queen held audiences with diplomats from Belize and Greece over video call. The same day, she met members of the Canadian Army at Windsor Castle at an event to mark the 150th anniversary of the A and B batteries of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. She later had a telephone call with Boris Johnson. The Queen presented the Captain General's Sword to representatives of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery The Queen then travelled to Londonto attend the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relayat Buckingham Palace. It was her first major event at Buckingham Palace since the Covid pandemic began and she was joined by her youngest son, Prince Edward. The Queen placed a message in the baton, which will travel through 72 Commonwealth nations and territories ahead of the Games in 2022 A few days later she attended a church service at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion. Accompanied by the Princess Royal, she was seen using a walking stick as she arrived via the Poet's Yard entrance. The Westminster Abbey service was thought to be the first time the Queen had used a stick at a major public event The Queen welcomed pianist Dame Imogen Cooper to Buckingham Palace, presenting her with The Queen's Medal for Music for 2019. She also held three other audiences. The Queen's Medal for Music is awarded each year and 2019's went to English classical pianist Imogen Cooper The following day, the Queen travelled to Cardiff toopen the sixth term of the Senedd. It was her first visit to Wales in five years, and she praised the spirit of the Welsh people during the pandemic. While there,she was overheard appearing to sayshe was irritated by people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"" anything on climate change. A 21-gun salute in Cardiff Bay marked the Queen's arrival in the city By Saturday she was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire. The Queen has a lifelong love of horseracing The Queen held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand Dame Cindy Kiro. The governor-general's role is to act as the Queen's representative in New Zealand. On Tuesday she had two virtual audiences during the day with the Japanese ambassador and the EU ambassador. Then in the evening she was back at Windsor Castle hosting a reception for guests attending the Global Investment Summit, including billionaire business leaders like Microsoft's Bill Gates.

Who owns UK fishing rights?,"Fishing was one of the key sticking points in negotiations between the UK and the EU over their new trade agreement. The deal, which came into force on 1 January 2021,still allows EU boats to fish in UK waters for some years to comebut gives UK boats a greater share of the catch (or quota). The question of who has the right to fish in UK waters is further complicated by the fact that significant parts of the British quota have been sold off to foreign-owned boats, which sail under a British flag. Â£160m worth of England's fishing quota is in the hands of vessels owned by companies based in Iceland, Spain and the Netherlands, according to BBC research. That amounts to 130,000 tonnes of fish a year and 55% of the quota's annual value in 2019. Quotas are used by many countries to manage shared fish stocks. They determine how many fish of each species each country's fleets are allowed to catch. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) sets quotas among EU member states, and similar deals are negotiated with neighbouring countries. The Dutch owners of the Frank Bonefaas super-trawler own a fifth of England's fishing quota One of the priorities of the Fisheries Act,external, which became law on 24 November, is that ""fishing activities of UK fishing boats bring social or economic benefits to the United Kingdom"". Current rules say even if vessels are 100% foreign-owned, they must have an ""economic link"" to the UK. That means they must meet one of five conditions, which include landing more than half their catch at UK ports or having majority British crews. A consultation by the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra),external, which closed in November, outlined plans to ""increase the landing requirements from 50% to 70% for quota catch caught by English registered vessels landing more than 2 tonnes per annum"". The consultation stated that this change ""could result in up to Â£60m worth of additional landings each year"", but it did not mention any changes to rules around ownership. For many in the fishing industry Defra's proposals did not go far enough. ""If the government allows foreign companies to continue to own more than half of England's quota, it would be a calamity,"" said Paul Lines, from Fishing for Leave, a pro-Brexit group within the British fishing industry. Fishing for Leave wants to change the rules so all British fishing vessels must be ""60% British-owned; 60% British-crewed; (and must) land, process and sell 60% of their catches in Britain"". ""I would be absolutely over the moon if they bring an end to foreign ownership,"" added Mr Lines, ""but it would surprise me if the government followed through on this as it wasn't mentioned in the bill or in the consultation."" An EU source said British negotiators were at one point insisting that boats must be majority British-owned in order to take advantage of a larger catch in UK waters, but this proposal does not feature in the final text of the deal. ""It could be possible, though administratively difficult, for the government to re-allocate any newly-won quota to British-owned boats,"" says Dr Emma Cardwell from Nottingham Trent University. ""But it would be legally tricky to try and wrest existing UK quota from the ownership of foreign companies."" Many parts of the quota were sold by English fishermen in the 1990s when fishing rights were cut dramatically. Cod fishing, for instance, was almost entirely stopped for several years. Foreign companies then bought it up as a long-term investment, and experts say the quota market has been allowed to develop in an unregulated way ever since. ""There's a lack of clarity on the legal status of fishing rights,"" Dr Cardwell said, ""meaning the government is very vulnerable to litigation if it tries to reallocate quota. ""Any foreign fishing companies that purchased UK quota in good faith would be very likely to sue if this was now taken away from them."" As fishing is a devolved policy, the way the quota is managed differs around the UK. England and Wales, where a majority voted for Brexit, have both allowed foreign ownership of more than half their fishing quota. In Wales, which is allocated a tiny share of the UK quota, the figure is as high as 85% of the annual value - most of it held by one big industrial trawler. But in Scotland, which is responsible for about 60% of the UK quota, only 4% of the annual value in 2019 was in foreign hands. In Northern Ireland the figure was 2%. ""The Scottish fishing industry is largely made up of family-owned businesses,"" said Elspeth MacDonald, from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. ""These businesses have developed the industry during the good times and have had the desire and resolve to hold on through difficult times, when others have not."" The figures obtained by the BBC, in collaboration with the New Economics Foundation (NEF), reveal that a fifth of the annual value of the UK's overall quota is held by foreign-owned companies. The total annual value is just over Â£900m. Elsewhere in Europe the level of foreign ownership varies. In Belgium, the figure is just over a quarter, but other EU countries have much stricter rules. There is very little foreign ownership in France and Ireland for example, and in two countries outside the EU that have big fishing fleets - Iceland and Norway - there is no foreign ownership at all. The degree of confusion over foreign ownership of UK quota was highlighted by a ministerial response to a parliamentary question back in October. Victoria Prentis, the Fisheries Minister, admitted the Marine Management Organisation, the body responsible for English waters, ""does not hold data relating to the degree of foreign investment"".

Brexit and fishing explained,"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

Slow rise from ultra-low mortgage rates predicted,"Mortgage experts are expecting a ""slow and measured"" increase in the cost of home loans amid predictions of rising prices elsewhere. All eyes turn to the Bank of England which will consider next week whether to raise the base rate. Some mortgage lenders have raised their interest rates slightly, after a period of intense competition and ultra-low costs for borrowers. Official forecasters say the biggest mortgage rate rises will be in 2023. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's official, independent forecaster - said inflation (which measures the cost of living) was likely to speed up to 4% next year. In response, it predicted a rise in the Bank rate next year, and the year after, from its current record low of 0.1%. It said the Bank rate would not be expected to breach the 1% mark, although it could go as high as 3.5% if inflation went above 5%. Surge in house prices predicted to slow Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Will mortgage costs go up? and other Budget questions Such a change would generally feed through to the interest rates experienced by householders, meaning the cost of mortgages would rise, but returns on savings could get better too. ""Whether base rate rises or not, mortgage rates have started edging upwards as the markets have already priced in a rate rise, and possibly two or three more by the end of next year,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. Simon Gammon, managing partner at Knight Frank Finance, said: ""The market is now alive with talk that interest rates are set to rise and all signs suggest the best products available are on borrowed time. ""Though any hikes are likely to be slow and measured, this is the lowest mortgage costs are likely to be for some time."" Some 74% of mortgage holders are on fixed-rate deals, so would only see a change in their repayments when their current term ends Of the remainder, 850,000 homeowners are on tracker deals, which usually move in line with Bank rate changes The other 1.1 million are on standard variable rates, often because they have been automatically moved at the end of their fixed deal term. The rate of interest they pay can been changed at any time by their lender, as is often the case if the Bank rate is altered Were there to be a 0.25 percentage point rise in rates, this would translate to approximately an additional Â£26 per month mortgage payment on average for a tracker rate customer and Â£16 for the typical borrower on an SVR Source: UK Finance Competition in the mortgage market has been intense, particularly in recent months. That has led to historically low mortgage rates. Newly published figures from the Bank of England show that the effective interest rate typically paid on newly drawn mortgages fell slightly to 1.78% in September. There has also been an improvement for first-time buyers unable to offer much in terms of a deposit to mortgage lenders, according to Rachel Springall, of financial information service Moneyfacts. She said competition was still rife, despite ""murmurings of a base rate rise"". ""Away from headline-grabbing low rates, we have also seen notable improvements on deals for those with a low deposit this month, whereas last year, borrowers would have found it hard to find a deal as lenders pulled them due to coronavirus,"" she said. Andrew Montlake, managing director of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: ""It does now look like the era of ridiculously low rates is coming to an end, but we must remember that we are still in a low-price environment overall. ""As the Bank of England weighs up whether to finally raise the rate of interest themselves, there is now a whole generation of borrowers who have never experienced a rate rise of any kind.""

UK warns France it could retaliate in fishing row,"This video can not be played George Eustice on post-Brexit fishing row with France: ""Two can play at that game"" The UK could respond in turn if France goes ahead with threats amid a row over post-Brexit fishing rights, Environment Secretary George Eustice has said, warning ""two can play at that game"". France said it could stop UK boats landing in its ports if the row over licences was not resolved by Tuesday. The UK government warned it could start ""rigorous"" checks on EU fishing activities in response. Meanwhile, the French ambassador has left the Foreign Office after talks. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she asked one of her ministers to summon ambassador Catherine Colonna to the Foreign Office ""to explain the disappointing and disproportionate threats made against the UK and Channel Islands"". Ms Colonna left the building in Whitehall just over 20 minutes after she arrived. Boris Johnson will also have a ""brush by"" meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the G20 summit in Rome this weekend, the prime minister's spokesman said. He added that France remained a ""close and strong ally"" to the UK. A British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday. French authorities say the detained Cornelis Gert Jan vessel did not have a licence - a claim denied by the boat's owner Macduff Shellfish of Scotland. But the European Union said the UK authorities withdrew the licence on 1 March. The captain of the scallop dredger will face a court hearing in August next year, French authorities said on Friday. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said No 10 sources were ""amazed and concerned"" at the escalating fishing row, describing the developments in recent days as ""extraordinary"". Ministers met on Thursday to discuss the situation and are understood to be considering a ""range of options"" to retaliate. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? How serious is summoning the French ambassador? Four ambassadors on what it is like being summoned France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to dozens of French boats to access British waters, and argued that this breached the Brexit deal. The country has warned it would block British boats from landing their catches in some French ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. Brexit minister Lord Frost said the EU would be in breach of the UK-EU post-Brexit agreement if France were to disrupt UK fisheries, wider trade or energy supplies after Tuesday. And ministers are considering launching ""dispute settlement proceedings"" with the EU if France goes ahead with the ""unjustified measures"", a government spokesman said. Mr Eustice told the BBC only a ""small number of vessels"" did not qualify for licences ""because they have never accessed Jersey waters before"". He said the UK had an ""ever open door"" and the government would wait to see what decision is made by Tuesday, after which the UK ""reserved the right to respond in a proportionate way"". Asked about the claim by France's Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, that the only language Britain understands was ""the language of force"", Mr Eustice said: ""That is completely inflammatory and is the wrong way to go about things."" He added: ""For now, we're not going to respond in the way that France has, we're going to raise this with the commission and we're going to raise it through diplomatic channels with the French ambassador but we'll reserve our right to do more things if France continue to press ahead with these threats."" The environment secretary suggested France was politicising the process of checking vessels. ""There obviously is an election coming up in France, it may be that is a factor in this,"" he said. Mr Eustice said the detained trawler had been granted a licence at the beginning of the year and the government was ""trying to get to the bottom"" of why it had subsequently been taken off the list given to the European Union. He said the boat may have made some changes to its engine which meant the licence had to be renewed. Andrew Brown, from the boat's owners Macduff Shellfish, said: ""We don't know where the error of interpretation of the licence lies, that will take some time to fix. ""But I would believe that under normal circumstances a misunderstanding like this could be sorted out with a  phone call."" By summoning the French ambassador, the government is expressing its significant concern over the fishing dispute in a very public way. This is not something allies do very often and this form of diplomatic dressing down is normally reserved for governments with whom the UK has a less amicable relationship, such as China or Iran. But equally, this is also a calibrated response by the Foreign Office - the ambassador is meeting only a junior minister. It would have been a greater escalation if Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had chosen to see the ambassador, Catherine Colonna, herself. And as diplomatic contretemps go, this is quite measured in comparison to a recent dispute over nuclear submarines when France actually recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the United States. Read more from Jameshere. StÃ©phanie Yon-Courtin, a French MEP and member of the EU Fisheries Committee, accused the UK government and Channel Islands authorities of not respecting the trade agreement they signed with the EU, saying it was ""up to the UK government to de-escalate the situation"". Under the Brexit deal, it was agreed that licences would be given to vessels that could show they had fished in each other's waters for years, although there have been disputes about how much evidence is needed. The UK maintains the rejected applications that sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show the boats had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island.

Kuenssberg: Has Johnson got what it takes to get a deal?,"It wasn't really meant to happen. The snappily titled Conference of the Parties, this mammoth environmental, political and diplomatic shindig, or COP26 as it's known, wasn't destined to be held in the UK. One insider told me ""the whole thing was a mistake"". Another said: ""It was definitely a quirk"". When prospective host Italy seemed to be humming and hawing over it, the cabinet minister at the time, Claire Perry, spotted an opportunity to grab it for the UK. Downing Street wasn't necessarily convinced, the Treasury was said to be even less charitable about the prospect, but one insider suggests: ""One B. Johnson, then foreign secretary, thought the idea for the UK to host such a big event after Brexit would be marvellous."" Glasgow was chosen because the government wanted the opportunity to ""plant Union Jacks and display some of the advantages of the Union"" by bringing a massive international event to Scotland. Given that the conference only ended up in the UK as a twist of fate, will the government end up being delighted it took the chance or regretting the gamble? Getting nearly 200 different countries to actually agree on anything is, politely, a tricky challenge. The choreography of such an event is dizzying. The etiquette of COP meetings is unusual. Rows are likely. Walkouts are possible. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. One insider who has participated in previous COP events recalls a meeting where the attendees spent half an hour arguing over whether to designate the particular session as ""informal"" or ""formal"" while the shouts and chants of protestors outside could be heard in the room, threatening to drown them out. This time, one source told me, there could be as many as 300 delegates in the same room, all entitled to have their say. The idea of trying to reach an agreement with that many people seems mind boggling. Don't be surprised if even the first day is spent in a massive bun fight over agreeing what is on the actual agenda. COP is designed to be inclusive so that everyone taking part can put forward ideas or issues for discussion. That might feel like the right and proper thing to do, but it doesn't make for rapid or straightforward deal making. And there will be moments where it feels like the summit is all going wrong even if the final conclusions are a triumph. Having spotted the political opportunity a long time ago, however, the government is obviously massively eager to show that the meetings end in success. Pope calls for radical action on climate change Schwarzenegger angered by world climate policies Poll shows rising demand for climate action Let's face it, while the awareness of climate change and public concern is much higher than it used to be, public and political understanding of all the complexities is not deep or wide. One opinion polling source told me ""COP is literally not on anyone's radar"". But inside government, there is intense focus on what will happen and there are yardsticks by which ministers will measure success. Protesters are seeking to focus politicians' mind on the main message For the government, the broad aim is covered by the catchphrase to ""keep 1.5C alive"", that is to get a deal that limits increases in the world's temperature to 1.5 degrees, the threshold scientists want to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change. The hard part for Boris Johnson is that, as you might imagine, it's an awful lot harder than just flicking a switch. The plan to achieve that aim is made up of three main parts. First, what does each country plan to do about climate change? Have they promised to become ""net zero"" at home by the middle of the century? That is, to take out as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as they put in it. And, thirdly, whether they have committed to net zero, or a date, or not what are their own targets for cutting emissions? Downing Street is hopeful that more countries will make stronger commitments before the summit gets under way. If big powerful countries that produce lots of greenhouse gases, like China or India, come forward with measly plans, that creates an obvious first big problem. That's why one official suggests the biggest factor in this whole discussion is ""when do China's emissions peak?"". Then there is the question of cold, hard, cash. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney is working on financial solutions For years, rich, developed countries have meant to be helping the most vulnerable protect themselves from the worst effects of climate change, and to make their economies greener. But guess what, when it comes to shelling out billions, you won't be surprised that the conversations get tricky. The challenge is to work out who is responsible for what and when. In the words of one insider: ""The core of COP is a closed shop where people have huge rows about who is going to go first, and who is going to pay."" With the possibility that the high stakes diplomacy falters, Boris Johnson also wants the fortnight in Glasgow to demonstrate real world progress. You may have heard the prime minister's pledge of ""coal, cash, cars and trees"", and if you haven't, you'll hear plenty more of it in the next couple of weeks. Stand by for practical announcements on all sorts of actions that should help cut carbon use and reduce the environmental damage from the world's economies, whether that's planting trees, expanding the use of electric vehicles, or just showcasing new technologies. This might be where a lot of the real action is, with work like that of the former Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who has been looking at how to rewire financial systems. And there will be a long list of cameos from the global great and good - whether that's Prince Charles, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Pope or Arnold Schwarzenegger - all urging world leaders and the public to pay attention, and to try to help. The prime minister has a chance to crank up the momentum at a G20 meeting in Rome this weekend, encouraging world leaders to increase their own enthusiasm, and maybe their own commitments. But the cocktail of different factors that will bubble together at COP means a successful fortnight is very far from certain. Boris Johnson is the target of protests outside the summit venue in Glasgow Organisers also worry about the logistical challenges of such a massive event. Keeping hundreds of people, fed, warm and watered matters when you are trying to get them to agree on something, one says. Insiders joke that freezing weather that got delegates shivering at the Copenhagen COP in 2009 was one of the factors that contributed to what was regarded as a miserable outcome. So COP is a political risk and an opportunity for the government. Those who have worked with the prime minister on the issue say ""he has got the religion"", another says it ""matters enormously"" to him that the summit is a political success. There isn't a question over whether Mr Johnson wants to make progress. There are nagging doubts, however, over whether he really comprehends every aspect of the fiendishly complicated detail. One official told me: ""He does care, but he doesn't completely understand all of it."" Another climate activist questioned whether, in the closing moments of the summit, the PM had the right political characteristics to salvage a deal if he hadn't mastered all of the specifics, to untangle the knots that might be holding back agreement. For months activists and even some in government have suggested privately that Downing Street has focused far less on the upcoming summit than was really required, in contrast to the French government in the run up to the landmark Paris summit in 2015. Number 10 would counter that claim though, pointing out that Mr Johnson has raised the summit in dozens of foreign calls for more than a year. And his president for COP, Alok Sharma, has certainly burned through the air miles trying to build alliances and prepare the ground for progress to be made. It is not, however, the case that every minister you speak to about the summit responds with wild enthusiasm (although if it's a success stand by for lots of retrospective wriggling to be part of claiming the credit.). Some of Mr Johnson's MPs describe the whole thing as ""incoherent and elitist"", with the government's own green policy at home threatening to ""knacker us at the election"". Another Tory source suggests there's a big risk of a ""greenlash"" from voters when the reality of environmental measures hit, although other government insiders claim Downing Street hopes that a successful COP could go some way to improve the Conservatives standing with younger voters. Given public awareness overall of the summit that might seem like wishful thinking - remember our pollster who suggested the event had barely been noticed so far? The Glasgow meeting is far from the be-all-and-end-all for the UK and the rest of the world's environmental ambitions. But it is an important and visible pressure point for presidents and prime ministers to show what they are willing to do on the issue of our times. And for Boris Johnson, who loves the glad-handing of summitry, the grand nature of big international events, it is a chance, he hopes, to show that the UK can lead.

Energy price cap to be reviewed as firms go bust,"The UK energy watchdog has said it will review how the price cap on gas and electricity bills is calculated following a series of company failures. Ofgem said there had been an ""unprecedented"" rise in wholesale energy prices. Suppliers are unable to pass on the full rise to consumers because of a price cap on household bills, prompting a number of firms to collapse. Ofgem will examine if the price cap reflects the risks facing companies. It said it will ""consult on the price cap methodology to ensure it appropriately reflects the costs, risks and uncertainties facing suppliers"". What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? A number of UK energy firms have gone bust in recent weeks after wholesale global gas prices surged by as much as 250% since the start of the year. Ofgem can review the price cap - which is the maximum amount per unit that a supplier can charge households on a standard tariff - twice a year. The most recent review lifted the price cap by 12% to a record Â£1,277. In a letter to the energy industry, Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley, said: ""The unprecedented rise in energy prices this year has changed the perception of risk and uncertainty in this market. ""In order to protect the interests of consumers, we must ensure that the regulatory frameworks, including the price cap, fully reflect the costs, risks and uncertainties facing the supply companies we regulate."" Over the past couple of months, more than two million households have seen their energy suppliers go bust because of the rise in gas prices. Ofgem has stepped in to find a new energy supplier for these households. However, it has also meant that consumers face higher energy bills because their new supplier may not be able to offer the tariff they were on before. ""We've got to take a cold, hard look at the energy market to understand what went wrong and to make sure we can stop this happening again,"" said Michael Lewis, UK chief executive of E.On, which has taken on customers from three collapsed energy companies. ""Customers are already facing steep rises in bills because of the sudden jump in wholesale energy costs, made worse by the added costs from the failure of more than a dozen energy companies."" Philippe Commaret, from EDF, said the review was good news: ""The recent spikes in wholesale fossil fuel prices have undoubtedly had an impact on customers and we welcome Ofgem's review of the market to make sure customers are protected in the long term."" Ofgem currently calculates the cap by looking at wholesale gas prices, energy suppliers' network costs and costs of government policies such as renewable power subsidies. Greg Jackson, the founder and chief executive at Octopus energy, said the current methodology was ""a bit clunky"". ""It looks backwards six to 12 months on historical prices, so when you see very big rapid changes, it is not agile to that,"" he said. Scottish Power's chief executive Keith Anderson, said: ""We need urgently to address the structural failures in the retail market - reforming the price cap so that it can respond more quickly to price shocks in the wholesale energy markets as well as focusing it on the most vulnerable customers, who will need our help the most."" Ofgem will launch the consultation in November. A decision on any changes will be published in February, when the new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April. The watchdog also said it would take an ""enhanced"" approach to making sure that energy companies had a ""sustainable business model"", which it said would minimise ""risks to customers and the market as a whole"". Mr Jackson, whose firm has taken on hundreds of thousands of customers from bust firms, said the situation ""is not just about the price cap"". ""There are some questions about how companies were run,"" he said. ""The reality is most of the companies, if not all of them that have sadly failed, have done so because they were selling long-term energy contracts but buying short-term energy, and so when the wholesale cost rose, they weren't able to deliver on the prices they promised or even on the price cap,"" said Mr Jackson. ""So we need to make sure that energy companies are run prudently."" Mr Anderson said: ""Irresponsible and reckless behaviours have gone unpunished and now customers are being told to bear the costs. ""Things are becoming desperate even for some well-run companies in our sector. Many more will go bust in the next few weeks.""

Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines: Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After a month of steadily
rising case numbers, during which the daily case rate rose by more than a
third, weâve had hopeful news each day this week. Sundayâs cases were lower
than the number reported a week before. And that pattern has been repeated six
days in a row. The chart below shows that
the seven-day average for cases reported has fallen by more than 5,000 to just
above 41,000 cases a day. One note of caution: there
may be an effect of mid-term holidays. So itâs certainly too soon to get
carried away and say that weâre definitely on the way down from a peak. But the modellers advising
government have been hopeful for some time that the combination of vaccinations
plus the high levels of infections weâve seen since July are putting enough
immunity in the path of the virus to slow its spread. We brought you the news a short while ago that more than seven million of the UKâs most vulnerable people have now received their
Covid-19 booster jab, according to the latest government figures. Health
Secretary Sajid Javid says the booster programme is ""accelerating"" and he is urging ""everyone eligible to get their booster
as soon as they can"". And Vaccines
Minister Maggie Throup emphasised the importance of vaccines over the colder months. ""If youâre eligible for a
booster jab, or youâre yet to come forward for your first or second jab, make
sure to book it as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you,"" she adds.

The appeal of an unmanned convenience store that uses contactless payment was obvious when the Covid pandemic began, as customers were trying to reduce face-to-face contact.

A stranded tourist leaves the Ejin Banner on a charter train Tourists are beginning to leave China's Inner Mongolia after a swift lockdown this week left more than 10,000 people stranded in the Ejin Banner region. China's Xinhua news agency said transport had been arranged out of the area for some 500 travellers. They left Inner Mongolia on a train for the eastern city of Zhengzhou. Localised lockdowns were imposed last week and a strict stay at home order was issued for everyone in the Ejin Banner on Monday. Residents and tourists were told,externalthat ""those who violate the rulesâ¦ will face severe punishments according to the law"". Given the region's landmass and comparatively small population, there have been reports of people struggling to get food and necessities.

From 04:00 GMT on Monday, passengers arriving from Colombia, Peru, Panama, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela and Ecuador will no longer have to pay for a 10-day quarantine in a hotel. Although there will be no red nations left, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the red list will remain in place as a precautionary measure and countries could be added if needed. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments have confirmed they will follow suit. Meanwhile, fully vaccinated travellers returning to England can now use cheaper lateral flow tests - instead of PCR ones. The same rule change will apply to the rest of the UK from 31 October.

Six million people in England have received a Covid-19 booster vaccine, six weeks after the programme launched, NHS England says. More than half of over-50s, who are eligible to receive the jab, have had their booster. Last week, nearly 1.6 million boosters were given to those eligible. More than 86 million vaccines have been delivered, and nine in 10 adults have had their first dose. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says: âBooster vaccines are by far our best protection against the virus as we head into winter and it is fantastic to see enthusiasm continue to grow as more people become eligible, with millions of lifesaving top-ups delivered across England already."" Across the UK, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. Usually it will be Pfizer or Moderna. Much of the world is grappling with high Covid infection rates while also trying to return to normal life. In Mexico, worshippers ask St Jude Thaddeus, a patron saint of impossible and desperate causes, to bring an end to the pandemic Activists stage a demonstration in Rome to protest global vaccine inequity in the face of huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies Members of the Russian Communist Party wore red masks during an event in Moscow, which is seeing record cases A medical worker takes a swab sample from a child in Zhangye, northwest China A health official prepares for a Covid Halloween in Seoul, South Korea Beijing residents have been told to postpone weddings and keep funeral ceremonies short, as Covid measures are ramped up across China before the Winter Olympics kick off in the capital. China has reported a tiny number of Covid infections since its initial epidemic last year. This is down to strict border restrictions and targeted lockdowns. But China is now seeing rising cases in a dozen regions linked to tourists. Cases are still far lower than in most countries, with 48 new domestic infections bringing the number to below 250 in the past week. But tens of thousands of people in Beijing - which hosts the Winter Olympics in February - have been placed under lockdown after a handful of cases were detected. The city's residents should ""postpone weddings, keep funerals brief, don't organise banquets, and reduce unnecessary gatherings"", deputy chief of the city's disease control centre Pang Xinghuo told reporters, according to AFP. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Passengers onboard two trains bound for Beijing found themselves in for a surprise yesterday when their journeys came to an abrupt halt, and they were all sent to quarantine. According to Chinaâs nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper, a train from Shanghai and a train from nearby Zhejiang province were halted, after a government notice was issued stating that crew members had been on the same train as people who had tested positive for Covid-19. Collectively, there were more than 300 passengers on board. One passenger told the newspaper that their train suddenly stopped, and medical staff boarded in hazmat suits, and told them to switch to medical-grade masks. Strict control measures have been routinely enforced in China. The country has a zero-Covid strategy, meaning that one symptomatic case can result in an entire city being locked down, as happened in thecity of Heihe in Heilongjiang province earlier this week,external. There are fears at the moment of a widespread winter outbreak. Since 16 October, cases have reached 14 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. The Peopleâs Daily says there has been more than 200 confirmed cases and âmany infected people had travelled by plane or trainâ. However, official media report that at least 75% of Chinaâs population are fully vaccinated. Russia has reported 1,163
new Covid-19 deaths, its highest one-day toll of the pandemic. It comes amid a surge in cases that has resulted in officials reinstating some lockdown measures. Deaths have set new records in nine of the past 11 days. Russia will go into a national workplace shutdown for the
first week of November. Moscow reinstated partial lockdown measures on Thursday, with only essential shops
like pharmacies and supermarkets permitted to stay open. To keep Wales ""safe and open"", Drakeford says it is necessary to strengthen the Covid measures already in place and ""that will need everybodyâs help over the next three
weeks"". He says: ""If rates continue to rise rather than fall, the cabinet will have
to consider raising the alert level [which is currently zero] and
reintroducing some further restrictions at the next review. ""None of us want to see that happen â so over the coming three
weeks we will strengthen six measures â from the requirement to wear face coverings
to changing the guidance on self-isolation to reflect the latest evidence of
household transmission."" He announces that people who are fully vaccinated - or aged five to 17 - will now need to
isolate until they have a negative PCR test if they live in the same household
as someone who has Covid-19. Covid passes are also being extended over the next three weeks. They are already compulsory for nightclubs and large indoor events
in Wales but Drakeford says their use will be extended to theatres, cinemas and concert halls in
two weeksâ time. The R number for England has risen, according to the latestgovernment figures,external. The latest R number estimate is 1.1 to 1.3 - up from 1.0 to 1.2 last week. An R value between 1.1 and 1.3 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. A growth rate of between +1% and +3% means that the number of new infections is growing by between 1% and 3% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. Today's live page was brought to you by Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Jo Couzens, Alex Therrien and Sophie Gallagher. The editors were Emma Harrison and Francesca Gillett. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines: Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After a month of steadily
rising case numbers, during which the daily case rate rose by more than a
third, weâve had hopeful news each day this week. Sundayâs cases were lower
than the number reported a week before. And that pattern has been repeated six
days in a row. The chart below shows that
the seven-day average for cases reported has fallen by more than 5,000 to just
above 41,000 cases a day. One note of caution: there
may be an effect of mid-term holidays. So itâs certainly too soon to get
carried away and say that weâre definitely on the way down from a peak. But the modellers advising
government have been hopeful for some time that the combination of vaccinations
plus the high levels of infections weâve seen since July are putting enough
immunity in the path of the virus to slow its spread. We brought you the news a short while ago that more than seven million of the UKâs most vulnerable people have now received their
Covid-19 booster jab, according to the latest government figures. Health
Secretary Sajid Javid says the booster programme is ""accelerating"" and he is urging ""everyone eligible to get their booster
as soon as they can"". And Vaccines
Minister Maggie Throup emphasised the importance of vaccines over the colder months. ""If youâre eligible for a
booster jab, or youâre yet to come forward for your first or second jab, make
sure to book it as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you,"" she adds.

Thousands miss out on care due to staff shortagesSome people with serious disabilities and terminal illnesses have already lost their carers.Scotland,"Some people with serious disabilities and terminal illnesses have already lost their carers Thousands of people with complex needs have been told their care may not be fully met because of staff shortages. A number of areas, including Fife, Argyll and Bute and the Lothians, have sent letters saying they may have to amend existing care packages. Some people with serious disabilities and terminal illnesses have already lost their carers. The Scottish government said it was working hard to help with recruitment in the sector. It said Covid and the loss of EU workers because of Brexit had caused staffing shortages and it called on the UK government to give visas to allow people to come back to work in the social care service. Unpaid carers 'like Cinderella, nobody sees us' Nearly 200 care homes took mainly untested patients The 'hidden' role of unpaid carers in lockdown Scotland's health and social care partnerships (HSCPs) have described the challenges of increased demand and staffing shortages as ""unprecedented"". The letter from Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP), seen by the BBC, said there may be changes to individual care plans in the coming weeks because of the ""national"" issue of recruitment problems. It asks people to contact friends and family for ""support with your care needs"" at this ""challenging time"". Donald MacAskill, of Scottish Care, which represents the independent care sector, said the country was in the midst of a ""national social care crisis"" which needed to be dealt with urgently before the worst pressures of winter. He said the crisis would create a huge additional burden for the NHS because people could not be released from hospital without care-at-home packages. ""I know of no area that is not affected by workforce problems,"" Dr Macaskill said. ""These are challenges facing every area of Scotland."" Geoffrey Alexander was living an independent life before he developed motor neurone disease Geoffrey Alexander has motor neurone disease (MND) and requires help for everything. His mobility is so affected he doesn't have the strength to turn on his mobile phone. A year ago, the 66-year-old was living an independent life. He could walk and take care of himself. Today he can tweak just one finger and thumb. He can move his eyes and speak. His siblings stay with him and until the start of this month he had two carers four times a day to get him up, dressed and fed. Then on Monday, 4 October he received a call from his care providers to say they could provide no care for him beyond the end of the week because of staff shortages. He says social work in Edinburgh were able to find him a temporary place in a care home. At his specially-adapted flat in Edinburgh, sourced by the charity MND Scotland, he had been able to listen to music, work on his writing and videos, send emails and spend time with family and friends. In the care home he says he can only sit and ""contemplate"" and look at the wall. ""I am totally at the mercy of those around me,"" he says. ""I can move my hand a little. I can sometimes squeeze a mouse button. But if I need to move my feet I have to ask someone to move them for me."" He says he has already deteriorated physically in his three weeks in the care home and is worried that he still has no long-term solution. Geoffrey's care-at-home was provided by independent operator Time for You Care, on behalf of Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership. It said that if staffing challenges meant it could not provide its usual standard of care, it would always work to offer an alternative. TFY Care said it was paid higher wages than most care companies but it was still losing staff to other jobs such as delivery driving and supermarkets. A spokeswoman from the Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) said care-at-home providers right across Scotland were facing an ""acutely difficult time"" and the gaps in some areas were significant. She said there was an urgent recruitment drive for new carers but in the meantime they were working with families to identify ""alternative short-term options"". She apologised to people affected and said a return to preferred support arrangements would be reinstated ""at the earliest possible opportunity"". The letters from health and social care partnerships explained that staff shortages both within their organisations and with independent providers meant it was not possible to provide care. Scottish Labour's social affairs spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the letters were ""really troubling for carers"" as they talked about removing some, or all, of their care package. ""That puts the burden on hard-pressed families who have been there throughout the pandemic for their loved ones,"" she said. The Labour MSP said the latest increase in the minimum wage to Â£10.02 an hour for care staff was ""insufficient"" and did not value them properly. ""I am meeting carers who are telling me they can get paid more on the supermarket checkout at Lidl or in the local pub,"" Ms Baillie said. ""We are arguing for Â£15 an hour for social care workers in Scotland."" The social care crisis is expected to worsen this winter. The Scottish government is working on plans to reduce delayed discharge from hospital but care providers said that would not be possible as they could not provide care packages at home. Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) said it was experiencing increased demand for care-at-home as well as recruitment difficulties. It said it was working to provide the best care it could in ""these very challenging times"". Lynne Garvey, from Fife HSCP, said Covid-19 was continuing to have an impact and the demand for care-at-home packages was ""unprecedented"". Ms Garvey said the partnership was recruiting 40 new carers and looking to attract more home carers. Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said Brexit had been a major factor in staffing shortages Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said the Scottish government was doing what it could to help health and social care partnerships to recruit and retain staff. He said factors such as Covid and Brexit had created staffing problems in the sector. ""One care home company I spoke to the other week had lost 40% of their staff because of Brexit and folk returning to their home countries,"" the minister said. He said the Scottish government had been in conversation with the UK government about giving visas to allow people to come back to work in the social care service. Mr Stewart said the UK government was being ""rather uncooperative"". The minister said social care workers were seeing their minimum wage raised to Â£10.02 an hour as part of a Â£300m package of investments in health services announced at the start of the month.

"UK warns France it could retaliate in fishing rowThe environment secretary says ""two can play at that game"" as dispute over fishing rights escalates.UKCommentsClimate summit venue becomes UN territoryThe Scottish Event Campus is handed over to the United Nations ahead of the start of COP26 on Sunday.Glasgow & West Scotland","This video can not be played George Eustice on post-Brexit fishing row with France: ""Two can play at that game"" The UK could respond in turn if France goes ahead with threats amid a row over post-Brexit fishing rights, Environment Secretary George Eustice has said, warning ""two can play at that game"". France said it could stop UK boats landing in its ports if the row over licences was not resolved by Tuesday. The UK government warned it could start ""rigorous"" checks on EU fishing activities in response. Meanwhile, the French ambassador has left the Foreign Office after talks. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she asked one of her ministers to summon ambassador Catherine Colonna to the Foreign Office ""to explain the disappointing and disproportionate threats made against the UK and Channel Islands"". Ms Colonna left the building in Whitehall just over 20 minutes after she arrived. Boris Johnson will also have a ""brush by"" meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the G20 summit in Rome this weekend, the prime minister's spokesman said. He added that France remained a ""close and strong ally"" to the UK. A British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday. French authorities say the detained Cornelis Gert Jan vessel did not have a licence - a claim denied by the boat's owner Macduff Shellfish of Scotland. But the European Union said the UK authorities withdrew the licence on 1 March. The captain of the scallop dredger will face a court hearing in August next year, French authorities said on Friday. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said No 10 sources were ""amazed and concerned"" at the escalating fishing row, describing the developments in recent days as ""extraordinary"". Ministers met on Thursday to discuss the situation and are understood to be considering a ""range of options"" to retaliate. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? How serious is summoning the French ambassador? Four ambassadors on what it is like being summoned France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to dozens of French boats to access British waters, and argued that this breached the Brexit deal. The country has warned it would block British boats from landing their catches in some French ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. Brexit minister Lord Frost said the EU would be in breach of the UK-EU post-Brexit agreement if France were to disrupt UK fisheries, wider trade or energy supplies after Tuesday. And ministers are considering launching ""dispute settlement proceedings"" with the EU if France goes ahead with the ""unjustified measures"", a government spokesman said. Mr Eustice told the BBC only a ""small number of vessels"" did not qualify for licences ""because they have never accessed Jersey waters before"". He said the UK had an ""ever open door"" and the government would wait to see what decision is made by Tuesday, after which the UK ""reserved the right to respond in a proportionate way"". Asked about the claim by France's Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, that the only language Britain understands was ""the language of force"", Mr Eustice said: ""That is completely inflammatory and is the wrong way to go about things."" He added: ""For now, we're not going to respond in the way that France has, we're going to raise this with the commission and we're going to raise it through diplomatic channels with the French ambassador but we'll reserve our right to do more things if France continue to press ahead with these threats."" The environment secretary suggested France was politicising the process of checking vessels. ""There obviously is an election coming up in France, it may be that is a factor in this,"" he said. Mr Eustice said the detained trawler had been granted a licence at the beginning of the year and the government was ""trying to get to the bottom"" of why it had subsequently been taken off the list given to the European Union. He said the boat may have made some changes to its engine which meant the licence had to be renewed. Andrew Brown, from the boat's owners Macduff Shellfish, said: ""We don't know where the error of interpretation of the licence lies, that will take some time to fix. ""But I would believe that under normal circumstances a misunderstanding like this could be sorted out with a  phone call."" By summoning the French ambassador, the government is expressing its significant concern over the fishing dispute in a very public way. This is not something allies do very often and this form of diplomatic dressing down is normally reserved for governments with whom the UK has a less amicable relationship, such as China or Iran. But equally, this is also a calibrated response by the Foreign Office - the ambassador is meeting only a junior minister. It would have been a greater escalation if Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had chosen to see the ambassador, Catherine Colonna, herself. And as diplomatic contretemps go, this is quite measured in comparison to a recent dispute over nuclear submarines when France actually recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the United States. Read more from Jameshere. StÃ©phanie Yon-Courtin, a French MEP and member of the EU Fisheries Committee, accused the UK government and Channel Islands authorities of not respecting the trade agreement they signed with the EU, saying it was ""up to the UK government to de-escalate the situation"". Under the Brexit deal, it was agreed that licences would be given to vessels that could show they had fished in each other's waters for years, although there have been disputes about how much evidence is needed. The UK maintains the rejected applications that sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show the boats had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island.

Thanks for joining us. Today's live page was brought to you by Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Jo Couzens, Alex Therrien and Sophie Gallagher. The editors were Emma Harrison and Francesca Gillett. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines: Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After a month of steadily
rising case numbers, during which the daily case rate rose by more than a
third, weâve had hopeful news each day this week. Sundayâs cases were lower
than the number reported a week before. And that pattern has been repeated six
days in a row. The chart below shows that
the seven-day average for cases reported has fallen by more than 5,000 to just
above 41,000 cases a day. One note of caution: there
may be an effect of mid-term holidays. So itâs certainly too soon to get
carried away and say that weâre definitely on the way down from a peak. But the modellers advising
government have been hopeful for some time that the combination of vaccinations
plus the high levels of infections weâve seen since July are putting enough
immunity in the path of the virus to slow its spread. We brought you the news a short while ago that more than seven million of the UKâs most vulnerable people have now received their
Covid-19 booster jab, according to the latest government figures. Health
Secretary Sajid Javid says the booster programme is ""accelerating"" and he is urging ""everyone eligible to get their booster
as soon as they can"". And Vaccines
Minister Maggie Throup emphasised the importance of vaccines over the colder months. ""If youâre eligible for a
booster jab, or youâre yet to come forward for your first or second jab, make
sure to book it as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you,"" she adds. TomÃ¡s Smyth sells his Wholey Cow brand of milk Vending machines might be associated with fizzy drinks and chocolate bars but there is a growing body of small business owners using the technology in new ways. The appeal of an unmanned convenience store that uses contactless payment was obvious when the Covid pandemic began, as customers were trying to reduce face-to-face contact. And in the last 12 monthsso-called automated micro markets grew by 367%, according to David Llewellyn, chief executive of the Vending and Automated Retail Association. One of these business owners was TomÃ¡s Smyth who launched Mr Smyth's Milk Shack to sell his Wholey Cow brand of milk at the end of March 2020. ""For two months it was crazy, 80 to 90 people in a queue here every day,"" says Smyth, a dairy farmer in Ireland's County Louth. And the options are expanding: you can now buy eyelashes from a vending machine (at Lash Loft in Newcastle) or perfume (from Russia's Perfumatic) and even prescriptions. A stranded tourist leaves the Ejin Banner on a charter train Tourists are beginning to leave China's Inner Mongolia after a swift lockdown this week left more than 10,000 people stranded in the Ejin Banner region. China's Xinhua news agency said transport had been arranged out of the area for some 500 travellers. They left Inner Mongolia on a train for the eastern city of Zhengzhou. Localised lockdowns were imposed last week and a strict stay at home order was issued for everyone in the Ejin Banner on Monday. Residents and tourists were told,externalthat ""those who violate the rulesâ¦ will face severe punishments according to the law"". Given the region's landmass and comparatively small population, there have been reports of people struggling to get food and necessities. The Ejin Banner is located in the Gobi Desert, next to the Mongolian border. It is roughly the size of South Korea and has a population of around 30,000 people. Read more Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded with his compatriots to ""turn on your brain"" and get vaccinated. His request comes as Ukraine grapples with a surge in Covid infections. It has reported a record 26,870 new Covid cases in 24 hours. ""I ask everyone to switch off social networks and turn on your brain,"" Zelensky said in the city of Odessa. ""We must get vaccinated,"" he said, adding that ""it is the only solution"". Only about 20% of Ukrainians are fully vaccinated. There were initially problems with the number of doses available and there has also been widespread vaccine-scepticism. But new restrictions requiring vaccinations have seen a huge spike in people taking up their jabs. Overseas residents visiting the UK has dropped 97% Overseas residents made just 277,000 visits by air to the UK between April and June, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. That is a 97% decline on pre-pandemic levels, with visits to UK-based friends and relatives dropping 93%. The number of business trips was also down 97%. Just 13,000 holiday visits were recorded in the period - travel and tourism firms are blaming Covid restrictions.

vaccine dose and, as of today, 7,293,638 (12.7%) people have had a booster or third dose. There have been a further 43,467 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to
thelatest government figures,external. And
there have been another 186 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the
previous 28 days. Ed Sheeran says he hopes he is getting over Covid after experiencing some ""pretty gnarly"" symptoms. The singer-songwriter, who was co-presenting the BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show with Zoe Ball, said he had ""drunk a lot of water, slept a lot and had all the vitamins"". The Suffolk star revealed he had tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday. ""I think I'm getting to the other side if it. The beginning of the week was pretty gnarly"" he said.

From 04:00 GMT on Monday, passengers arriving from Colombia, Peru, Panama, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela and Ecuador will no longer have to pay for a 10-day quarantine in a hotel. Although there will be no red nations left, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the red list will remain in place as a precautionary measure and countries could be added if needed. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments have confirmed they will follow suit. Meanwhile, fully vaccinated travellers returning to England can now use cheaper lateral flow tests - instead of PCR ones. The same rule change will apply to the rest of the UK from 31 October.

Six million people in England have received a Covid-19 booster vaccine, six weeks after the programme launched, NHS England says. More than half of over-50s, who are eligible to receive the jab, have had their booster. Last week, nearly 1.6 million boosters were given to those eligible. More than 86 million vaccines have been delivered, and nine in 10 adults have had their first dose. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says: âBooster vaccines are by far our best protection against the virus as we head into winter and it is fantastic to see enthusiasm continue to grow as more people become eligible, with millions of lifesaving top-ups delivered across England already."" Across the UK, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. Usually it will be Pfizer or Moderna. Much of the world is grappling with high Covid infection rates while also trying to return to normal life. In Mexico, worshippers ask St Jude Thaddeus, a patron saint of impossible and desperate causes, to bring an end to the pandemic Activists stage a demonstration in Rome to protest global vaccine inequity in the face of huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies Members of the Russian Communist Party wore red masks during an event in Moscow, which is seeing record cases A medical worker takes a swab sample from a child in Zhangye, northwest China A health official prepares for a Covid Halloween in Seoul, South Korea Beijing residents have been told to postpone weddings and keep funeral ceremonies short, as Covid measures are ramped up across China before the Winter Olympics kick off in the capital. China has reported a tiny number of Covid infections since its initial epidemic last year. This is down to strict border restrictions and targeted lockdowns. But China is now seeing rising cases in a dozen regions linked to tourists. Cases are still far lower than in most countries, with 48 new domestic infections bringing the number to below 250 in the past week. But tens of thousands of people in Beijing - which hosts the Winter Olympics in February - have been placed under lockdown after a handful of cases were detected. The city's residents should ""postpone weddings, keep funerals brief, don't organise banquets, and reduce unnecessary gatherings"", deputy chief of the city's disease control centre Pang Xinghuo told reporters, according to AFP. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Passengers onboard two trains bound for Beijing found themselves in for a surprise yesterday when their journeys came to an abrupt halt, and they were all sent to quarantine. According to Chinaâs nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper, a train from Shanghai and a train from nearby Zhejiang province were halted, after a government notice was issued stating that crew members had been on the same train as people who had tested positive for Covid-19. Collectively, there were more than 300 passengers on board. One passenger told the newspaper that their train suddenly stopped, and medical staff boarded in hazmat suits, and told them to switch to medical-grade masks. Strict control measures have been routinely enforced in China. The country has a zero-Covid strategy, meaning that one symptomatic case can result in an entire city being locked down, as happened in thecity of Heihe in Heilongjiang province earlier this week,external. There are fears at the moment of a widespread winter outbreak. Since 16 October, cases have reached 14 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. The Peopleâs Daily says there has been more than 200 confirmed cases and âmany infected people had travelled by plane or trainâ. However, official media report that at least 75% of Chinaâs population are fully vaccinated. Russia has reported 1,163
new Covid-19 deaths, its highest one-day toll of the pandemic. It comes amid a surge in cases that has resulted in officials reinstating some lockdown measures. Deaths have set new records in nine of the past 11 days. Russia will go into a national workplace shutdown for the
first week of November. Moscow reinstated partial lockdown measures on Thursday, with only essential shops
like pharmacies and supermarkets permitted to stay open. To keep Wales ""safe and open"", Drakeford says it is necessary to strengthen the Covid measures already in place and ""that will need everybodyâs help over the next three
weeks"". He says: ""If rates continue to rise rather than fall, the cabinet will have
to consider raising the alert level [which is currently zero] and
reintroducing some further restrictions at the next review. ""None of us want to see that happen â so over the coming three
weeks we will strengthen six measures â from the requirement to wear face coverings
to changing the guidance on self-isolation to reflect the latest evidence of
household transmission."" He announces that people who are fully vaccinated - or aged five to 17 - will now need to
isolate until they have a negative PCR test if they live in the same household
as someone who has Covid-19. Covid passes are also being extended over the next three weeks. They are already compulsory for nightclubs and large indoor events
in Wales but Drakeford says their use will be extended to theatres, cinemas and concert halls in
two weeksâ time. The R number for England has risen, according to the latestgovernment figures,external. The latest R number estimate is 1.1 to 1.3 - up from 1.0 to 1.2 last week. An R value between 1.1 and 1.3 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. A growth rate of between +1% and +3% means that the number of new infections is growing by between 1% and 3% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thousands miss out on care due to staff shortages,"Some people with serious disabilities and terminal illnesses have already lost their carers Thousands of people with complex needs have been told their care may not be fully met because of staff shortages. A number of areas, including Fife, Argyll and Bute and the Lothians, have sent letters saying they may have to amend existing care packages. Some people with serious disabilities and terminal illnesses have already lost their carers. The Scottish government said it was working hard to help with recruitment in the sector. It said Covid and the loss of EU workers because of Brexit had caused staffing shortages and it called on the UK government to give visas to allow people to come back to work in the social care service. Unpaid carers 'like Cinderella, nobody sees us' Nearly 200 care homes took mainly untested patients The 'hidden' role of unpaid carers in lockdown Scotland's health and social care partnerships (HSCPs) have described the challenges of increased demand and staffing shortages as ""unprecedented"". The letter from Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP), seen by the BBC, said there may be changes to individual care plans in the coming weeks because of the ""national"" issue of recruitment problems. It asks people to contact friends and family for ""support with your care needs"" at this ""challenging time"". Donald MacAskill, of Scottish Care, which represents the independent care sector, said the country was in the midst of a ""national social care crisis"" which needed to be dealt with urgently before the worst pressures of winter. He said the crisis would create a huge additional burden for the NHS because people could not be released from hospital without care-at-home packages. ""I know of no area that is not affected by workforce problems,"" Dr Macaskill said. ""These are challenges facing every area of Scotland."" Geoffrey Alexander was living an independent life before he developed motor neurone disease Geoffrey Alexander has motor neurone disease (MND) and requires help for everything. His mobility is so affected he doesn't have the strength to turn on his mobile phone. A year ago, the 66-year-old was living an independent life. He could walk and take care of himself. Today he can tweak just one finger and thumb. He can move his eyes and speak. His siblings stay with him and until the start of this month he had two carers four times a day to get him up, dressed and fed. Then on Monday, 4 October he received a call from his care providers to say they could provide no care for him beyond the end of the week because of staff shortages. He says social work in Edinburgh were able to find him a temporary place in a care home. At his specially-adapted flat in Edinburgh, sourced by the charity MND Scotland, he had been able to listen to music, work on his writing and videos, send emails and spend time with family and friends. In the care home he says he can only sit and ""contemplate"" and look at the wall. ""I am totally at the mercy of those around me,"" he says. ""I can move my hand a little. I can sometimes squeeze a mouse button. But if I need to move my feet I have to ask someone to move them for me."" He says he has already deteriorated physically in his three weeks in the care home and is worried that he still has no long-term solution. Geoffrey's care-at-home was provided by independent operator Time for You Care, on behalf of Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership. It said that if staffing challenges meant it could not provide its usual standard of care, it would always work to offer an alternative. TFY Care said it was paid higher wages than most care companies but it was still losing staff to other jobs such as delivery driving and supermarkets. A spokeswoman from the Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) said care-at-home providers right across Scotland were facing an ""acutely difficult time"" and the gaps in some areas were significant. She said there was an urgent recruitment drive for new carers but in the meantime they were working with families to identify ""alternative short-term options"". She apologised to people affected and said a return to preferred support arrangements would be reinstated ""at the earliest possible opportunity"". The letters from health and social care partnerships explained that staff shortages both within their organisations and with independent providers meant it was not possible to provide care. Scottish Labour's social affairs spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the letters were ""really troubling for carers"" as they talked about removing some, or all, of their care package. ""That puts the burden on hard-pressed families who have been there throughout the pandemic for their loved ones,"" she said. The Labour MSP said the latest increase in the minimum wage to Â£10.02 an hour for care staff was ""insufficient"" and did not value them properly. ""I am meeting carers who are telling me they can get paid more on the supermarket checkout at Lidl or in the local pub,"" Ms Baillie said. ""We are arguing for Â£15 an hour for social care workers in Scotland."" The social care crisis is expected to worsen this winter. The Scottish government is working on plans to reduce delayed discharge from hospital but care providers said that would not be possible as they could not provide care packages at home. Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) said it was experiencing increased demand for care-at-home as well as recruitment difficulties. It said it was working to provide the best care it could in ""these very challenging times"". Lynne Garvey, from Fife HSCP, said Covid-19 was continuing to have an impact and the demand for care-at-home packages was ""unprecedented"". Ms Garvey said the partnership was recruiting 40 new carers and looking to attract more home carers. Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said Brexit had been a major factor in staffing shortages Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said the Scottish government was doing what it could to help health and social care partnerships to recruit and retain staff. He said factors such as Covid and Brexit had created staffing problems in the sector. ""One care home company I spoke to the other week had lost 40% of their staff because of Brexit and folk returning to their home countries,"" the minister said. He said the Scottish government had been in conversation with the UK government about giving visas to allow people to come back to work in the social care service. Mr Stewart said the UK government was being ""rather uncooperative"". The minister said social care workers were seeing their minimum wage raised to Â£10.02 an hour as part of a Â£300m package of investments in health services announced at the start of the month.

Banks must not fund climate destruction - ThunbergThe Swedish campaigner is in the UK to take part in protests ahead of next week's COP26 conference.,"This video can not be played Climate change activist Greta Thunberg says it is ""very unclear"" if she has been officially invited to the COP26 summit. Greta Thunberg has called on banks to ""stop funding our destruction"", ahead of the UN COP26 climate summit. The teenage Swedish climate activist is in London to take part in protests demanding the financial system stops funding fossil fuel projects. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr that ""change is possible"" at the summit, if pressure on politicians is maintained. But she added she has not been ""officially"" invited to speak at the event in Glasgow. The demonstrations against investment in fossil fuel projects come as world leaders gather in the Scottish city ahead of COP26's opening on Sunday. The protest in London is part of a series taking place on Friday at financial centres around the world, including New York, San Francisco and Nairobi. Campaigners are calling on banks not to lend money to companies and projects that use fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? COP26: Has Johnson got what it takes to get a deal? The COP26 conference will see more than 200 countries asked to set out their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The summit is seen as crucial if countries are to implement a pledge made in 2015 keep global warming ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. As the host country, the UK is under pressure to get them to make ambitious commitments to reduce the greenhouse gases they emit. Ms Thunbergconfirmed this weekshe will travel to Glasgow to join a ""climate strike"" taking place during the summit. But asked whether she had been asked to speak at the event, she replied: ""I don't know. It's very unclear. Not, like, officially."" In itsofficial summit programme,external, the UK said it wanted to ""elevate youth voices"" during a series of events arranged on one of the summit days alongside the UN's official youth climate arm. There will also be a discussion on the outcomes of September's Youth4Climate summit in Milan, where Ms Thunbergdelivered a speech in which she mocked politicians' use of climate slogans. The interview was recorded at the Natural History Museum, where the activist examined a newly discovered species of beetlenamed after her in 2019. The interview will be shown on Sunday's Andrew Marr Show on BBC One. Greta Thunberg joined activists protesting outside major banks in the City of London on Friday Matt Graveling, BBC News reporter Today's protest had a sense of community, with young activists from different countries converging on London ahead of COP26 and sharing their message on a communal mic. While today's protest was aimed at the banking industry's financial support of companies who mine fossil fuels, it also offered the first chance for different global movements to meet face-to-face, having previously only ever communicated online. Different groups told me that as young individuals they struggle to be recognised, but are optimistic that by joining forces their voice will now to be heard. Elsewhere in her interview, Ms Thunberg said poorer countries most affected by climate change should have a bigger presence at COP26. She added it was ""not fair"" that some nations would send ""lots and lots"" of delegates, while nations from the so-called Global South would be ""under-represented"". And she added that the talks would not succeed if the world ""continues to ignore"" the ""historical responsibility"" of industrialised countries to cut their carbon emissions. The United States is seen as a key player in the success of the summit, with President Joe Bidenarriving in Europe on Friday ahead of the event. His $1.75 trillion (Â£1.2tn) Build Back Better social welfare package includes more than $500bn of spending on green policies. Mr Biden has described the measures as historic - but Ms Thunberg called on the US to go further. Asked whether the US could be seen as a world leader on climate change, she replied: ""Of course, everyone has the possibility, but if they continue like now, no"". ""We all understand, activists, that this doesn't fall on one single person. ""But of course, when you are a leader of the most powerful country in the world, you have lots of responsibility. ""When the US is in fact expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, that is a clear sign that they are not really treating the climate crisis as an emergency."" Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? What was agreed at COP26?

"Slow rise from ultra-low mortgage rates predictedBrokers say the current cost of a mortgage is the lowest it will be ""for some time"".Business","Mortgage experts are expecting a ""slow and measured"" increase in the cost of home loans amid predictions of rising prices elsewhere. All eyes turn to the Bank of England which will consider next week whether to raise the base rate. Some mortgage lenders have raised their interest rates slightly, after a period of intense competition and ultra-low costs for borrowers.

In response, it predicted a rise in the Bank rate next year, and the year after, from its current record low of 0.1%.

The rate of interest they pay can been changed at any time by their lender, as is often the case if the Bank rate is altered Were there to be a 0.25 percentage point rise in rates, this would translate to approximately an additional Â£26 per month mortgage payment on average for a tracker rate customer and Â£16 for the typical borrower on an SVR Source: UK Finance Competition in the mortgage market has been intense, particularly in recent months.

Schwarzenegger angered by world climate policies,"This video can not be played Watch: Arnold Schwarzenegger interview Arnold Schwarzenegger says leaders who claim combating climate change hurts the economy are ""stupid or liars"". Ahead of theCOP26 climate summit,the former governor of California told the BBC that cutting carbon emissions will benefit global economies. The Terminator actor said reducing meat intake does not have to mean sacrificing something - instead cutting his own has led him to be healthier. He also took aim at pollution caused by international trade. In a wide-ranging interview forBBC Radio 4's 39 Ways to Save the Planet series,Mr Schwarzenegger claimed California's continued economic success and prolific job creation proves carbon dioxide reduction and boosting wealth go hand in hand. ""They are liars, they are stupid. Or they don't know how to do it, because we figured how to do it and it's all about having the balls to do it,"" he argued. Mr Schwarzenegger became a champion of clean air and renewable energy while governor between 2003 and 2011 - setting targets to reduce exhaust fumes and greenhouse gas emissions. Arnold Schwarzenegger (left) has argued green policies will benefit economies around the world Since leaving office he has used his fame and influence to promote carbon-cutting policies, notably with the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative. Mr Schwarzenegger is also critical of an environmental agenda focused on lifestyle sacrifice. The former champion bodybuilder says he has reduced his meat intake by around three-quarters in the last few years, but argues he is ""gaining"" as a result. ""Since eating more vegetables and plant-based foods my heart doctor said my arteries have stopped narrowing,"" he said. ""So how have I given up something? I gained my health, it gave me an extra two years."" Mr Schwarzenegger also believes technology is delivering solutions and cites his Hummer - a massive military style off-road vehicle - that he switched from diesel to battery power as evidence, given the electric version goes faster with more horsepower. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. He expressed particular alarm about the air pollution and greenhouse gases coming from shipping, and suggested the most important thing we can do as individuals to cut carbon is to shop local. ""Buy local products. Every time you buy something from overseas, that is evil for the environment - this is like the worst thing you can do."" When challenged over whether, as a Republican politician, he should support global capitalism that drives this kind of trade, Mr Schwarzenegger rejected this characterisation. ""You can have competition but you have to be smart about itâ¦ because if people are dead, they are dead. It's over."" He is planning to be at the climate talks in Glasgow next week, but doesn't put huge faith in the top-down system - preferring to see the solution coming from popular pressure and technological change. However, Mr Schwarzenegger remains optimistic and still believes: ""There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" You can listen to Arnold Schwarzenegger'sfull interview on BBC Sounds.

"Kuenssberg: Has Johnson got what it takes to get a deal?The UN climate summit is a huge test of diplomacy for the prime minister, with considerable political risks.UK Politics","It wasn't really meant to happen. The snappily titled Conference of the Parties, this mammoth environmental, political and diplomatic shindig, or COP26 as it's known, wasn't destined to be held in the UK. One insider told me ""the whole thing was a mistake"". Another said: ""It was definitely a quirk"". When prospective host Italy seemed to be humming and hawing over it, the cabinet minister at the time, Claire Perry, spotted an opportunity to grab it for the UK. Downing Street wasn't necessarily convinced, the Treasury was said to be even less charitable about the prospect, but one insider suggests: ""One B. Johnson, then foreign secretary, thought the idea for the UK to host such a big event after Brexit would be marvellous."" Glasgow was chosen because the government wanted the opportunity to ""plant Union Jacks and display some of the advantages of the Union"" by bringing a massive international event to Scotland. Given that the conference only ended up in the UK as a twist of fate, will the government end up being delighted it took the chance or regretting the gamble? Getting nearly 200 different countries to actually agree on anything is, politely, a tricky challenge. The choreography of such an event is dizzying. The etiquette of COP meetings is unusual. Rows are likely. Walkouts are possible. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. One insider who has participated in previous COP events recalls a meeting where the attendees spent half an hour arguing over whether to designate the particular session as ""informal"" or ""formal"" while the shouts and chants of protestors outside could be heard in the room, threatening to drown them out. This time, one source told me, there could be as many as 300 delegates in the same room, all entitled to have their say. The idea of trying to reach an agreement with that many people seems mind boggling. Don't be surprised if even the first day is spent in a massive bun fight over agreeing what is on the actual agenda. COP is designed to be inclusive so that everyone taking part can put forward ideas or issues for discussion. That might feel like the right and proper thing to do, but it doesn't make for rapid or straightforward deal making. And there will be moments where it feels like the summit is all going wrong even if the final conclusions are a triumph. Having spotted the political opportunity a long time ago, however, the government is obviously massively eager to show that the meetings end in success. Pope calls for radical action on climate change Schwarzenegger angered by world climate policies Poll shows rising demand for climate action Let's face it, while the awareness of climate change and public concern is much higher than it used to be, public and political understanding of all the complexities is not deep or wide. One opinion polling source told me ""COP is literally not on anyone's radar"". But inside government, there is intense focus on what will happen and there are yardsticks by which ministers will measure success. Protesters are seeking to focus politicians' mind on the main message For the government, the broad aim is covered by the catchphrase to ""keep 1.5C alive"", that is to get a deal that limits increases in the world's temperature to 1.5 degrees, the threshold scientists want to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change. The hard part for Boris Johnson is that, as you might imagine, it's an awful lot harder than just flicking a switch. The plan to achieve that aim is made up of three main parts. First, what does each country plan to do about climate change? Have they promised to become ""net zero"" at home by the middle of the century? That is, to take out as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as they put in it. And, thirdly, whether they have committed to net zero, or a date, or not what are their own targets for cutting emissions? Downing Street is hopeful that more countries will make stronger commitments before the summit gets under way. If big powerful countries that produce lots of greenhouse gases, like China or India, come forward with measly plans, that creates an obvious first big problem. That's why one official suggests the biggest factor in this whole discussion is ""when do China's emissions peak?"". Then there is the question of cold, hard, cash. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney is working on financial solutions For years, rich, developed countries have meant to be helping the most vulnerable protect themselves from the worst effects of climate change, and to make their economies greener. But guess what, when it comes to shelling out billions, you won't be surprised that the conversations get tricky. The challenge is to work out who is responsible for what and when. In the words of one insider: ""The core of COP is a closed shop where people have huge rows about who is going to go first, and who is going to pay."" With the possibility that the high stakes diplomacy falters, Boris Johnson also wants the fortnight in Glasgow to demonstrate real world progress. You may have heard the prime minister's pledge of ""coal, cash, cars and trees"", and if you haven't, you'll hear plenty more of it in the next couple of weeks. Stand by for practical announcements on all sorts of actions that should help cut carbon use and reduce the environmental damage from the world's economies, whether that's planting trees, expanding the use of electric vehicles, or just showcasing new technologies. This might be where a lot of the real action is, with work like that of the former Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who has been looking at how to rewire financial systems. And there will be a long list of cameos from the global great and good - whether that's Prince Charles, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Pope or Arnold Schwarzenegger - all urging world leaders and the public to pay attention, and to try to help. The prime minister has a chance to crank up the momentum at a G20 meeting in Rome this weekend, encouraging world leaders to increase their own enthusiasm, and maybe their own commitments. But the cocktail of different factors that will bubble together at COP means a successful fortnight is very far from certain. Boris Johnson is the target of protests outside the summit venue in Glasgow Organisers also worry about the logistical challenges of such a massive event. Keeping hundreds of people, fed, warm and watered matters when you are trying to get them to agree on something, one says. Insiders joke that freezing weather that got delegates shivering at the Copenhagen COP in 2009 was one of the factors that contributed to what was regarded as a miserable outcome. So COP is a political risk and an opportunity for the government. Those who have worked with the prime minister on the issue say ""he has got the religion"", another says it ""matters enormously"" to him that the summit is a political success. There isn't a question over whether Mr Johnson wants to make progress. There are nagging doubts, however, over whether he really comprehends every aspect of the fiendishly complicated detail. One official told me: ""He does care, but he doesn't completely understand all of it."" Another climate activist questioned whether, in the closing moments of the summit, the PM had the right political characteristics to salvage a deal if he hadn't mastered all of the specifics, to untangle the knots that might be holding back agreement. For months activists and even some in government have suggested privately that Downing Street has focused far less on the upcoming summit than was really required, in contrast to the French government in the run up to the landmark Paris summit in 2015. Number 10 would counter that claim though, pointing out that Mr Johnson has raised the summit in dozens of foreign calls for more than a year. And his president for COP, Alok Sharma, has certainly burned through the air miles trying to build alliances and prepare the ground for progress to be made. It is not, however, the case that every minister you speak to about the summit responds with wild enthusiasm (although if it's a success stand by for lots of retrospective wriggling to be part of claiming the credit.). Some of Mr Johnson's MPs describe the whole thing as ""incoherent and elitist"", with the government's own green policy at home threatening to ""knacker us at the election"". Another Tory source suggests there's a big risk of a ""greenlash"" from voters when the reality of environmental measures hit, although other government insiders claim Downing Street hopes that a successful COP could go some way to improve the Conservatives standing with younger voters. Given public awareness overall of the summit that might seem like wishful thinking - remember our pollster who suggested the event had barely been noticed so far? The Glasgow meeting is far from the be-all-and-end-all for the UK and the rest of the world's environmental ambitions. But it is an important and visible pressure point for presidents and prime ministers to show what they are willing to do on the issue of our times. And for Boris Johnson, who loves the glad-handing of summitry, the grand nature of big international events, it is a chance, he hopes, to show that the UK can lead.

The hard part for Boris Johnson is that, as you might imagine, it's an awful lot harder than just flicking a switch. The plan to achieve that aim is made up of three main parts. First, what does each country plan to do about climate change? Have they promised to become ""net zero"" at home by the middle of the century? That is, to take out as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as they put in it. And, thirdly, whether they have committed to net zero, or a date, or not what are their own targets for cutting emissions? Downing Street is hopeful that more countries will make stronger commitments before the summit gets under way. If big powerful countries that produce lots of greenhouse gases, like China or India, come forward with measly plans, that creates an obvious first big problem. That's why one official suggests the biggest factor in this whole discussion is ""when do China's emissions peak?"". Then there is the question of cold, hard, cash. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney is working on financial solutions For years, rich, developed countries have meant to be helping the most vulnerable protect themselves from the worst effects of climate change, and to make their economies greener. But guess what, when it comes to shelling out billions, you won't be surprised that the conversations get tricky. The challenge is to work out who is responsible for what and when. In the words of one insider: ""The core of COP is a closed shop where people have huge rows about who is going to go first, and who is going to pay."" With the possibility that the high stakes diplomacy falters, Boris Johnson also wants the fortnight in Glasgow to demonstrate real world progress. You may have heard the prime minister's pledge of ""coal, cash, cars and trees"", and if you haven't, you'll hear plenty more of it in the next couple of weeks. Stand by for practical announcements on all sorts of actions that should help cut carbon use and reduce the environmental damage from the world's economies, whether that's planting trees, expanding the use of electric vehicles, or just showcasing new technologies. This might be where a lot of the real action is, with work like that of the former Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who has been looking at how to rewire financial systems. And there will be a long list of cameos from the global great and good - whether that's Prince Charles, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Pope or Arnold Schwarzenegger - all urging world leaders and the public to pay attention, and to try to help. The prime minister has a chance to crank up the momentum at a G20 meeting in Rome this weekend, encouraging world leaders to increase their own enthusiasm, and maybe their own commitments. But the cocktail of different factors that will bubble together at COP means a successful fortnight is very far from certain. Boris Johnson is the target of protests outside the summit venue in Glasgow Organisers also worry about the logistical challenges of such a massive event. Keeping hundreds of people, fed, warm and watered matters when you are trying to get them to agree on something, one says. Insiders joke that freezing weather that got delegates shivering at the Copenhagen COP in 2009 was one of the factors that contributed to what was regarded as a miserable outcome. So COP is a political risk and an opportunity for the government. Those who have worked with the prime minister on the issue say ""he has got the religion"", another says it ""matters enormously"" to him that the summit is a political success. There isn't a question over whether Mr Johnson wants to make progress. There are nagging doubts, however, over whether he really comprehends every aspect of the fiendishly complicated detail. One official told me: ""He does care, but he doesn't completely understand all of it."" Another climate activist questioned whether, in the closing moments of the summit, the PM had the right political characteristics to salvage a deal if he hadn't mastered all of the specifics, to untangle the knots that might be holding back agreement. For months activists and even some in government have suggested privately that Downing Street has focused far less on the upcoming summit than was really required, in contrast to the French government in the run up to the landmark Paris summit in 2015. Number 10 would counter that claim though, pointing out that Mr Johnson has raised the summit in dozens of foreign calls for more than a year. And his president for COP, Alok Sharma, has certainly burned through the air miles trying to build alliances and prepare the ground for progress to be made. It is not, however, the case that every minister you speak to about the summit responds with wild enthusiasm (although if it's a success stand by for lots of retrospective wriggling to be part of claiming the credit.). Some of Mr Johnson's MPs describe the whole thing as ""incoherent and elitist"", with the government's own green policy at home threatening to ""knacker us at the election"". Another Tory source suggests there's a big risk of a ""greenlash"" from voters when the reality of environmental measures hit, although other government insiders claim Downing Street hopes that a successful COP could go some way to improve the Conservatives standing with younger voters. Given public awareness overall of the summit that might seem like wishful thinking - remember our pollster who suggested the event had barely been noticed so far? The Glasgow meeting is far from the be-all-and-end-all for the UK and the rest of the world's environmental ambitions. But it is an important and visible pressure point for presidents and prime ministers to show what they are willing to do on the issue of our times. And for Boris Johnson, who loves the glad-handing of summitry, the grand nature of big international events, it is a chance, he hopes, to show that the UK can lead.

"Pope calls for radical action on climate changeIn an exclusive message recorded for the BBC, Pope Francis addresses world leaders ahead of COP26.Europe","This video can not be played Pope Francis delivered his message for BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day In a message recorded exclusively for the BBC, Pope Francis has called on world leaders meeting next week at the UN Climate conference in Glasgow to provide ""effective responses"" to the environment emergency and offer ""concrete hope"" to future generations. Speaking from the Vatican for BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day, the Pope talked of crises including the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and economic difficulties, and urged the world to respond to them with vision and radical decisions, so as not to ""waste opportunities"" that the current challenges present. ""We can confront these crises by retreating into isolationism, protectionism and exploitation,"" the pontiff said, ""or we can see in them a real chance for change."" He evoked the need for ""a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world"", adding that ""each of us - whoever and wherever we may be - can play our own part in changing our collective response to the unprecedented threat of climate change and the degradation of our common home."" The Pontiff is due to meet US President Joe Biden at the Vatican later. Mr Biden's domesticclimate policies are yet to pass through the US Congress. The message is a reminder of the emphasis Francis has placed on environmentalism throughout his pontificate. He has frequently evoked the climate crisis in speeches, and in 2015 published an encyclical, or papal document, called Laudato Si' focusing on the issue. In the text, subtitled On Care for our Common Home, he decried environmental destruction, stressed the need to take mitigating measures and gave an unambiguous acceptance that climate change was largely manmade. The letter was issued before the 2015 UN climate conference in Paris, COP21, and was seen as having some impact on pushing leaders towards an agreement. It was evoked during discussions, including by the president of Paraguay, who spoke of the Pope's ""dramatic warning that we face a crisis and need to protect the world upon which we rely for life"". Six years on, world leaders are preparing to gather in Glasgow for this year's climate summit, COP26. With growing evidence that the commitments made in Paris to keep global temperature rises ""preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" aren't being met, Pope Francis has again focused on the issue, hoping his intervention will have a similar impact. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Earlier this month, he gathered almost 40 faith leaders from across the world at the Vatican to sign a joint appeal calling on COP26 to stick to pledges on global warming, carbon neutrality and support for poorer nations to transition to clean energy. In return, the leaders committed to educating and informing their faithful about the climate emergency. There was an expectation that the Pope would attend the conference in Glasgow, telling journalists over the summer that his speech was being written. But at the last minute the Vatican announced that the 84-year-old pontiff would not be going, giving no reason. That is a blow for COP26's organisers, who had hoped his presence would lend added weight to a summit dubbed ""the world's best last chance to get runaway climate change under control"". Listen to Pope Francis's BBC message in full What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all And so this message through the BBC is intended to give his guidance from afar. ""Every crisis calls for visionâ¦ to rethink the future of the world,"" he said, urging ""radical decisions"" and ""a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world"". ""The most important lesson we can take from these crises is our need to build together, so that there will no longer be any borders, barriers or political walls for us to hide behind.""

"COP26: Has Johnson got what it takes to get a deal?The UN climate summit is a huge test of diplomacy for the UK prime minister, with considerable political risks.UK Politics","It wasn't really meant to happen. The snappily titled Conference of the Parties, this mammoth environmental, political and diplomatic shindig, or COP26 as it's known, wasn't destined to be held in the UK. One insider told me ""the whole thing was a mistake"". Another said: ""It was definitely a quirk"". When prospective host Italy seemed to be humming and hawing over it, the cabinet minister at the time, Claire Perry, spotted an opportunity to grab it for the UK. Downing Street wasn't necessarily convinced, the Treasury was said to be even less charitable about the prospect, but one insider suggests: ""One B. Johnson, then foreign secretary, thought the idea for the UK to host such a big event after Brexit would be marvellous."" Glasgow was chosen because the government wanted the opportunity to ""plant Union Jacks and display some of the advantages of the Union"" by bringing a massive international event to Scotland. Given that the conference only ended up in the UK as a twist of fate, will the government end up being delighted it took the chance or regretting the gamble? Getting nearly 200 different countries to actually agree on anything is, politely, a tricky challenge. The choreography of such an event is dizzying. The etiquette of COP meetings is unusual. Rows are likely. Walkouts are possible. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. One insider who has participated in previous COP events recalls a meeting where the attendees spent half an hour arguing over whether to designate the particular session as ""informal"" or ""formal"" while the shouts and chants of protestors outside could be heard in the room, threatening to drown them out. This time, one source told me, there could be as many as 300 delegates in the same room, all entitled to have their say. The idea of trying to reach an agreement with that many people seems mind boggling. Don't be surprised if even the first day is spent in a massive bun fight over agreeing what is on the actual agenda. COP is designed to be inclusive so that everyone taking part can put forward ideas or issues for discussion. That might feel like the right and proper thing to do, but it doesn't make for rapid or straightforward deal making. And there will be moments where it feels like the summit is all going wrong even if the final conclusions are a triumph. Having spotted the political opportunity a long time ago, however, the government is obviously massively eager to show that the meetings end in success. Pope calls for radical action on climate change Schwarzenegger angered by world climate policies Poll shows rising demand for climate action Let's face it, while the awareness of climate change and public concern is much higher than it used to be, public and political understanding of all the complexities is not deep or wide. One opinion polling source told me ""COP is literally not on anyone's radar"". But inside government, there is intense focus on what will happen and there are yardsticks by which ministers will measure success. Protesters are seeking to focus politicians' mind on the main message For the government, the broad aim is covered by the catchphrase to ""keep 1.5C alive"", that is to get a deal that limits increases in the world's temperature to 1.5 degrees, the threshold scientists want to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change.

"West Belfast residents take Casement Park legal actionA west Belfast group is trying to overturn planning permission for the 34,500-capacity GAA stadium.Northern Ireland","Planning permission for the 34,500-capacity stadium was granted in July A west Belfast residents' group has confirmed it is taking legal action to try to stop plans to build a new stadium at Casement Park. The Mooreland and Owenvarragh Residents Association is attempting to overturnplanning permission granted in July. A 34,500-capacity Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) stadium is planned. The residents' group succeeded ina legal challenge against a previous plan to build a bigger stadium, with a 38,000 capacity, in 2014. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon announced in July the completion of the planning process for the latest proposed stadium. Her department is aware it is now facing a legal challenge. ""The department has received leave papers on behalf of Mooreland and Owenvarragh Residents Association in respect of the decision to grant planning permission for Casement Park,"" a Department of Infrastructure spokesperson said. ""Judicial review proceedings are ongoing."" The residents' group circulated a letter to people living in the vicinity of the proposed stadium outlining its concerns about the granting of planning permission. The letter states: ""We believe it is flawed to the point of being unlawful. ""For that reason, we sought legal advice regarding the minister's decision. Our legal advisors have identified various grounds on which to challenge the legality of the decision."" The letter describes the proposed stadium as ""over-sized"" and states that a judicial review is the only way to stop it being built. The GAA had been hoping that work on the new stadium could be completed by summer 2024. The legal challenge could potentially delay or scupper the project. If the project survives the legal challenge, it is not clear yet exactly how it will be funded asthe new stadium is expected to cost much more than the original estimate. In July, First Minister Paul Givan suggested the final bill could be more than Â£140m. The original estimate was Â£77.5m. The redevelopment of Casement Park is part of a sports investment plan which began a decade ago, involving upgrades to the Ulster Rugby ground at Ravenhill and Windsor Park football stadium.

Four rescued as heavy rain warning continuesTwo bridges are washed away and the Carlisle to Dumfries rail line shut amid more heavy downpours.South Scotland,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows extent of Dumfries flooding Two historic footbridges have been washed away as water levels on the River Annan hit a 50-year high. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) recorded the figure at its Brydekirk station near Annan. The rail line between Dumfries and Carlisle has been shut for safety checks on a viaduct in the town. Four people also had to be rescued from premises on the Whitesands in Dumfries as heavy rains continued to hit southern Scotland. Two bridges were washed away over the River Annan as it rose to record levels A major incident was declared in Hawick on Thursday as water levels rose but police said it had now been stood down. Emergency services were called out early on Thursday evening to the Whitesands as the River Nith poured out across nearby car parks and roads. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service helped four people out of premises - they were all said to be safe and well. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather Some of the worst issues were suffered in Annan where two footbridges were washed away. Annandale South councillor Richard Brodie said the town was ""still in shock"" at the loss of the Diamond Jubilee Bridge and the Cuthbertson Memorial Bridge. ""They are so much a part of our DNA in the town, that it is essential that they are replaced as soon as possible,"" he said. Four people had to be taken to safety from properties in Dumfries The two bridges lost have allowed people to cross the River Annan for decades. The Diamond Jubilee Bridge was the older of the pair - built in 1897 to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne. The 19th century suspension bridge was a B-listed structure. The Cuthbertson Memorial Bridge dated back to 1957 to commemorate Lt William Cuthbertson but was dedicated to everyone from Annan who lost their lives in World War Two. Network Rail Scotland said the viaduct had been shut after the two bridges north of the railway had been washed away. It tweeted: ""We're unable to allow trains to pass over the Annan Viaduct pending a daylight safety inspection. ""The line between Dumfries and Carlisle will remain closed until further notice."" Divers will be needed to go and check the structure but they will be unable to do so until the flow of water in the area slows. Lucy Woods and Ayla Fudala had to take steps to protect their home Among those affected by the Dumfries flooding were Lucy Woods and Ayla Fudala. ""I had to go and lug 20 sandbags and meanwhile the rain kept coming down,"" said Ms Fudala. ""The water level kept getting higher and higher. ""We had to lift up the fridges and put them on chairs and the power went out for a while."" However, they also had one more pleasant surprise. ""Our roommate saw an otter swim down the street yesterday,"" said Ms Fudala. ""We saw an otter right outside our window - that was nice,"" added Ms Woods.

"COP26: Has Johnson got what it takes to get a deal?The UN climate summit is a huge test of diplomacy for the UK prime minister, with considerable political risks.UK PoliticsThe city trying to save the worldYour pictures of ScotlandFour rescued as heavy rain warning continuesTwo bridges are washed away and the Carlisle to Dumfries rail line shut amid more heavy downpours.South Scotland","It wasn't really meant to happen. The snappily titled Conference of the Parties, this mammoth environmental, political and diplomatic shindig, or COP26 as it's known, wasn't destined to be held in the UK. One insider told me ""the whole thing was a mistake"". Another said: ""It was definitely a quirk"". When prospective host Italy seemed to be humming and hawing over it, the cabinet minister at the time, Claire Perry, spotted an opportunity to grab it for the UK. Downing Street wasn't necessarily convinced, the Treasury was said to be even less charitable about the prospect, but one insider suggests: ""One B. Johnson, then foreign secretary, thought the idea for the UK to host such a big event after Brexit would be marvellous."" Glasgow was chosen because the government wanted the opportunity to ""plant Union Jacks and display some of the advantages of the Union"" by bringing a massive international event to Scotland. Given that the conference only ended up in the UK as a twist of fate, will the government end up being delighted it took the chance or regretting the gamble? Getting nearly 200 different countries to actually agree on anything is, politely, a tricky challenge. The choreography of such an event is dizzying. The etiquette of COP meetings is unusual. Rows are likely. Walkouts are possible. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. One insider who has participated in previous COP events recalls a meeting where the attendees spent half an hour arguing over whether to designate the particular session as ""informal"" or ""formal"" while the shouts and chants of protestors outside could be heard in the room, threatening to drown them out. This time, one source told me, there could be as many as 300 delegates in the same room, all entitled to have their say. The idea of trying to reach an agreement with that many people seems mind boggling. Don't be surprised if even the first day is spent in a massive bun fight over agreeing what is on the actual agenda. COP is designed to be inclusive so that everyone taking part can put forward ideas or issues for discussion. That might feel like the right and proper thing to do, but it doesn't make for rapid or straightforward deal making. And there will be moments where it feels like the summit is all going wrong even if the final conclusions are a triumph. Having spotted the political opportunity a long time ago, however, the government is obviously massively eager to show that the meetings end in success. Pope calls for radical action on climate change Schwarzenegger angered by world climate policies Poll shows rising demand for climate action Let's face it, while the awareness of climate change and public concern is much higher than it used to be, public and political understanding of all the complexities is not deep or wide. One opinion polling source told me ""COP is literally not on anyone's radar"". But inside government, there is intense focus on what will happen and there are yardsticks by which ministers will measure success. Protesters are seeking to focus politicians' mind on the main message For the government, the broad aim is covered by the catchphrase to ""keep 1.5C alive"", that is to get a deal that limits increases in the world's temperature to 1.5 degrees, the threshold scientists want to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change. The hard part for Boris Johnson is that, as you might imagine, it's an awful lot harder than just flicking a switch. The plan to achieve that aim is made up of three main parts. First, what does each country plan to do about climate change? Have they promised to become ""net zero"" at home by the middle of the century? That is, to take out as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as they put in it. And, thirdly, whether they have committed to net zero, or a date, or not what are their own targets for cutting emissions? Downing Street is hopeful that more countries will make stronger commitments before the summit gets under way. If big powerful countries that produce lots of greenhouse gases, like China or India, come forward with measly plans, that creates an obvious first big problem. That's why one official suggests the biggest factor in this whole discussion is ""when do China's emissions peak?"". Then there is the question of cold, hard, cash. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney is working on financial solutions For years, rich, developed countries have meant to be helping the most vulnerable protect themselves from the worst effects of climate change, and to make their economies greener. But guess what, when it comes to shelling out billions, you won't be surprised that the conversations get tricky. The challenge is to work out who is responsible for what and when. In the words of one insider: ""The core of COP is a closed shop where people have huge rows about who is going to go first, and who is going to pay."" With the possibility that the high stakes diplomacy falters, Boris Johnson also wants the fortnight in Glasgow to demonstrate real world progress. You may have heard the prime minister's pledge of ""coal, cash, cars and trees"", and if you haven't, you'll hear plenty more of it in the next couple of weeks. Stand by for practical announcements on all sorts of actions that should help cut carbon use and reduce the environmental damage from the world's economies, whether that's planting trees, expanding the use of electric vehicles, or just showcasing new technologies. This might be where a lot of the real action is, with work like that of the former Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who has been looking at how to rewire financial systems. And there will be a long list of cameos from the global great and good - whether that's Prince Charles, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Pope or Arnold Schwarzenegger - all urging world leaders and the public to pay attention, and to try to help. The prime minister has a chance to crank up the momentum at a G20 meeting in Rome this weekend, encouraging world leaders to increase their own enthusiasm, and maybe their own commitments. But the cocktail of different factors that will bubble together at COP means a successful fortnight is very far from certain. Boris Johnson is the target of protests outside the summit venue in Glasgow Organisers also worry about the logistical challenges of such a massive event. Keeping hundreds of people, fed, warm and watered matters when you are trying to get them to agree on something, one says. Insiders joke that freezing weather that got delegates shivering at the Copenhagen COP in 2009 was one of the factors that contributed to what was regarded as a miserable outcome. So COP is a political risk and an opportunity for the government. Those who have worked with the prime minister on the issue say ""he has got the religion"", another says it ""matters enormously"" to him that the summit is a political success. There isn't a question over whether Mr Johnson wants to make progress. There are nagging doubts, however, over whether he really comprehends every aspect of the fiendishly complicated detail. One official told me: ""He does care, but he doesn't completely understand all of it."" Another climate activist questioned whether, in the closing moments of the summit, the PM had the right political characteristics to salvage a deal if he hadn't mastered all of the specifics, to untangle the knots that might be holding back agreement. For months activists and even some in government have suggested privately that Downing Street has focused far less on the upcoming summit than was really required, in contrast to the French government in the run up to the landmark Paris summit in 2015. Number 10 would counter that claim though, pointing out that Mr Johnson has raised the summit in dozens of foreign calls for more than a year. And his president for COP, Alok Sharma, has certainly burned through the air miles trying to build alliances and prepare the ground for progress to be made. It is not, however, the case that every minister you speak to about the summit responds with wild enthusiasm (although if it's a success stand by for lots of retrospective wriggling to be part of claiming the credit.). Some of Mr Johnson's MPs describe the whole thing as ""incoherent and elitist"", with the government's own green policy at home threatening to ""knacker us at the election"". Another Tory source suggests there's a big risk of a ""greenlash"" from voters when the reality of environmental measures hit, although other government insiders claim Downing Street hopes that a successful COP could go some way to improve the Conservatives standing with younger voters. Given public awareness overall of the summit that might seem like wishful thinking - remember our pollster who suggested the event had barely been noticed so far? The Glasgow meeting is far from the be-all-and-end-all for the UK and the rest of the world's environmental ambitions. But it is an important and visible pressure point for presidents and prime ministers to show what they are willing to do on the issue of our times. And for Boris Johnson, who loves the glad-handing of summitry, the grand nature of big international events, it is a chance, he hopes, to show that the UK can lead.

"Pope calls for radical action on climate changeIn an exclusive message recorded for the BBC, Pope Francis addresses world leaders ahead of COP26.EuropeClubs say they work hard to prevent spikingWomen are set to boycott clubs for a night, calling for spiking to be taken more seriously.Wales","This video can not be played Pope Francis delivered his message for BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day In a message recorded exclusively for the BBC, Pope Francis has called on world leaders meeting next week at the UN Climate conference in Glasgow to provide ""effective responses"" to the environment emergency and offer ""concrete hope"" to future generations. Speaking from the Vatican for BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day, the Pope talked of crises including the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and economic difficulties, and urged the world to respond to them with vision and radical decisions, so as not to ""waste opportunities"" that the current challenges present. ""We can confront these crises by retreating into isolationism, protectionism and exploitation,"" the pontiff said, ""or we can see in them a real chance for change."" He evoked the need for ""a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world"", adding that ""each of us - whoever and wherever we may be - can play our own part in changing our collective response to the unprecedented threat of climate change and the degradation of our common home."" The Pontiff is due to meet US President Joe Biden at the Vatican later. Mr Biden's domesticclimate policies are yet to pass through the US Congress. The message is a reminder of the emphasis Francis has placed on environmentalism throughout his pontificate. He has frequently evoked the climate crisis in speeches, and in 2015 published an encyclical, or papal document, called Laudato Si' focusing on the issue. In the text, subtitled On Care for our Common Home, he decried environmental destruction, stressed the need to take mitigating measures and gave an unambiguous acceptance that climate change was largely manmade. The letter was issued before the 2015 UN climate conference in Paris, COP21, and was seen as having some impact on pushing leaders towards an agreement. It was evoked during discussions, including by the president of Paraguay, who spoke of the Pope's ""dramatic warning that we face a crisis and need to protect the world upon which we rely for life"". Six years on, world leaders are preparing to gather in Glasgow for this year's climate summit, COP26. With growing evidence that the commitments made in Paris to keep global temperature rises ""preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" aren't being met, Pope Francis has again focused on the issue, hoping his intervention will have a similar impact. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Earlier this month, he gathered almost 40 faith leaders from across the world at the Vatican to sign a joint appeal calling on COP26 to stick to pledges on global warming, carbon neutrality and support for poorer nations to transition to clean energy. In return, the leaders committed to educating and informing their faithful about the climate emergency. There was an expectation that the Pope would attend the conference in Glasgow, telling journalists over the summer that his speech was being written. But at the last minute the Vatican announced that the 84-year-old pontiff would not be going, giving no reason. That is a blow for COP26's organisers, who had hoped his presence would lend added weight to a summit dubbed ""the world's best last chance to get runaway climate change under control"". Listen to Pope Francis's BBC message in full What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all And so this message through the BBC is intended to give his guidance from afar. ""Every crisis calls for visionâ¦ to rethink the future of the world,"" he said, urging ""radical decisions"" and ""a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world"". ""The most important lesson we can take from these crises is our need to build together, so that there will no longer be any borders, barriers or political walls for us to hide behind.""

The message is a reminder of the emphasis Francis has placed on environmentalism throughout his pontificate. He has frequently evoked the climate crisis in speeches, and in 2015 published an encyclical, or papal document, called Laudato Si' focusing on the issue. In the text, subtitled On Care for our Common Home, he decried environmental destruction, stressed the need to take mitigating measures and gave an unambiguous acceptance that climate change was largely manmade. The letter was issued before the 2015 UN climate conference in Paris, COP21, and was seen as having some impact on pushing leaders towards an agreement. It was evoked during discussions, including by the president of Paraguay, who spoke of the Pope's ""dramatic warning that we face a crisis and need to protect the world upon which we rely for life"". Six years on, world leaders are preparing to gather in Glasgow for this year's climate summit, COP26. With growing evidence that the commitments made in Paris to keep global temperature rises ""preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" aren't being met, Pope Francis has again focused on the issue, hoping his intervention will have a similar impact. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Earlier this month, he gathered almost 40 faith leaders from across the world at the Vatican to sign a joint appeal calling on COP26 to stick to pledges on global warming, carbon neutrality and support for poorer nations to transition to clean energy. In return, the leaders committed to educating and informing their faithful about the climate emergency. There was an expectation that the Pope would attend the conference in Glasgow, telling journalists over the summer that his speech was being written. But at the last minute the Vatican announced that the 84-year-old pontiff would not be going, giving no reason. That is a blow for COP26's organisers, who had hoped his presence would lend added weight to a summit dubbed ""the world's best last chance to get runaway climate change under control"". Listen to Pope Francis's BBC message in full What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all And so this message through the BBC is intended to give his guidance from afar. ""Every crisis calls for visionâ¦ to rethink the future of the world,"" he said, urging ""radical decisions"" and ""a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world"". ""The most important lesson we can take from these crises is our need to build together, so that there will no longer be any borders, barriers or political walls for us to hide behind.""

Menopause 'made me feel I was disappearing',"""I am a Wednesday and a Sunday person. Don't laugh, but I deep condition my hair, put on a face pack and change my HRT patch. It's all self-care in one go."" Fifty-one year-old Adelle Martin is sitting in the pub she runs in Rochester in Kent, showing us the HRT patches she sticks on her hip twice a week. Now post-menopausal, she coaches other women through a life stage which can be extremely challenging. Adelle's menopausal symptoms started very early, when she was just 39, and working in finance. She went through the menopause itself three years later and says the experience affected everything about her life. ""It was like I was disappearing inside myself - I could be really, really tearful or really, really grumpy and that was really difficult for the people around me. ""When I was at work and with my team, I had to try hard not to cry and not to scream."" Drug exports restricted 'to protect NHS patients' Medical leaders demand action over HRT shortages Disciplined for taking time off during menopause She lost her confidence, suffered from mood swings and ""brain fog"". She also had the classic symptom associated with menopause - the hot flush. ""It is the most burning feeling ever. What people see is the sweat. For me, it was burning and tightening of my chest and the feeling of suffocating sometimes and wanting to get out."" Adelle says she even had one of the stranger of the 34 symptoms of menopause - the sensation of getting electric shocks. She laughs. ""That was quite funny"" Overall, what was happening to her though was anything but funny. Her voice starts to crack as she recalls having to take time out of her job. ""The hardest thing was looking in the mirror and not recognising yourself and that's what took me out of the boardroom. ""The confidence had gone, I felt hot all the time, my skin, my hair... everything lacked. I felt like I just completely lost myself. At the time I didn't know what it was. It was the menopause."" Relief came when Adelle asked to be put on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which, she says, stopped her hot flushes and helped her think more clearly. Nine years on, she still uses the patches to guard against any possible weakening of her bones. Each prescription costs Â£9.35 on the NHS. Adelle currently gets one box every three months but used to pay for it every month before asking her GP for a longer prescription. She has one patch that contains two hormones - oestrogen and progesterone. Some women have to buy them separately, which means they pay twice. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prescriptions are free on the NHS. Labour MP Carolyn Harris has put forward a Private Members' Bill to Parliament calling for that to be extended to England too. She acknowledges HRT is ""not for everyone"" but says there should be choice. Labour's Carolyn Harris wants HRT prescriptions to be free on the NHS in England ""We're talking about 51% of the population who are suffering this and need the choices to make this decision if they want HRT."" She is putting the bill forward as part of a wider campaign to raise awareness of the menopause. ""It's not just about the HRT, it's about education, it's about employment, it's about relationships, it's about sharing, it's about talking about it."" The bill certainly has got Westminster talking about the menopause. Health Minister Maria Caulfield has promised it will be a priority in the government's forthcoming Women's Health Strategy. She made the commitment in a debate to mark World Menopause Month. Several female MPs had earlier shared their personal experiences, symptoms and all. Speaking up to end the stigma around menopause Early menopause 'feels like you've been robbed' With millions of women eligible, the cost of making HRT free in England would be significant. It's not just menopausal women who have to pay regularly for prescriptions. People with long-term health conditions have been campaigning for their medications to become free in England too. The Prescription Charges Coalition is a group of 51 organisations calling on the government to scrap charges for those with long-term conditions. Coalition chair Laura Cockram says the cost of buying multiple items can prove difficult. ""If you're somebody who has Parkinson's, you could have eight or nine medications each month so it's really expensive to live with a long-term condition like that,"" she says. ""You can buy a pre-payment certificate - for three months, it costs just over Â£30. For 12 months, it costs just over Â£108. But some people have told us, particularly those with long-term conditions, that actually that is quite a lot of money to find to pay that upfront cost."" According to the Menopause Charity, only 12% of menopausal women in the UK take HRT. Some argue that misinformation and a lack of knowledge can be more of a barrier for women than cost. A flawed study conducted in the US in the early 2000s led to misleading publicity about the possible risks of HRT, which is still blamed by some for putting women off taking it. The government says it is ""crucial"" the menopause is ""taken seriously and women get the support they need"". It says it is ""deeply committed to ensuring women are able to access high quality menopause treatment, including HRT, which can be a lifeline for women who are experiencing severe symptoms.""

Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines: Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After a month of steadily
rising case numbers, during which the daily case rate rose by more than a
third, weâve had hopeful news each day this week. Sundayâs cases were lower
than the number reported a week before. And that pattern has been repeated six
days in a row. The chart below shows that
the seven-day average for cases reported has fallen by more than 5,000 to just
above 41,000 cases a day. One note of caution: there
may be an effect of mid-term holidays. So itâs certainly too soon to get
carried away and say that weâre definitely on the way down from a peak. But the modellers advising
government have been hopeful for some time that the combination of vaccinations
plus the high levels of infections weâve seen since July are putting enough
immunity in the path of the virus to slow its spread. We brought you the news a short while ago that more than seven million of the UKâs most vulnerable people have now received their
Covid-19 booster jab, according to the latest government figures. Health
Secretary Sajid Javid says the booster programme is ""accelerating"" and he is urging ""everyone eligible to get their booster
as soon as they can"". And Vaccines
Minister Maggie Throup emphasised the importance of vaccines over the colder months. ""If youâre eligible for a
booster jab, or youâre yet to come forward for your first or second jab, make
sure to book it as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you,"" she adds. TomÃ¡s Smyth sells his Wholey Cow brand of milk Vending machines might be associated with fizzy drinks and chocolate bars but there is a growing body of small business owners using the technology in new ways. The appeal of an unmanned convenience store that uses contactless payment was obvious when the Covid pandemic began, as customers were trying to reduce face-to-face contact. And in the last 12 monthsso-called automated micro markets grew by 367%, according to David Llewellyn, chief executive of the Vending and Automated Retail Association. One of these business owners was TomÃ¡s Smyth who launched Mr Smyth's Milk Shack to sell his Wholey Cow brand of milk at the end of March 2020. ""For two months it was crazy, 80 to 90 people in a queue here every day,"" says Smyth, a dairy farmer in Ireland's County Louth. And the options are expanding: you can now buy eyelashes from a vending machine (at Lash Loft in Newcastle) or perfume (from Russia's Perfumatic) and even prescriptions. A stranded tourist leaves the Ejin Banner on a charter train Tourists are beginning to leave China's Inner Mongolia after a swift lockdown this week left more than 10,000 people stranded in the Ejin Banner region. China's Xinhua news agency said transport had been arranged out of the area for some 500 travellers. They left Inner Mongolia on a train for the eastern city of Zhengzhou. Localised lockdowns were imposed last week and a strict stay at home order was issued for everyone in the Ejin Banner on Monday. Residents and tourists were told,externalthat ""those who violate the rulesâ¦ will face severe punishments according to the law"". Given the region's landmass and comparatively small population, there have been reports of people struggling to get food and necessities. The Ejin Banner is located in the Gobi Desert, next to the Mongolian border. It is roughly the size of South Korea and has a population of around 30,000 people. Read more Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded with his compatriots to ""turn on your brain"" and get vaccinated. His request comes as Ukraine grapples with a surge in Covid infections. It has reported a record 26,870 new Covid cases in 24 hours. ""I ask everyone to switch off social networks and turn on your brain,"" Zelensky said in the city of Odessa. ""We must get vaccinated,"" he said, adding that ""it is the only solution"". Only about 20% of Ukrainians are fully vaccinated. There were initially problems with the number of doses available and there has also been widespread vaccine-scepticism. But new restrictions requiring vaccinations have seen a huge spike in people taking up their jabs. Overseas residents visiting the UK has dropped 97% Overseas residents made just 277,000 visits by air to the UK between April and June, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. That is a 97% decline on pre-pandemic levels, with visits to UK-based friends and relatives dropping 93%. The number of business trips was also down 97%. Just 13,000 holiday visits were recorded in the period - travel and tourism firms are blaming Covid restrictions. From Monday 1 November, the remaining seven countries on the UK government's Covid travel red list will be removed.

From 04:00 GMT on Monday, passengers arriving from Colombia, Peru, Panama, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela and Ecuador will no longer have to pay for a 10-day quarantine in a hotel. Although there will be no red nations left, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the red list will remain in place as a precautionary measure and countries could be added if needed. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments have confirmed they will follow suit. Meanwhile, fully vaccinated travellers returning to England can now use cheaper lateral flow tests - instead of PCR ones. The same rule change will apply to the rest of the UK from 31 October. Read more:What are the full travel and testing rules for the UK? Sadiq Khan is calling for the return of mandatory masks Just joining us? Here are the latest Covid headlines in the UK. Six million people in England have received a Covid-19 booster vaccine, six weeks after the programme launched, NHS England says. More than half of over-50s, who are eligible to receive the jab, have had their booster. Last week, nearly 1.6 million boosters were given to those eligible. More than 86 million vaccines have been delivered, and nine in 10 adults have had their first dose. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says: âBooster vaccines are by far our best protection against the virus as we head into winter and it is fantastic to see enthusiasm continue to grow as more people become eligible, with millions of lifesaving top-ups delivered across England already."" Across the UK, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. Usually it will be Pfizer or Moderna. Much of the world is grappling with high Covid infection rates while also trying to return to normal life. In Mexico, worshippers ask St Jude Thaddeus, a patron saint of impossible and desperate causes, to bring an end to the pandemic Activists stage a demonstration in Rome to protest global vaccine inequity in the face of huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies Members of the Russian Communist Party wore red masks during an event in Moscow, which is seeing record cases A medical worker takes a swab sample from a child in Zhangye, northwest China A health official prepares for a Covid Halloween in Seoul, South Korea Beijing residents have been told to postpone weddings and keep funeral ceremonies short, as Covid measures are ramped up across China before the Winter Olympics kick off in the capital. China has reported a tiny number of Covid infections since its initial epidemic last year. This is down to strict border restrictions and targeted lockdowns. But China is now seeing rising cases in a dozen regions linked to tourists. Cases are still far lower than in most countries, with 48 new domestic infections bringing the number to below 250 in the past week. But tens of thousands of people in Beijing - which hosts the Winter Olympics in February - have been placed under lockdown after a handful of cases were detected. The city's residents should ""postpone weddings, keep funerals brief, don't organise banquets, and reduce unnecessary gatherings"", deputy chief of the city's disease control centre Pang Xinghuo told reporters, according to AFP. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Passengers onboard two trains bound for Beijing found themselves in for a surprise yesterday when their journeys came to an abrupt halt, and they were all sent to quarantine. According to Chinaâs nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper, a train from Shanghai and a train from nearby Zhejiang province were halted, after a government notice was issued stating that crew members had been on the same train as people who had tested positive for Covid-19. Collectively, there were more than 300 passengers on board. One passenger told the newspaper that their train suddenly stopped, and medical staff boarded in hazmat suits, and told them to switch to medical-grade masks. Strict control measures have been routinely enforced in China. The country has a zero-Covid strategy, meaning that one symptomatic case can result in an entire city being locked down, as happened in thecity of Heihe in Heilongjiang province earlier this week,external. There are fears at the moment of a widespread winter outbreak. Since 16 October, cases have reached 14 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. The Peopleâs Daily says there has been more than 200 confirmed cases and âmany infected people had travelled by plane or trainâ. However, official media report that at least 75% of Chinaâs population are fully vaccinated. Russia has reported 1,163
new Covid-19 deaths, its highest one-day toll of the pandemic. It comes amid a surge in cases that has resulted in officials reinstating some lockdown measures. Deaths have set new records in nine of the past 11 days. Russia will go into a national workplace shutdown for the
first week of November. Moscow reinstated partial lockdown measures on Thursday, with only essential shops
like pharmacies and supermarkets permitted to stay open. To keep Wales ""safe and open"", Drakeford says it is necessary to strengthen the Covid measures already in place and ""that will need everybodyâs help over the next three
weeks"". He says: ""If rates continue to rise rather than fall, the cabinet will have
to consider raising the alert level [which is currently zero] and
reintroducing some further restrictions at the next review. ""None of us want to see that happen â so over the coming three
weeks we will strengthen six measures â from the requirement to wear face coverings
to changing the guidance on self-isolation to reflect the latest evidence of
household transmission."" He announces that people who are fully vaccinated - or aged five to 17 - will now need to
isolate until they have a negative PCR test if they live in the same household
as someone who has Covid-19. Covid passes are also being extended over the next three weeks. They are already compulsory for nightclubs and large indoor events
in Wales but Drakeford says their use will be extended to theatres, cinemas and concert halls in
two weeksâ time. The R number for England has risen, according to the latestgovernment figures,external. The latest R number estimate is 1.1 to 1.3 - up from 1.0 to 1.2 last week. An R value between 1.1 and 1.3 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. A growth rate of between +1% and +3% means that the number of new infections is growing by between 1% and 3% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

Six million people in England have received a Covid-19 booster vaccine, six weeks after the programme launched, NHS England says. More than half of over-50s, who are eligible to receive the jab, have had their booster. Last week, nearly 1.6 million boosters were given to those eligible. More than 86 million vaccines have been delivered, and nine in 10 adults have had their first dose. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says: âBooster vaccines are by far our best protection against the virus as we head into winter and it is fantastic to see enthusiasm continue to grow as more people become eligible, with millions of lifesaving top-ups delivered across England already."" Across the UK, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. Usually it will be Pfizer or Moderna. Much of the world is grappling with high Covid infection rates while also trying to return to normal life. In Mexico, worshippers ask St Jude Thaddeus, a patron saint of impossible and desperate causes, to bring an end to the pandemic Activists stage a demonstration in Rome to protest global vaccine inequity in the face of huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies Members of the Russian Communist Party wore red masks during an event in Moscow, which is seeing record cases A medical worker takes a swab sample from a child in Zhangye, northwest China A health official prepares for a Covid Halloween in Seoul, South Korea Beijing residents have been told to postpone weddings and keep funeral ceremonies short, as Covid measures are ramped up across China before the Winter Olympics kick off in the capital. China has reported a tiny number of Covid infections since its initial epidemic last year. This is down to strict border restrictions and targeted lockdowns. But China is now seeing rising cases in a dozen regions linked to tourists. Cases are still far lower than in most countries, with 48 new domestic infections bringing the number to below 250 in the past week. But tens of thousands of people in Beijing - which hosts the Winter Olympics in February - have been placed under lockdown after a handful of cases were detected. The city's residents should ""postpone weddings, keep funerals brief, don't organise banquets, and reduce unnecessary gatherings"", deputy chief of the city's disease control centre Pang Xinghuo told reporters, according to AFP. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Passengers onboard two trains bound for Beijing found themselves in for a surprise yesterday when their journeys came to an abrupt halt, and they were all sent to quarantine. According to Chinaâs nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper, a train from Shanghai and a train from nearby Zhejiang province were halted, after a government notice was issued stating that crew members had been on the same train as people who had tested positive for Covid-19. Collectively, there were more than 300 passengers on board. One passenger told the newspaper that their train suddenly stopped, and medical staff boarded in hazmat suits, and told them to switch to medical-grade masks. Strict control measures have been routinely enforced in China. The country has a zero-Covid strategy, meaning that one symptomatic case can result in an entire city being locked down, as happened in thecity of Heihe in Heilongjiang province earlier this week,external. There are fears at the moment of a widespread winter outbreak. Since 16 October, cases have reached 14 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. The Peopleâs Daily says there has been more than 200 confirmed cases and âmany infected people had travelled by plane or trainâ. However, official media report that at least 75% of Chinaâs population are fully vaccinated. Russia has reported 1,163
new Covid-19 deaths, its highest one-day toll of the pandemic. It comes amid a surge in cases that has resulted in officials reinstating some lockdown measures. Deaths have set new records in nine of the past 11 days. Russia will go into a national workplace shutdown for the
first week of November. Moscow reinstated partial lockdown measures on Thursday, with only essential shops
like pharmacies and supermarkets permitted to stay open. To keep Wales ""safe and open"", Drakeford says it is necessary to strengthen the Covid measures already in place and ""that will need everybodyâs help over the next three
weeks"". He says: ""If rates continue to rise rather than fall, the cabinet will have
to consider raising the alert level [which is currently zero] and
reintroducing some further restrictions at the next review. ""None of us want to see that happen â so over the coming three
weeks we will strengthen six measures â from the requirement to wear face coverings
to changing the guidance on self-isolation to reflect the latest evidence of
household transmission."" He announces that people who are fully vaccinated - or aged five to 17 - will now need to
isolate until they have a negative PCR test if they live in the same household
as someone who has Covid-19. Covid passes are also being extended over the next three weeks. They are already compulsory for nightclubs and large indoor events
in Wales but Drakeford says their use will be extended to theatres, cinemas and concert halls in
two weeksâ time. The R number for England has risen, according to the latestgovernment figures,external. The latest R number estimate is 1.1 to 1.3 - up from 1.0 to 1.2 last week. An R value between 1.1 and 1.3 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. A growth rate of between +1% and +3% means that the number of new infections is growing by between 1% and 3% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines: Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After a month of steadily
rising case numbers, during which the daily case rate rose by more than a
third, weâve had hopeful news each day this week. Sundayâs cases were lower
than the number reported a week before. And that pattern has been repeated six
days in a row. The chart below shows that
the seven-day average for cases reported has fallen by more than 5,000 to just
above 41,000 cases a day. One note of caution: there
may be an effect of mid-term holidays. So itâs certainly too soon to get
carried away and say that weâre definitely on the way down from a peak. But the modellers advising
government have been hopeful for some time that the combination of vaccinations
plus the high levels of infections weâve seen since July are putting enough
immunity in the path of the virus to slow its spread. We brought you the news a short while ago that more than seven million of the UKâs most vulnerable people have now received their
Covid-19 booster jab, according to the latest government figures. Health
Secretary Sajid Javid says the booster programme is ""accelerating"" and he is urging ""everyone eligible to get their booster
as soon as they can"". And Vaccines
Minister Maggie Throup emphasised the importance of vaccines over the colder months. ""If youâre eligible for a
booster jab, or youâre yet to come forward for your first or second jab, make
sure to book it as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you,"" she adds. TomÃ¡s Smyth sells his Wholey Cow brand of milk Vending machines might be associated with fizzy drinks and chocolate bars but there is a growing body of small business owners using the technology in new ways. The appeal of an unmanned convenience store that uses contactless payment was obvious when the Covid pandemic began, as customers were trying to reduce face-to-face contact. And in the last 12 monthsso-called automated micro markets grew by 367%, according to David Llewellyn, chief executive of the Vending and Automated Retail Association. One of these business owners was TomÃ¡s Smyth who launched Mr Smyth's Milk Shack to sell his Wholey Cow brand of milk at the end of March 2020. ""For two months it was crazy, 80 to 90 people in a queue here every day,"" says Smyth, a dairy farmer in Ireland's County Louth.

China's Xinhua news agency said transport had been arranged out of the area for some 500 travellers. They left Inner Mongolia on a train for the eastern city of Zhengzhou. Localised lockdowns were imposed last week and a strict stay at home order was issued for everyone in the Ejin Banner on Monday. Residents and tourists were told,externalthat ""those who violate the rulesâ¦ will face severe punishments according to the law"". Given the region's landmass and comparatively small population, there have been reports of people struggling to get food and necessities.

""We must get vaccinated,"" he said, adding that ""it is the only solution"". Only about 20% of Ukrainians are fully vaccinated.

The pair blocking Biden's climate agenda,"Joe Biden heads to Glasgow in the coming days for a crucial climate summit at which he hopes to cajole international partners into era-defining commitments to reduce carbon emissions. But two senators could undermine his green credentials at the worst possible time. In a Senate balanced on a knife's edge between Democrats and Republicans, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have found their moment. They may share the moderate lane of the party, the centre ground of US politics, but beyond that the two could hardly be more different. The rugged 74-year-old man from the mountains of West Virginia and the 45-year-old iconoclastic woman from the deserts of Arizona. One enjoys extended chats with political reporters and hosts parties for fellow senators on his houseboat. The other barely speaks to the press and flies back to her home state at the slightest opportunity. But for all their differences, they are united in opposing parts of Joe Biden's ambitious climate programme - with its ultimate goal of reducing US greenhouse gas emissions to half of 2005 levels. And now it's a race to strike an agreement on a spending bill that allays their concerns without diluting the US president's green agenda before he arrives in Glasgow on Sunday. What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all So what is driving their thinking? On Sunday morning in Wilmington, Delaware, the president of the United States, the majority leader of the US Senate and the senator from West Virginia sat down for breakfast. Manchin, hailing from a rural state with only 1.8 million people and a fraction of a percent of the total US gross domestic product, was the one calling the shots. Because of a legislative procedure, Biden and the Democratic congressional leadership hope to use to pass their upcoming spending package with a simple majority, Manchin's support could be the difference between success and failure. The West Virginian had already effectively scuttled what was the centrepiece of Biden's legislative climate agenda, a $150bn programme that would have rewarded energy producers that switched to renewable sources of power and fined those that continued to rely on fossil fuels. Now he is reportedly targeting a fee on the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. He has said he is more amenable to investments in renewable resources as long as they are accompanied by research to make fossil fuel cleaner and don't endanger existing subsidies for the energy industry. Is Trump's power over Republicans starting to slip? Part of Manchin's concern with Biden's social-spending and climate agenda is ideological. Manchin is a centrist in a party that is trending more to the left. He's a throwback to a time when his state was controlled by Democrats, but last year Republican Donald Trump won West Virginia by 39 percentage points. Manchin is now the lone Democratic holdout in West Virginia politics and, if he were to choose not to run for re-election in 2024, his seat would almost certainly flip to the Republicans. Another component of Manchin's view, on climate in particular, is practical. He is one of the two senators - the other a Republican - from a state whose economy is dominated by the coal industry. In 2019, the most recent year for which there are figures, coal contributed $9.1bn to the West Virginian economy and accounted for about 27,000 jobs. Manchin's energy investments personally provided him with almost half a million dollars in income in 2020. Energy companies gave more to Manchin's political campaigns than any other senator's. Art installation in NYC about climate change From his perch as chair of the Senate Energy Committee, Manchin has a particular interest in the climate policies his party - and president - seek to enact. And climate policies that present an existential threat to his state's energy business have little hope of escaping his reach. If Manchin's motives to scale back Biden's climate agenda are reasonably clear, the reasoning of the other key Senate centrist on the issue is more of a cipher. Sinema started her career in politics as an activist in the Green Party, before she began a steady climb up through Arizona elective office. As she's elevated her position, she's moved steadily toward the middle of the political spectrum, culminating in her Senate victory in 2018, the first for a Democrat in the state in 30 years. Sinema is a keen triathlete and once completed an Ironman In the past year, she's infuriated her party with a vote against raising the minimum wage and by skipping a procedural vote on forming a committee to investigate the January attack on the US Capitol. She's also frustrated liberal activists by keeping her public statements about the spending-bill negotiations to a minimum. Where Manchin will frequently spell out what he will - and won't - support, Sinema treats reporters - and their questions - like a toxic outbreak. How 'Let's go Brandon' became an anti-Biden jeer Sinema's relative silence has created a cottage industry of speculation about her motivations and objectives. The left wing of the party point to her frequent meetings with corporate lobbyists as evidence that she's in league with big business interests, perhaps preparing herself for a lucrative post-Senate career. It's a theory political reporter Joshua Marshall of the website Talking Points Memo doesn't buy. ""You just don't work that hard and that successfully to climb the ladder of political power to flame out after one Senate term to get a job as a lobbyist,""he writes,external. ""The money isn't that good."" Death Valley is getting hotter and drier Marshall speculates that Sinema is styling herself after the late Arizona Senator John McCain, who frequently quarrelled with his fellow Republicans and, shortly before his death, cast a deciding vote against his party to block the repeal of Democratic health-insurance reforms in 2017. McCain's maverick persona - along with his war-hero record - helped him become an institution in Arizona and ultimately win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Sinema's calculation may be that the key to success in her state, and perhaps nationally, is to burnish her independent credentials. In a state where registered independents outnumber Democrats, it could be a winning strategy. And so she has expressed opposition to some of the bigger-ticket green-energy subsidies, community funding and spending items in Biden's climate package, while still voicing interest in a tax on carbon used in energy-production (an idea that probably won't fly with Manchin, however). There's already talk in liberal circles of mounting a challenge to Sinema in the 2024 Arizona Democratic primary, and left-wing activists have taken to chasing her through airports and in other public spaces to pressure her to be more of a party team player. Manchin has faced similar scrutiny - and liberal outcry. It is, perhaps, a reflection of just how effective efforts by these two centrists have been that Democrats on the left have become increasingly frustrated with the diminished size of the final bill - and a left-wing rebellion against the final agreement is still a possibility. It may be too late, however. While the party's liberal flank has succeeded in delaying passage of an accompanying bipartisan infrastructure bill that both Sinema and Manchin have championed, the size of the president's social spending package has been reduced by trillions of dollars - and the scope of the climate measures have been significantly curtailed - because of the two centrists' efforts. The liberal wing of the party has been scathing in its criticism of Manchin and Sinema According toreporting by Axios,external, the White House has scrambled to find a number of new ways to cut emissions, having lost the battle with Manchin over the cleaner energy grid. As Biden prepares to head to Scotland for next week's climate summit, it will be Manchin and Sinema who are defining the limits of what he can promise the US will deliver - and, perhaps, whether he can make any promises at all.

"UK summons French ambassador amid fishing rowThe UK government condemns ""unjustified"" threats from France after a British trawler was detained.UK","This video can not be played Watch: British trawler Cornelis Gert Jan is held in Le Havre The UK has condemned ""unjustified"" threats from France and summoned the country's ambassador in an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is calling for talks later, asking Catherine Colonna to explain ""disappointing and disproportionate threats"". A British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday. French authorities said the detained vessel did not have a licence. However, Environment Secretary George Eustice has insisted the European Union did grant a licence to the trawler and said it was ""unclear"" why, according to reports, it was subsequently withdrawn from the list given to the EU. Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? What happens when an ambassador is summoned? France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to dozens of French boats, and argued that this breached the Brexit deal. The country has warned it would block British boats from some ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute over fishing licences was not resolved by 2 November. In issuing its ultimatum, it said it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from next Tuesday, including preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports and more checks on UK goods. France has also warned it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as itpreviously threatened in May. The country's Europe minister Clement Beaune told French TV news channel CNews: ""We need to speak the language of force because, unfortunately, that seems to be the only thing this British government understands."" On Thursday evening, Ms Truss said in a tweet that she had asked Europe Minister Wendy Morton to summon the French ambassador for talks on Friday. A government spokesman said: ""The proposed French actions are unjustified and do not appear to be compatible on the EU's part with the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) or wider international law. ""We regret the confrontational language that has been consistently used by the French government on this issue, which makes this situation no easier to resolve."" This video can not be played George Eustice says France's response has been ""disappointing and disproportionate"" The detained vessel is the Cornelis Gert Jan and its owner, Macduff Shellfish of Scotland, said the vessel was fishing legally in French waters. The firm's Andrew Brown said it appeared the Cornelis, based at Shoreham, in West Sussex, had been ""caught up"" in the ongoing UK-France post-Brexit fishing row. He warned that without ""a speedy resolution"" the vessel's catch could be confiscated by the French authorities, and called on the UK government to ""defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet"". French maritime minister Annick Girardinsaid on Twitter,externalthe trawler was found to be fishing in the Bay of Seine without the proper licences. The minister said checks on the British vessels were standard during the scallop fishing season. But she added they had also been undertaken against ""the backdrop of the tightening of controls in the Channel, in the context of discussions on licences with the United Kingdom and the European Commission"". The UK maintains the rejected applications that sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show the boats had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters. A meeting with officials from France, Jersey, the UK and European Commission on Wednesday led to 162 French boats being given licencesto fish in Jersey's waters from Friday. The government of Jersey said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the latest threats of sanctions by France. French trawlers previously protestedoutside the port of St Helier on the island.

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines: Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After a month of steadily
rising case numbers, during which the daily case rate rose by more than a
third, weâve had hopeful news each day this week. Sundayâs cases were lower
than the number reported a week before. And that pattern has been repeated six
days in a row. The chart below shows that
the seven-day average for cases reported has fallen by more than 5,000 to just
above 41,000 cases a day. One note of caution: there
may be an effect of mid-term holidays. So itâs certainly too soon to get
carried away and say that weâre definitely on the way down from a peak. But the modellers advising
government have been hopeful for some time that the combination of vaccinations
plus the high levels of infections weâve seen since July are putting enough
immunity in the path of the virus to slow its spread. We brought you the news a short while ago that more than seven million of the UKâs most vulnerable people have now received their
Covid-19 booster jab, according to the latest government figures. Health
Secretary Sajid Javid says the booster programme is ""accelerating"" and he is urging ""everyone eligible to get their booster
as soon as they can"". And Vaccines
Minister Maggie Throup emphasised the importance of vaccines over the colder months. ""If youâre eligible for a
booster jab, or youâre yet to come forward for your first or second jab, make
sure to book it as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you,"" she adds. TomÃ¡s Smyth sells his Wholey Cow brand of milk Vending machines might be associated with fizzy drinks and chocolate bars but there is a growing body of small business owners using the technology in new ways. The appeal of an unmanned convenience store that uses contactless payment was obvious when the Covid pandemic began, as customers were trying to reduce face-to-face contact. And in the last 12 monthsso-called automated micro markets grew by 367%, according to David Llewellyn, chief executive of the Vending and Automated Retail Association. One of these business owners was TomÃ¡s Smyth who launched Mr Smyth's Milk Shack to sell his Wholey Cow brand of milk at the end of March 2020. ""For two months it was crazy, 80 to 90 people in a queue here every day,"" says Smyth, a dairy farmer in Ireland's County Louth. And the options are expanding: you can now buy eyelashes from a vending machine (at Lash Loft in Newcastle) or perfume (from Russia's Perfumatic) and even prescriptions. A stranded tourist leaves the Ejin Banner on a charter train Tourists are beginning to leave China's Inner Mongolia after a swift lockdown this week left more than 10,000 people stranded in the Ejin Banner region. China's Xinhua news agency said transport had been arranged out of the area for some 500 travellers. They left Inner Mongolia on a train for the eastern city of Zhengzhou. Localised lockdowns were imposed last week and a strict stay at home order was issued for everyone in the Ejin Banner on Monday. Residents and tourists were told,externalthat ""those who violate the rulesâ¦ will face severe punishments according to the law"". Given the region's landmass and comparatively small population, there have been reports of people struggling to get food and necessities. The Ejin Banner is located in the Gobi Desert, next to the Mongolian border. It is roughly the size of South Korea and has a population of around 30,000 people. Read more Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded with his compatriots to ""turn on your brain"" and get vaccinated. His request comes as Ukraine grapples with a surge in Covid infections. It has reported a record 26,870 new Covid cases in 24 hours. ""I ask everyone to switch off social networks and turn on your brain,"" Zelensky said in the city of Odessa. ""We must get vaccinated,"" he said, adding that ""it is the only solution"". Only about 20% of Ukrainians are fully vaccinated. There were initially problems with the number of doses available and there has also been widespread vaccine-scepticism. But new restrictions requiring vaccinations have seen a huge spike in people taking up their jabs. Overseas residents visiting the UK has dropped 97% Overseas residents made just 277,000 visits by air to the UK between April and June, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. That is a 97% decline on pre-pandemic levels, with visits to UK-based friends and relatives dropping 93%. The number of business trips was also down 97%. Just 13,000 holiday visits were recorded in the period - travel and tourism firms are blaming Covid restrictions. From Monday 1 November, the remaining seven countries on the UK government's Covid travel red list will be removed. Thelatest figures,externalshow that the number of deaths have increased by 12.6% compared to the previous week

week, with 289,718 recorded between 23 and 29 October, a decrease
of 42,185. A total of 49,882,904 people over the age of 12 - or 86.7% of this age group - have now had at least one
jab. And 45,651,222 (79.4%) have had a second

The singer-songwriter, who was co-presenting the BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show with Zoe Ball, said he had ""drunk a lot of water, slept a lot and had all the vitamins"". The Suffolk star revealed he had tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday. ""I think I'm getting to the other side if it. The beginning of the week was pretty gnarly"" he said.

From 04:00 GMT on Monday, passengers arriving from Colombia, Peru, Panama, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela and Ecuador will no longer have to pay for a 10-day quarantine in a hotel. Although there will be no red nations left, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the red list will remain in place as a precautionary measure and countries could be added if needed. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments have confirmed they will follow suit. Meanwhile, fully vaccinated travellers returning to England can now use cheaper lateral flow tests - instead of PCR ones. The same rule change will apply to the rest of the UK from 31 October.

Six million people in England have received a Covid-19 booster vaccine, six weeks after the programme launched, NHS England says. More than half of over-50s, who are eligible to receive the jab, have had their booster. Last week, nearly 1.6 million boosters were given to those eligible. More than 86 million vaccines have been delivered, and nine in 10 adults have had their first dose. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says: âBooster vaccines are by far our best protection against the virus as we head into winter and it is fantastic to see enthusiasm continue to grow as more people become eligible, with millions of lifesaving top-ups delivered across England already."" Across the UK, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. Usually it will be Pfizer or Moderna. Much of the world is grappling with high Covid infection rates while also trying to return to normal life. In Mexico, worshippers ask St Jude Thaddeus, a patron saint of impossible and desperate causes, to bring an end to the pandemic Activists stage a demonstration in Rome to protest global vaccine inequity in the face of huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies Members of the Russian Communist Party wore red masks during an event in Moscow, which is seeing record cases A medical worker takes a swab sample from a child in Zhangye, northwest China A health official prepares for a Covid Halloween in Seoul, South Korea Beijing residents have been told to postpone weddings and keep funeral ceremonies short, as Covid measures are ramped up across China before the Winter Olympics kick off in the capital. China has reported a tiny number of Covid infections since its initial epidemic last year. This is down to strict border restrictions and targeted lockdowns. But China is now seeing rising cases in a dozen regions linked to tourists. Cases are still far lower than in most countries, with 48 new domestic infections bringing the number to below 250 in the past week. But tens of thousands of people in Beijing - which hosts the Winter Olympics in February - have been placed under lockdown after a handful of cases were detected. The city's residents should ""postpone weddings, keep funerals brief, don't organise banquets, and reduce unnecessary gatherings"", deputy chief of the city's disease control centre Pang Xinghuo told reporters, according to AFP. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Passengers onboard two trains bound for Beijing found themselves in for a surprise yesterday when their journeys came to an abrupt halt, and they were all sent to quarantine. According to Chinaâs nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper, a train from Shanghai and a train from nearby Zhejiang province were halted, after a government notice was issued stating that crew members had been on the same train as people who had tested positive for Covid-19. Collectively, there were more than 300 passengers on board. One passenger told the newspaper that their train suddenly stopped, and medical staff boarded in hazmat suits, and told them to switch to medical-grade masks. Strict control measures have been routinely enforced in China. The country has a zero-Covid strategy, meaning that one symptomatic case can result in an entire city being locked down, as happened in thecity of Heihe in Heilongjiang province earlier this week,external. There are fears at the moment of a widespread winter outbreak. Since 16 October, cases have reached 14 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. The Peopleâs Daily says there has been more than 200 confirmed cases and âmany infected people had travelled by plane or trainâ. However, official media report that at least 75% of Chinaâs population are fully vaccinated. Russia has reported 1,163
new Covid-19 deaths, its highest one-day toll of the pandemic. It comes amid a surge in cases that has resulted in officials reinstating some lockdown measures. Deaths have set new records in nine of the past 11 days. Russia will go into a national workplace shutdown for the
first week of November. Moscow reinstated partial lockdown measures on Thursday, with only essential shops
like pharmacies and supermarkets permitted to stay open. To keep Wales ""safe and open"", Drakeford says it is necessary to strengthen the Covid measures already in place and ""that will need everybodyâs help over the next three
weeks"". He says: ""If rates continue to rise rather than fall, the cabinet will have
to consider raising the alert level [which is currently zero] and
reintroducing some further restrictions at the next review. ""None of us want to see that happen â so over the coming three
weeks we will strengthen six measures â from the requirement to wear face coverings
to changing the guidance on self-isolation to reflect the latest evidence of
household transmission."" He announces that people who are fully vaccinated - or aged five to 17 - will now need to
isolate until they have a negative PCR test if they live in the same household
as someone who has Covid-19. Covid passes are also being extended over the next three weeks. They are already compulsory for nightclubs and large indoor events
in Wales but Drakeford says their use will be extended to theatres, cinemas and concert halls in
two weeksâ time. The R number for England has risen, according to the latestgovernment figures,external. The latest R number estimate is 1.1 to 1.3 - up from 1.0 to 1.2 last week. An R value between 1.1 and 1.3 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. A growth rate of between +1% and +3% means that the number of new infections is growing by between 1% and 3% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

That is a 97% decline on pre-pandemic levels, with visits to UK-based friends and relatives dropping 93%. The number of business trips was also down 97%. Just 13,000 holiday visits were recorded in the period - travel and tourism firms are blaming Covid restrictions.

From 04:00 GMT on Monday, passengers arriving from Colombia, Peru, Panama, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela and Ecuador will no longer have to pay for a 10-day quarantine in a hotel. Although there will be no red nations left, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the red list will remain in place as a precautionary measure and countries could be added if needed. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments have confirmed they will follow suit. Meanwhile, fully vaccinated travellers returning to England can now use cheaper lateral flow tests - instead of PCR ones. The same rule change will apply to the rest of the UK from 31 October.

Six million people in England have received a Covid-19 booster vaccine, six weeks after the programme launched, NHS England says. More than half of over-50s, who are eligible to receive the jab, have had their booster. Last week, nearly 1.6 million boosters were given to those eligible. More than 86 million vaccines have been delivered, and nine in 10 adults have had their first dose. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, says: âBooster vaccines are by far our best protection against the virus as we head into winter and it is fantastic to see enthusiasm continue to grow as more people become eligible, with millions of lifesaving top-ups delivered across England already."" Across the UK, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. Usually it will be Pfizer or Moderna. Much of the world is grappling with high Covid infection rates while also trying to return to normal life. In Mexico, worshippers ask St Jude Thaddeus, a patron saint of impossible and desperate causes, to bring an end to the pandemic Activists stage a demonstration in Rome to protest global vaccine inequity in the face of huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies Members of the Russian Communist Party wore red masks during an event in Moscow, which is seeing record cases A medical worker takes a swab sample from a child in Zhangye, northwest China A health official prepares for a Covid Halloween in Seoul, South Korea Beijing residents have been told to postpone weddings and keep funeral ceremonies short, as Covid measures are ramped up across China before the Winter Olympics kick off in the capital. China has reported a tiny number of Covid infections since its initial epidemic last year. This is down to strict border restrictions and targeted lockdowns. But China is now seeing rising cases in a dozen regions linked to tourists. Cases are still far lower than in most countries, with 48 new domestic infections bringing the number to below 250 in the past week. But tens of thousands of people in Beijing - which hosts the Winter Olympics in February - have been placed under lockdown after a handful of cases were detected. The city's residents should ""postpone weddings, keep funerals brief, don't organise banquets, and reduce unnecessary gatherings"", deputy chief of the city's disease control centre Pang Xinghuo told reporters, according to AFP. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Passengers onboard two trains bound for Beijing found themselves in for a surprise yesterday when their journeys came to an abrupt halt, and they were all sent to quarantine. According to Chinaâs nationalGlobal Times,externalnewspaper, a train from Shanghai and a train from nearby Zhejiang province were halted, after a government notice was issued stating that crew members had been on the same train as people who had tested positive for Covid-19. Collectively, there were more than 300 passengers on board. One passenger told the newspaper that their train suddenly stopped, and medical staff boarded in hazmat suits, and told them to switch to medical-grade masks. Strict control measures have been routinely enforced in China. The country has a zero-Covid strategy, meaning that one symptomatic case can result in an entire city being locked down, as happened in thecity of Heihe in Heilongjiang province earlier this week,external. There are fears at the moment of a widespread winter outbreak. Since 16 October, cases have reached 14 of Chinaâs 31 provincial-level regions. The Peopleâs Daily says there has been more than 200 confirmed cases and âmany infected people had travelled by plane or trainâ. However, official media report that at least 75% of Chinaâs population are fully vaccinated. Russia has reported 1,163
new Covid-19 deaths, its highest one-day toll of the pandemic. It comes amid a surge in cases that has resulted in officials reinstating some lockdown measures. Deaths have set new records in nine of the past 11 days. Russia will go into a national workplace shutdown for the
first week of November. Moscow reinstated partial lockdown measures on Thursday, with only essential shops
like pharmacies and supermarkets permitted to stay open. To keep Wales ""safe and open"", Drakeford says it is necessary to strengthen the Covid measures already in place and ""that will need everybodyâs help over the next three
weeks"". He says: ""If rates continue to rise rather than fall, the cabinet will have
to consider raising the alert level [which is currently zero] and
reintroducing some further restrictions at the next review. ""None of us want to see that happen â so over the coming three
weeks we will strengthen six measures â from the requirement to wear face coverings
to changing the guidance on self-isolation to reflect the latest evidence of
household transmission."" He announces that people who are fully vaccinated - or aged five to 17 - will now need to
isolate until they have a negative PCR test if they live in the same household
as someone who has Covid-19. Covid passes are also being extended over the next three weeks. They are already compulsory for nightclubs and large indoor events
in Wales but Drakeford says their use will be extended to theatres, cinemas and concert halls in
two weeksâ time. The R number for England has risen, according to the latestgovernment figures,external. The latest R number estimate is 1.1 to 1.3 - up from 1.0 to 1.2 last week. An R value between 1.1 and 1.3 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people. A growth rate of between +1% and +3% means that the number of new infections is growing by between 1% and 3% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. Today's live page was brought to you by Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Jo Couzens, Alex Therrien and Sophie Gallagher. The editors were Emma Harrison and Francesca Gillett. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines: Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After a month of steadily
rising case numbers, during which the daily case rate rose by more than a
third, weâve had hopeful news each day this week. Sundayâs cases were lower
than the number reported a week before. And that pattern has been repeated six
days in a row. The chart below shows that
the seven-day average for cases reported has fallen by more than 5,000 to just
above 41,000 cases a day. One note of caution: there
may be an effect of mid-term holidays. So itâs certainly too soon to get
carried away and say that weâre definitely on the way down from a peak. But the modellers advising
government have been hopeful for some time that the combination of vaccinations
plus the high levels of infections weâve seen since July are putting enough
immunity in the path of the virus to slow its spread. We brought you the news a short while ago that more than seven million of the UKâs most vulnerable people have now received their
Covid-19 booster jab, according to the latest government figures. Health
Secretary Sajid Javid says the booster programme is ""accelerating"" and he is urging ""everyone eligible to get their booster
as soon as they can"". And Vaccines
Minister Maggie Throup emphasised the importance of vaccines over the colder months. ""If youâre eligible for a
booster jab, or youâre yet to come forward for your first or second jab, make
sure to book it as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you,"" she adds. TomÃ¡s Smyth sells his Wholey Cow brand of milk Vending machines might be associated with fizzy drinks and chocolate bars but there is a growing body of small business owners using the technology in new ways. The appeal of an unmanned convenience store that uses contactless payment was obvious when the Covid pandemic began, as customers were trying to reduce face-to-face contact. And in the last 12 monthsso-called automated micro markets grew by 367%, according to David Llewellyn, chief executive of the Vending and Automated Retail Association. One of these business owners was TomÃ¡s Smyth who launched Mr Smyth's Milk Shack to sell his Wholey Cow brand of milk at the end of March 2020. ""For two months it was crazy, 80 to 90 people in a queue here every day,"" says Smyth, a dairy farmer in Ireland's County Louth. And the options are expanding: you can now buy eyelashes from a vending machine (at Lash Loft in Newcastle) or perfume (from Russia's Perfumatic) and even prescriptions. A stranded tourist leaves the Ejin Banner on a charter train Tourists are beginning to leave China's Inner Mongolia after a swift lockdown this week left more than 10,000 people stranded in the Ejin Banner region. China's Xinhua news agency said transport had been arranged out of the area for some 500 travellers. They left Inner Mongolia on a train for the eastern city of Zhengzhou. Localised lockdowns were imposed last week and a strict stay at home order was issued for everyone in the Ejin Banner on Monday. Residents and tourists were told,externalthat ""those who violate the rulesâ¦ will face severe punishments according to the law"". Given the region's landmass and comparatively small population, there have been reports of people struggling to get food and necessities. The Ejin Banner is located in the Gobi Desert, next to the Mongolian border. It is roughly the size of South Korea and has a population of around 30,000 people.

""We must get vaccinated,"" he said, adding that ""it is the only solution"". Only about 20% of Ukrainians are fully vaccinated.

Call for rich nations to airlift surplus vaccines,"This video can not be played Former UK PM Gordon Brown calls for richer countries to airlift surplus vaccines More than 160 former world leaders and global figures have called on the UK and other rich countries to immediately airlift millions of surplus Covid vaccines to less developed nations. They say it would be unethical for doses to be wasted while thousands are dying with the virus every day. The call comes in a letter, organised by former prime minister Gordon Brown. It is addressed to Italian PM Mario Draghi, who is hosting the G20 group of major economies in Rome this weekend. Mr Brown told BBC Breakfast: ""Countries have over-ordered and they're over-stocked and they're not giving the vaccines out quickly enough so a lot of vaccines could be wasted past their expiry date."" The letter's signatories include 36 former presidents, 30 ex-prime ministers and another 100 influential global figures. Among them is the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso. What difference could a billion jabs make? How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? While more than six billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, they say 70% of these were administered by only a few countries and just 2% of people in low-income countries have received a jab. The letter says that between them the US, EU, UK and Canada will have 240 million unused vaccines by the end of this month, which could be airlifted immediately to countries most in need. Millions more vaccines should be transferred each month, totalling 1.1 billion in the next four months, it adds. If this is achieved, it says the World Health Organization's target for 70% of all adults to be vaccinated by spring next year can be met. ""Without a detailed plan, 100 million vaccine doses will have passed their use-by date at the end of the year,"" the letter says. ""If we do not act quickly, that figure could exceed 200 million by the end of January 2022."" Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST The UKhas pledged to donate more than 100 million doses over the next year, while the US has pledged 500 million doses. In total, the G7 group of nations promised to donate more than 870 million doses at a summit in the UK in June. The vaccines will mainly be delivered through the Covax vaccine scheme, which aims to reach the most vulnerable 20% of every nation around the world. Meanwhile, the president of Indonesia, where around 30% of the population are fully vaccinated,has also urged richer countries to share their doses. ""Everyone has helped, but in my opinion it's not enough,"" Joko Widodo told the BBC.

Menopause 'made me feel I was disappearing'HRT can help women going through the menopause and one MP is trying to make it free on the NHS.,"""I am a Wednesday and a Sunday person. Don't laugh, but I deep condition my hair, put on a face pack and change my HRT patch. It's all self-care in one go."" Fifty-one year-old Adelle Martin is sitting in the pub she runs in Rochester in Kent, showing us the HRT patches she sticks on her hip twice a week. Now post-menopausal, she coaches other women through a life stage which can be extremely challenging. Adelle's menopausal symptoms started very early, when she was just 39, and working in finance. She went through the menopause itself three years later and says the experience affected everything about her life. ""It was like I was disappearing inside myself - I could be really, really tearful or really, really grumpy and that was really difficult for the people around me. ""When I was at work and with my team, I had to try hard not to cry and not to scream."" Drug exports restricted 'to protect NHS patients' Medical leaders demand action over HRT shortages Disciplined for taking time off during menopause She lost her confidence, suffered from mood swings and ""brain fog"". She also had the classic symptom associated with menopause - the hot flush. ""It is the most burning feeling ever. What people see is the sweat. For me, it was burning and tightening of my chest and the feeling of suffocating sometimes and wanting to get out."" Adelle says she even had one of the stranger of the 34 symptoms of menopause - the sensation of getting electric shocks. She laughs. ""That was quite funny"" Overall, what was happening to her though was anything but funny. Her voice starts to crack as she recalls having to take time out of her job. ""The hardest thing was looking in the mirror and not recognising yourself and that's what took me out of the boardroom. ""The confidence had gone, I felt hot all the time, my skin, my hair... everything lacked. I felt like I just completely lost myself. At the time I didn't know what it was. It was the menopause."" Relief came when Adelle asked to be put on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which, she says, stopped her hot flushes and helped her think more clearly. Nine years on, she still uses the patches to guard against any possible weakening of her bones. Each prescription costs Â£9.35 on the NHS. Adelle currently gets one box every three months but used to pay for it every month before asking her GP for a longer prescription. She has one patch that contains two hormones - oestrogen and progesterone. Some women have to buy them separately, which means they pay twice. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prescriptions are free on the NHS. Labour MP Carolyn Harris has put forward a Private Members' Bill to Parliament calling for that to be extended to England too. She acknowledges HRT is ""not for everyone"" but says there should be choice. Labour's Carolyn Harris wants HRT prescriptions to be free on the NHS in England ""We're talking about 51% of the population who are suffering this and need the choices to make this decision if they want HRT."" She is putting the bill forward as part of a wider campaign to raise awareness of the menopause. ""It's not just about the HRT, it's about education, it's about employment, it's about relationships, it's about sharing, it's about talking about it."" The bill certainly has got Westminster talking about the menopause. Health Minister Maria Caulfield has promised it will be a priority in the government's forthcoming Women's Health Strategy. She made the commitment in a debate to mark World Menopause Month. Several female MPs had earlier shared their personal experiences, symptoms and all. Speaking up to end the stigma around menopause Early menopause 'feels like you've been robbed' With millions of women eligible, the cost of making HRT free in England would be significant. It's not just menopausal women who have to pay regularly for prescriptions. People with long-term health conditions have been campaigning for their medications to become free in England too. The Prescription Charges Coalition is a group of 51 organisations calling on the government to scrap charges for those with long-term conditions. Coalition chair Laura Cockram says the cost of buying multiple items can prove difficult. ""If you're somebody who has Parkinson's, you could have eight or nine medications each month so it's really expensive to live with a long-term condition like that,"" she says. ""You can buy a pre-payment certificate - for three months, it costs just over Â£30. For 12 months, it costs just over Â£108. But some people have told us, particularly those with long-term conditions, that actually that is quite a lot of money to find to pay that upfront cost."" According to the Menopause Charity, only 12% of menopausal women in the UK take HRT. Some argue that misinformation and a lack of knowledge can be more of a barrier for women than cost. A flawed study conducted in the US in the early 2000s led to misleading publicity about the possible risks of HRT, which is still blamed by some for putting women off taking it. The government says it is ""crucial"" the menopause is ""taken seriously and women get the support they need"". It says it is ""deeply committed to ensuring women are able to access high quality menopause treatment, including HRT, which can be a lifeline for women who are experiencing severe symptoms.""

Biden unveils 'once in a generation' plan,"US President Joe Biden has called for trillions in spending aimed at re-igniting America's economic growth by upgrading its crumbling infrastructure and tackling climate change. The $2.3tn (Â£1.7tn) proposal would direct billions to initiatives such as charging stations for electric vehicles and eliminating lead water pipes. The spending would be partially offset by raising taxes on businesses. Those plans have already roused fierce opposition. Republicans have called the rises ""a recipe for stagnation and decline"", while powerful business lobby groups including the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce said they supported investments but would oppose tax increases. The pushback is a sign of the tough fight ahead for the plan, which needs approval from Congress. Joe Biden could have gone in a number of different policy directions after narrowly getting his covid pandemic aid package through Congress. That he opted to push for an infrastructure bill, rather than upping the pressure for gun control, voting rights, immigration, the environment or healthcare reform, suggests he's looking for a popular, non-controversial legislative second act. Of course, like that coronavirus package, the Biden administration is likely to use a massive piece of legislation to quietly advance some of those other policy priorities. The proposal contains hundreds of millions of dollars in green energy spending, expanded care for the elderly and disabled and job training, for instance. Also like the coronavirus aid bill, even non-controversial infrastructure provisions that have high public support will be swamped in partisan acrimony. In particular, Republicans are going to vehemently object to the tax increases for corporations and businesses contained in the proposed legislation. Chances are, Democrats will again have to go it alone when it comes to passing Biden's legislative agenda. The challenge, then, will be keeping the Democratic coalition together at a time when a wide number of constituencies, many of whom held their tongue during the Covid negotiations, line up to ensure their priorities are funded. The White House has promoted its proposal as the most ambitious public spending in decades, saying the investments are necessary to keep the US economy growing and competitive with other countries, especially China. ""This is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Mr Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. ""It's a once in a generation investment in America."" It calls for investing more than $600bn in infrastructure, including modernising roads, replacing rail cars and buses and repairing crumbling bridges. Billions more would be devoted to initiatives like improving veterans hospitals, upgrading affordable housing, expanding high-speed broadband, and providing incentives for manufacturing and technology research. It calls for money to be directed to rural communities and communities of colour, including establishing a national climate-focused laboratory affiliated with an historically black university. Civic Works runs programmes focused on job training for green careers in Baltimore, MD The spending, which would have to be approved by Congress, would roll out over eight years. The White House said tax increases would offset the cost over 15 years. Mr Biden called for raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a move that would partially undo cuts the US passed in 2017. He also proposed raising the minimum rate charged for overseas profits. In his speech, in an acknowledgment such plans are likely to face, he said he was also ""open to other ideas"" when it came to paying for the spending. ""Failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors,"" he said. ""The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future."" Mr Biden's proposal - which closely resembles promises he made during last year's election campaign - comes just weeks after Democrats muscled through $1.9tn more in aid to address the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, approving that package without Republican support. It's not clear yet how much of Mr Biden's latest plan will make it through Congress - or how much of another spending package focused on areas such as childcare and education that he plans to unveil in coming weeks. Biden signs $1.9tn Covid relief bill into law Biden warns China will 'eat our lunch' on spending Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the speedy advance of the pandemic package was unusual. ""Normally the negotiations drag on for months and what eventually gets passed, if anything gets passed at all, bears only a passing resemblance to what the administration originally asked for,"" he said. ""We suspect these negotiations will revert to the mean."" Eli Allen is director of the Center for Sustainable Careers at Civic Works, a non-profit organisation that offers programmes such as job training focused on careers in sustainable energy in Baltimore, Maryland, a majority black city near Washington, DC. He said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that something resembling Mr Biden's ambitions would eventually pass and  was particularly heartened by Mr Biden's emphasis on creating ""quality jobs"" in terms of pay and benefits - which he said could help set a standard across the industry. ""The focus on racial equity is not something we've seen in some of the past federal programmes that we've worked with,"" he added. ""I think that focus â¦ is very important as we think about strategies to expand access to these jobs, especially for communities of colour."" Joe Biden delivered his speech in Pittsburgh, which has been working to reinvent its economy Stefani Pashman is chief executive of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, a regional economic development group in Pittsburgh, the former steel town in Pennsylvania where Mr Biden delivered his speech on Wednesday. The city, located in a state that was key to Mr Biden's election victory, has been working to reinvent itself as a centre for high-tech research in areas such as autonomous vehicles. Ms Pashman said the president's promise of billions of government dollars has also injected new energy into ambitious local plans, like an effort by Carnegie Mellon University and rail technology company Wabtec to establish a new research lab focused on innovations in freight rail, like autonomous trains. ""The idea is to transform the rail industry â¦ but we need $600m from the federal government to amplify what we're able to do at the local level,"" she said. ""The past few years â¦ I don't think the government was positioned to take this on at the level that it needs to be addressed and invested in to propel our region's economy and all the economies of the nation,"" she added. ""It's clear that they're prioritizing infrastructure in a new way.""

"Amazon to pay billions to stop Christmas shortagesThe online retail giant said it would take steps to ""minimise the impact"" of supply chain issues.","Amazon has said it will spend several billion dollars to manage labour shortages and supply chain issues in the run-up to Christmas. The online retail giant said it was doing ""whatever it takes to minimise the impact"" on customers and sellers. Meanwhile, Apple said a shortage of semiconductor chips had cost it $6bn (Â£4.35bn) in lost sales. The tech giant's boss, Tim Cook, admitted its problems would persist over the festive period. While the technology giant said fourth-quarter sales rose 29% to $83.4bn, they fell short of expectations. Profit rose to $20.5bn from $12.6bn. Mr Cook said it had experienced ""larger-than-expected supply constraints"" in the three months to 25 September and the chip shortage was now affecting ""most of our products"". Apple said it lost $6bn in sales due to a shortage of chips which are used in products such as the iPhone Amazon said it would have to spend a significant amount of money to manage its own shortages. Chief executive Andy Jassy said Amazon expected to ""incur several billion dollars of additional costs"" as it managed its way through ""labour supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs"". ""It'll be expensive for us in the short term, but it's the right prioritisation for our customers and partners,"" he added. Amazon's profits dropped sharply to $3.2bn from $6.3bn in the third quarter to 30 September, on sales 15% higher at $110.8bn. Why Christmas may be stuck in a shipping container Amazon offers Â£3,000 bonuses to attract staff George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC: ""It shows that these global giants - and they are just vastly huge businesses - are not immune from the problems that every business is facing."" Businesses across the world have been grappling with shortages and issues with supply chains as economies have rebooted following coronavirus lockdowns. A global chip shortage is causing delays on the production lines of many products - including cars, washing machines, and smartphones - because supply has not kept pace with demand. Surging demand for goods, including those sold by Amazon, has led to increased congestion at ports in many countries, with retailers sounding the alarm bell that deliveries for the holiday season could be delayed. In California in the US, there have been record-breaking queues of container ships outside major ports. Amazon's staffing issues has led to the retailer offering one-off payments of up to Â£3,000 in a bid to attract staff in UK regions where there is high demand for labour. The firm is hiring for 20,000 positions across its UK network during the festive season amid fears over worker shortages. It also began offering a Â£1,000 signing-on bonus to recruit permanent staff in some regions in August. Pay for the temporary roles starts at a minimum of Â£10 per hour, rising to Â£11.10 in some parts of the UK. In the past, Amazon has faced accusations of poor working conditions both in the UK and the US, where it is the country's second largest employer. Reuters reported Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky had said worker shortages contributed to inconsistent staffing levels at the company. He said staff became its primary capacity constraint in the third quarter, which he added was having an impact on other areas of the business.

Menopause 'made me feel I was disappearing'HRT can help women going through the menopause and one MP is trying to make it free on the NHS.UK Politics,"""I am a Wednesday and a Sunday person. Don't laugh, but I deep condition my hair, put on a face pack and change my HRT patch. It's all self-care in one go."" Fifty-one year-old Adelle Martin is sitting in the pub she runs in Rochester in Kent, showing us the HRT patches she sticks on her hip twice a week. Now post-menopausal, she coaches other women through a life stage which can be extremely challenging. Adelle's menopausal symptoms started very early, when she was just 39, and working in finance. She went through the menopause itself three years later and says the experience affected everything about her life. ""It was like I was disappearing inside myself - I could be really, really tearful or really, really grumpy and that was really difficult for the people around me. ""When I was at work and with my team, I had to try hard not to cry and not to scream."" Drug exports restricted 'to protect NHS patients' Medical leaders demand action over HRT shortages Disciplined for taking time off during menopause She lost her confidence, suffered from mood swings and ""brain fog"". She also had the classic symptom associated with menopause - the hot flush. ""It is the most burning feeling ever. What people see is the sweat. For me, it was burning and tightening of my chest and the feeling of suffocating sometimes and wanting to get out."" Adelle says she even had one of the stranger of the 34 symptoms of menopause - the sensation of getting electric shocks. She laughs. ""That was quite funny"" Overall, what was happening to her though was anything but funny. Her voice starts to crack as she recalls having to take time out of her job. ""The hardest thing was looking in the mirror and not recognising yourself and that's what took me out of the boardroom. ""The confidence had gone, I felt hot all the time, my skin, my hair... everything lacked. I felt like I just completely lost myself. At the time I didn't know what it was. It was the menopause."" Relief came when Adelle asked to be put on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which, she says, stopped her hot flushes and helped her think more clearly. Nine years on, she still uses the patches to guard against any possible weakening of her bones. Each prescription costs Â£9.35 on the NHS. Adelle currently gets one box every three months but used to pay for it every month before asking her GP for a longer prescription. She has one patch that contains two hormones - oestrogen and progesterone. Some women have to buy them separately, which means they pay twice. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prescriptions are free on the NHS. Labour MP Carolyn Harris has put forward a Private Members' Bill to Parliament calling for that to be extended to England too. She acknowledges HRT is ""not for everyone"" but says there should be choice. Labour's Carolyn Harris wants HRT prescriptions to be free on the NHS in England ""We're talking about 51% of the population who are suffering this and need the choices to make this decision if they want HRT."" She is putting the bill forward as part of a wider campaign to raise awareness of the menopause. ""It's not just about the HRT, it's about education, it's about employment, it's about relationships, it's about sharing, it's about talking about it."" The bill certainly has got Westminster talking about the menopause. Health Minister Maria Caulfield has promised it will be a priority in the government's forthcoming Women's Health Strategy. She made the commitment in a debate to mark World Menopause Month. Several female MPs had earlier shared their personal experiences, symptoms and all. Speaking up to end the stigma around menopause Early menopause 'feels like you've been robbed' With millions of women eligible, the cost of making HRT free in England would be significant. It's not just menopausal women who have to pay regularly for prescriptions. People with long-term health conditions have been campaigning for their medications to become free in England too. The Prescription Charges Coalition is a group of 51 organisations calling on the government to scrap charges for those with long-term conditions. Coalition chair Laura Cockram says the cost of buying multiple items can prove difficult. ""If you're somebody who has Parkinson's, you could have eight or nine medications each month so it's really expensive to live with a long-term condition like that,"" she says. ""You can buy a pre-payment certificate - for three months, it costs just over Â£30. For 12 months, it costs just over Â£108. But some people have told us, particularly those with long-term conditions, that actually that is quite a lot of money to find to pay that upfront cost."" According to the Menopause Charity, only 12% of menopausal women in the UK take HRT. Some argue that misinformation and a lack of knowledge can be more of a barrier for women than cost. A flawed study conducted in the US in the early 2000s led to misleading publicity about the possible risks of HRT, which is still blamed by some for putting women off taking it. The government says it is ""crucial"" the menopause is ""taken seriously and women get the support they need"". It says it is ""deeply committed to ensuring women are able to access high quality menopause treatment, including HRT, which can be a lifeline for women who are experiencing severe symptoms.""

The odd couple blocking Biden's climate agenda,"Joe Biden heads to Glasgow in the coming days for a crucial climate summit at which he hopes to cajole international partners into era-defining commitments to reduce carbon emissions. But two senators could undermine his green credentials at the worst possible time. In a Senate balanced on a knife's edge between Democrats and Republicans, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have found their moment. They may share the moderate lane of the party, the centre ground of US politics, but beyond that the two could hardly be more different. The rugged 74-year-old man from the mountains of West Virginia and the 45-year-old iconoclastic woman from the deserts of Arizona. One enjoys extended chats with political reporters and hosts parties for fellow senators on his houseboat. The other barely speaks to the press and flies back to her home state at the slightest opportunity. But for all their differences, they are united in opposing parts of Joe Biden's ambitious climate programme - with its ultimate goal of reducing US greenhouse gas emissions to half of 2005 levels. And now it's a race to strike an agreement on a spending bill that allays their concerns without diluting the US president's green agenda before he arrives in Glasgow on Sunday. What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all So what is driving their thinking? On Sunday morning in Wilmington, Delaware, the president of the United States, the majority leader of the US Senate and the senator from West Virginia sat down for breakfast. Manchin, hailing from a rural state with only 1.8 million people and a fraction of a percent of the total US gross domestic product, was the one calling the shots. Because of a legislative procedure, Biden and the Democratic congressional leadership hope to use to pass their upcoming spending package with a simple majority, Manchin's support could be the difference between success and failure. The West Virginian had already effectively scuttled what was the centrepiece of Biden's legislative climate agenda, a $150bn programme that would have rewarded energy producers that switched to renewable sources of power and fined those that continued to rely on fossil fuels. Now he is reportedly targeting a fee on the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. He has said he is more amenable to investments in renewable resources as long as they are accompanied by research to make fossil fuel cleaner and don't endanger existing subsidies for the energy industry. Is Trump's power over Republicans starting to slip? Part of Manchin's concern with Biden's social-spending and climate agenda is ideological. Manchin is a centrist in a party that is trending more to the left. He's a throwback to a time when his state was controlled by Democrats, but last year Republican Donald Trump won West Virginia by 39 percentage points. Manchin is now the lone Democratic holdout in West Virginia politics and, if he were to choose not to run for re-election in 2024, his seat would almost certainly flip to the Republicans. Another component of Manchin's view, on climate in particular, is practical. He is one of the two senators - the other a Republican - from a state whose economy is dominated by the coal industry. In 2019, the most recent year for which there are figures, coal contributed $9.1bn to the West Virginian economy and accounted for about 27,000 jobs. Manchin's energy investments personally provided him with almost half a million dollars in income in 2020. Energy companies gave more to Manchin's political campaigns than any other senator's. Art installation in NYC about climate change From his perch as chair of the Senate Energy Committee, Manchin has a particular interest in the climate policies his party - and president - seek to enact. And climate policies that present an existential threat to his state's energy business have little hope of escaping his reach. If Manchin's motives to scale back Biden's climate agenda are reasonably clear, the reasoning of the other key Senate centrist on the issue is more of a cipher. Sinema started her career in politics as an activist in the Green Party, before she began a steady climb up through Arizona elective office. As she's elevated her position, she's moved steadily toward the middle of the political spectrum, culminating in her Senate victory in 2018, the first for a Democrat in the state in 30 years. Sinema is a keen triathlete and once completed an Ironman In the past year, she's infuriated her party with a vote against raising the minimum wage and by skipping a procedural vote on forming a committee to investigate the January attack on the US Capitol. She's also frustrated liberal activists by keeping her public statements about the spending-bill negotiations to a minimum. Where Manchin will frequently spell out what he will - and won't - support, Sinema treats reporters - and their questions - like a toxic outbreak. How 'Let's go Brandon' became an anti-Biden jeer Sinema's relative silence has created a cottage industry of speculation about her motivations and objectives. The left wing of the party point to her frequent meetings with corporate lobbyists as evidence that she's in league with big business interests, perhaps preparing herself for a lucrative post-Senate career. It's a theory political reporter Joshua Marshall of the website Talking Points Memo doesn't buy. ""You just don't work that hard and that successfully to climb the ladder of political power to flame out after one Senate term to get a job as a lobbyist,""he writes,external. ""The money isn't that good."" Death Valley is getting hotter and drier Marshall speculates that Sinema is styling herself after the late Arizona Senator John McCain, who frequently quarrelled with his fellow Republicans and, shortly before his death, cast a deciding vote against his party to block the repeal of Democratic health-insurance reforms in 2017. McCain's maverick persona - along with his war-hero record - helped him become an institution in Arizona and ultimately win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Sinema's calculation may be that the key to success in her state, and perhaps nationally, is to burnish her independent credentials. In a state where registered independents outnumber Democrats, it could be a winning strategy. And so she has expressed opposition to some of the bigger-ticket green-energy subsidies, community funding and spending items in Biden's climate package, while still voicing interest in a tax on carbon used in energy-production (an idea that probably won't fly with Manchin, however). There's already talk in liberal circles of mounting a challenge to Sinema in the 2024 Arizona Democratic primary, and left-wing activists have taken to chasing her through airports and in other public spaces to pressure her to be more of a party team player. Manchin has faced similar scrutiny - and liberal outcry. It is, perhaps, a reflection of just how effective efforts by these two centrists have been that Democrats on the left have become increasingly frustrated with the diminished size of the final bill - and a left-wing rebellion against the final agreement is still a possibility. It may be too late, however. While the party's liberal flank has succeeded in delaying passage of an accompanying bipartisan infrastructure bill that both Sinema and Manchin have championed, the size of the president's social spending package has been reduced by trillions of dollars - and the scope of the climate measures have been significantly curtailed - because of the two centrists' efforts. The liberal wing of the party has been scathing in its criticism of Manchin and Sinema According toreporting by Axios,external, the White House has scrambled to find a number of new ways to cut emissions, having lost the battle with Manchin over the cleaner energy grid. As Biden prepares to head to Scotland for next week's climate summit, it will be Manchin and Sinema who are defining the limits of what he can promise the US will deliver - and, perhaps, whether he can make any promises at all.

VideoAll the times the US spent big on infrastructure,"This video can not be played The US federal government played a key role in developing infrastructure over the course of the 20th Century, from the public works project of the 1930s to the building of the highways in the 1950s. Now, Joe Biden hopes to build on that legacy with a $2tn (Â£1.4tn) plan that would mark the largest federal investment in infrastructure ""in a generation"". Where does it rank among the largest projects in American history? The president's plan has received criticism from Republicans for defining infrastructure too widely. Only about 6% of the spending would go directly towards roads and bridges. The bill makes significant investments in home-care services, job-training, expansion of broadband access, electric vehicle incentives and R&D.
