Imps exceed 'wildest dreams' on day of shocks,"This video can not be played FA Cup: Non-league Lincoln City make history Lincoln boss Danny Cowley said guiding the Imps to the fifth round of the FA Cup was ""beyond my wildest dreams"", as the non-league side once again stole the headlines on a day of high drama. Lincoln's 3-1 win over Championship leaders Brighton was just one chapter in an enthralling afternoon of football that also saw Wolves dump out Liverpool, Oxford upset Newcastle, and League Two Wycombe come agonisingly close to stunning Tottenham at White Hart Lane. The fourth-round action led BBC Sport pundit Garth Crooks to proclaim the FA Cup ""alive and well"". ""It was a magnificent day with some wonderful performances,"" he said. ""Wycombe were sensational, as were Lincoln."" Lincoln are only the third non-league team to reach the FA Cup fifth round since the turn of the century, after Crawley Town in 2010-11 and Luton Town in 2012-13 BBC One is showing two live FA Cup ties on Sunday. Millwall host Watford at 12:00 GMT, followed at 16:00 GMT by holders Manchester United against Wigan. Catch up with all of Saturday's FA Cup goals and reports This video can not be played Highlights: Lincoln 3-1 Brighton The last time Lincoln reached the last 16 of the FA Cup was in the 1901-02 season, a run that featured a victory over a cash-strapped team from the north-west of England named Newton Heath, who within weeks would be issued with a winding-up order before being saved and renamed Manchester United in April 1902. The fortunes of those two sides have differed wildly over the past 115 years, but Lincoln at least have the pleasure of knowing their place in the fifth-round draw on Monday evening is already assured, with holders United in action at Wigan on Sunday. After dominating Ipswich in their third-round replay earlier this month, National League leaders Lincoln faced an altogether sterner taskagainst in-form Brighton, who made nine changes for the game at Sincil Bank but nevertheless deservedly led at the break. Chris Hughton's visitors went in front through Richie Towell's well-taken strike, but the hosts rallied after the break, levelling through Alan Power's penalty before Fikayo Tomori's own goal gave them the lead. Theo Robinson, who scored twice at Ipswich in the third round, added the third on the break to confirm the Imps' place in the next round. ""I'm surprised. It's not often football surprises me, but today..."" said Lincoln boss Cowley. ""I was really pleased that we were able to stay in the game [after going behind]. ""It's surreal, and it's been surreal for quite a period of time. The first Ipswich game, seeing those 5,000 away supporters and hearing the noise they made, from that moment onwards it's been crazy - but a good crazy. ""I can't believe the scenes and the emotion and the support."" This video can not be played Highlights: Tottenham 4-3 Wycombe It was a case of what might have been for brave Wycombe, who led 2-0 and 3-2 before succumbing to aheartbreaking 4-3 loss at White Hart Lane. Son Heung-min's stoppage-time winner rescued the Premier League side, who were rocked on their heels by Paul Hayes' sweetly struck left-footed volley that put Wycombe ahead. The captain grabbed his second from the spot to double the visitors' lead before Son's deflected effort on the hour and a Vincent Janssen penalty four minutes later pulled Spurs level. Substitute Garry Thompson headed in Myles Weston's cross with seven minutes to go to put Gareth Ainsworth's side back in front, but Dele Alli pulled Spurs level again before Son scrambled in a late winner. ""The lads have done me and the town so proud,"" Wycombe boss Ainsworth said. ""It was an outstanding effort from the boys. I am so proud, disappointed but it is now back to the reality of Exeter away."" This video can not be played Highlights: Liverpool 1-2 Wolves At Anfield, Championship strugglers Wolves recordeda stunning 2-1 victoryover a Liverpool side who have now managed only one win in eight games in 2017. Richard Stearman put the visitors ahead after only 53 seconds, left unmarked to head in Helder Costa's free-kick, before Costa set up Andreas Weimann to double Wolves' lead before the break. Divock Origi pulled one back but Paul Lambert's men held on to reach the fifth round for the first time since 2008. What is going wrong for Liverpool? Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said: ""I am responsible for this performance because I thought this line-up was ready for this game but obviously we weren't and that doesn't feel too good. ""I could look for excuses but I don't want to. Maybe we should use this time to be disappointed, to be frustrated, to be angry at ourselves. All I can say, sorry."" This video can not be played Highlights: Oxford 3-0 Newcastle League One Oxford reached the fifth round for the first time in 23 years with a3-0 winover Championship promotion-chasers Newcastle. Kane Hemmings met a Chey Dunkley back-post header to put Oxford ahead before Aleksandar Mitrovic missed the chance to level when his penalty was saved low down by Simon Eastwood. Curtis Nelson added Oxford's second before Toni Martinez sealed a famous win. ""I said to the players at half-time that they wouldn't get a better opportunity to get into the last 16 of the FA Cup,"" Oxford manager Michael Appleton said. ""For me personally, with the squad Newcastle have got, this surpasses beating Arsenal at Emirates Stadium when I was at Blackburn [in the fifth round four years ago]. That's how big this is. ""It feels fantastic. It won't be long before Newcastle are plying their trade in the Premier League and, with the squad they've got, they'll be challenging in the top half, I believe. ""I think that belief really told in the last 15 minutes and I thought the players were magnificent.""

Theresa May hand in hand with Trump,"""It was the unlikeliest of double acts,"" saysThe Times,external, as Theresa May and President Trump's face-to-face meeting appears on many front pages. The Daily Mail refers to Donald Trump and Theresa May as ""an odd couple."" TheDaily Mirror,externalthinks it was ""like watching Julie Andrews hang out with Hugh Hefner."" The Sun's cartoonist offers a different comparison with Beauty and the Beast in the Disney version.  ""Lady and the Trump"" is the headline in the Daily Star. The iconic image is that of the two leaders walking out to face the press ""hand in hand"", says The Daily Telegraph. Daily Mail columnistQuentin Letts,externalthinks that the late Cilla Black would have been encouraged: ""the blind date was a success."" TheGuardian,external, meanwhile, seems stunned by the ""off-the-scale risk"" that Mrs May took. ""Politically,"" it says, the news conference ""was a dash across sniper's alley."" It adds: ""For Mrs May, the danger was of being collateral damage in a Trump explosion."" Most agreed with the view of the Daily Express that she ""managed this tricky task with aplomb."" The paper writes thinks she has enhanced her standing on both sides of the Atlantic. She has shown, says the Times, ""that engagement beats detachment with the new president in the White House."" The Sun can't resist offering a formal pat on the back: ""Mission accomplished, Theresa."" The Sun reports that Jeremy Corbyn continued to have what used to be styled ""a little local difficulty"" with his party. ""Whenever you think Labour's chaos cannot get worse, it does."" TheMirror,externalthinks the Labour leader was ""rocked"" by another resignation from his shadow cabinet as more of his MPs refused to support the formal start of Brexit. TheExpress,externalsays ""this is terrible conduct on all sides"" and ""it speaks volumes about his incompetence."" But The i did not think the issue was leaving EU, but ""a question about how to save the party... Should it be a party of unity, or principles?"" Chaos and fiasco: words used byThe Times,externalto the long-running problems on Southern Rail. The paper says a trouble-shooter brought in to report on ""Britain's worst performing rail network"" will blame the Department for Transport for ""shoddy management."" A source tells the Times that the report is ""dynamite"" and the paper expects there to be more calls for radical action. What do you do with ""the singed fur and charred feet"" of a weasel that lost its life by interrupting the power supply to the Large Hadron Collider, theGuardian,externalasks. The answer is to put it on display. The paper reports that the ""fried"" remains of the stone marten are now on show at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam.

Serena the greatest? Pick your favourite,"Serena, Graf, Navratilova, Evert, Court, Seles and King have won 109 Grand Slam singles between them Who is the greatest female tennis player of the Open era? It is a question fans love to debate. Of course, it is difficult to compare across eras, with technology and professionalism evolving since the Open era - which allowed professionals to compete alongside amateurs - began in 1968. Is the number of Grand Slam wins what really matters? Serena Williams has won the most in the Open era - her victory in theAustralian Opentaking her to 23. ""Serena is the greatest of all-time because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras,"" says BBC Sport presenter Sue Barker, herself a former French Open champion. Do you agree? From our shortlist, pick your 1-7 using our interactive tool - and if you still can't decide, Sue's analysis below might help. We will announce your greatest on Monday, 30 January. Barker:""Serena has won 23 in an era which is so much more competitive than previous eras. The first, second and third-round matches at Grand Slams are more competitive than they used to be. ""The pace she generates, her serve is without question the greatest ever, and put that with her movement and her power, she pushes her opponents constantly on the back foot."" Barker:""She is the greatest athlete that has ever played the game. Steffi made everything look effortless and incredibly graceful. The big forehand was her trademark. ""She was great for the game and we needed someone like her to take the game forward. However, I do feel she was in an era where she was not well challenged because Gabriela Sabatini went away and then so didMonica Seles after her stabbing.,externalWe never saw a great rivalry develop."" Barker:""Martina was the first person who changed the physical side of the women's game. While we all just went for a three-mile run, she started doing training off court - she did specific gym exercises and built up muscles which we hadn't seen before. She dominated, and the other players had to change. ""Her serve-volley was exceptional. I don't think there has been a better serve-volleyer in the women's game at the top level."" Barker:""She was mentally so incredibly hard. To try to get past Chrissie you knew you were going to suffer - you were going to run and run and run. She never broke down, she didn't make an error and played the big points so well. ""She didn't miss and never got nervous - that's why they called her 'The Ice Princess'. She never look flustered. Mentally she was incredibly strong and solid in every department."" Barker:""Margaret was from a very different era. It is difficult to compare because it was a different game then - it wasn't a hard-hitting game. She was tall and had an incredible wingspan, she could almost touch either sideline! She had great reach so just trying to pass her was very difficult. ""However, most of her Grand Slams were won in Australia - and I sound a little bit disrespectful here - when it was only Australians playing it because no-one went there. I think the records that came later from the others were greater."" Barker:""Monica could have been one of the greatest ever if the stabbing had not happened. She was just beginning to get the better of Steffi. ""I feel tennis was robbed of that incredible rivalry because she was never the same player when she came back - which was totally understandable."" Barker:""Billie Jean is the greatest in terms of the whole sport, combining her Slam wins with everything else she has done off the court in terms of promoting the sport. ""Tennis is probably the best known women's sport because of everything she has done for the game. She was a great champion and moved the game forward."" Order of play - who plays when?

George III's abdication letter released,"A draft letter of abdication written by King George III during the American War of Independence has been made public for the first time. The unused letter - which includes crossings out, redrafts, blotches and scrawls - was written when the king faced political trouble in March 1783. In it, George said he intended to exile himself to Hanover after he abdicated. The letter is one of 350,000 pages in theRoyal Archives,externalto be digitised and made available to view online. The exploration of the Georgian archive, which includes the private papers of George and his wife Charlotte, is the subject of a new documentary, George III: The Genius Of The Mad King. Filmmakers, who had access to the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle, uncovered letters that showed the king - who reigned from 1760 until 1820 - had a network of private agents. One, code-named Aristarchus, asked for payment for intelligence that France was plotting to assassinate the king - dubbed ""the mad king"" - as he walked at night in the Queen's Garden. The handwritten letter included blotches and crossings out Another discovery was a blond lock of the hair of Prince Alfred, who died when he was a baby, sewn into a letter from Charlotte. Academics also uncovered a letter in which the king told Prime Minister Lord North how the Prince of Wales had an ""improper connection"" with an actress who was blackmailing him. Historians says the papers show George, often derided as the king who lost America, had taken a keen interest in the details of the American War of Independence. Andrew Lambert, from King's College London, said they showed the king had taken his job ""very seriously"". ""He is processing knowledge on a proto-industrial scale as a part of his role. He's the best informed chief executive this country has ever had,"" he said. The documentary will air on BBC Two on Monday 30 January at 9pm. Was George III a manic depressive?

Remember - there's still plenty of coverage of the remaining FA Cup games on the BBC Sport website this weekend. Â We'll be back on Tuesday when Reading will look to close the gap to the top two when they travel to Gianfranco Zola's Birmingham in one of seven Championship games. There's also three games in League Two to look forward to. Until then, goodbye. Rotherham United 0-1 Barnsley Adam Armstrong hit a second-half winner as Barnsley won the South Yorkshire derby at Rotherham. The Tykes continued their dominance over their local rivals, winning for the seventh time in the last 11 league meetings.

Queens Park Rangers 1-2 Burton Albion Nigel Clough put aside speculation about becoming Nottingham Forest boss to guide his Burton side to victory at QPR. Goals from Luke Murphy and Lloyd Dyer were enough to win the game, despite Conor Washington pulling one back for Rangers. The results moves the Brewers three points clear of the relegation zone. Nigel Clough puts aside speculation about becoming Nottingham Forest boss to guide his Burton side to victory at QPR. Preston North End 1-1 Ipswich Town Jordan Hugill rescued a point for Preston against Ipswich, a side that has twice attempted to sign the striker recently.

It's time to begin recapping everything you might've missed in our five Championship matches... The Marquis of Goals himself, John Marquis, helped himself to two more asDoncasterran away with a 3-0 win at Yeovil this afternoon. Notts Countyhave enjoyed a bit of positivity this week with their transfer embargo being lifted by the EFL, and their first win since October was enough to drag them out of the bottom two. Jonathan Forte got the winner with minutes remaining. Exetermade it five wins on the bounce to keep up their promotion hopes away to Portsmouth, while, at the other end of the table, bottom sideNewporthanded Dave Jones a losing start to life in charge of Hartlepool, winning 3-1 at Rodney Parade. ScunthorpeÂ go to the top of League One after a hard-earned 3-2 win against Port Vale, with Sheffield United not in action this afternoon. Josh Morris' 19th of the season played a key role in the Irons' victory. MK Donsscored four goals in little more than 30 minutes to demolish Peterborough. Harvey Barnes, Kieran Agard and Chuks Aneke - who scored twice - secured the points. Bolton Wanderers lost at home to lose a bit of ground at the top,Charlton Athleticwinning 2-1 at the Macron Stadium despite going down to 10 men. And it was a goal-fest at Gigg Lane, whereBuryandWalsallshared six goals in the process of picking up a point apiece. Real pendulum-swinging stuff! There's been some decent stories across the EFL this afternoon - all of which we'll be wrapping up during the next half an hour or so - but it's hard to argue against the FA Cup trumping us today. We've had some extraordinary drama and upsets up and down the country, all of which you can follow reaction to byclicking here. Unfortunately the major story in League One this afternoon was around what should not have been on the field rather than what should. Coventry fans protesting against their owners Sisu over long-standing grievances relating to the ground and general running of the club launched flares and made several pitch invasions to delay the match. As for the game itself, their team, reduced to 10 men, were routed by Northampton - ironically on the ground in which they were tenants a few years ago. Keshi Anderson snatched a hat-trick in a 3-0 win. #bbcefl Today's results have had an impact at both ends of the Championship table. Readingare up to third place after beating Cardiff at home. The Royals are now six points behind second-placed Newcastle. Play-off hopefulsBarnsleyandNorwichhave upped the pressure on sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday. The Tykes are one point behind the Owls in 7th, with the Canaries a point and a place further behind. Preston move up to 10th with a draw against Ipswich. Burton,meanwhile, are up to 20th place thanks to victory at QPR. The Brewers are now three points above the bottom three. Take a look at the full Championship table here. Rotherham 0-1 Barnsley South Yorkshire bragging rights are going the way of Barnsley, who have beaten bottom side Rotherham United. Adam Armstrong's second-half goal proved the difference. QPR 1-2 Burton Burton end a run of three straight league defeats to move three points clear of the relegation zone. A reminder - earlier today Brewers boss Nigel Clough was granted permission to speak to Nottingham Forest about their managerial vacancy. Meanwhile, QPR's four-match unbeaten run in the Championship is over. Preston 1-1 Ipswich Mick McCarthy's Ipswich are denied what would have been a crucial three points by a late Jordan Hugill goal, a player the Tractor Boys have been trying to sign. Reading 2-1 Cardiff Reading go third in the Championship with victory over Cardiff, their seventh home win in eight. The Royals' points tally of 52 points matches their entire total from the 2015-16 campaign. Jaap Stam's side are now six points behind second-placed Newcastle and eight points clear of 7th place. Norwich 2-0 Birmingham Norwich close the gap to sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday to two points. Birmingham's wretched form since sacking Gary Rowett last month continues. Norwich 2-0 Birmingham. It's not going to be Birmingham's day. Kerim Frei feeds Craig Gardner on the edge of the box but his powerful shot strikes the bar. That surely means it'll be nine games without a win for Blues boss Gianfranco Zola. Reading 2-1 Cardiff Reading have four minutes of injury time to endure at the MAdejski Stadium. Cardiff are still pressing. Royals keeper Ali Al-Habsi did well moments ago to punch clear PEter Whittingham's corner, with bodies all around him in the six-yard box. Â The mood among the Coventry City support will certainly not have been helped by Keshi Anderson's hat-trick for Northampton. Three goals without reply. It's been miserable. Walsall's comeback is complete, they now lead Bury 3-2 thanks to Jason McCarthy's goal. Bury were flying, 2-0 up at the break... but Erhun Oztumer and McCarthy goals have flipped it. Southend's day has been spoiled at the last. Having coped with taxi rides from the station, the loss of a key player to injury in the warm-up, they did go a goal up. However, David Ball has popped up with a 90th minute equaliser. MK Dons have steamed into a 4-0 lead against Peterborough.

I thought we got a foothold in the game in the first half and they showed the quality theyâve got. Simon Eastwood had to make two very good saves towards the interval. âI said to the players at half-time that they wouldnât get a better opportunity to get into the last 16 of the FA Cup. I said that weâd need to keep our concentration and that Simon would have to make one more important save, thankfully he did that from the penalty. âI thought weâd scored the first goal too soon and for 15 to 20 minutes, they pinned us in a little bit.

Born into a cultSurviving the London sect that locked me away for 30 years," At exactly 11:15, the front door of a council flat in Brixton opened. Two women stepped out on to a quiet residential street. The younger woman, Rosie, had an awkward gait. Her movement was stiff and clunky, as though she simply wasn't used to walking any distance. In fact, she had spent the past 30 years - her whole life - in captivity. Now she was ill and needed urgent medical attention. Born into a “collective”, she was not allowed to see a doctor, had never been allowed outside alone and had been told that if she tried to leave she would spontaneously combust and die. Worried she might not survive her illness, on 25 October 2013, Rosie and another woman, Josie, sneaked out. Waiting for them just round the corner were members of an organisation that helps people who have been abused, trafficked or enslaved. Along with the police, they had helped organise the escape. It soon became apparent that Rosie and 57-year-old Josie weren't the only women who lived in the flat, and when police officers returned they met Aisha - a 69-year-old woman originally from Malaysia. At first she didn't want to leave, but as they talked, she changed her mind. In the weeks that followed, it became clear how extraordinary their life had been. All three women seemed extremely frightened, often referring to an all-powerful force called Jackie, which they believed might seek retribution or cause them terrible harm. They were terrified of electricity, which they called “eeee” and seemed anxious that household appliances might blow up or explode. As they revealed details of their existence and Rosie gradually became more confident, she decided to change her name to Katy, inspired by the lyrics of Katy Perry's song, Roar, which is about a woman overcoming a difficult relationship and finding her voice. Katy's own story, and everything she had managed to overcome, proved far stranger than anyone could have imagined. The household in Brixton was run by Aravindan Balakrishnan, who the women called Comrade Bala or AB. Describing life with him, Katy explains how he exercised total control over his so-called comrades. He said that “he's God, he rules the world, he's immortal and he's our leader and teacher and we just have to obey him”. He claimed to have an all-powerful machine at his disposal which he called Jackie, an acronym for Jehovah, Allah, Christ, Krishna and Immortal Easwaran. Jackie was supposedly an invisible computer satellite built by the Chinese. Aravindan Balakrishnan Balakrishnan claimed that with Jackie's help he could control the world from inside the flat. He took credit for all global events, including wars and natural disasters. Balakrishnan told his followers it was only a matter of time until he would become ‘the overt ruler of the world’ One day in 1995, a pizza delivery man rang their doorbell by mistake. “Bala said this was the British fascist state trying to provoke him by bringing a pizza he hadn't ordered and ringing on his bell to disturb his important political work,” says Katy. Later that day, there was a huge earthquake in Japan. “So the same day as the fascist state knocked on God's door, Bala's door, there was a huge earthquake in Kobe to punish the fascist state,” she says. In Japanese, Kobe means God's door. Kobe after the earthquake, 1995 “From what he said, if something happens anywhere in the world, it's going to affect everything else in other parts of the world,” says Aisha. “Nothing exists in isolation, everything has its consequences. That's all I understand.  I just accept it because it's beyond my comprehension.” Balakrishnan told his followers it was only a matter of time until he would become “the overt ruler of the world”, adds Katy. “He used to look at the newspapers and say: 'You see this article, they're coming closer to me.'  And then he would ask: 'Who's coming to whom?' And everybody used to say: 'They're coming to you,' all in unison around him.” Throughout her life, Balakrishnan warned Katy that she would experience spontaneous human combustion, or SHC, if she ever stepped outside - Jackie would know and make her burst into flames. Once, when she was a small child, he put her outside the front door as a punishment and she became hysterical with fear, assuming she was about to die. Later, wondering why she had survived, she rationalised away the inconsistency thinking that because Balakrishnan himself had put her outside, Jackie knew to spare her on this occasion. Katy describes how Balakrishnan persuaded his followers to believe that, if they misbehaved, Jackie even had the power to stop the household plumbing from working as a punishment.  Daily life was hard. The comrades were expected to rise early to do the housework, make meals and serve Balakrishnan. They competed for his favour and it was considered a great honour to be allowed to turn on the shower for him or to enter the bathroom after he had finished to turn the shower off. In the early years, when the group was larger, some of the comrades would be sent out to work to make money for the collective, although neither Balakrishnan nor his wife ever had a job. Aisha worked at one time in Superdrug and then in the department store Morleys in Brixton, while Josie worked in a local industrial laundry. One comrade was a nurse and another a midwife. Those who didn't go out to work remained indoors inside the collective, where every day they had to attend Balakrishnan's morning lectures, standing to attention, sometimes for three or four hours. Anyone who sat down was punished. The bedrock of Balakrishnan's belief system was the tenets and teachings of Marx, Lenin and Mao. The group wanted to bring about a communist revolution and believed they were building the new world. They operated in secret and hid themselves from the “British fascist state”. Lectures were extended rants that often consisted of Balakrishnan denouncing individual comrades for perceived misdemeanours or identifying what he called synchronisations in the world, based on things he had read in the papers or seen on the news. “Someone used to have to log these synchronisations and write them down. As a child, I would spend ages copying these out,” says Katy. Balakrishnan created a mythology around himself. Every day, comrades had to sing songs celebrating his existence. The anniversary of his conception and his birthday - 16 October and 16 July - were celebrated and significant world events which happened on or close to these dates were seen as being synchronised with his life, providing evidence of his greatness. He claimed that the splitting of the atom, the moon landing and the storming of the Bastille - which happened about 150 years before he was born - were all linked to him in this way. Comrades came to believe that everything was interconnected and that Balakrishnan, with the help of Jackie, was all-powerful. “I received a nasty letter from my brother in Malaysia,"" says Aisha. “AB opened it and read it and then a few years after that my brother passed away, so I said to myself, 'OK, that's Jackie's work.'” When the Space Shuttle Challenger blew up in 1986, Balakrishnan claimed this was because people in the household were challenging him. “He said that his name Aravindan began with the sound 'AR', so it was 'Challenge - AR'.  People in the house were challenging him, so that's why Challenge-AR blew up,” says Katy. Balakrishnan believed in his own immortality and told his followers that they too would become immortal if they lived according to his rules. Remaining inside the flat was one way of extending their lives. “Captive animals live longer,” was one of his oft-repeated mantras. “He didn't believe in going to the dentist because he says we should let our teeth drop naturally and then when you're 100, your teeth will re-grow and you'll get another set,” says Aisha. Comrades were not allowed to see a doctor either. “He used to say that NHS means Never Help Self. So if we get ill, we have to focus on him and then we will get better as if by magic,” explains Katy. Balakrishnan introduced many acronyms into the language of the collective - the “British fascist state” became BFS and Nato was known as Farto, which stood for Fascist and Racist Terror Organisation. Our brains… they were dirty - they had to be washed of all ideas The collective itself was commonly referred to as AB's CCF(P), which stood for Aravindan Balakrishnan's Communist Collective Family Pilot Unit. So why did the women stay with Balakrishnan for so long? The group had started as a left-wing political organisation but evolved as Balakrishnan developed a raft of pseudo-religious ideas. Over time “we were brainwashed” explains Aisha. “Our brains… they were dirty. They had to be washed of all ideas. When you want to build a new world, you can't bring the old into it, so we had to chip away the old and fill the void with new ideas.” Aisha and Katy both report that beatings were a regular feature of life within the collective and if there was ever any dissent or disobedience, violence would ensue. Once, when the thought of leaving did cross her mind, Aisha quickly realised she had nowhere to go. “I had nobody outside, I had lost contact with my family, I had no money, I had no job, and I might have been deported.” However, Josie defends Balakrishnan and fervently denies that he ever used force. Katy was born in 1983. Her mother, Sian Davies, had joined the collective voluntarily and began a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan in the early 80s. Sian became pregnant and their child was given the name Prem Maopinduzi. Prem means love in Hindi, and Maopinduzi appears to be a combination of the Swahili word for revolution, mapinduzi, and Mao. Katy's birth certificate “It meant Love Revolution and I hated that… he thought that when he rules the world I'm meant to be like a soldier for him or his mouthpiece,” says Katy, and in her teens she started to refer to herself as Rosie. Members of the collective were not told who her father was and were led to believe that Sian had been impregnated by Jackie. “He used to say I was the product of electronic warfare,” says Katy. Katy's mother, Sian Davies At this point, Balakrishnan coined the term Project Prem. Project Prem was an experiment in child rearing intended to eliminate the nuclear family - a pilot for a new form of social organisation that would be implemented globally once Balakrishnan ruled the world. Comrade Prem, as Katy was known, was dressed in genderless clothing, never went to school, never got to know any other children and only rarely left the house. She was not told who her parents were and was brought up collectively by the group, who were not allowed to show her affection. Only Balakrishnan was allowed to cuddle her. “If I was to cuddle other people, he used to say that that's like being a lesbian, to cuddle other women,” she says. Balakrishnan's own childhood was spent in Asia. He was born in India in 1940 and moved to Singapore with his family when he was eight.  In 1963, he travelled to the UK on a British Council scholarship to study at the London School of Economics. As a student, he became increasingly involved in left-wing politics and eventually abandoned his studies. In 1974 he set up the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought, which he described as a “Chinese-initiated World Revolutionary Party”.  Its slogan was “China's Chairman is Our Chairman. China's Path is Our Path”. By 1976, his Workers' Institute had moved into premises on Acre Lane in Brixton, south London.  On the ground floor was a meeting room and a shop selling communist tracts. Upstairs was a communal living area where about 15 of Balakrishnan's core followers slept on the floor, with men in one room and women in another. Along with his Tanzanian wife Chandra and her disabled sister, the group consisted mainly of fellow students from Singapore and Malaysia, who felt ambivalent about Britain's colonial and imperialist past. Aisha Wahab had come to the UK from Malaysia at the age of 24 to study quantity surveying. She joined the group in its early days. Aisha Wahab “I was really inspired by him and drawn to him. I thought he was great to have been able to clarify our minds as to what to do with our lives,” she says. Other members included Josie Herivel, a brilliant young violinist studying at the Royal College of Music and Sian Davies, a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, who used family money to pay the rent on the Acre Lane premises. An old school friend, Sally Unwin, remembers Sian as very academic, “a deep thinker”. But the last time she remembers seeing her, Sian was “dressed like a Maoist, with all the blue and the collar… and the way she talked to me, I didn't know who she was… It was quite scary”.  It was not long before the political activities at the Workers' Institute attracted the attention of the police and in March 1978, it was raided by officers searching for drugs. Although no drugs were found, nine members of the group, including Balakrishnan, were sent to prison for assaulting police officers during the raid. At their trial, they refused to recognise the authority of the court and when called to the stand, they shouted “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! Death to the British fascist state! Victory to world revolution!” After a brief period of incarceration, Balakrishnan decided that in order to escape the attention of the “British fascist state”, the group must go underground. So from then on, it operated in secret, frequently moving house.  By 1980, it consisted of only seven followers, all of whom were women. As the women stopped going out to work, the group came to rely on Chandra's sister's disability allowance and Chandra's carer's allowance for an income. Balakrishnan exerted control over the collective for many years.  As well as threatening and beating them, he would use each individual's past to further undermine them. Sian Davies's father had killed himself when she was a teenager and Balakrishnan would repeatedly tell her this was her fault.  By 1996, Sian's mental health had become fragile and on Christmas Eve of that year, she fell from the second floor bathroom window of a terraced house in Shakespeare Road, Brixton in an apparent suicide attempt. The house in Shakespeare Road where the collective lived for several years “Sian was acting really oddly saying she's a devil and was starting to behave really unlike herself,” says Katy. “There was screaming in the middle of the night and subsequently I learned that Sian had tried to stab herself with a knife. She had tried to run out the door... then because she couldn't escape that way, she went out through the window “On the morning of Christmas Eve, I went downstairs and Sian was lying on the floor.  Her hands and legs were tied and she was gagged and she had this piece of cloth in her mouth.  It may have been a sock or something.” Balakrishnan and Chandra were both shouting at Sian. “She had tried to run out the door, that's why she was tied up, because she was trying to escape. Then because she couldn't escape that way, she went out through the window.” Sian was taken to hospital, where she fell into a coma. Balakrishnan insisted that Sian's family should not be told what had happened and Josie told them on the phone that Sian was “away travelling in India and sends her love”. After lying in a coma for seven months, Sian died. At the inquest into her death, the coroner asked Aisha whether Sian had any children. On Balakrishnan's instructions, Aisha said she didn't. “We definitely didn't want Katy to be taken away and live a life as of old and not participate in building a new society,” she explains. It was around this time that Katy guessed Sian was her mother, but paradoxically, after Sian's death, life got better for Katy in some respects. “She was one of the worst servants of Bala, so it was such a relief with her not there. His worst enforcer had gone,” she says. And Sian was not the only person to die in the course of the collective's existence.  In 2004, Oh Kar Eng, a nurse from Malaysia, who had been with Balakrishnan since the 1970s, banged her head on a kitchen cabinet and had a stroke. The following day, she too died. Oh Kar Eng died in 2004 These two deaths reinforced the idea in the minds of the remaining members that Balakrishnan had the power of life and death over them. “AB said that he helps people to live and that those who die have not internalised his teachings enough. That's why it frightened me,” says Aisha. “Sian and Oh had died and I thought 'OK, next time, it will be me.' I didn't want to die.” By 2005, Katy’s situation had caused her to become deeply depressed. Observing life outside her window, she began to doubt Balakrishnan’s account of the world. At the age of 22, having never gone outside on her own and despite believing she might be killed by Jackie, she decided to try to escape. She packed a bag and let herself out of the back door of the flat. When she asked a passer-by for help, they suggested she go to the police station. But with no experience of the outside world, she struggled to explain her situation to the officer at the desk, only saying that she had “run away from home”. The officer persuaded Katy to let her phone Balakrishnan, who came to collect her.  He reassured the police that all was well and took Katy back to the collective, where he denounced her and told her she was ungrateful. Katy remained in captivity for another eight years. Over the summer of 2013 Katy lost weight dramatically and became so unwell that Josie feared she might not survive. Arranging a doctor's appointment was not an option so the two women came up with a plan. In early October, they saw a story about forced marriage on the BBC News and at the end the newsreader gave out a helpline number. I just couldn't take living like an animal like that any more Josie committed the number to memory and saved change in secret from her regular trips to the grocery shop.  She smuggled a mobile phone into their home and, while Balakrishnan and Chandra watched Neighbours on television, they called for help. Katy, a few days after her escape They made a series of calls and were passed on to Gerard Stocks and Yvonne Hall at the Palm Cove Society, who, together with the Metropolitan Police, co-ordinated the women's rescue. Each week Balakrishnan and Chandra went shopping at the same time, so Katy knew when there would be an opportunity to escape. “We had to make sure they were not anywhere near when we walked out of the house… so 11:15 sharp we left, Josie and me, with our trolleys.” Yvonne and Gerard were waiting just round the corner. Katy was “delighted” but Josie already appeared to be having second thoughts. Left toright: Aisha, Katy, Yvonne Hall and Josie “She knew the police were involved, she was beginning to regret it, thinking it'll make trouble for Bala,” says Katy. But Katy was determined to leave and never go back: “I just couldn't take living like an animal like that any more, being treated with such disrespect and just being a non-person.” She felt confident she could trust Yvonne. “After what I had come from, anything was better than that. That's all I knew for sure.” When Katy left the collective she had “a hundred feelings at once, you can't really say what”. She couldn't believe it was true and was afraid that she would “wake up and find that I'm still stuck”. As they slowly walked to the meeting point “Katy had a beaming smile” remembers Yvonne. “We just hugged each other.” Aisha wanted to know why the cars coming towards us had white lights and the cars in front of us had red lights That same day, Yvonne and Gerard drove Katy, Josie and Aisha to Leeds where they gave them a place to stay. Katy was treated in hospital for diabetes. “The women seemed to start and finish one another's sentences. They spoke in unison, as if they'd had the same conversations with each other for years and years and years, so if one of them started a sentence, the others knew what the next bit was going to be,” says Gerard. “Aisha wanted to know why the cars coming towards us had white lights and the cars in front of us had red lights,” he adds. It rapidly became clear that Katy in particular had very few life skills. She was “overwhelmed by the enormity of everything, because she had been confined,"" says Yvonne. “She couldn't cross a road, had never handled money and couldn't look around or make eye contact.” Katy at Gerard and Yvonne's house After a while, Josie and Aisha were housed locally in sheltered accommodation, but Katy's needs were greater and she lived with Yvonne and Gerard for more than a year, while they helped her to develop the skills she would need to live independently. Balakrishnan was brought to trial in 2015 and was charged with sexual offences as well as with imprisoning his daughter. In the course of the police investigation, it emerged that he had sexually abused two women, Woman A and Woman B, over a period of years. Woman A described in court how Balakrishnan had made her write an account of her sexual history, which he then used to humiliate her in front of the others. Later he sexually abused her, raped her and regularly beat her. In 1989, after 13 years, she left the collective. Woman B was a nurse from Malaysia, who had moved into the Acre Lane commune in 1978. She too was beaten, sexually assaulted and raped. In 1992, she worked a night shift and found the courage not to return to the collective. In January 2016, Balakrishnan was convicted of crimes including rape, sexual assault, child cruelty and the false imprisonment of his daughter. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Josie and Chandra during Balakrishnan's trial His wife Chandra and Josie Herivel stood by him and made a statement to the press, declaring his innocence and claiming he had been framed by the “British fascist state”. Despite having voluntarily left the collective, Josie continues to follow his teachings and now devotes her time to trying to clear his name. Josie still campaigns for Balakrishnan's release Aisha is now 72 and lives in sheltered housing in Leeds. She claims she was unaware of any sexual abuse taking place in the collective. Although she has regrets about the way Katy was treated, she still believes in campaigning to make the world a better place and volunteers once a week in a local charity shop. She also has regular dentist appointments to get her teeth fixed. Katy has adopted the last name Morgan-Davies, consisting of two surnames from her mother’s side of the family. She is doing her best to leave the indoctrination of her past behind and has made remarkable progress. She is studying English and maths at college and has recently moved out of supported accommodation into a flat of her own. DNA tests carried out by the police confirmed that Balakrishnan is her father. Somehow she has managed to find it within herself to forgive him “I used to hate him, but not any more. Nelson Mandela said that you are still in prison if you hold on to your anger, hatred and bitterness, so there’s no place for that in my life.  I would like to reconcile with him in the future if he wants that.  But you can’t clap with one hand.” Vanessa Engle's documentary, The Cult Next Door, is broadcast on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT, 26 January -watch it on BBC iPlayer All images subject to copyright"

On his decision to make nine changes to his team, he said:""I would do it again.""Â Southampton 0-1 Arsenal Patient stuff from Arsenal with 15 passes in the build-up to that wonderfully taken goal by Danny Welbeck.

We didnât take our chances in the first half, we missed a penalty and Oxford took their chances. âYou have to give credit to them as they were fighting for the result and we just made too many mistakes and paid for the first one at the start of the second half. âI feel sorry for the fans and for us as we wanted to go through and we couldâve done on the chances created in the first half.

Trump and abortion,"This video can not be played Could US overseas abortion funding ban lead to more deaths in Africa? Donald Trump's pro-abortion funding ban has infuriated many global health organisations as they say it will unintentionally lead to more abortions and more deaths in Africa. The US president signed the executive order to stop federal money going to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions during his first week in office. Known as the ""Mexico City Policy"", or global gag rule by critics, it was no surprise that he reinstated it. First introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been become a game of policy ping pong between Republican and Democrat presidents. Supporters of the ban say it protects the fundamental right to life. Kenyan gynaecologist John Nyamu says the US policy may lead to more backstreet abortions But some health workers in Africa say when it was last put in place under George W Bush in 2001, it had far-reaching consequences. ""Women could not have access to contraceptive services and so they were getting unintended pregnancies and that increased the number of unwanted pregnancies and as such they went to the backstreet to do unsafe abortions,"" says Kenyan gynaecologist Dr John Nyamu. The policy blocks US funding to overseas organisations that ""support or participate in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation"". It even affects countries like Kenya - where abortion is illegal unless a mother's life is at risk - as some family planning clinics or organisations get their funding from US pro-abortion groups. The Trump order goes even further than previous Republican administrations, which only targeted reproductive health services, by extending the ban to cover all global health assistance provided by all departments or agencies. Republican presidents have supported the Mexico City Policy, while Democrats have dropped it ""By removing funding from organisations that also deal with malaria and other child health issues, the policy could threaten progress on many fronts, including efforts to reduce HIV-related deaths and new infections, and decrease childhood mortality through malaria prevention and treatment initiatives and immunisation programs,""Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement,external. The medical charity does not receive US government funding - so is not affected by the policy - but it fears that women's lives could be endangered. Unsafe abortion is one of the five main causes of maternal mortality, accounting for 13% of cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The Mexico City Policy is based on the US Republican party's pro-life position, which has resonance with much of socially conservative Africa, where abortion is largely illegal. Abortion on demand can only be offered in four out of 54 African countries, according to the UN's World Abortion Policies report. But the continent carries the biggest burden of unsafe abortions, according to the WHO. Marie Stopes International's projections for Nigeria suggest the policy will have a big impact on women's health in Africa's most populous country. ""Without US funding, from 2017 to 2020, over 1.8 million unintended pregnancies will probably occur; more than 660,000 abortions will happen and over 10,000 maternal deaths will not be averted,"" says Effiom Effiom, country director for Marie Stopes in Nigeria. Marie Stopes in Nigeria has been receiving funds through USAid The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) regional office in Africa says it will lose up to $100m (Â£80m) in US funding meant for sexual and reproductive health services for millions of women and girls who would otherwise go without these vital services as it refuses to abide by the gag rules. ""Over the years USAid has been a huge supporter of family planning - with a budget of over $600m per year. Reinstatement will mean that years of progress to increase access to essential services globally, will be lost,""it said in a statement,external. IPPF works with affiliates in 30 African countries including at least a dozen clinics in Kenya, five of which shut down the last time the Mexico City Policy was reinstated. But it has struck a defiant note, saying it will work to bridge the funding and services gapsas the Dutch government has donewith plans for an international fund to finance access to birth control in countries hit by the cuts. ""We cannot and will not - deny life-saving services to the world's poorest women,"" IPPF said. What does Trump abortion policy mean? Help to stop Kenya's illegal abortions.

Lost innocence,"Seven hundred people took part in the search for Birna when she was reported missing Iceland is united in grief. The body of a young woman, Birna Brjansdottir, was found washed up on a desolate, cold beach last weekend. Birna, 20, had been reported missing over a week before. Such murder cases are rare in a country with one of the world's lowest crime rates and a population of 330,000 people. No-one I have spoken to has been untouched by the events that unfolded from such an everyday event as a young woman walking home from a night out partying, along a well-lit street. For some, the case has sinister echoes of a dark plot from a Nordic noir TV drama. I and almost every one of my female friends have walked up that very same street from that very same bar, at that hour of night, and we have always felt safe. Most of my friends even told me that at some point they had caught a lift from strangers for short distances. Some use an underground Uber-like service called Skutlarar- a Facebook group where people offer or ask for lifts from strangers driving around town, for a lower price than official taxis. A close friend once told me she had got a lift from a tourist last summer, from a party near the harbour at Grandi. ""I was so tired, and I couldn't find a taxi,"" she explained. That might sound crazy but that is how safe women in Reykjavik usually feel. More stories from Iceland: The Reyjkavik confessions Iceland renews debate on EU Of course the city centre of Reykjavik obviously isn't entirely safe. Locals drink heavily on weekend nights, partying goes on all night and it is usually a vociferous, crowded affair. And there are occasional reports of attacks and rapes. But this was different. A young woman walking up the main street eating a kebab who then disappeared off the face of the earth. The story of Birna, an average young Icelandic woman, who walked up the city's main shopping street, Laugavegur, after a beer too many touches everyone because we can all relate to it. The 20-year-old goes out on the Friday night, to a music venue. At around 05:00 the next morning, on 14 January, she leaves the club on her own. She is separated from her friends, and never seen again. Hours later she is reported missing. Birna's photograph immediately starts circulating on Icelandic social media on Saturday. Where is she, her mother pleads. Birna is conscientious, she's always online, she always calls. She's not involved with drugs. Birna's face gazes at us from her photo: a pretty, smiling, auburn-haired girl next door. It is now Monday, and Reykjavik Metropolitan Police host a press conference. Grimur Grimsson leads the investigation into the murder This is unusual in Iceland. Usually, local police are a surly bunch and rarely give much information to the media. This time they are open, honest, compassionate, clear and concise. Heading the investigation is Grimur Grimsson, a policeman who reminds us of fictional crime-fighter Detective Erlendur, a gloomy figure from the novels of Icelandic writer Arnaldur Indridason. Over the course of a week police begin piecing together the puzzle that is Birna's disappearance. From the security camera footage of her walking unsteadily up Laugavegur, to where she goes missing at number 31, where a red Kia Rio car pulled up. Her mobile phone is traced all the way to Hafnarfjordur, a picturesque little town next to Reykjavik. Events turn more and more sinister. Her Doc Marten shoes are found by Hafnarfjordur harbour, and the rental car is traced to a couple of crew members of a Greenlandic trawler, the Polar Nanoq. Armed special forces board a helicopter, fly to the trawler as it heads back to Greenland, take control of the ship, return it to Iceland and arrest two men on suspicion of murder. They deny involvement. The two suspects were detained after a special forces operation at sea The following day over 700 members and volunteers from Iceland's SAR search and rescue team take part in the biggest such operation in the island's history. Birna's blood is found inside the car, and finally the tragic news that people were hoping not to hear. On Sunday 22 January, her body was found near a lighthouse on the Reykjanes peninsula, over 40km (26 miles) from where she disappeared. The post mortem examination was clear - she had been murdered. We still don't know what happened to Birna Brjansdottir in those fateful hours of Saturday morning. But Icelanders responded by putting a candle in their windows. Social media was flooded with messages for Birna. People broke down in tears. Flowers were placed on the spot where she disappeared. Our neighbours in Greenland were also shocked. Crowds gathered with candles in six different towns and also placed candles in their windows. Icelandic women have reacted defiantly to news of Birna's murder Two nations, united in grief over a young woman who could have been anyone's sister, daughter or girlfriend. When you live in such a small society, the victim doesn't feel like a stranger, but part of your family. Hundreds of Icelanders will take part in a candlelit march for Birna on Saturday, on the street she disappeared. Icelandic women don't want this to make them scared of going out at night, nor will they pay attention to warnings to avoid getting drunk or walking home alone, as if such crimes are somehow our fault. But I fear that Birna's murder has changed things. It has changed the way I feel heading back from a pub downtown, and my 16-year-old daughter tells me she won't be walking there alone at night in the future.

Death of a salesman?,"Some customers are already directed to buy their cars online Here's a personal prediction: 2017 will be the year that tens of thousands of motorists will start to buy new cars not from a salesman, but directly from their lap-tops, tablets and smartphones. The industry is betting that many consumers want to switch to the convenience of buying online, rather than negotiating in person with a dealer. This month alone three separate car-makers have launched new sales websites, with others expected to follow. If motorists take to buying online, the days of slick-talking salesmen and saleswomen could be numbered. The likes of Arthur Daley or Swiss Toni, from the BBC's Fast Show, would be very unhappy. But will internet sales also mean lower prices? That has been the experience in virtually every other part of the retail sector. But going out to buy a car is not like a shopping trip in the High Street. At least, not yet. Spooked by the success of car-broking websites like Carwow.co.uk, which searches dealerships for the cheapest model, manufacturers now want their own sales platforms. This month Hyundai, Smart and Peugeot - which includes Citroen - have all entered the market. When they go online, customers can choose the precise specifications they want - including colour and engine size - part-exchange their old car, arrange finance, decide whether they want their new model delivered to a dealership or to their home, and then click ""pay"". The process is said to take as little as half an hour. In practice that is probably only achievable if you have already decided on the exact model you want, and how you are going to pay for it. Nevertheless, for the first time it is perfectly possible for a motorist to buy a new car without going anywhere near a dealer, and never meeting a car salesman. However, if he or she wants to see or test drive a car, that can still be arranged. Anyone sceptical about whether online sales will work should visit Bluewater in Kent, or Westfield Stratford shopping centre in East London. Both Jaguar Land Rover and Hyundai have models on display, but to buy one you have to go online. Between them these ""shops"" sold a thousand cars in their first year. And here traditional sales executives are already a thing of the past. Instead customers are greeted by so-called ""store angels"", whose job is restricted to giving information, as well as guiding people through the website. So-called store angels have already replaced some traditional sales staff ""You don't need to have a sales executive driving a sale,"" says Michael Canham, a team leader with Hyundai's sales partner, Rockar. ""If a customer is in a buying mode, they will make that choice naturally themselves."" But some customers visiting the store disagree. ""I like to negotiate with a salesman,"" says David Graph. ""They will go that bit further and give you a discount."" Another, Carlton Moodie, said he would never buy a car online, as it means missing out on special deals. ""I'd rather negotiate. Online you can't negotiate."" But Maria McCarthy, a motoring journalist, believes many people will be delighted not to have to haggle in person. ""You don't need a physical person in front of you to offer those deals,"" she says. She also thinks anyone who is not confident in a car showroom can easily feel patronised by sales staff. ""Whether it's a lingerie department (for men), or a garage on the corner, we've all got environments where we feel a bit awkward. In car dealerships that awkwardness is intensified by the fact that you are going to make a very expensive purchase."" Some people may not be happy to negotiate with the likes of Swiss Toni in The Fast Show But surely most buyers want to see, or even test drive a car? All these websites still offer a facility for customers to go to a dealer if they want to, and then continue their purchase online. However, fewer people now insist on doing so. For example, since it opened 16 months ago, Hyundai Rockar has found that just 53% of customers opt to drive a car before buying one. The reason may be their trust in the brand - or perhaps their reluctance to spend too much time on the whole car-buying process. Customers using the new websites will find that the prices are fixed. By going to a dealer instead, they may get a discount of a thousand pounds, or perhaps tinted glass, leather seats or free insurance thrown in. In other words, it is still likely to be cheaper to go shopping in a car showroom. The reason is that manufacturers are reluctant to undercut their dealers. So for the moment dealers will still get some money from each internet sale. Steve Huntingford, the editor of What Car? Magazine, believes car-makers would love to offer direct sales in theory, but they are currently too reliant on their showroom networks. ""There's an element of you don't want to upset the dealer and cut them out altogether, because at the moment they know there is a need for them."" Peugeot themselves confirmed that they are unlikely to offer direct sales, independently of dealers, for the foreseeable future. ""In simple terms, no,"" says Andrew Baird, head of Peugeot's digital and online operations. ""At the moment we think our (dealers) invest an awful lot of money in the brand, and are an absolutely critical part of the business."" As a result he believes there is little scope for discounted prices on the internet. ""I think that's extremely difficult with the franchise model that we have, because ultimately the franchisee can sell a car at any price they want. They control the prices."" For the moment then, manufacturers are selling the idea of internet sales on convenience alone. But that should not be underestimated. George Cole as Arthur Daley, the archetypal car salesman in the TV series Minder Industry figures show that the average car buyer used to visit three showrooms before buying. Now that is down to one. Our appetite for physical reconnaissance may be waning, while our confidence in internet shopping is still growing. Ask online clothing retailers, for example. However, any boom in online car sales may take its toll on those wearing natty suits like Arthur Daley in the TV series Minder, or the master of the double entendre, Swiss Toni. ""I don't think it will happen for a while,"" says Steve Huntingford. ""But I think eventually, yes, the traditional way of buying a car will gradually shrink, and in a couple of generations you can see a time when there is no need for a car salesman.""

It was a win-win situation because a Williams would be lifting the trophy at the end of the day. Serena cannot believe it - she is a seven-time Australian Open champion. It is completely insane what this woman is capable of and what she keeps achieving. S Williams 6-4 6-4 V Williams Serena looks up to her box, waving one solitary finger on her right hand up to her box. ""I'm back at world number one!"" is the message. And she's right.

Serena piles on the pressure, forcing Venus on to the back foot, only for the older sister to keep getting the ball back.

Spinster act,"Ida and Louise Cook smuggled valuables out of Germany to help those fleeing the Nazi regime Between 1934 and 1939, two ""nervous British spinsters"" were regular visitors to the opera houses of Germany and Austria. But the trips also served a greater and more dangerous purpose - saving Jewish lives. Ida and Louise Cook risked their own lives dozens of times by smuggling out valuable goods for those attempting to flee the Nazi regime, as well as passing on messages and meeting contacts, some of whom were active in the underground movement. Every time they left Germany, a border guard could have called into question the ownership of the furs and jewellery they were draped in, putting the sisters in peril of arrest and imprisonment - and worse. They met one contact almost under the nose of several high-ranking Nazi officials, when he got in touch with them at their hotel - one of Hitler's lunchtime haunts - asking them to rush outside and jump into his taxi. The sisters helped many people to escape, but as Ida said many years later: ""The funny thing is we weren't the James Bond type - we were just respectable Civil Service typists."" By 1934 Germany was under Nazi control The Cook sisters were born in the early 1900s, and - in common with a lot of their generation in the wake of the deaths of so many young men during World War One - never married, living quietly at home with their parents in south London. Their passion in life was opera, and they became ardent fans - in the words of their nephew John Cook, ""opera groupies"" - attending performances and waiting at stage doors in the hope of getting autographs. They also wrote to their favourite opera stars and in 1934 visited the Salzburg Festival, where they were befriended by the conductor and impresario Clemens Krauss. Their childhood home in Sunderland has now been marked with a blue plaque It was his wife who suggested they ""look after"" a friend who was visiting London and she opened their eyes to the situation Jewish people living in Germany and Austria faced at the time. Speaking in a BBC radio interview in 1967, Ida Cook said: ""I can't emphasise sufficiently how we stumbled into this thing. ""This friend opened our eyes into the appalling situation Jewish people in Germany found themselves in. They were without any rights as human beings at all."" There were restrictions on all aspects of life and although Jews were at this stage able to leave the country, they were unable to take money or possessions with them. Those wanting to come to Great Britain had to prove they had a job to go to or sufficient funds to live on - the latter presenting huge difficulties due to the money prohibition. Ida and Louise were able to help them get around this Catch-22 situation by smuggling their valuable goods across the border. The sisters would arrive in the country plainly dressed without coats, travelling home decked in jewellery and furs, which they pretended were their own. Ida Cook wrote about 130 romances for Mills and Boon under the name of Mary Burchell They also persuaded people to vouch for refugees, by offering work or financial guarantees, to satisfy the British requirements for immigration. Soon the Cook name went around and they began getting ""the most pitiable appeals"" from people wanting to leave. At that point Ida - then earning Â£5 a week as a shorthand typist - wrote what she described as ""a light romance"" which was published by Mills and Boon. Over the course of the next 50 years, under the pen name of Mary Burchell, she wrote about 130 novels for the publisher and ""the money just kept coming in"". During the late 1930s this funded the sisters' trips to Germany and Austria. A performance of Richard Strauss's Die Liebe der Danae at the 2016 Salzburg Festival - the Cook sisters attended the event in 1934 When their frequent visits aroused suspicion, Krauss, who was then director of the Munich Opera House, stepped in. He arranged for performances - sometimes letting them choose which one -  in the cities and on the days they requested. This allowed them to do their work amid what Ida later described as ""some of the greatest operatic performances of the century"". They were careful to arrive and depart via separate border crossings, as it would have given them away if they arrived with very little luggage but left two days later ""loaded to the Plimsoll Line"" with jewellery. Earrings had to be clip-on ones, as neither had pierced ears, as ""that was the kind of thing officials noticed"". And they had their cover story ready. Ida said: ""Ours was very simple - we were two nervous British spinsters who didn't trust our families at home and so when we went abroad we took all our jewellery with us. ""There's no answer for that. You can say 'how ridiculous', but you can't say 'it's not true'."" Clemens Krauss - pictured (left) with German composer Richard Strauss - was instrumental in the sisters becoming involved with the rescues And the danger was very real - they were breaking clearly defined Nazi law. Sunderland historian Stuart Miller said: ""They were smuggling large quantities of valuables knowingly and deliberately and could have been arrested at any point at the border, in which case there was nothing the British government could have done. ""There are examples of British citizens who were incarcerated and later ended up in concentration camps."" He came across the women's story when Ida's memoir was brought to his attention as he researched local heroes. ""They left Sunderland early, but they did live there - and it was where Ida was born,"" he said. ""Children in schools can identify with their story; not only were they local but they were two young women, doing this in a period when women were just coming out of the Victorian and Edwardian age. ""It's almost a Scarlet Pimpernel story."" As a permanent reminder of the sisters' heroism, on Friday Sunderland Council unveiled a blue plaque at the entrance of Croft Avenue, which was their childhood home. Joining local dignitaries for the ceremony, Tony Wortman, chairman of the Newcastle Reform Synagogue, said: ""Ida and Louise Cook saved many Jews... many of whom are still living and now surrounded by their children and grandchildren. ""For them, life has gone on but this would have not been so had it not been for their bravery and I am pleased to be invited to honour them on behalf of all those they saved."" Throughout their lives the sisters rarely mentioned their exploits of the 1930s In 1965, the sisters received the Righteous Among the Nations honour from the state of Israel, for their ""warmth of heart, devotion, rare perseverance [and willingness] to sacrifice their personal safety, time and energy"". Ida died in 1986, with Louise outliving her by just over four years. Remembering the ""quite extraordinary old biddies"", nephew John Cook said: ""They were modest, only mentioned their exploits if asked. ""They were first really exposed when Ida's wrote her memoirs, which was mostly about operas. ""The story of the rescues was in the context of opera visits; there was no desire to push them to the forefront."" He added: ""Ida used to say something like: 'You are what you do' and that was about it. ""They did it because it was the right thing to do, nothing more, nothing less.""

Box office flops,"Zoe Saldana appeared alongside Ben Affleck in the period gangster thriller It was written and directed by the guy who plays Batman, but in terms of box office receipts, Live by Night was more of a Joker. According to Variety,external, the Ben Affleck crime drama is set to lose the Warner Bros studio $75m (Â£60m). The film cost an estimated $65m (Â£52m) to make but has only made $16.5m (Â£13m) of it back. Factor in the costs of marketing and distribution and the period gangster thriller looks like it's firing blanks. It's a galling comedown for Affleck, whose last film as director was the Oscar-winning Argo. It also came off the back of the stinging reviews he received for both Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and another thriller calledThe Accountant. Yet the 44-year-old should perhaps take heart from the fact that Live by Night will occupy a fairly lowly position on any rundown of expensive film flops. 47 Ronin cast the Canadian Reeves as a half-English, half-Japanese swordsman Indeed, it would have had to lose more than twice as much to challenge47 Ronin, a 2013 martial arts fantasy starring Keanu Reeves. With worldwide grosses of $151m (Â£119.4m) set against an estimated budget of Â£225m (Â£179m), the film is believed to have left Universal with a $149m (Â£118m) hole in its coffers. Varietycalled it,external""one of the costliest box office flops of 2013"", citing rewrites, reshoots and a ""novice"" director as factors in its downfall. Then there isMars Needs Moms, a 2011 Disney fantasy that made use of the performance capture technology popularised by 2004's The Polar Express. Estimated to have cost $150m (Â£119.3m) to make, Simon Wells's film took just $38.9m (Â£30.9m) at cinemas - landing the House of Mouse with an estimated write-down of $130.5m (Â£103.7m). Johnny Depp played Tonto in Disney's expensive comedy western Other Disney offerings that had their bean-counters running for cover include 2012'sJohn Carter- estimated to have lost the company $125m (Â£99.4m) - and 2013'sThe Lone Ranger, thought to have accrued losses of around $150m (Â£119.5m). Yet even these may be dwarfed byThe 13th Warrior, a 1999 action fantasy that is rumoured to be the biggest box office disaster ever. We say ""rumoured"" because it has never been accurately ascertained exactly how much Antonio Banderas's Viking saga cost to produce. Could it be as high as $160m (Â£127m)? If so, its adjusted for inflation losses can be calculated to be around $183m - an eye-watering Â£145m in UK currency.

The man behind Trump's illegal vote claim,"More than 130m Americans voted on 8 November - President Trump believes millions did so fraudulently Donald Trump and his aides say that between three and five million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. One man has emerged as the originator of that claim: Gregg Phillips. On Friday morning, President Trump's first tweet of the day read, ""Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand. Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better!"" Since taking office, the president and his staff, most notably press secretary Sean Spicer, have repeated claims of mass voter fraud and on Wednesday,Trump promised,externala ""major investigation"" in response. So where did this figure of three million illegal votes come from and who is Gregg Phillips? The man Phillips isa staunch conservative,externalwho began his work in government by campaigning for Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice in the mid-1990s. He subsequently became head the Mississippi Department of Human Services, but resigned a year laterover conflict-of-interest claims,externallevelled against him. He next became the deputy commissioner for Texas' Health and Human Services, before leaving public life to found his own companies. Long-time Clarion-Ledger investigative reporter Jerry Mitchell says he is still known in political circles in Mississippi. ""When I found out he was the one who [tweeted] this I was like, 'You're kidding me,'"" says Mitchell. ""Gregg has always been great at spinning things."" Phillips did not return a request for comment from BBC News. The Associated Press reports that Phillips was listed on the voter rolls in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi, according to voting records and election officials in those states. But records show he voted only in Alabama in November. The claim Phillips is a board member of True the Vote, a conservative nonprofit that tracks voter fraud, and the owner of a technology company called AutoGov. One of his products, called VoteStand, is intended to help users ""quickly report suspected election illegalities as they happen"".The app,externallets people take photos of irregularities they see at polling places, and sends the report back to VoteStand. On 11 November, 2016, just days after the election,Phillips wrote on Twitter,external, ""Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team."" On 13 November, he clarified further: ""We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens."" The claims were retweeted and liked thousands of times. They became the basis ofan article,externalon the conspiracy theory news site InfoWars. Later, Trump himself began tweeting that he would have won the popular vote, were it not for millions of illegal votes. When reporters first approached Phillips asking if he had influenced the president-elect's thinking, Phillips demurred. ""When did a tweet become news?""he told the Austin American-Statesman,external. The proof Phillips says the figure is based on 189 million voting records he and ""a group of volunteer election integrity researchers"" have collected from voter files around the country. He further explained his methodology to CNN anchor Christopher Cuomo on Friday. ""We've augmented that database with everything from geo-coding to all sort of identifying information we've developed, algorithms that allow us to to first verify identity,""he told Cuomo,external. ""We can verify residency, we can verify citizenship, felon status, and all of the other factors that go into making a legal, registered vote."" But Phillips has repeatedly refused to show his work. He sayshe will reveal,externalhis raw data, his algorithm and his methodology to the public, and to the US Department of Justice. However, he says that the results may still contain errors, which is the reason for the delay. He says he may not release the information for ""months"". The doubts David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, says while he can't comment specifically on any of Phillips' claims, he does see a few red flags. While the kinds of voter rolls that Phillips says he has are public, Becker says there is no way they would be ready as soon as two days after the election, when Phillips originally tweeted his 3m figure. ""Having done this and worked with other people who've done this, it would be very early to do a comprehensive study of all the voters who voted in November,"" says Becker. ""The first reports are likely to come out in the spring."" Becker concedes that there are major problems keeping voter registration rolls accurate - millions of deceased people,for example,external, remain registered, and millions others are registered in more than one state. But that does not mean that anyone actually voted improperly using the name of a dead person, or voted twice. (Several members of Trump's inner circle, including members of his family,are registered in two places,external, which is not illegal). Even without Phillips yet disclosing how he arrived at his figures, Jennifer Clark, counsel at the Brennan Center's Democracy Program, says that a finding of several million illegal votes will go against all other credible research so far. ""This idea that there could be millions of fraudulent votes and truly nobody noticed, or there was some kind of vast conspiracy with election officials around the country, which is what it would take - it's not believable,"" she says. ""It's laughable"".

"Dave Lee: So long, 3DTV","If thereâs one thing history has taught us: technology fails if using it makes you look like a plonker. I donât mean a bit silly, like skiing on a Nintendo Wii, or a little crackers, like running around in Snapchatâs Spectacles. I mean the sort of technology that when you look across a room and see someone wearing it you donât think âwowâ or âthatâs futuristicâ. You just thinkâ¦ plonker. Thatâs how I felt whenRory started wearing Google Glass(sorry, Rory) and thatâs how I've always felt about 3DTV. That was the first nail in its coffin. The second was the fact it really didnât bring much to the TV-watching experience. The third? It was too expensive, even at a discount. And the fourth? It was uncomfortable, and according to some surveys, straining many peopleâs eyes and giving them headaches. This week we learned thatboth LG and Sony have now stopped making 3D-enabled televisions.,externalThe firms follow Samsung - the worldâs biggest TV maker - who confirmed the move last year. It means there are currently no major manufacturers making 3DTVs. At this yearâs CES trade show, there was barely a whimper of 3D TV, compared to just two years ago when it was being heralded as the next big thing. But you could argue that 3DTV was never about the home experience. Where it would come into its own was in huge cinemas with full surround and the kind of environment that would do the new(ish) medium justice. But here, too, things have ground to a miserable halt. Despite the moderately promising start made by Avatar, no single 3D production ever became a must-see. The 3D high point for me was the remake of the Jungle Book, but the enjoyment there was clearly the return to the songs that soundtracked my early childhood - not the fact the odd branch stuck out of the screen, even if it did enhance the immersion of the jungle which had been so beautifully animated. ""One is moderately entertained..."" In the cinema, 3D was milked for all it was worth. Watching the 3D version of the film would often be a more expensive ticket. And while some theatres would give you free glasses you could return at the end, many would make you pay for them on the basis that you could âbring them back next timeâ. Imagine being the sort of person who brings their own pair of 3D glasses to a date. It's up there with owning your own pair of bowling shoes. Then, having to watch an hourâs worth of hollow Hollywood tat with plastic strapped to your face would soon see off any chance of an eventful evening. Even James Cameron, who directed Avatar, is fed up with 3D. It has ""become a studio-driven top down process to make moneyâ, he said (as if Hollywood has ever been anything else). The cinema-going public was immediately sceptical - knowing that the more the movie industry told them it was the next big thing, the more it felt like a pathetic gimmick.To quote The Oatmeal,external, âsaying that 3D movies are the future of cinema is like saying that Magic Eye books were the future of literatureâ. Which is why most major studios have just about stopped bothering. The former head of Dreamworks Animation said that the industry âblew itâ with 3D, something he blamed it as much on poor story-telling as limitations of the tech. And while there are plenty of 3D films lined up for this coming year, many of them have been bodged together using post-production, rather than filmed with 3D viewing in mind.
