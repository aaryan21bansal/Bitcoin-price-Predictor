Four killed in motorway pile-up,"This video can not be played Drivers rushed to help those caught in the crash Four people have died in a crash on the M5. Police said a lorry travelling southbound crashed through the central reservation and hit at least two vehicles heading the opposite way. A woman and two children were also injured in the crash and taken to hospitals in Bristol, where they are in a life-threatening condition. Emergency services were called just after 14:30 BST on Saturday to junctions 15 and 14 in Gloucestershire. The lorry driver was taken to hospital to be checked over as a precaution. The motorway was shut for hours after the crash in both directions between junctions 16 and 14 to allow the recovery operation and investigations to be carried out. The southbound side of the carriageway reopened at about 05:30. Highways England said it expected the northbound side to remain shut throughout Sunday. Supt Simon Ellis, of Avon and Somerset Police, said the rescue and recovery operation was ""painstaking work"". ""Our priority is to ensure the victims' next of kin are notified and supported, as well as the ongoing management of the scene, and this important work is ongoing,"" he said. Supt Ellis thanked the emergency services, as well as members of the public who ""courageously went to the aid of those involved"" in the crash. Motorists have been stuck on the M5 for hours Cardiologist Dr Amer Hamed was in a car travelling ""10 to 20 seconds behind"" when the crash happened. He was one of the first at the scene along with a passing GP and other medics to help an injured woman who was in one of the cars. Paramedics arrived on the scene about six minutes later and the woman Dr Hamed had been helping was taken away by ambulance to hospital. He said: ""There was a lorry involved and at least two other cars. One was absolutely destroyed and another had flipped over."" He said motorists who had been stuck on the carriageway for several hours were ""very helpful"". ""People are helping as much as they can,"" he said. ""Several people offered us water and one man came out of his car to give food. We're going to be stuck here for a few hours yet."" South Western Ambulance Service said it was called just after 14.30 BST. The most striking thing about the scene is the almost complete silence here. Looking over the bridge, the police, fire and ambulance crews are patiently doing their work at quite a disturbing scene. The lorry that has crashed has hit what M5 commuters will know as a familiar landmark, a windsock next to the road. But alongside that are several cars crushed from the impact. On the other side of the bridge, motorists patiently wait with some eager to help. I overheard one asking if any prayer support was needed. While others talk to police officers about the sadness of what has happened.

Armed police search house over Tube bomb,"This video can not be played Police cordons are in place around the residential street in Surrey Police have arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of a terror offence in connection with Friday's attack on a London Tube train. Armed police are continuing to search a house in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. The arrest is ""very significant"" and the terror threat level remains ""critical"", Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said. The man was arrested in the departure area of Dover port on Saturday and has been moved to a London police station. Thirty people were injured after the explosion on a train at Parsons Green. Live: Arrest in hunt for Tube attacker Reality Check: How terror threat levels work In pictures: Parsons Green blast Armed police patrols stepped up in Scotland The arrest sparked an evacuation of Dover port and a number of items were recovered in a police search, Mr Basu said, adding that detectives were ""keeping an open mind"" as to whether more people were involved in the Tube attack. Residents of houses surrounding the Sunbury-on-Thames property have been allowed to return home after being evacuated by officers earlier on Saturday. Locals said the property being searched by police is occupied by married couple Ronald Jones, 88, and Penelope Jones, 71. The couple are known for fostering many children and young people over several decades, and in 2010 wererewarded by the Queen by being made MBEs,external. Penelope and Ronald Jones, who were made MBEs in 2010, live in the house at the centre of a police search One neighbour, Anna Wilkins, told BBC News she was ""shaking like jelly"" after being told by armed police to leave the home she shares with her partner and two young children. ""As I walked out of my house I saw three armed officers,"" she said. ""One had a balaclava on, all I could see were his eyes, I was really frightened."" Many residents had been evacuated to Staines Rugby Club where one local, Dan Norcott, said the council had  begun making preliminary arrangements for hotel accommodation. This video can not be played ""An officer banged on the door quite severely and said 'Out now you've got two minutes'"" After a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee earlier, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was ""much too early"" to say whether those behind the attack were known to authorities, adding: ""The operation is ongoing"". The terror threat level was raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, on Friday evening. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick described the attack as ""cowardly and indiscriminate"". Ms Dick, who travelled by Tube before joining Met officers patrolling the South Bank, said: ""London has not stopped after other terrible attacks and it will not stop after this one."" Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick joined police patrolling London's South Bank Operation Temperer, which involves the use of the military was put in place after the threat level was raised and is being stepped up gradually. Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it is mainly focused on London and the south-east of England and is described as ""light-touch"", and not on the same scale as what was seen after theManchester Arena attack. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said ""significant"" police activity would continue this weekend. More armed police officers will be present at London Underground stations, as well as at stations across England, Scotland and Wales, British Transport Police Assistant Chief Constable Robin Smith told the BBC. Most people caught in the blast were treated for minor injuries and have been released, NHS England said, but three people remain in Chelsea and Westminster hospital in central London. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This is the fourth time the UK national terror threat level has been raised to critical since the system was made public in 2006. The last time was in May following the Manchester Arena bombing, when it was wrongly thought the bomb-maker was still at large and could strike again. On Friday the government delayed raising the threat level to critical for more than 12 hours under advice from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre.  On Saturday the home secretary said it would remain at this level, implying that despite the arrest there is still thought to be a risk of another imminent attack. Each time the level has gone to critical, it has only stayed at this highest level of alertness for three to four days - this is partly as it involves an unsustainably high tempo for the police, intelligence and security services. Extra patrols are mounted on the streets of London, covert surveillance is stepped up and troops are deployed to free up police officers to focus on the main effort: catching the bomber before he can plant another device. But the very fact that Friday's attack took place with no warning shows this system is only a broad guide to the threat and simply reflects the latest assessment. The BBC understands CCTV images have been obtained of the person suspected of planting the explosive device. The Islamic State group has said it was behind the bomb, which detonated at 08:20 BST on Friday. It is understood the device had a timer, but the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off properly. Police have spoken to 100 witnesses so far and received 180 images and videos from the public Had it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said. The Met's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said it was ""very routine"" for the Islamic State group to claim the attack, whether in contact with those involved or not. They urge anyone with information to get in touch and to upload pictures and video to the websitewww.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk,externalor to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.

"Girl, 14, raped in 'horrendous attack'","Police have issued a picture of a man they would like to speak to over the attack A 14-year-old girl has been raped in a ""horrendous attack"" in a park in south London, the Metropolitan Police says.

The attacker is described as black, aged in his 20s, of slim build with short black hair and a moustache. He was wearing sand-coloured combat trousers, dark shoes which might have been blue, and a grey drawstring bag. He also had on black, round sunglasses. No arrests have been made. The attack happened close to Avery Hill Road, police say Det Con Mark Azariah said: ""This was a horrendous attack on a vulnerable girl in the middle of the day.

Palace plays down 'power struggle' claims,"Sir Christopher Geidt has been the private secretary to Her Majesty since 2007 The Royal Households say they are ""committed to supporting the Queen"", amid reports of a ""power struggle"" between Her Majesty's private secretary and the Prince of Wales. The statement follows claims fromThe Times,externalnewspaper that Sir Christopher Geidt was ""forced out"" by the prince. The BBC understands Sir Christopher - the Queen's most senior and trusted advisor - did not step down willingly. Unnamed sources say he left after complaints from Prince Charles. Earlier this year it was confirmed that Sir Christopher would step down after 10 years in the role. He has held one of the most important jobs in Britain since 2007 - advising the Queen on political and constitutional matters. The BBC's royal correspondent Peter Hunt has spoken to several people, inside and outside the ancient institution, who have confirmed this decision was not taken willingly by Sir Christopher. The senior courtier, who was awarded a second knighthood for his work in preparation for a change of monarch, had been attempting to get all three royal households - of the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, to work more closely together. But the BBC's Peter Hunt explained that the Queen's eldest son, who turns 70 next year, was wary of any change that might reduce his involvement in the causes he is passionate about. Matters came to a head in July when Prince Charles reportedly told his mother Sir Christopher's position was untenable. In order to avoid conflict, the Queen agreed. ""This summertime bloodless palace coup means Prince Charles can now exercise more control over the monarchy's direction of travel,"" said Peter Hunt. Saturday's unprecedented statement from all three households, Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace, he added, was ""a sign of how concerned the institution is about how this might look to the outside world"". Prince Charles is longest-serving Prince of Wales Duchess of Cambridge's right-hand woman stands down Prince Charles is the longest serving heir apparent in British history The Times reports that Sir Christopher, 56, denies that he was forced out. The Royal Households said they would not engage with a story based on what they called "" rumours from unnamed sources"", but issued the following statement: ""It was previously announced in July that Sir Christopher Geidt is stepping down after 10 years as private secretary. ""At the time of the announcement, the Lord Chamberlain (the Earl Peel, who is head of the Queen's household) paid tribute to the major contribution made by Sir Christopher who, in turn, commended the support offered to Her Majesty by other members of the Royal Family. ""Indeed, recent years have seen an ever-closer working relationship between all the different Royal Households and their respective teams. ""The Prince of Wales and the entire Royal Family are committed to supporting the Queen in whatever way they can at Her Majesty's request."" Sir Christopher will be succeeded by the Queen's deputy private secretary Edward Young.

Parsons Green latest and Tories 'at war',"The Surrey house belongs to Penelope and Ronald Jones who were made MBEs by the Queen in 2010 Several papers feature a picture of the foster parents whose home has been searched as part of the investigation into Friday's Tube bombing. The Observer,externalinterviews neighbours who were told to leave their homes as the operation unfolded, ""shattering the peace of a London suburban street"". ""I had one minute to get out of the house with my three children,"" one woman tells the paper. The Sunday Telegraph,externalhighlights a report that warns the EU laws meant to stop terrorists getting the ingredients to make such bombs are too lax. It says the European Commission has found ""alarming"" gaps in the way sales of potentially lethal chemicals are controlled. According tothe Sunday Mirror,external, followers of so-called Islamic State are using an instant messaging site to send encrypted online messages ""urging lone-wolf jihadis to carry out atrocities across the UK"". It says fanatics ""warned an attack in London was imminent 36 hours before the Parsons Green explosion"". Thirty people were injured after a bomb was detonated at Parsons Green station on Friday The think tank, the Henry Jackson Society, the former army commander Colonel Richard Kemp, and a leading security expert all take to the Sunday Express to demand greater action to monitor and deport foreign nationals involved in extremism. The home secretary reflects inthe Sun on Sunday,externalon the need for a new security treaty with the EU after Brexit. Amber Rudd says continued close co-operation is vital, and announces that the government will set out its plans for a new partnership on Monday. She says the EU already has agreements with non-EU countries on law enforcement and expresses confidence that an understanding can be reached. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The fallout from Boris Johnson's intervention on Brexit continues, amid claims that it is the start of a leadership challenge. According tothe Sunday Express,external, sources close to the foreign secretary have been forced to deny he is ""on manoeuvres"" while a Downing Street source points out: ""He's going to be given a platform at conference to air his views, so we're not sure why he felt the need to do this."" The Mail on Sunday,externaldescribes the Conservatives as being ""at war"", with Boris Johnson in ""open revolt"" against Theresa May. A supporter of the foreign secretary likens his comments to ""lobbing a hand grenade through Downing Street's window"". David Cameron's former speechwriter, Ian Birrell, uses an article in the paper to accuse Mr Johnson of being ""disingenuous, disloyal and desperate"" to lead the country. But Mr Johnson's fellow Vote Leave campaigners, Michael Gove and Priti Patel have ""thrown their weight behind"" his vision, saysthe Sunday Telegraph,external. In particular they support his call for some of the money sent to Brussels to be spent on the NHS. Mr Gove and Mr Johnson are said to have reconciled after their falling out last year and to be ""of one mind"" on the issue. Gove led the Leave campaign with Boris Johnson in 2016 The Sunday Times columnist Dominic Lawson,externalargues that Boris Johnson is ""self-serving, egotistical...but right"" to urge ""more Brexit zest"" from the government.

Ryanair to cancel 40-50 flights per day,"Ryanair is to cancel 40 to 50 flights every day for the next six weeks, in a bid to improve punctuality of flights. The budget Irish-based airline announced the plan on Friday, saying that it was ""unacceptable"" that its punctuality had fallen below 80% in the first half of this month. It also said it had to clear a backlog of staff leave by the end of the year. The move could affect up to 285,000 passengers, who will be offered alternative flights or refunds. Ryanair said that less than 2% of its flights would be cancelled and the move would help it hit its annual punctuality target of 90%. But passengers have complained about the short notice of the cancellations. Ryanair plane makes emergency landing at East Midlands Airport Ryanair cuts cabin baggage limit to speed up boarding Gary Cummings was due to fly from Leeds to Bratislava on Friday morning. On Thursday night he received a text message from Ryanair, saying his flight had been cancelled. The only alternative flight he was offered was on Monday - when he was originally due to be returning to Leeds. ""We were left in limbo really,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. Allow Twitter content?

But customers do have rights under the European Passenger Rights legislation. ""The rules say if the airline doesn't have a suitable alternative flight, you have to be booked on a rival airline,"" said Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent. He said passengers should also be able to claim compensation for the cancellations. ""It's a really odd thing in terms of customer care, to say we want to improve the operation by keeping more planes on the ground,"" he told the BBC. By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent Ryanair made a profit of â¬1.32bn (Â£1.16bn) last year after it carried 120 million passengers. So it can afford to risk annoying up to 400,000 of its customers by suddenly cancelling hundreds of flights at short notice. It's not the first time that a large company has changed how holidays are allocated to staff, but it's probably the first time for a giant airline that such changes have discommoded so many paying customers. Ryanair hopes that it can minimise the reputational and financial cost until it gets to the end of October when fewer flights will be in the skies anyway. In the meantime passengers are urged to check what their compensation rights might be under EU261 rules. Ryanair has advised customers that flights will be operating as scheduled unless passengers have received a cancellation email. ""By cancelling less than 2% of our flying programme over the next six weeks, until our winter schedule starts in early November, we can improve the operational resilience of our schedules and restore punctuality to our annualised target of 90%,"" Ryanair's Robin Kiely said. The statement added that the airline was in a transition period to move the holiday year for its staff from April to March, to January to December. EU compensation rules for cancelled flights Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice In addition, passengers can also claim compensation Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul Passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can be compensated from 200 to 600 euros, depending on the length of flights and delay Emergency landing after plane loses wheel Ryanair cuts cabin baggage allowance At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Slender Man stabbing girl 'mentally ill',"Morgan Geyser (L) and Anissa Weier (R) were 12 at the time of the crime A jury in the US state of Wisconsin has determined that a girl who admitted to participating in a stabbing in 2014 to please the horror character Slender Man was mentally ill during the attack. Anissa Weier, now 15, had pleaded guilty in August to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide. But she said she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. She will be sent to a mental hospital. The victim, a classmate, was stabbed 19 times in May 2014 but survived. She was found crawling from woods by a cyclist near the city of Waukesha, a western suburb of Milwaukee. She had stab wounds to her arms, legs and torso. Anissa Weier told investigators that she and co-defendant Morgan Geyser believed they had to kill their victim in ""dedication"" to Slender Man, a fictional horror website character. But prosecutors said she knew what she was doing was wrong. All three girls were 12 at the time. He is a skinny, shadowy figure, who has appeared in photos, drawings and articles across the internet. Some claim he has tentacles emerging from his back and most say he wears dark clothes and has a pale face. The schoolgirls involved in the attack in Waukesha say there were inspired after reading about him in acreepypasta,external, a short online story designed to shock or scare the reader. Slender Man first appeared on the internet in 2009. Eric Knudsen from Florida created the character in response to a call for submissions from the online forum SomethingAwful and posted the picture of the figure behind a crowd of people. Slender Man: Born in cyber land The origins of Slender Man A lawyer for Anissa Weier said that her mind was ""broken"" when the attack happened,the Associated Press reports.,external The jury's decision means she will spend at least three years in a mental hospital,local broadcaster WISN says.,external Morgan Geyser pleaded not guiltyto being a party to attempted second-degree homicide.

He insisted the Lib Dems must do more to communicate the message that they are the ""party of remain"". ""This a battle ahead we have got to win,"" he said. ""This is the biggest battle of our political lives."" He insisted he did not want a re-run of the 2016 vote, which saw the UK vote to leave by 51.9% to 48.1%. Once negotiations had concluded, the public would be better informed about the choice facing the UK and would be asked to settle the matter once and for all in what he said would be the ""first referendum on the facts"". Both the Conservatives and Labour have ruled out any further referendum, saying the UK will leave the EU. A guide to the Lib Dem conference Lib Dems must 'think big' says Ashdown The four-day conference in Bournemouth is set to be dominated by the Brexit issue, with a debate on Sunday on the UK's future relationship with the EU amid increasing calls from within the party for a tougher line. Speaking at the traditional start of conference rally meeting, Sir Vince said the Lib Dems would not be satisfied with securing a ""soft, easy"" Brexit, suggesting such a prospect was ""not for real"". While he conceded he had initially been sceptical about the merits of having a second referendum so soon after the 2016 plebiscite, he said the issue of the UK's future in Europe was too important to let rest. ""We are the party of remain. We believe membership of the EU is in our country's interest,"" he said. ""No-one has come up with a plausible explanation about how leaving will make us better off than we are inside. ""Nobody has come up with a plausible explanation about how this process can be managed in a way that does not cause enormous cost and enormous damage."" Likening Brexit to a divorce, Sir Vince said he feared the negotiations could get ""messy and nasty"". ""People will have a choice - do you want to go ahead or have an exit from Brexit?"" ""What we are saying once we have a clear picture of the destination, that is the moment the people should have their say. We have to argue people should be trusted."" Despite making a second referendum the centrepiece of their general election campaign, the Lib Dems got a lower share of the vote than in 2015 - 7.4% - although they did see four more MPs elected. Ahead of his first conference as leader, Sir Vince appealed to ""moderates"" who may be dismayed by the direction of the Conservatives and Labour but acknowledged his party had much more work to do to broaden its appeal. ""British politics is now becoming very polarised between extreme hardline Brexit government and a hard left Labour Party. People are going to be looking for sensible, moderate, middle-ground politics. That is what we can provide."" Sir Vince, who was elected unopposed this summer after Tim Farron resigned in the wake of the election, conceded it had not done as well in June's election as hoped and leading a party with 12 MPs was a ""challenge"". ""Yes, the result did not live up to our expectations,"" Sir Vince added. ""I think we are going to turn it around... It is a challenge but I wouldn't have taken it on unless I was optimistic."" He insisted the party must not come to be totally defined by Brexit - ""a UKIP in reverse"" - and that it had to spell out clear positions on issues it was long associated with - such as civil liberties, devolution and the environment. On Sunday, activists will also debate the armed forces covenant and housing standards among other issues.

Banksy donates funds from drone artwork,"Three Predator drones are depicted bombing a child-like drawing of a house The anonymous street artist Banksy has donated Â£205,000 from the sale of a protest piece to anti-arms campaigners. The artwork, Civilian Drone Strike, was on display at the Art the Arms Fair art exhibition in east London. It depicts drones destroying a cartoon image of a house, while a child and her dog look on in distress. The exhibition was held alongside the world's largest arms fair, the Defence and Security Equipment International - both exhibitions closed on Friday. The art exhibition claimed to highlight ""the inhumanity of the arms trade"" through art, with work by more than 1,600 exhibitors from 54 countries. The money raised from the Banksy sale will be split between one of the exhibition's organisers, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), and the human rights group Reprieve. Andrew Smith from CAAT said the money would be used ""to ensure we mobilise even more people against the next arms fair, so that we can stop it from happening"". He added: ""It's time to shut it down for good."" During last week's Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) fair, Mr Smith said it was ""shameful that the government is welcoming despots and dictatorships to the UK to buy weapons"". He added: ""If the government cares for human rights and democracy then it's time to end its support for arms fairs like DSEI."" A portable emergency medical station was among the displays at the DSEI fair The DSEI fair featured a vast array of state-of-the-art military equipment, from tanks and armoured personnel carriers through fighter jets and high-speed inflatables, to sniper rifles and hi-tech protective clothing. In his opening address, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox emphasised the importance of the defence industry to the UK economy, with an annual turnover of Â£35 billion last year. The Department for International Trade's stand featured a Bowler off-road rapid intervention vehicle (RIV) complete with machine gun, a light artillery gun and an inflatable rescue launch as well as a series of unmanned aerial drones. A spokesman for the department said: ""The government undertakes a stringent process of scrutiny and approval before issuing any invitations to foreign governments to attend a major UK defence exhibition like DSEI. ""Respect for human rights is a mandatory consideration in the process and a country would not be invited where that would contradict the UK's international obligations."" A group from the Botswana military attended the DSEI event last week Bristol-based artist Banksyis well-known for his politically provocative artworks - and has gained global notoriety for his unique, stencilled artwork on public walls and facades. Two years ago, he offered afree weapons guide at his Dismaland theme parkin Weston-super-Mare to coincide with the 2015 DSEI arms fair. He asked members of the public to disperse the guide for tracking manufacturers of weapons used against public protest, saying it was ""of limited use in Weston-super-Mare"".

"Four dead, three hurt, in M5 lorry crash","This video can not be played Drivers rushed to help those caught in the crash Four people have died in a crash on the M5. Police said a lorry travelling southbound crashed through the central reservation and hit at least two vehicles heading the opposite way. A woman and two children were also injured in the crash and taken to hospitals in Bristol, where they are in a life-threatening condition. Emergency services were called just after 14:30 BST on Saturday to junctions 15 and 14 in Gloucestershire. The lorry driver was taken to hospital to be checked over as a precaution. The motorway was shut for hours after the crash in both directions between junctions 16 and 14 to allow the recovery operation and investigations to be carried out. The southbound side of the carriageway reopened at about 05:30. Highways England said it expected the northbound side to remain shut throughout Sunday. Supt Simon Ellis, of Avon and Somerset Police, said the rescue and recovery operation was ""painstaking work"". ""Our priority is to ensure the victims' next of kin are notified and supported, as well as the ongoing management of the scene, and this important work is ongoing,"" he said. Supt Ellis thanked the emergency services, as well as members of the public who ""courageously went to the aid of those involved"" in the crash. Motorists have been stuck on the M5 for hours Cardiologist Dr Amer Hamed was in a car travelling ""10 to 20 seconds behind"" when the crash happened. He was one of the first at the scene along with a passing GP and other medics to help an injured woman who was in one of the cars. Paramedics arrived on the scene about six minutes later and the woman Dr Hamed had been helping was taken away by ambulance to hospital. He said: ""There was a lorry involved and at least two other cars. One was absolutely destroyed and another had flipped over."" He said motorists who had been stuck on the carriageway for several hours were ""very helpful"". ""People are helping as much as they can,"" he said. ""Several people offered us water and one man came out of his car to give food. We're going to be stuck here for a few hours yet."" South Western Ambulance Service said it was called just after 14.30 BST. The most striking thing about the scene is the almost complete silence here. Looking over the bridge, the police, fire and ambulance crews are patiently doing their work at quite a disturbing scene. The lorry that has crashed has hit what M5 commuters will know as a familiar landmark, a windsock next to the road. But alongside that are several cars crushed from the impact. On the other side of the bridge, motorists patiently wait with some eager to help. I overheard one asking if any prayer support was needed.

Schoolgirl injured in 'horrific' bus fall,"Pupils from St Kevin's College were attending a Mass to celebrate the opening of the school A schoolgirl was left semi-conscious by a roadside after falling through a rear window of a bus in County Fermanagh. The 16-year-old pupil was returning to St Kevin's College in Lisnaskea from a trip when the bus window collapsed and she was thrown into the road on Monday. She was found lying on the grass verge by the school's principal, Gary Kelly. ""It really was horrific, quite horrific,"" he said. ""She was really quite badly cut up."" He said the window was understood to have given way when the bus turned a corner and the girl leaned on it. Mr Kelly found the window further along the road. ""I saw the whole window of the bus and the rubber frame,"" he told the BBC. The incident was first reportedby the Fermanagh Herald newspaper,external. The pupil was assessed at hospital and found to have no serious head or spinal injuries, but she has not yet returned to school. ""She's an A-star girl, a brilliant child,"" said Mr Kelly. The girl had been travelling in a yellow Education Authority bus with other pupils, two teachers and an assistant. Some 600 pupils had been returning in several buses from a celebratory Mass to mark the school's opening on 11 September, following the amalgamation of two local schools. The Education Authority said it was investigating the circumstances of the incident, but that it would be ""inappropriate to comment further at this stage"". A spokesperson said the incident was unprecedented, and not related to an emergency exit on the bus.

German storm over 'pride in WW2' remarks,"Mainstream opinion sees the Wehrmacht as a willing tool of the Nazis A candidate of Germany's right-wing nationalist party has said the country should ""be proud of"" its soldiers in both world wars and people should no longer ""reproach"" Germans for World War Two. Alexander Gauland's words have been met with some scorn. What pride are Germans likely to muster for the Wehrmacht? Germany is ""very devoted to a discussion of its past"", Andrew Cohen, a Canadian journalist and professor, tells the BBC. ""I have not seen a country anywhere that is as committed to a frank and painful discussion of its history as Germany is."" Making a Nazi salute or denying the Holocaust in Germany could land you in jail - alongside swastikas and other Nazi symbols they are illegal. And the country takes pains to make sure the horrors of World War Two are remembered, respectfully, with a view to preventing them happening again. Cities are full of sites dedicated to the Holocaust, from big museums and concentration camp memorials totiny plaques in the ground, the size of cobblestones, that you may notice by chance when in the middle of something else. BBC History: World War Two The Holocaust year by year Some have said it is too much - a decade ago already Der Spiegel published anarticle,externaldecrying the ""mania for commemoration"" and quoting the essayist Wolf Jobst Siedler saying: ""If the Germans were once the greatest sinners, they now apparently want to be the greatest penitents."" The army (Wehrmacht) did not run the concentration camps - that was the role of the SS. But it committed atrocities of its own including shooting thousands of Polish people. ""The mainstream approach is that the Wehrmacht was a willing instrument of the Nazi perpetrators as an institution,"" says Michael Wolffson, an Israeli-German historian at the University of the Armed Forces in Munich. ""Many things are commemorated - resistance to the Nazis, victims such as Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals - but not the Wehrmacht."" Does he think Germany should regain pride in its army of the time? ""Any generalisation is stupid,"" was his reply. A video emerged of Alexander Gauland, a candidate for the right-wing nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is expected to gain seats in the national parliament for the first time at elections next weekend, speaking to supporters. Mr Gauland is one of his party's top candidates He said ""no other people"" in Europe had dealt as clearly as the Germans with a ""wrong"" past, and the 12 years when the Nazi party ruled Germany (1933-1945) ""no longer affect our identity"". ""We have the right to take back our country and our history,"" he said. ""If the French are rightly proud of their emperor and the Britons of Nelson and Churchill, we have the right to be proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars,"" he said.

Germany's justice minister tweeted that the statements showed the AfD was on the extreme right. Newspapers reported the statements as a ""provocation,external"" and said they ""made one catch one's breath,external"" (articles in German). For German writer Marcel Krueger, the statement is ""a bit strange"". ""I don't think anyone perceives anything the German army did then as positive,"" he says. Many children of the post-war generation felt a strong sense of guilt over what their parents had done. Mr Krueger says that has changed. For his generation ""it's about looking at it from a neutral space"". ""The lessons from the past, as horrible and bad as they are, need to be confronted and understood."" Allow Twitter content?

But Amy Iman Zayed, someone detached from this controversy because her parents are Egyptian, has noticed guilt among her classmates. In the mandatory classes about World War Two, she saw that her friends would ""sound and look embarrassed as if it was them or their parents who did all these terrible things"". ""And sometimes someone would say: 'But what do I have to do with it?' ""And the teachers would be really upset and give them a hard time. They would say stuff like: 'You should never forget what happened so it never happens again, and although you yourself have nothing to do with it we need to remind ourselves what could happen.'"" Some of Germany's memorials are designed to be small and subtle and take one by surprise Mr Cohen, the Canadian who admires Germany's willingness to grapple with its past, says: ""The story of post-war Germany has been one of guilt, a search for an act of redemption."" Some saw that act in Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees to the country. But that decision in itself has fanned the flames of right-wing nationalism. The German language has many great long words and of course there is one that is instructive here.VergangenheitsbewÃ¤ltigung- or coming to terms with the past - describes the struggle with a problematic recent history.

Boris Johnson 'all behind' PM over Brexit,"Boris Johnson has insisted he is ""all behind"" Theresa May after setting out his own vision of Britain after Brexit. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,external, the foreign secretary revived the contested claim Brexit could free up Â£350m a week for the NHS and also said the UK should not pay for EU single market access. He later tweeted he backed the PM, who is making a major EU speech next week. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the Â£350m figure was ""a lie"" while Jeremy Corbyn said it showed Tory divisions. In a 4,000 word piece for the newspaper, Mr Johnson expanded at length on his views about the Brexit negotiations with the EU, and the opportunities he said it would give a ""bold, thriving"" Britain when it leaves in March 2019. If Britain did continue its membership of the single market and customs union it would make a ""complete mockery"" of last year's referendum result, he wrote. Brexit: All you need to know Could PM's Florence speech prove a game changer? Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? The UK, he argued, would be ""roughly"" Â£350m better off once it had ""settled its accounts"" with the EU and he said it would be ""fine"" if ""a lot of that money"" was spent on the health service. Writing later on Twitter,external, Mr Johnson said that he was ""looking forward"" to the prime minister's speech next Friday in Florence - in which she is expected to set out details of the UK's ""special partnership"" with the EU after Brexit. ""All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit,"" he wrote. The BBC's political correspondent Leila Nathoo said that although sources close to Mr Johnson insist his article has nothing to do with leadership ambitions, the intervention has revived speculation that he is still eyeing the top job. Asked for her response, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was focused on co-ordinating the government's response to the Parsons Green bomb attack and had hadn't a chance to look at the article. But Sir Vince Cable suggested the foreign secretary was pushing for ""a far more extreme"" version of Brexit in pursuit of his own personal ambitions. ""On his central point, the Â£350m a week, this is a lie. He knows it is a lie and endlessly repeating it does not make it the truth,"" he said. And the Lib Dems Brexit spokesman Tom Brake told his party conference - which began on Saturday - that far from enhancing the NHS, the UK's exit would have a ""calamitous effect on our cherished public services"". Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested there is a consensus in the cabinet for the need for a transitional period of several years to minimise the disruption from Brexit - which would ""look a lot like the status quo"" in many ways. This has prompted unconfirmed speculation that the UK could potentially pay the EU for a limited period of time to continue to access the single market on an existing tariff-free basis. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson's comments ""laid bare the conflicts at the heart of Theresa May's government over Brexit"" and undermined the prime minister's authority. He said: ""The foreign secretary even has the gall to dredge up the fantasy of Â£350m a week extra for the NHS. ""The prime minister must spell out now how this will be paid for, or stand condemned for once again trying to mislead the British public."" In the run up to the referendum, the Leave campaign - of which Mr Johnson was a key figure - claimed the UK sent Â£20bn a year, or Â£350m a week, to Brussels in 2014. Vote Leave emblazoned the figure on its campaign bus and said the money could be used to fund extra spending on public services such as the NHS. Buta letter from the head of the UK statistics watchdog Sir Andrew Dilnot,externalduring the referendum campaign described the figure as ""potentially misleading"". The Â£350m figure was one of the Leave campaign's main messages By Liz Corbin, Reality Check Editor The claim that the UK sent Â£350m per week to the EU is wrong. There are three things to consider: The UK's gross contribution to the EU The UK's rebate, negotiated by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher The amount of money the EU gives to the UK Boris Johnson and other Leave campaigners claimed that in the calendar year 2014, the UK gave Â£350m per week to the EU. The UK's gross contribution was actually Â£361m, but - crucially - the rebate is removed before any money is sent to the EU. So the amount sent to the EU in 2014 was Â£276m per week, after the rebate. The Vote Leave campaign's claim argued that the money could be spent on the NHS. Well, it could, but that would mean cutting all the money the EU sends back to the UK, for example on farming subsidies and grants for community projects. That was in 2014. The amount the UK sends the EU has been falling. In 2016 it sent Â£252m per week to the EU after the rebate, the lowest since 2012. Are we giving Â£350m a week to Brussels? Pound hits highest since Brexit vote The politics behind the Â£350m figure What happens now that a deal's been done?

'At least' four dead in M5 crash,"This video can not be played Drivers rushed to help those caught in the crash Four people have died in a crash on the M5. Police said a lorry travelling southbound crashed through the central reservation and hit at least two vehicles heading the opposite way. A woman and two children were also injured in the crash and taken to hospitals in Bristol, where they are in a life-threatening condition. Emergency services were called just after 14:30 BST on Saturday to junctions 15 and 14 in Gloucestershire. The lorry driver was taken to hospital to be checked over as a precaution. The motorway was shut for hours after the crash in both directions between junctions 16 and 14 to allow the recovery operation and investigations to be carried out. The southbound side of the carriageway reopened at about 05:30. Highways England said it expected the northbound side to remain shut throughout Sunday. Supt Simon Ellis, of Avon and Somerset Police, said the rescue and recovery operation was ""painstaking work"". ""Our priority is to ensure the victims' next of kin are notified and supported, as well as the ongoing management of the scene, and this important work is ongoing,"" he said. Supt Ellis thanked the emergency services, as well as members of the public who ""courageously went to the aid of those involved"" in the crash. Motorists have been stuck on the M5 for hours Cardiologist Dr Amer Hamed was in a car travelling ""10 to 20 seconds behind"" when the crash happened. He was one of the first at the scene along with a passing GP and other medics to help an injured woman who was in one of the cars. Paramedics arrived on the scene about six minutes later and the woman Dr Hamed had been helping was taken away by ambulance to hospital. He said: ""There was a lorry involved and at least two other cars. One was absolutely destroyed and another had flipped over."" He said motorists who had been stuck on the carriageway for several hours were ""very helpful"". ""People are helping as much as they can,"" he said. ""Several people offered us water and one man came out of his car to give food. We're going to be stuck here for a few hours yet."" South Western Ambulance Service said it was called just after 14.30 BST. The most striking thing about the scene is the almost complete silence here. Looking over the bridge, the police, fire and ambulance crews are patiently doing their work at quite a disturbing scene. The lorry that has crashed has hit what M5 commuters will know as a familiar landmark, a windsock next to the road. But alongside that are several cars crushed from the impact. On the other side of the bridge, motorists patiently wait with some eager to help. I overheard one asking if any prayer support was needed. While others talk to police officers about the sadness of what has happened.

Flats fire leaves residents 'with nothing',"The fire was reported at about 06:50 BST, Kent Fire and Rescue Service said Residents forced to leave their homes after a fire at a block of flats say their properties have been destroyed and they have been left with nothing. The fire in Manley Boulevard, Holborough Lakes in Snodland, was reported at about 06:50 BST, Kent Fire and Rescue Service said. At its peak more than 100 firefighters were at the scene tackling a blaze. The cause of the fire is not yet know. Alternative accommodation is being found for those affected. No-one was seriously injured in the blaze, but some residents of the 22 flats in the block say everything they own has been destroyed. Lee Hayes, who lives in the block, said: ""I was woken up to banging on the door. I ran into my living room and just outside my patio doors there were flames engulfing the whole building. ""There's pretty much nothing left of my property."" Louise Finch said her whole life had been in her flat. ""We've all lost everything, absolutely everything."" Eyewitness Les Jeal said: ""It's calmed down now, the whole block is evacuated and everyone is accounted for and safe. ""The local Snodland community have come together and rounded up donations for the families affected."" He said online fundraising pages had been set up for those forced to leave their homes. ""Most families have been left with just the clothes on their backs."" Dean Bone-Knell from Kent Fire and Rescue Service said the building had suffered ""serious structural damage"". ""Some of the flats have been completely burnt out. ""You can see the facade of the building, but inside it's very unsupported and our firefighters have got to be very careful that parts of the building don't collapse."" A community briefing centre has been set up for the residents of the 22 flats in the block in Lambe Close, Manley Boulevard, the fire service said and those affected are being found alternative accommodation.

Armed police search house over Tube bombing,"This video can not be played Police cordons are in place around the residential street in Surrey Police have arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of a terror offence in connection with Friday's attack on a London Tube train. Armed police are continuing to search a house in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. The arrest is ""very significant"" and the terror threat level remains ""critical"", Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said. The man was arrested in the departure area of Dover port on Saturday and has been moved to a London police station. Thirty people were injured after the explosion on a train at Parsons Green. Live: Arrest in hunt for Tube attacker Reality Check: How terror threat levels work In pictures: Parsons Green blast Armed police patrols stepped up in Scotland The arrest sparked an evacuation of Dover port and a number of items were recovered in a police search, Mr Basu said, adding that detectives were ""keeping an open mind"" as to whether more people were involved in the Tube attack. Residents of houses surrounding the Sunbury-on-Thames property have been allowed to return home after being evacuated by officers earlier on Saturday. Locals said the property being searched by police is occupied by married couple Ronald Jones, 88, and Penelope Jones, 71. The couple are known for fostering many children and young people over several decades, and in 2010 wererewarded by the Queen by being made MBEs,external. Penelope and Ronald Jones, who were made MBEs in 2010, live in the house at the centre of a police search One neighbour, Anna Wilkins, told BBC News she was ""shaking like jelly"" after being told by armed police to leave the home she shares with her partner and two young children. ""As I walked out of my house I saw three armed officers,"" she said. ""One had a balaclava on, all I could see were his eyes, I was really frightened."" Many residents had been evacuated to Staines Rugby Club where one local, Dan Norcott, said the council had  begun making preliminary arrangements for hotel accommodation. This video can not be played ""An officer banged on the door quite severely and said 'Out now you've got two minutes'"" After a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee earlier, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was ""much too early"" to say whether those behind the attack were known to authorities, adding: ""The operation is ongoing"". The terror threat level was raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, on Friday evening. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick described the attack as ""cowardly and indiscriminate"". Ms Dick, who travelled by Tube before joining Met officers patrolling the South Bank, said: ""London has not stopped after other terrible attacks and it will not stop after this one."" Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick joined police patrolling London's South Bank Operation Temperer, which involves the use of the military was put in place after the threat level was raised and is being stepped up gradually. Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it is mainly focused on London and the south-east of England and is described as ""light-touch"", and not on the same scale as what was seen after theManchester Arena attack. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said ""significant"" police activity would continue this weekend. More armed police officers will be present at London Underground stations, as well as at stations across England, Scotland and Wales, British Transport Police Assistant Chief Constable Robin Smith told the BBC. Most people caught in the blast were treated for minor injuries and have been released, NHS England said, but three people remain in Chelsea and Westminster hospital in central London. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This is the fourth time the UK national terror threat level has been raised to critical since the system was made public in 2006. The last time was in May following the Manchester Arena bombing, when it was wrongly thought the bomb-maker was still at large and could strike again. On Friday the government delayed raising the threat level to critical for more than 12 hours under advice from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre.  On Saturday the home secretary said it would remain at this level, implying that despite the arrest there is still thought to be a risk of another imminent attack. Each time the level has gone to critical, it has only stayed at this highest level of alertness for three to four days - this is partly as it involves an unsustainably high tempo for the police, intelligence and security services. Extra patrols are mounted on the streets of London, covert surveillance is stepped up and troops are deployed to free up police officers to focus on the main effort: catching the bomber before he can plant another device. But the very fact that Friday's attack took place with no warning shows this system is only a broad guide to the threat and simply reflects the latest assessment. The BBC understands CCTV images have been obtained of the person suspected of planting the explosive device. The Islamic State group has said it was behind the bomb, which detonated at 08:20 BST on Friday. It is understood the device had a timer, but the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off properly. Police have spoken to 100 witnesses so far and received 180 images and videos from the public Had it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said. The Met's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said it was ""very routine"" for the Islamic State group to claim the attack, whether in contact with those involved or not. They urge anyone with information to get in touch and to upload pictures and video to the websitewww.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk,externalor to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.

Koala survives 16km ride on car axle,"This video can not be played The koala was rescued from under the car wheel arch A koala has been released into the wild in Australia after recovering from a 16km (10-mile) car journey clinging to the axle of a four-wheel drive. The female had crawled into the wheel arch of the vehicle while it was parked in the hills near the city of Adelaide last weekend. The driver was only alerted to the marsupial's presence when he stopped and heard her traumatised cries. Rescuers eventually came to take the wheel off and free the koala. ""I could smell her burnt fur,"" Jane Brister from the Fauna Rescue charity told Reuters news agency. Coyote hitches ride in car grille The wheel of the car had to be removed to free the animal After a few days of resting and feeding in captivity, the animal was released into the forest. Koalas are native to Australia and classified as a ""vulnerable"" species. There are fewer than 100,000 left in the wild, according to the Australian Koala Foundation.

Boris Johnson repeats Â£350m Brexit claim,"Boris Johnson has insisted he is ""all behind"" Theresa May after setting out his own vision of Britain after Brexit. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,external, the foreign secretary revived the contested claim Brexit could free up Â£350m a week for the NHS and also said the UK should not pay for EU single market access. He later tweeted he backed the PM, who is making a major EU speech next week. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the Â£350m figure was ""a lie"" while Jeremy Corbyn said it showed Tory divisions. In a 4,000 word piece for the newspaper, Mr Johnson expanded at length on his views about the Brexit negotiations with the EU, and the opportunities he said it would give a ""bold, thriving"" Britain when it leaves in March 2019. If Britain did continue its membership of the single market and customs union it would make a ""complete mockery"" of last year's referendum result, he wrote. Brexit: All you need to know Could PM's Florence speech prove a game changer? Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? The UK, he argued, would be ""roughly"" Â£350m better off once it had ""settled its accounts"" with the EU and he said it would be ""fine"" if ""a lot of that money"" was spent on the health service. Writing later on Twitter,external, Mr Johnson said that he was ""looking forward"" to the prime minister's speech next Friday in Florence - in which she is expected to set out details of the UK's ""special partnership"" with the EU after Brexit. ""All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit,"" he wrote. The BBC's political correspondent Leila Nathoo said that although sources close to Mr Johnson insist his article has nothing to do with leadership ambitions, the intervention has revived speculation that he is still eyeing the top job. Asked for her response, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was focused on co-ordinating the government's response to the Parsons Green bomb attack and had hadn't a chance to look at the article. But Sir Vince Cable suggested the foreign secretary was pushing for ""a far more extreme"" version of Brexit in pursuit of his own personal ambitions. ""On his central point, the Â£350m a week, this is a lie. He knows it is a lie and endlessly repeating it does not make it the truth,"" he said. And the Lib Dems Brexit spokesman Tom Brake told his party conference - which began on Saturday - that far from enhancing the NHS, the UK's exit would have a ""calamitous effect on our cherished public services"". Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested there is a consensus in the cabinet for the need for a transitional period of several years to minimise the disruption from Brexit - which would ""look a lot like the status quo"" in many ways. This has prompted unconfirmed speculation that the UK could potentially pay the EU for a limited period of time to continue to access the single market on an existing tariff-free basis. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson's comments ""laid bare the conflicts at the heart of Theresa May's government over Brexit"" and undermined the prime minister's authority. He said: ""The foreign secretary even has the gall to dredge up the fantasy of Â£350m a week extra for the NHS. ""The prime minister must spell out now how this will be paid for, or stand condemned for once again trying to mislead the British public."" In the run up to the referendum, the Leave campaign - of which Mr Johnson was a key figure - claimed the UK sent Â£20bn a year, or Â£350m a week, to Brussels in 2014. Vote Leave emblazoned the figure on its campaign bus and said the money could be used to fund extra spending on public services such as the NHS. Buta letter from the head of the UK statistics watchdog Sir Andrew Dilnot,externalduring the referendum campaign described the figure as ""potentially misleading"". The Â£350m figure was one of the Leave campaign's main messages By Liz Corbin, Reality Check Editor The claim that the UK sent Â£350m per week to the EU is wrong. There are three things to consider: The UK's gross contribution to the EU The UK's rebate, negotiated by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher The amount of money the EU gives to the UK Boris Johnson and other Leave campaigners claimed that in the calendar year 2014, the UK gave Â£350m per week to the EU. The UK's gross contribution was actually Â£361m, but - crucially - the rebate is removed before any money is sent to the EU. So the amount sent to the EU in 2014 was Â£276m per week, after the rebate. The Vote Leave campaign's claim argued that the money could be spent on the NHS. Well, it could, but that would mean cutting all the money the EU sends back to the UK, for example on farming subsidies and grants for community projects. That was in 2014. The amount the UK sends the EU has been falling. In 2016 it sent Â£252m per week to the EU after the rebate, the lowest since 2012. Are we giving Â£350m a week to Brussels? Pound hits highest since Brexit vote The politics behind the Â£350m figure What happens now that a deal's been done?

Man arrested over London Tube bombing,"This video can not be played Police cordons are in place around the residential street in Surrey Police have arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of a terror offence in connection with Friday's attack on a London Tube train. Armed police are continuing to search a house in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. The arrest is ""very significant"" and the terror threat level remains ""critical"", Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said. The man was arrested in the departure area of Dover port on Saturday and has been moved to a London police station. Thirty people were injured after the explosion on a train at Parsons Green. Live: Arrest in hunt for Tube attacker Reality Check: How terror threat levels work In pictures: Parsons Green blast Armed police patrols stepped up in Scotland The arrest sparked an evacuation of Dover port and a number of items were recovered in a police search, Mr Basu said, adding that detectives were ""keeping an open mind"" as to whether more people were involved in the Tube attack. Residents of houses surrounding the Sunbury-on-Thames property have been allowed to return home after being evacuated by officers earlier on Saturday. Locals said the property being searched by police is occupied by married couple Ronald Jones, 88, and Penelope Jones, 71. The couple are known for fostering many children and young people over several decades, and in 2010 wererewarded by the Queen by being made MBEs,external. Penelope and Ronald Jones, who were made MBEs in 2010, live in the house at the centre of a police search One neighbour, Anna Wilkins, told BBC News she was ""shaking like jelly"" after being told by armed police to leave the home she shares with her partner and two young children. ""As I walked out of my house I saw three armed officers,"" she said. ""One had a balaclava on, all I could see were his eyes, I was really frightened."" Many residents had been evacuated to Staines Rugby Club where one local, Dan Norcott, said the council had  begun making preliminary arrangements for hotel accommodation. This video can not be played ""An officer banged on the door quite severely and said 'Out now you've got two minutes'"" After a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee earlier, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was ""much too early"" to say whether those behind the attack were known to authorities, adding: ""The operation is ongoing"". The terror threat level was raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, on Friday evening. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick described the attack as ""cowardly and indiscriminate"". Ms Dick, who travelled by Tube before joining Met officers patrolling the South Bank, said: ""London has not stopped after other terrible attacks and it will not stop after this one."" Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick joined police patrolling London's South Bank Operation Temperer, which involves the use of the military was put in place after the threat level was raised and is being stepped up gradually. Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it is mainly focused on London and the south-east of England and is described as ""light-touch"", and not on the same scale as what was seen after theManchester Arena attack. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said ""significant"" police activity would continue this weekend. More armed police officers will be present at London Underground stations, as well as at stations across England, Scotland and Wales, British Transport Police Assistant Chief Constable Robin Smith told the BBC. Most people caught in the blast were treated for minor injuries and have been released, NHS England said, but three people remain in Chelsea and Westminster hospital in central London. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This is the fourth time the UK national terror threat level has been raised to critical since the system was made public in 2006. The last time was in May following the Manchester Arena bombing, when it was wrongly thought the bomb-maker was still at large and could strike again. On Friday the government delayed raising the threat level to critical for more than 12 hours under advice from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre.  On Saturday the home secretary said it would remain at this level, implying that despite the arrest there is still thought to be a risk of another imminent attack. Each time the level has gone to critical, it has only stayed at this highest level of alertness for three to four days - this is partly as it involves an unsustainably high tempo for the police, intelligence and security services. Extra patrols are mounted on the streets of London, covert surveillance is stepped up and troops are deployed to free up police officers to focus on the main effort: catching the bomber before he can plant another device. But the very fact that Friday's attack took place with no warning shows this system is only a broad guide to the threat and simply reflects the latest assessment. The BBC understands CCTV images have been obtained of the person suspected of planting the explosive device. The Islamic State group has said it was behind the bomb, which detonated at 08:20 BST on Friday. It is understood the device had a timer, but the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off properly. Police have spoken to 100 witnesses so far and received 180 images and videos from the public Had it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said. The Met's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said it was ""very routine"" for the Islamic State group to claim the attack, whether in contact with those involved or not. They urge anyone with information to get in touch and to upload pictures and video to the websitewww.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk,externalor to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.

Koala survives 16km ride on car axel,"This video can not be played The koala was rescued from under the car wheel arch A koala has been released into the wild in Australia after recovering from a 16km (10-mile) car journey clinging to the axle of a four-wheel drive. The female had crawled into the wheel arch of the vehicle while it was parked in the hills near the city of Adelaide last weekend. The driver was only alerted to the marsupial's presence when he stopped and heard her traumatised cries. Rescuers eventually came to take the wheel off and free the koala. ""I could smell her burnt fur,"" Jane Brister from the Fauna Rescue charity told Reuters news agency. Coyote hitches ride in car grille The wheel of the car had to be removed to free the animal After a few days of resting and feeding in captivity, the animal was released into the forest. Koalas are native to Australia and classified as a ""vulnerable"" species. There are fewer than 100,000 left in the wild, according to the Australian Koala Foundation.

Cult actor Harry Dean Stanton dies at 91,"Harry Dean Stanton, pictured in 2013 Actor Harry Dean Stanton, known for his roles in films like The Godfather II, Alien and Cool Hand Luke, has died of natural causes at the age of 91. The Kentucky-born star had a career which spanned more than six decades, appearing in dozens of films, including 1984's Paris, Texas and Repo Man. More recently, he appeared in the hit HBO show Big Love, and this year's revival of the cult classic Twin Peaks. Stanton's last role was in Lucky - a film to be released later this month. He died at Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles on Friday, his agent John Kelly said in a statement. This video can not be played Harry Dean Stanton told Ridley Scott he ""didn't like monster pictures"" He said Stanton was ""beloved in the entertainment industry"" and earned a reputation for his ""meticulous preparation"" and easygoing personality. Twin Peaks creator David Lynch, who cast Stanton in his films The Straight Story, Inland Empire and Wild at Heart, among others, said: ""There's nobody like Harry Dean. Everyone loved him.

Madonna: 'I want to reinvent pop tours',"Twenty-seven years ago, Madonna set the template for modern pop concerts with her Blond Ambition world tour. From its hydraulic stage to Jean-Paul Gaultier's iconic costumes, it raised the bar for stadium-sized spectacle. Now, after seven huge world tours, the star tells the BBC she's ""exploring"" a smaller-scale show in the future. ""I've done so many shows - world tours, stadiums, sports arenas, you name it - that I feel like I have to reinvent that now too,"" she explains. ""I like doing intimate shows and being able to talk directly to the audience. ""This is something I'm exploring right now: the idea of doing a show that doesn't travel the world, but stays in one place and utilises not only humour and the music in a more intimate setting but other people's music, as well, and other entertainment. ""Kind of a revolving door of amazing, gifted, unique talent - dancers, musicians, singers, comedians, me, humour. I don't know! Like, I'm trying to come up with all those ideas now."" Madonna's Tears of a Clown show could be the template for her next tour The concerts will presumably owe much to the vaudeville-style Tears of a Clown show that Madonna performed twice in 2016 - once as a gift to fans in Australia, and again at a fundraiser for her Raising Malawi charity. The low-key gigs featured the pop icon dressed as a clown, riding a tricycle, chatting to the audience and telling jokes when not performing stripped-back renditions of some of her favourite songs. Footage of the Australian concert appears on the star's new DVD, released on Friday, which documents her 2015-16 Rebel Heart Tour. In an exclusive interview with BBC News, she talked about touring life, changing attitudes to sex, and her recent dispute with a courier company... Before we start, there's one thing I need to know: Did yourFedEx packageever arrive? Ha ha! Yes, it has. FedEx is blaming customs, customs is blaming FedEx and we'll never know what happened. But I have it now. So,I saw the Rebel Heart tour when you were in Londonand the DVD does a really good job of capturing what it was like to be in the audience. How do you go about that? I was there every step of the way, every day for months and months. It's really hard to capture the true feeling of the excitement and the passion and the heat and the blood, sweat and tears.  I'm pleased with the way it came out. There's a particularly touching sequence during True Blue, where everybody in the audience embraces each other. I know, it's a very sweet, emotional moment in the show. I didn't expect it to be, but when I look back at the DVD it almost brings a tear to my eye because everyone seems so in love. The Rebel Heart tour featured Samurai, matadors and a finale in a 1920s-style Parisian cafe How do you put a show like this together? Where do you get the ideas? Everything's based around my song choice. So first, I go through my catalogue of songs with my band and I start working on things that excite me and inspire me in the moment. Some songs I'm sick of doing and I don't want to do them. Other songs I say, ""No, I did that on the last tour, I don't want to do it again."" So I try to rotate things and I also try to reflect my current mood and what I've been feeling, and what's been inspiring me artistically or filmically, politically, philosophically. I try to put songs together in groups that have thematic connection, and then I try to tell a story. And then I do the visuals. It's quite a process. What are the songs you don't want to do again? Well, I tend to not want to do the songs I did on the tour before. That's what I mean. So if I did Material Girl on the tour before, or Express Yourself on the tour before, then I'll say, ""OK, I did that for 88 shows. I can't do it again."" How do you keep a healthy balance between new songs and your back catalogue? It's just playing in rehearsal. It's really hard for me, especially with my older songs, to do them with the original arrangement. Because 33 years later, after doing it for so long, you just have to reinvent things. Well, I do. And it's fun for me to take an '80s pop song and turn it into a salsa song, or turn it into a samba, or make an uptempo song into a ballad. The Blond Ambition tour changed how many people think about pop concerts The overarching theme of the tour was being a rebel. In the intro you say, ""when fascist dictators come for you dressed as righteous men"" you have to rise up and take a stand. If you were doing the tour against the current political backdrop, would that message feel more relevant? Yeah, I created that voiceover for my short filmSecret Project,,external. I feel like it was a foreshadowing of things to come, like a prophecy. You felt something in the air? I did then - and I think people all thought I was being a little bit dramatic and extreme, but I felt like I was witnessing the beginning of it on the tour previous [to Rebel Heart]. And, of course, look what's happening in the world right now. It's pretty crazy. Twenty-seven years ago, the Pope tried to get one of your shows banned. Now you have pole-dancing nuns and nobody bats an eyelid. Is that progress? Is it progress? Well, I guess in some ways you could call that progress. When I released mySex book, the idea of someone being scantily-clad on the street was an outrage. But look at social media today and it's nothing. People get used to things, but I wouldn't call that progress. What I think of as progress is people becoming more open-minded, and people understanding the difference between art and exploitation. Madonna has always played with religious iconography in her shows When I was banned by the Pope, I was playing with the ideas of religion and sexuality, which are usually kept completely apart. Sex is considered a sin in the Catholic church. And I was questioning that and challenging that point of view because I don't, obviously, agree with it. So now that no one's batting an eyelash about nuns on the stripper poles, it doesn't mean that the Vatican or the Catholic church is soul-searching or investigating whether they made the right choices. I don't think people are thinking that maybe sexuality and Goddon'tneed to be separate. That, to me, would be progress. The DVD also includes the Tears of a Clown show you did in Melbourne. Was that a one-off or a trial run for a different type of Madonna concert? I like doing intimate shows and being able to talk directly to the audience; to play with them and use humour and pathos and truth, and share my life - and also make up stories. I like the freedom of it and I like the intimacy of it, and I would like to explore doing it more in the future. Maybe a residency? Yeah, a residency. If I look back at the Rebel Heart tour, my favourite [part] was really the last section where I got to just sit on the stage and play my ukulele and sing La Vie en Rose and talk to the audience. [It was] just more intimate. More audience participation and connecting to human beings - I feel I'm craving that more and more. The pop singer played more than 80 shows on her Rebel Heart tour Did it feel like there was more room for improvisation in that section? Yeah, I have freedom and I can make mistakes. That's another thing I do in Tears of a Clown - if I start a song off wrong and I make a boo-boo, I just turn around and go ""Stop! Let's start again!"" When you're doing a sports arena show, you're linked up to video, you can't stop. Once the train leaves the station, you have to keep going. There's a certain kind of adrenalin rush to that - but there's no room for error. So I like the idea of mistakes and freestyling. Free-falling, really. It's more exciting to me right now.

The forgotten mining disaster that claimed 361 lives,"This video can not be played ""When the pit went up it was like a volcano"" In December 1866 a colliery in Barnsley was ripped apart by a series of explosions over two days, killing at least 361 men and boys, in what remains England's worst mining disaster. The events of this largely forgotten tragedy and its devastating effect on the community have been recreated in a new film. On the fateful morning of 12 December, more than 300 workers started their shifts at The Oaks colliery in Hoyle Mill. During the afternoon there was a huge explosion. Many volunteer rescuers were still down the pit the next day when another explosion, bigger than the first, took place. Rescue attempts were then halted. The death toll was recorded as 361 - although recent research puts the figure at 383. ""When The Oaks exploded there was just nothing to compare it with; it was absolutely huge,"" historian Brian Elliott said. ""The impact was enormous on the communities. Virtually the entire adult male population of several streets in Hoyle Mill was eliminated in an afternoon."" Contemporary accounts describe houses shaking for miles around as coal was blasted upwards, turning the sky dark grey, and depositing a deathly residue, described as ""black snow"". Wales- 14 October 1913,         Senghenydd        - 439 deaths England- 12-13 December 1866, The Oaks                     - 361 deaths Scotland- 22 October 1877,         Blantyre               - 207 deaths The largest number of deaths in a single day in England was at Pretoria Colliery, in Westhoughton, in what is now Greater Manchester, on 21 December 1910, where 344 miners lost their lives. Source: NUM Researchers for commemorations to mark the 150th anniversary of the disaster soon realised they faced a mammoth task. Volunteers, funded with a lottery grant, spent more than 5,000 hours working on the project. ""There's no one place to go to to get a list of victims,"" said Stephen Miller, who was the lead researcher with the Dearne Valley Local Partnership (DVLP). ""There are some lists but they are not complete - plus they are just names. We wanted more information: where were these people from, where did they live? ""We wanted to connect with them at a human level so we looked at age profiles and looked to see if children were involved."" Parkin Jeffcock was a respected mining engineer. As soon as he got a telegram informing him The Oaks was on fire he got on a train at Sheffield and travelled to Barnsley. He and others descended into the pit to assess the damage and help stabilise the conditions for rescuers. Jeffcock was still down there at 9am the following day when a second, bigger, blast occurred, killing him and 26 other volunteers. His body was not recovered until 5 October 1867. St Saviour's Church in High Green, Sheffield, was built as a memorial to him in 1872. Source: DVLP Death certificates held in the basement of Barnsley Town Hall were trawled through, burial registers at cemeteries and churches scrutinised, and newspaper articles containing missing persons lists pored over. ""We eventually came up with a list of more than 500 names. But we knew some would be duplicates, or the result of misspellings, so we researched them all,"" Mr Miller said. A figure of 383 was eventually reached. Among the dead were boys as young as 10. Black Snow director Stephen Linstead and others drew on press accounts to help recreate the events of 12-13 December 1866 One of the surprises the research threw up was the geographical spread of the workers. ""We had some from as far as Ireland and Northumberland as well as the coalfield areas of Wales, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire,"" Mr Miller said. ""We also had one, James Haycroft, from Shoreditch in east London, which is very strange. ""He was 38 and had married a girl from Barnsley. ""The Sheffield Daily Telegraph reported his body was found two years after the disaster but we could not find a burial record for him. ""His wife identified him by his flannel trousers, belt and boots."" To mark the 150th anniversary of the disaster, a memorial by sculptor Graham Ibbeson was unveiled in the town The defunct Barnsley Main Colliery sits on the original site of The Oaks, at Hoyle Mill The task of making a film recreating the events of 12-13 December 1866 proved challenging as, despite the scale of the tragedy, the historical evidence was scant. Stephen Linstead a filmmaker and professor at the University of York's York Management School, teamed up with Andy Lawrence and Alan ""Archie"" Andrews to try to recreate the explosion. Mr Andrews, a miner turned digital artist, recreated the scene using virtual reality. ""I looked at historical illustrations, although these were limited,"" he said. ""I used sources such as the Illustrated London News but also used my mining background. I knew what many of the buildings would look like. ""It was a mix of artistic licence with background information."" A memorial to the Rescue League, many of whom perished in the second, larger explosion, still stands in Barnsley ""I put the explosion where some stairs would have been, where the clean air would mix with returning air, possibly helping to cause the explosion,"" Mr Andrews added. ""We do know The Oaks was a very gassy pit."" ""We had to use our imagination,"" director Mr Linstead said. ""We looked through the contemporaneous press accounts and picked out phrases that were of use. ""The virtual reality reflected that there is no final version of history that you can use to get the truth of it."" A banner for the colliery is on display at the NUM's headquarters in Barnsley The reports that were laid down in Parliament after the disaster gave differing reasons for the explosion. The first, the inspection report, put the cause down to the shot firing, Mr Linstead said. The second, from the coroner, mentioned a broken lamp being a possible cause. ""The main thing is nothing happened as a result. There was no full inquiry,"" he said. ""Twenty years later things began to change. But there was no change in legislation following The Oaks."" William Henry Hart, originally from Dukinfield in what is now Greater Manchester, was aged 11 and working as pony driver when The Oaks exploded. He was underground at the time having a break, sitting in an archway with his donkey, Tom, in front of him. William Henry Hart would go back down the mine when it reopened two years later (Image courtesy of Steve Wyatt) Tom took the brunt of the blast and Hart survived, although he was badly burned and broke his arm. He was brought out of the mine by volunteer rescuer William Sugden, who was killed in the explosion the following day. Hart was among the first miners to go back down the mine when it reopened two years later. Source: DVLP NUM secretary Chris Kitchen agreed that although nothing changed immediately after the disaster, it was not long before there was a better system for recording incidents. This eventually led to the UK's mining industry becoming one of the safest and most highly regulated in the world. ""But it was reactive, rather than proactive,"" he said. ""A slow learning curve.""

Can Labour get back in touch with Catholic voters?,"Can Labour reconnect with traditional, socially conservative voters? A new organisation is being launched by a group of Labour MPs - Catholics for Labour. Mike Kane, the shadow schools minister, will be the organiser of a group to be established at Labour's conference later this month. So is Labourgoing to ""do God"" again,external? Or is it trying to reconnect with some of its traditional working class, socially conservative supporters? The group will publish a letter this weekend setting out its purpose - signed by eight other Catholic MPs on the Labour benches, with the expectation of gathering support from the wider party membership. ""We are not about standing still or merely making observations of the world around us. Our hearts and minds are firmly focused on social justice."" But this will be seen as an attempt to make space within Labour for views beyond metropolitan liberalism. Mr Kane had to see off a UKIP challenge to win his working class constituency in the north west. His backing for a Catholics for Labour group represents a different strand from ""identity politics"" focused on sexuality, race and gender. He says there are 3.8 million Catholic voters in England and Wales and ""Labour will ignore them at its peril"", Mike Kane is the MP organising a group representing Catholics within Labour The move follows the efforts of so-called Blue Labour, which wanted to re-align Labour away from freewheeling neo-liberal economics and back to an emphasis on families, communities and self-help. It's much more from the Co-op than the campus. There is also an underlying concern that liberalism is itself becoming a constricting orthodoxy, so much so that MPs or would-be candidates do not feel able to assert their own religious beliefs. This is a call that the modern Left should not be intolerant of anything that does not look and sound like itself. But it's unlikely to be plain sailing. When the group is launched, it will want to talk about social justice. But it's much more likely to face tricky questions on same-sex marriage and abortion and whether Catholic values and progressive politics are compatible. It will also raise wider questions about the place of faith in politics. Conservative MPJacob Rees-Mogg set out his religious beliefsearlier this month - and divided opinion over whether this made him more ""authentic"" or out-of-touch with modern social values. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron stood down because he felt he could notreconcile his role as party leader with his own religious beliefs. How does the modern Labour party view the role of religion? Labour has often been described as ""owing more to Methodism than Marxism"". But is the modern Left now culturally hostile to the idea of religion in public life? Catholics have been among Labour's most reliable supporters. An analysis by Ben Clements from the University of Leicester showed that in almost every election since the 1950s, Labour had a clear advantage among Catholic voters. It was support that Labour was once keen not to antagonise. When Alan Johnson was education secretary he performed what became known as the ""fastest U-turn in British political history"" when he announced and rapidly un-announced restrictions on Catholic schools. But Labour's hold on Catholic voters has weakened. In Scotland, Labour once claimed 80% of the Catholic vote, but this has more than halved, with the SNP taking the spoils. Across Britain, a 40 percentage point gap between support for Labour and the Conservatives in the 1990s has shrunk to a two percentage point lead for Labour among Catholics voting at the last election. St Andrew's Cathedral in Glasgow: Labour has lost many of its Catholic voters Of course the Catholic population has also changed across that time, becoming increasingly middle class. And it includes a wide spectrum of views on both religion and politics - with many Catholics not necessarily agreeing with their own church leaders. But are some traditionally left-leaning, but socially conservative, voters feeling that Labour is out of the touch with them? The EU referendum and the defeat of Hillary Clinton last year was seen by some as an indication of how quickly a metropolitan, socially liberal political operation can become detached from the instincts and values of blue collar voters. It's also part of a wider question of identity for political parties that no longer fit their historic labels. More than three-quarters of Labour members are now in the more affluent ABC1 social classes. In the general election, Labour won many more graduate votes than the Conservatives. It's the political equivalent of gentrification in housing in London's Labour heartlands. The streets that were once working class now have different occupants with different values. Is there room for a Catholics for Labour group in the new Left? ""I've always seen my politics as inextricably tied to my faith and I truly believe there is a natural connection between Catholicism and the Labour movement,"" says Mr Kane. ""My desire to help those who have fallen on hard times all stems from my Catholic upbringing."" But he's also fighting for a piece of Labour's soul - and pushing back against the idea that traditional religious values are becoming incompatible with the modern left.

The 'Hillary safe space' that divided the American left,"Verrit describes itself as ""media for the 65.8 million"" It's a website that describes itself as ""media for the 65.8 million"" - a reference to the number of Americans who voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election. That's a sizeable number, and if anywhere near that many had signed up,Verrit,externalwould be a very successful outlet. Instead, it has collected relatively few followers, and has highlighted divisions in the Democratic Party. Set up in June 2017, andendorsed,externalearlier this month on Twitter by Clinton herself, Verrit is a website whose primary function, according to its creator and former Clinton adviser Peter Daou, is ""to bring together like-minded people."" ""My wife and I are quite active on social media, and the community we are most involved with are Hillary supporters and voters and people who share their mindset,"" Daou tells BBC Trending. ""Since the election one of the main refrains we would hear is that these voters feel intimidated and harassed when they go on social media and they also feel invisible in the mainstream media,"" he says. ""So we thought it would be great to create a space where they could converse with each other, where their issues would be centred and highlighted."" The site displays a number of virtual message cards - known as ""Verrits"" - that quote a headline or short phrase. By clicking on the headline the reader is greeted either by a piece of text or links to news articles. A recent headline from the Verrit website Examples of some recent headlines the site has hosted include ""Murder is a leading cause of death for pregnant women in the United States."" When clicked on, the headline leads to aWashington Post article,externalfrom July. Another reads: ""By 2050, water shortages will affect a quarter of the world's population."" But on the site, statements of fact backed up by legitimate news outlets freely mix with opinion and spin. Other headlines include ""'Hillary Democrats' are the heart and conscience of America"" and ""The Republican Party is harmful to America's children."" The site seems to have flown mostly under the radar until Clinton's tweet: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. It was quickly criticised by some of Clinton's most determined opponents on the right. While that might not have been surprising, criticism of Verrit has also found root amongst those on the left. Overall online, the negative reaction was overwhelming.Politico,externaldescribed Verrit as ""a propaganda rag so shameless it would make Kim Jong Un blush."" Gab: Free speech haven or alt-right safe space? How the internet united against neo-Nazi Daily Stormer site Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Brendan James, one of the co-hosts of the leftist political comedy podcastChapo Trap House,externalis no fan of Clinton. But he also says he isn't convinced by the concept behind the site. ""It's not really a social media site because you can't upload anything to the site, you can't post your own material and these aren't really facts he's disseminating,"" he tells BBC Trending radio. ""I dare say even the more rabid Hillary voters don't quite know what to do with [Verrits]. ""I suppose you could pass them round like a meme, or use them in a little argument you might get in an email chain with your aunt,"" he says. Although Clinton's tweet received more than 22,000 likes, Verrit has not gone hugely viral. Its Twitter account has only about 60,000 followers, and its Facebook page has about 12,000. Hillary Clinton endorsed Verrit - but that hasn't led to millions of followers Daou says he doesn't take the criticism personally, and argues that the reaction shows he must be doing something right - and that his critics are scared of Hillary Clinton and Verrit. ""If her voice is being reflected in Verrit then she is here to stay,"" he says. ""I think long term, the idea of Verrit being here to stay does frighten people who don't want that view to be expressed."" Unsurprisingly, Brendan James from Chapo Trap House takes quite a different line: ""Well, that's sort of the only thing you can say when you've failed miserably in doing what you set out to do... if it were true that all of these people who voted for Hillary were as adoring of her as Peter is, this venture would make sense and they would all be clamouring for this service. ""Unfortunately I think the number of people who are really dying for this number in their dozens not their millions,"" he says. The incident highlights a key split in the Democratic Party - which is made up of many factions, but broadly speaking can be divided into Clinton loyalists, and supporters of the socialist Bernie Sanders, who challenged Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. Online, Clinton supporters use hashtags such as #StillWithHer - a reference to Clinton's popular ""I'm with her"" slogan - and #TheResistance. Sanders supporters are more likely to tweet #FeeltheBern - and as the debate over Verrit shows, these two factions have not quite been united in their shared opposition to President Donald Trump.

The whisky toasting the demise of Lehman Brothers bank,"This video can not be played Lehman Brothers: Failed bank or malt whisky? It's the bottle where everybody knows its name, and that is both its biggest asset and its biggest problem. Lehman Brothers is no longer just the bank that defined the global financial crisis of a decade ago, it's now also a range of whiskies. A London entrepreneur decided that the whole world should be able to taste one of the most profound company collapses in modern times. On 15 September nine years ago 25,000 people lost their jobs when the bank went bankrupt. James Green says he was inspired to keep the bank's name alive by the significance of those events. ""After living through the economic disaster of 2008, it really resounded with me. I personally related to it, there were people in my neighbourhood, my family that were personally affected by the crash,"" he says. He says his three different whiskies, one of which is named Ashes of Disaster, have been specially crafted to capture the flavour of the once mighty bank's fall from grace. James Green says the whiskies aim to capture the flavour of Lehman Brothers' fall from grace Getting the right to make them hasn't been a straightforward process. Barclays Bank fought Mr Green's efforts to register a trademark for the whisky at New York State's Division of Corporations. It unsuccessfully argued that it controls the Lehman Brothers name as part of the deal it struck to buy many of the bank's assets just after it went into meltdown and that the public would be confused into thinking the whisky was connected to the bank. Barclays declined to comment on the dispute. Using the Lehman's name to sell whisky is a clever idea according to Rob Malcolm. The former head of marketing for the world's biggest whisky seller, Diageo, says he thinks ""there will be an initial surge of appeal for its cleverness and its fun"" but he says ""after that's exhausted I'd be very surprised if there's much of a sustaining business there"", although he does expect it to make a profit. Dr Malcolm says that it will have greatest appeal amongst those working in the finance industry who can relate to the Lehman's story. He adds that whisky aficionados are ""disproportionately people who are economically successful"", such as bankers. Galen Lehman's eponymous family hardware store was founded in 1955 But for some firms, sharing a name with the collapsed Wall Street firm, has been more of a burden than a benefit. Since 1955 Galen Lehman's eponymous family hardware store in the US state of Ohio has been selling everything from butter churns to oil lamps and handmade soap. One of the company's wood stoves even featured in the film Back to the Future III. But 20 years ago they nearly got burnt by Lehman Brothers, the bank. It tried to stop the hardware store's efforts to become one of the first online retailers, when they registered the website lehmans.com. Mr Lehman recalls that one of their lawyers called and said: ""you can't use that name, that's us"", to which he replied: ""that's ironic it's me too"". Mr Lehman also remembers a similar call in the 1980s. Despite the problems, some 40% of his business is now done online and over the ensuing years Mr Lehman says name confusion has probably helped send additional customers his way. Lehman Brothers collapsed nine years ago on 15 September 2008 However it has also been a source of irritation and unwanted information, mainly thanks to the bank's own staff who sometimes confused the two companies domain names. The bank's was www.lehman.com, while the shop's is www.lehmans.com. ""We started getting all these emails between employees of Lehman brothers in New York and in London"", says Mr Lehman. The messages gave him a front row seat into some of the worst excesses of the financial crisis. Mr Lehman warned the bank and they eventually found a way to stop his inbox being inundated by emails that had ""information about financial transactions, bank account numbers, all kinds of clearly confidential information"". However, Mr Lehman says it gave him a unique insight into the ""play hard, work hard"" culture of the bank. ""It seemed like as soon as people were outside of work they'd head straight to the corner pub. And in one of the emails I remember in particular, one employee of Lehman Brothers was boasting to another employee of Lehman Brothers how he threw some bloke through a pub window the night before"". Actively choosing to copy another firm's name is ""audacious"", says Anthony Shore Of course, that kind of staff behaviour can be damaging to a company's reputation, something which goes hand in hand with a firm's name according to Anthony Shore. Mr Shore runs Operative Words and is one of the world's most sought after people when it comes to naming new businesses and products, something which he can charge tens of thousands of dollars for. While unintentional name coincidences are difficult to avoid, actively choosing to copy another firm's name is ""audacious"",  says Mr Shore. ""It's hard to replicate the decades and decades of equity that are accrued when a company has been in business"" for as long as the bank had, he says. ""The name becomes the crystallisation of everything that there is about the company, their reputation, their products their services for good or for ill,"" adds Mr Shore. James Green acknowledges his whiskey plays on ""the bad faith"" people now have in the demised bank's name. ""We are playing on the Lehman brothers destruction,"" he says. On both sides of the Atlantic there are many more court cases still to be heard over the failings of Lehman Brothers bank. Even without the whiskey it's a name whose reputation is still being tested.

What do we know about the bomb?,"This video can not be played Footage shows a burning bag on board the Tube carriage at Parsons Green station This is the fifth terror attack of 2017. And it's the only one this year in which nobody has died. Earlier this summer, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick said police believed they had stopped six other significant plots - and there has been at least one more since then. So, put plainly, this is the most sustained period of terror activity in England since the IRA bombing campaign of the 1970s. The amount of work that confronts detectives on a day like this is enormous. Hundreds of officers were immediately put on the investigation, with clear goals. These are: Who did it? Are there more devices? Who else, if anyone, was involved? How was the device made? So let's start with that fourth question and work backwards. The people in charge of the investigation into the bomb are scientists from the Forensic Explosives Laboratory. They investigate every explosive device recovered in the UK. In 2005 they had to look at the devices left behind from the botched attacks of 21 July. The bomb at Parsons Green was an improvised explosive device (IED) and, like those on 21/7, it didn't work as planned. One commuter took a picture of the device, which appeared to have wires protruding from a white canister The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. One of the 21 July 2005 devices that failed to explode TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year. The recipe is in wide circulation in publications produced by what remains of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the separate self-styled Islamic State group. But don't go looking for it: there have been dozens of ""Section 58"" prosecutions and jailings for possession of this material. It's a long-standing strategy to restrict the flow of this information. There are other similarities to previous incidents, including a failed attack on the London Underground last year. Damon Smith put his homemade device into a rucksack and left it on a Jubilee Line train in October 2016. Here he is getting off the train and leaving the bag behind: Damon Smith - now jailed He got the bomb recipe from a jihadist manual, used a cheap clock for a timer, and modified fairy lights acted as an initiator. The Parsons Green device is also understood to have had some kind of timer and the fairy lights are apparent from the pictures. Some of them have what looks like a white plug at the end which could be wax. This approach has been previously used to seal bulbs after they have been modified to be part of a bomb. Zahid Hussain, a Birmingham man convicted in May of trying to make a crude device, did exactly this. A device with a timer obviously suggests someone left it behind - although it is entirely possible the attacker intended to stay with the bomb until the end. Another would-be attacker who's now languishing in jail, Haroon Syed, wanted a bomb with a timer in case he messed it up himself. (He didn't know he was talking toan undercover investigator). Haroon Syed: Wanted bomb with a timer Working on the assumption that the attacker left before the detonation, specialist CCTV search officers will have since spent hours trying to ascertain who was carrying the distinctive Lidl freezer bag and its bulky contents onto the Tube. The London Underground is smothered with CCTV. If the attacker got on south of Parsons Green, rather than doubling back from the north, there are five stations that could have been the entrance point. Their image would have been captured on scores of cameras during their journey. Simultaneously, a specialist team of detectives will be following any money trail they can - an increasingly important part of any investigation. They'll be looking at the payment cards used to enter and leave the London Underground - and whether there is any match to a suspicious purchase of precursor chemicals. Officers will also have to work out if the attacker was alone. There may even be clues left at the scene. Latest updates: Arrest in hunt for Tube attacker Witnesses describe what happened What powers do police have to deal with terrorism? In pictures: Parsons Green blast Very often, it is the sheer incompetence of the would-be terrorist that provides the breakthrough, asthe Guardian's Jason Burke has documented,externalin this excellent piece on Friday. But thearrest of two individualswill not bring an end to the investigation. Investigators need the evidence that completes a chain from the carriage to a bomb factory (assuming again that they can find it) and a lot of that will come from the work of the Forensic Explosives Laboratory. One priority will be gathering evidence to prove that the individual intended the device to explode. In the 21/7 trial the defendants claimed it was all a hoax. So, in the months to come, scientists may construct an exact replica of the device to see how it would have behaved in controlled and safe conditions. Before that, they need to be able to safely remove the device for further analysis. That is far harder than it sounds. They can't just scoop it up and drive it through London. During 21/7, the science team carefully took small samples for analysis - but when what remained kept bubbling away, they were forced to destroy it out of fear it could still explode.

Cat police probe 'UK animal killer' link,"Rusty, a one-year-old cat, was deliberately mutilated and left on the doorstep of its owner's home Police forces are working together to see whether the mutilation of cats in different regions are linked to a so-called ""UK animal killer"". In the latest attacks the bodies of two dismembered cats were dumped in bags on their owners' doorsteps in Northampton. Northamptonshire Police is in contact with the Metropolitan force, which is investigating a series of cat deaths. Animal charity Snarl believes what it calls the ""UK animal killer"" could be involved in many attacks. The most recent cat death being investigated by Northamptonshire Police happened on 7 September. Thedismembered body,externalof 15-year-old Topsy was found in a carrier bag left outside her owner's front door in Brookfield Road, Kingsley. On 28 August a teenage girl opened a carrier bag on her doorstep in Betjeman Court in Northampton to find themutilated body of her pet cat Rusty. The head, limbs and ears of the ginger cat had been cut off. A few days earlier the family's other cat had been set on fire, but survived. A number of cat killings in the Croydon area were linked in late 2015/early 2016 A number of cat and other animal deaths around the country have been linked by the charity Snarl - South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty - which said the two Northampton mutilations ""bore wounds indicative of the UK animal killer"". After the charity raised concerns with police abouta series of ""gruesome"" killingswhich initially began in the Croydon area in 2015, the Met launched Operation Takahe to investigate animal deaths. The suspect initially became known as the ""Croydon cat killer"". Missy went missing on 4 December 2015 from her home near Croydon and was found dead days later with her head and tail chopped off Northamptonshire Police confirmed they ""have been in contact with the Met as part of their on-going investigation into cat deaths, to see if these are in any way linked"". A Met spokesman said its officers would ""assess the latest [Northampton] report to see if it is linked to the cases already established as part of the ongoing investigation led by police in Croydon"".

"German storm over âpride in WW2"" remarks","Mainstream opinion sees the Wehrmacht as a willing tool of the Nazis A candidate of Germany's right-wing nationalist party has said the country should ""be proud of"" its soldiers in both world wars and people should no longer ""reproach"" Germans for World War Two. Alexander Gauland's words have been met with some scorn. What pride are Germans likely to muster for the Wehrmacht? Germany is ""very devoted to a discussion of its past"", Andrew Cohen, a Canadian journalist and professor, tells the BBC. ""I have not seen a country anywhere that is as committed to a frank and painful discussion of its history as Germany is."" Making a Nazi salute or denying the Holocaust in Germany could land you in jail - alongside swastikas and other Nazi symbols they are illegal. And the country takes pains to make sure the horrors of World War Two are remembered, respectfully, with a view to preventing them happening again. Cities are full of sites dedicated to the Holocaust, from big museums and concentration camp memorials totiny plaques in the ground, the size of cobblestones, that you may notice by chance when in the middle of something else. BBC History: World War Two The Holocaust year by year Some have said it is too much - a decade ago already Der Spiegel published anarticle,externaldecrying the ""mania for commemoration"" and quoting the essayist Wolf Jobst Siedler saying: ""If the Germans were once the greatest sinners, they now apparently want to be the greatest penitents."" The army (Wehrmacht) did not run the concentration camps - that was the role of the SS. But it committed atrocities of its own including shooting thousands of Polish people. ""The mainstream approach is that the Wehrmacht was a willing instrument of the Nazi perpetrators as an institution,"" says Michael Wolffson, an Israeli-German historian at the University of the Armed Forces in Munich. ""Many things are commemorated - resistance to the Nazis, victims such as Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals - but not the Wehrmacht."" Does he think Germany should regain pride in its army of the time? ""Any generalisation is stupid,"" was his reply. A video emerged of Alexander Gauland, a candidate for the right-wing nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is expected to gain seats in the national parliament for the first time at elections next weekend, speaking to supporters. Mr Gauland is one of his party's top candidates He said ""no other people"" in Europe had dealt as clearly as the Germans with a ""wrong"" past, and the 12 years when the Nazi party ruled Germany (1933-1945) ""no longer affect our identity"". ""We have the right to take back our country and our history,"" he said. ""If the French are rightly proud of their emperor and the Britons of Nelson and Churchill, we have the right to be proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars,"" he said.

Germany's justice minister tweeted that the statements showed the AfD was on the extreme right. Newspapers reported the statements as a ""provocation,external"" and said they ""made one catch one's breath,external"" (articles in German). For German writer Marcel Krueger, the statement is ""a bit strange"". ""I don't think anyone perceives anything the German army did then as positive,"" he says. Many children of the post-war generation felt a strong sense of guilt over what their parents had done. Mr Krueger says that has changed. For his generation ""it's about looking at it from a neutral space"". ""The lessons from the past, as horrible and bad as they are, need to be confronted and understood."" Allow Twitter content?

But Amy Iman Zayed, someone detached from this controversy because her parents are Egyptian, has noticed guilt among her classmates. In the mandatory classes about World War Two, she saw that her friends would ""sound and look embarrassed as if it was them or their parents who did all these terrible things"". ""And sometimes someone would say: 'But what do I have to do with it?' ""And the teachers would be really upset and give them a hard time. They would say stuff like: 'You should never forget what happened so it never happens again, and although you yourself have nothing to do with it we need to remind ourselves what could happen.'"" Some of Germany's memorials are designed to be small and subtle and take one by surprise Mr Cohen, the Canadian who admires Germany's willingness to grapple with its past, says: ""The story of post-war Germany has been one of guilt, a search for an act of redemption."" Some saw that act in Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees to the country. But that decision in itself has fanned the flames of right-wing nationalism. The German language has many great long words and of course there is one that is instructive here.VergangenheitsbewÃ¤ltigung- or coming to terms with the past - describes the struggle with a problematic recent history.
