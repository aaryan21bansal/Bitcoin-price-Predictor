Man ends Booker Prize sponsorship,"The Duchess of Cornwall presents the award to 2018's winner Anna Burns Britain's most famous literary award is looking for a new sponsor after hedge fund Man Group said it would end its support after 18 years. The UK-based financial giant said its annual Â£1.6m backing of this year's Man Booker Prize would be its last. The link between the hedge fund and the literary world has not always been smooth, with novelist Sebastian Faulks last year calling the firm ""the enemy"". Man Group said in a statement,externalit had been a privilege to sponsor the prize. But the BBC's arts editor, Will Gompertz, said relations between Man Group and Booker organisers had been strained for some time, with a company source suggesting they felt underappreciated. Mr Gompertz said: ""The news will come as a disappointment to the Booker Prize Foundation, which is said to be confident of finding a new sponsor at a time when the corporate market is far from buoyant."" The annual contest for the best book written in English and published in the UK was first awarded in 1969, with prize money of Â£5,000. Last year's winner, Anna Burns, for her book Milkman, received Â£50,000, with each shortlisted contestant receiving Â£2,500. In recent years Man Group's link with the award has been uneasy. Originally, entries were restricted to British, Irish and Commonwealth authors. In 2014, the award was opened to other writers, and since then two out of five winners have been American. Peter Carey, who twice won the award, was critical of the rule change,saying the prize could lose its ""cultural flavour"".,external And last year, Mr Faulks, whose best-sellers include Birdsong, described the award as ""irritating"" and called Man Group ""the enemy"". He told a podcast that the hedge fund,externalwas ""not the sort of people who should be sponsoring literary prizes; they're the kind of people literary prizes ought to be criticising... I wouldn't feel happy about accepting money from them"". Man Group's chief executive, Luke Ellis, shot back, saying: ""His comments... come at a time when the arts are experiencing an unprecedented withdrawal of public funding. ""Literature and the arts need their champions to step in where public money has been pulled out."" Man Group said it had donated about Â£25m in support for prizes and charitable activities during its sponsorship. The Booker Prize Foundation,externalsaid it is in discussion with a new sponsor, and is ""confident that the new funding will be in place for 2020. In the meantime the two prizes [the Man Booker and the Man Booker International] will run as usual this year"". The company's statement, which made no mention of any criticism, said it would spend the sponsorship money on another project, to ""promote and improve diversity and inclusion at the firm and across the financial services and technology industries more broadly"". Helena Kennedy, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: ""We would like to put on record the Foundation's appreciation of Man Group's sponsorship. ""However, all good things must come to an end and we look forward to taking the prizes into the next phase with our new supporter."" Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor The relationship between the Man Group and the Booker Prize organisation has been strained for some time, according to a senior individual connected to the hedge fund. He said it felt the team behind the annual book award could have communicated more effectively and been more collaborative given the amount of money it was investing in the sponsorship. The news will come as a disappointment to the Booker Prize Foundation, which is said to be confident of finding a new sponsor at a time when the corporate market is far from buoyant. It has the advantage of a high media profile maintained by the significant coverage the prize enjoys. But there are problems, too. Sponsors hate negative publicity, which the prize has attracted recently having broadened its scope to include all novels published in English, in the UK. There is also the issue of brand recognition, which is very important to a sponsor but hard to achieve. It is made that bit more difficult in this instance, as the original sponsor (Booker Group), has become the official name of the prize.

US lifts sanctions on Putin ally's firms,"The US has accused Oleg Deripaska of operating for the Russian government The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on three firms linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an ally of President Vladimir Putin. Curbs on aluminium giant US Rusal, En+ Group and JSC EuroSibEnergo were lifted after Mr Deripaska ceded control. The oligarch has been linked to the probe into alleged Russian interference in US elections, and Democrats wanted the sanctions to continue. But the Treasury Department said curbs on oligarch himself remained in force. The companies were blacklisted last April when the Trump administration targeted people and businesses it said had profited from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world. Russia releases 'sex seminar' model Oleg Deripaska resigns from Rusal US slaps sanctions on key Putin allies That included Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, as well as international cyber attacks. But earlier this month, Republicans in the US Senate blocked an effort to continue the sanctions against Rusal, the world's second largest aluminium firm and other Deripaska-linked firms. They and the Trump administration argued the curbs could have an impact on the global aluminium industry. They also said Mr Deripaska had lowered his stakes in the firms so that he no longer controlled them, a sign the sanctions were working. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced sanctions against Deripaska and other powerful Russians last April. Kim Gittleson, Business reporter There has been pressure on the Trump administration by business groups to lift the sanctions on these three firms. That's because the announcement of the sanctions in April led global aluminium prices to briefly spike, as Rusal is one of the world's biggest suppliers. But when the Treasury Department signalled its intentions in December, US politicians cried foul. They wanted the Trump administration to wait until a special investigation into Russia's interference into the 2016 US Presidential election had finished. Earlier in January, in a significant break, 136 members of President Trump's Republican Party voted with House Democrats on a measure to oppose the lifting of sanctions. Although it was a largely symbolic vote - a similar measure the day before failed to get the necessary 60 votes to pass in the Senate - the large number of party defections was notable. While the Treasury Department has insisted that the three firms have agreed to stringent new reporting requirements and that the Russian oligarch at the centre of the dispute, Oleg Deripaska, has significantly lowered his ownership stake, the lifting of sanctions less than a year after they were imposed is sure to once more raise questions about the Trump administration's commitment to punishing Russia for meddling in the 2016 election. In a statement on Sunday, the US Treasury Department said the three companies had also agreed to ""extensive, ongoing auditing"" to ensure they had no ties with the Russian billionaire. And Power company EN+, in which Mr Deripaska owned a controlling stake, welcomed the news from Washington. The London-listed company's shares plummeted when sanctions were announced last April and have not recovered. The firm's chairman, Lord Barker of Battle said: ""This is the first time independent directors of a London listed Russian company, with the strong support of minority shareholders, have successfully removed control from a majority shareholder as a direct response to US sanctions policy."" But lawmakers across the political spectrum have said it is inappropriate to ease sanctions on companies tied to the oligarch while Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigates whether Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr Deripaska, 51, has been a recurring figure in the investigation and has ties to President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who pleaded guilty in September 2018 to attempted witness tampering and conspiring against the United States. Last week Belarussian model Nastya Rybka was briefly detained by Russian police, having claimed to have evidence of Russian interference in the election campaign obtained from Mr Deripaska. Mr Deripaska has denied the allegations and successfully sued her. President Trump denies collusion, and Moscow has denied seeking to influence the US election on Mr Trump's behalf, despite US intelligence agencies' finding that it did so.

'Appalling' conditions hamper climber's rescue,"This video can not be played Cairngorm were among the mountain rescue teams deployed in the rescue effort A climber has been rescued from a mountain in the Cairngorms in ""appalling"" weather conditions. The man, who was climbing alone on the Cairngorm plateau near Ben Macdui, raised the alarm using a personal locater beacon at about 14:30 on Sunday. Visibility was poor and high winds hampered the search. At 21:44 Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team said the man had been airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. He is understood to have back and leg injuries, which are not thought to be life-threatening. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The rescuers said the evacuation was ""protracted given the weather conditions"". Teams from Cairngorm, Braemar, Aberdeen, Glenmore Lodge and Police Scotland were involved in the operation along with a Coastguard rescue helicopter. Braemar MRT said on Twitter that the weather conditions were ""appalling"". The Met Office had earlier forecast up to 15cm (6in) of fresh snow on high ground in the north of Scotland. Willie Anderson, from Cairngorm Mountain Rescue, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""He set off a personal locater beacon saying he was in trouble, it was freezing, he was quite hypothermic and he'd injured his back and leg. ""The message from that goes to America then it comes back to this country."" Mr Anderson said it was a difficult operation, particularly in the early stages. ""It was the wind that was causing the problem,"" he said. ""It was making the team members struggle just to get to the location. The aircraft couldn't really get much above the car park level at Cairngorm. ""But we managed to locate him and got him treated by doctors. The best we could do was put him on a stretcher and drag him through the snow back to the car park. ""Without the beacon he would have been in real difficulty. He sent a few messages with that and then the messages eventually became more garbled and we couldn't really understand what he was saying, so that caused a bit of concern.""

Philippines church bomb attack kills 20,"This video can not be played Soldiers were deployed to the area after the explosions Two bombs at a Roman Catholic cathedral in southern Philippines have killed 20 people and injured dozens more, local officials say. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack on Jolo island, where jihadist groups are active. The first blast happened as Sunday Mass was being celebrated. A second device exploded outside as soldiers responded. The attack came days after a majority-Muslim area in the region voted for greater autonomy in a referendum. A statement from IS said the attack was carried out by ""two knights of martyrdom"" against a ""crusader temple"". Jolo has long been a base for militants, including those of the Abu Sayyaf group. Several of its factions have declared allegiance to IS. Who are the Abu Sayyaf group? Philippines country profile The local officials say the first blast happened at 08:45 local time (00:45 GMT) inside the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which has been hit by bombs in the past. The second explosion was shortly afterwards on the doorstep of the church. Police initially put the death toll at 27 but later lowered it to 20, saying there was double counting in earlier official reports. Most of the victims are civilians. The bomb attack devastated the church in Jolo Images posted on social media showed the main road leading to the church sealed off by soldiers in armoured personnel carriers. Some of the wounded were evacuated by air to the nearby city of Zamboanga. Calling the attack a ""dastardly act"", Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana urged the local population to work with the authorities to ""deny terrorism any victory"". ""We will use the full force of the law to bring to justice the perpetrators behind this incident."" The army has been deployed to the area after the bomb blasts In last week's referendum, voters approved the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in majority-Muslim areas of southern Philippines. But voters in Sulu province, where Jolo is located, rejected it. The referendum was the result of a peace deal between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The authorities have previously expressed hopes that the vote could be a political solution to try to end decades of fighting between Islamist separatists and the Philippine army in the predominantly Catholic country.

Tesco 'still finalising' job cut plans,"Tesco has announced it will close food counters in 90 of its stores as part of a wider cost-cutting plan that will affect 9,000 staff. The UK's largest supermarket said its remaining fish, meat and deli counters in 700 stores will be run on a full-time or flexible basis. It confirmed it will no longer offer a hot food service at its canteens and that head office staff will be cut. It said up to 9,000 workers will be affected but half could be redeployed. More than 10,000 jobs have been cut at Tesco since the current chief executive, Dave Lewis, took over in 2014. The UK's biggest grocer is in the midst of trying to save Â£1.5bn as the competition between supermarkets intensifies. Supermarkets battle over price cuts Tesco shares slump after profits disappoint Christmas retail winners and losers Tesco said: ""Not only are customers shopping in different ways, but we know that they have less time available to shop too - which means they are using our counters less frequently. ""We will be making changes to the counters in our large stores to ensure that we have the right offer for customers."" For a company which makes more than a billion pounds a year in profit, and saw strong Christmas trading, Tesco seems remarkably keen to cut costs. Yet the reasons are pretty plain. Competition between supermarkets is intense. The German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which arrived on these shores in the 1990s, are now big enough to make a real impact. They're steadily eroding the market share of established players, including Tesco, and forcing them to lower their own prices. And if competition regulators allow Sainsbury's to take control of Asda, then Tesco will lose its market dominance - and be faced with a rival just as powerful as itself, with as much bargaining power among suppliers. That could place further pressure on pricing - and profit margins. In-store butchers and delicatessens may look pretty and please more discerning customers, but they need to be staffed; and staff cost money. Tesco insists the number of people using them is falling as shopping habits change. Seen in that light, getting rid of a few looks like an easy way to save a bit of cash. But Tesco needs to be careful. Removing the things that make it different from the discounters may help it to cut costs - but it risks alienating existing consumers and eroding its brand value. After all, if there is nothing to differentiate the traditional supermarkets from the discounters, won't customers simply go to whichever is cheapest - trapping everyone in an endless cycle of cost cutting and ever-decreasing margins? Pauline Foulkes, national officer at the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), said: ""Staff at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by the scale of yet another round of potential job losses, which clearly demonstrates the pressure retailers are under in the current very difficult and uncertain economic climate, as the cost cutting continues. ""This is devastating news for staff, who have played a crucial role in Tesco's turnaround project, contributing to 12 successive quarters of growth, solid Christmas trading and over a billion pounds of profit."" As well as reducing its counters, Tesco said that after completing a detailed review: ""We're talking to colleagues about changes in some of our head office teams, moving to a simpler and leaner structure, which will allow us to focus on supporting our customers."" It also said that it made changes to the way it manages its stock which will mean ""a significantly reduced workload, with fewer hours needed to complete the routines"". Meanwhile, people who work for third party caterers that provide hot food services at some Tesco stores are also facing an uncertain future. Tesco said it will introduce self-service kitchen areas which will affect people employed by caterers. ""We are working with them to provide as much support as we can,"" said Tesco.

Expedition targets Shackleton's lost ship,"This video can not be played Prof Julian Dowdeswell: ""I must stress: sea-ice conditions are always difficult in the Weddell Sea"" A scientific expedition in the Antarctic has set out on a quest to find Sir Ernest Shackleton's lost ship. The team has spent the past two weeks investigating the Larsen C Ice Shelf and the continent's biggest iceberg,known as A68. And this puts it just a few hundred km from the last recorded position of the famous British explorer's vessel, the Endurance. The polar steam-yacht was crushed in sea-ice and sank in November 1915. UK team drills record Antarctic hole New map traces Shackleton's footsteps The 'monster' berg: What happened next? Endurance just before it sank: Crushed at the stern, it went down bow first Shackleton's extraordinary escape from this loss, saving his crew, means there is considerable interest in finding the wreck. Endurance should be resting on the ocean floor, some 3,000m down. The Weddell Sea Expedition 2019,externalteam wants to grab the chance of making the discovery, using robotic submersibles. On Sunday, the researchers announced that their work at Larsen and A68 was complete, and that they would now concentrate on finding the wreck. But the group will have a tough job reaching its presumed location, concedes chief scientist Prof Julian Dowdeswell. ""We've got a journey of several hundred km from where we are now through really heavy and quite difficult sea-ice,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Inside Science programmelast Thursday. ""We shall do our best to get there with the excellent ice-breaker that we have, but in any given year it will be very difficult to judge whether you will be able to penetrate the sea-ice.""

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The team has a very good idea of where the Endurance should be. Shackleton's skipper on the vessel, Frank Worsley, was a highly skilled navigator, and used a sextant and chronometer to calculate the sinking's co-ordinates - 68Â°39'30.0"" South and 52Â°26'30.0"" West. The ship is almost certainly within a few nautical miles of this point. If Prof Dowdeswell's ice-breaker, the  SA Agulhas II, can get reasonably close - it will be game-on. Frank Worsley used his sextant to record the position of the sinking The American geophysical survey company Ocean Infinity is part of the Weddell Sea Expedition group. It has a Kongsberg Hugin autonomous underwater vehicle that it will deploy to map a 20km by 20km grid square on the ocean floor. If it succeeds in locating the Endurance, a remotely operated vehicle will then be sent down to photograph the wreck site. The organisms that normally consume sunken wooden ships do not thrive in the cold waters of the Antarctic, so there is optimism that Endurance's timbers are well preserved. That said, crushing forces had done quite a bit of damage to the vessel before she slipped below the floes. ""I think that if we locate the Endurance, the greater likelihood will be that her hull is semi-upright and still in a semi-coherent state,"" commented marine archaeologist Mensun Bound. ""However, on the evidence of the only deep-water wooden wreck I have been privileged to study, I must concede that there is every possibility that she could have been wrenched wide open by impact (with the seafloor), thus exposing her contents like a box of chocolates,""he wrote on his expedition blog,external. The SA Agulhas II needs the sea-ice conditions to be favourable Luck has been with the Weddell cruise so far. Attempts to get to Larsen C in recent years by other expeditions were thwarted by the sea-ice conditions, but the SA Agulhas II made the most of favourable circumstances to reach Larsen and complete an extensive range of studies. The ice shelf is the fourth largest such structure in the Antarctic. It is an amalgam of glacier fronts that have flowed off land and lifted up to form a floating platform. Larsen C is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Antarctic Similar shelves to the north have collapsed in past decades and researchers want to understand the current status and likely future prospects of Larsen C. Was the calving from the shelf of the monster berg A68 in July 2017 just part of a natural cycle, or an indication that changes are coming? ""We have acquired detailed observations on the glaciology, oceanography, biology, and geology of the little known area around the Larsen C Ice shelf and the huge A68 iceberg,"" said Prof Dowdeswell, who is also the director of theScott Polar Research Institute,externalin Cambridge, UK. ""Analysis of this data will allow us to better understand the contemporary stability and past behaviour of Larsen C, with its wider implications for ice sheet stability more generally.""

UK's 'highest taxpayers' revealed,"Stephen Rubin, Denise Coates and Sir James Dyson Stephen Rubin - who owns a majority stake in JD Sports - and his family are the UK's top taxpayers, according to the Sunday Times. The newspaper is known for its rich list of the UK's wealthiest people - but has now, for the first time, drawn up a list ranking tax contributions. It estimated the tax due on business profits, share sales, dividends, house purchases and personal income. Denise Coates, the Bet365 boss, and Sir James Dyson also make the top three. As the largest taxpayers, Mr Rubin and his family will pay an estimated Â£181.6m in tax for the 2017/18 financial year - which works out at nearly Â£500,000 a day. This includes Â£121.6m from his stake in JD Sports as well as Â£53.2m in corporation tax owed by the family's company, Pentland Group, and Â£6.9m on the dividends they were due. Pentland Group employs more than 41,000 people and owns sports and fashion brands including Speedo, Ellesse and Berghaus. Just two of the top taxpayers also appear in the top 10 of the paper's Rich List - which is based on their overall wealth. The tax calculations are based on income.

His company paid Â£95m in UK tax in 2017, and the family were liable to pay tax of Â£32.8m on the dividends. Also on the list are the owner of Home Bargains, Tom Morris and his family (Â£39.2m); Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley (Â£30.4m); bakers the Warburton family (Â£14.5m); and David and Victoria Beckham in 49th place (Â£12.7m). By Rob Young, BBC business and economics correspondent The wealthy are often accused of not paying enough in tax. This ranking celebrates those who contribute the most to the Exchequer, not those who have simply earned the most within a year. This list details some of the large UK tax contributions being made by the leaders of some of our most well-known businesses. An individual's tax affairs are private in the UK. The Sunday Times Tax List is based on publicly available documents, so it isn't the full picture. The newspaper says its estimate of tax bills is likely to be conservative. Remember, it is income that's taxed, not wealth. Perhaps that's why only 28 out of the 145 billionaires on the same newspaper's Rich List appear on the, admittedly much shorter, Tax List. ThePanama PapersandParadise Papers- a leak of confidential documents revealing how the wealthy use tax havens - has led to a heightened interest in tax affairs. According to the Sunday Times, the 50 entries paid nearly Â£2bn in UK tax last year. The newspaper said that, when calculating tax liability, it did not include tax paid overseas in its calculations. It added that just 28 of the 145 billionaires and 18 of the 855 millionaires on last year's Sunday Times Rich List are featured in the tax list. Corporation Tax:Paid at a rate of 19% on all company profits. The amount ascribed to individuals by the Sunday Times is in proportion to their stake in the business Dividend Tax:Paid at a rate of 38.1 % for additional rate taxpayers (those earning more than Â£150,000 a year) on overall value of dividends received Capital Gains Tax:Paid at 10% on sales of businesses or parts of businesses for those qualifying for Entrepreneurs' Relief Income Tax:Paid at 45% on earnings above Â£150,000.

Expedition targets Shackleton's lost shipThe coming days will see an attempt to locate the wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Endurance ship.,"This video can not be played Prof Julian Dowdeswell: ""I must stress: sea-ice conditions are always difficult in the Weddell Sea"" A scientific expedition in the Antarctic has set out on a quest to find Sir Ernest Shackleton's lost ship. The team has spent the past two weeks investigating the Larsen C Ice Shelf and the continent's biggest iceberg,known as A68. And this puts it just a few hundred km from the last recorded position of the famous British explorer's vessel, the Endurance. The polar steam-yacht was crushed in sea-ice and sank in November 1915. UK team drills record Antarctic hole New map traces Shackleton's footsteps The 'monster' berg: What happened next? Endurance just before it sank: Crushed at the stern, it went down bow first Shackleton's extraordinary escape from this loss, saving his crew, means there is considerable interest in finding the wreck. Endurance should be resting on the ocean floor, some 3,000m down. The Weddell Sea Expedition 2019,externalteam wants to grab the chance of making the discovery, using robotic submersibles. On Sunday, the researchers announced that their work at Larsen and A68 was complete, and that they would now concentrate on finding the wreck. But the group will have a tough job reaching its presumed location, concedes chief scientist Prof Julian Dowdeswell. ""We've got a journey of several hundred km from where we are now through really heavy and quite difficult sea-ice,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Inside Science programmelast Thursday. ""We shall do our best to get there with the excellent ice-breaker that we have, but in any given year it will be very difficult to judge whether you will be able to penetrate the sea-ice.""

The team has a very good idea of where the Endurance should be. Shackleton's skipper on the vessel, Frank Worsley, was a highly skilled navigator, and used a sextant and chronometer to calculate the sinking's co-ordinates - 68Â°39'30.0"" South and 52Â°26'30.0"" West. The ship is almost certainly within a few nautical miles of this point. If Prof Dowdeswell's ice-breaker, the  SA Agulhas II, can get reasonably close - it will be game-on. Frank Worsley used his sextant to record the position of the sinking The American geophysical survey company Ocean Infinity is part of the Weddell Sea Expedition group. It has a Kongsberg Hugin autonomous underwater vehicle that it will deploy to map a 20km by 20km grid square on the ocean floor. If it succeeds in locating the Endurance, a remotely operated vehicle will then be sent down to photograph the wreck site. The organisms that normally consume sunken wooden ships do not thrive in the cold waters of the Antarctic, so there is optimism that Endurance's timbers are well preserved. That said, crushing forces had done quite a bit of damage to the vessel before she slipped below the floes. ""I think that if we locate the Endurance, the greater likelihood will be that her hull is semi-upright and still in a semi-coherent state,"" commented marine archaeologist Mensun Bound. ""However, on the evidence of the only deep-water wooden wreck I have been privileged to study, I must concede that there is every possibility that she could have been wrenched wide open by impact (with the seafloor), thus exposing her contents like a box of chocolates,""he wrote on his expedition blog,external. The SA Agulhas II needs the sea-ice conditions to be favourable Luck has been with the Weddell cruise so far. Attempts to get to Larsen C in recent years by other expeditions were thwarted by the sea-ice conditions, but the SA Agulhas II made the most of favourable circumstances to reach Larsen and complete an extensive range of studies. The ice shelf is the fourth largest such structure in the Antarctic. It is an amalgam of glacier fronts that have flowed off land and lifted up to form a floating platform. Larsen C is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Antarctic Similar shelves to the north have collapsed in past decades and researchers want to understand the current status and likely future prospects of Larsen C. Was the calving from the shelf of the monster berg A68 in July 2017 just part of a natural cycle, or an indication that changes are coming? ""We have acquired detailed observations on the glaciology, oceanography, biology, and geology of the little known area around the Larsen C Ice shelf and the huge A68 iceberg,"" said Prof Dowdeswell, who is also the director of theScott Polar Research Institute,externalin Cambridge, UK. ""Analysis of this data will allow us to better understand the contemporary stability and past behaviour of Larsen C, with its wider implications for ice sheet stability more generally.""

US 'will respond to Venezuela threats',"This video can not be played Thousands more leave Venezuela amid new crisis The US has warned Venezuela that any threats against American diplomats or opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ will be met with ""a significant response"". National Security Adviser John Bolton said any such ""intimidation"" would be ""a grave assault on the rule of law"". His warning comes days after the US and more than 20 other countries recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Meanwhile, Mr GuaidÃ³ has called for anti-government protests on Wednesday and Saturday. Mr GuaidÃ³, the elected leader of the opposition-held National Assembly, declared himself the interim president on 23 January. The political crisis in Venezuela now appears to be reaching boiling point amid growing efforts by the opposition to unseat President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. He was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging, triggering large protests. What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? Venezuela crisis - in seven charts Will the US target Venezuelan oil? On Sunday, Venezuela's top military representative to the US, Col JosÃ© Luis Silva, defected from Mr Maduro's government, saying he recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president instead. Later, Mr Bolton took to Twitter to reiterate Washington's position, warning others against any form of ""violence and intimidation"". Allow Twitter content?

Also on Twitter, Mr GuaidÃ³ called for a ""peaceful"" two-hour strike on Wednesday and a ""big national and international rally"" on Saturday. On Saturday, several European countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said they would recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections were not called within eight days. But Mr Maduro has rejected this, saying the ultimatum must be withdrawn. ""Venezuela is not tied to Europe. This is complete insolence,"" he told CNN Turk on Sunday. Mr Maduro added that he was ready to ""engage in comprehensive dialogue"" with those who opposed his presidency. He said he had sent Donald Trump ""many messages"", but he thought the US president ""despises us"". He later appeared at a military exercise in Venezuela's central state of Carabobo, where he called for ""union, discipline and cohesion"" to overcome what he described as an ""attempted coup d'etat"" by Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr Maduro attended military exercises in Carabobo on Sunday Mr Maduro broke off relations with the US last Thursday over the country's support for Mr GuaidÃ³, and ordered US envoys to depart Venezuela within 72 hours. However on Saturday evening, as the deadline was due to expire, Venezuela's foreign ministry said it would withdraw the expulsion order, and instead allow 30 days for the two sides to set up ""interest offices"" in each others' countries. Interest offices are used when countries do not have formal diplomatic relations, but want to have a basic level of contact to represent their interests. Washington has previously said it does not recognise Mr Maduro's authority to order its diplomats out. Meanwhile,Mr GuaidÃ³ told the Washington Post that he was in talks with ""sympathetic military"" officials,externalin Venezuela with the aim of building support for his presidency. Venezuela's army has stood by Mr Maduro throughout previous upheaval, encouraged by regular wage increases and other incentives.In July, some 16,900 soldiers were promoted as a reward for their ""loyalty"". Despite that, reports suggest the lower ranks are increasingly dissatisfied with the government, which they blame for food and medicine shortages, as well as frequent power and water cuts. This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Russia, China, Mexico and Turkey have publicly backed Mr Maduro. At a UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, Russia accused Washington of plotting a coup. However, more than a dozen Latin American countries and Canada have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. In Europe, Greece's left-wing governing party has backed Mr Maduro. Venezuela is in economic crisis - hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials have hit its population hard and caused millions to flee. Mr Maduro has faced internal opposition and ongoing international criticism for his human rights record and handling of the economy.

UK 'could ban' social media over suicide images,"This video can not be played After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account Social media firms could be banned if they fail to remove harmful content, the health secretary has warned. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Matt Hancock said: ""If we think they need to do things they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate."" But he said it would be better to work jointly with social media companies. The minister earlier called on social media giants to ""purge"" material promoting self-harm and suicide in the wake of links to a teenager's suicide. Asked if social media could be banned, Mr Hancock said: ""Ultimately parliament does have that sanction, yes"" but added: ""it's not where I'd like to end up."" Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017 after viewing disturbing content about suicide on social media. Speaking to the BBC, her father said he believed Instagram ""helped kill my daughter"". Mr Russell also criticised the online scrapbook Pinterest, telling the Sunday Times: ""Pinterest has a huge amount to answer for."" Instagram responded by saying it works with expert groups who advise them on the ""complex and nuanced"" issues of mental health and self-harm. Based on their advice that sharing stories and connecting with others could be helpful for recovery, Instagram said, they ""don't remove certain content"". ""Instead (we) offer people looking at, or posting it, support messaging that directs them to groups that can help."" But Instagram added it is undertaking a full review of its enforcement policies and technologies. A Pinterest spokesman said: ""We have a policy against harmful content and take numerous proactive measures to try to prevent it from coming and spreading on our platform. ""But we know we can do more, which is why we've been working to update our self-harm policy and enforcement guidelines over the last few months."" Facebook, which owns Instagram,said earlier it was ""deeply sorry"". The internet giant said graphic content which sensationalises self-harm and suicide ""has no place on our platform"". Almost half of UK internet users 'harmed' online University switches off social media Reality TV harms youngsters' body image Papyrus, a charity that works to prevent youth suicide, said it has been contacted by around 30 families in the past week who believe social media had a part to play in their children's suicides. ""We've had a spike in calls to our UK helpline since the BBC first reported this six days ago, all saying the same thing,"" said a spokeswoman for the charity. Mr Hancock said he was ""horrified"" to learn of Molly's death and feels ""desperately concerned to ensure young people are protected"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock: We will and we must act if we have to In a letter sent to Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, Apple, Google and Facebook (which owns Instagram), the minister ""welcomed"" steps already taken by firms but said ""more action is urgently needed"". He wrote: ""It is appalling how easy it still is to access this content online and I am in no doubt about the harm this material can cause, especially for young people. ""It is time for internet and social media providers to step up and purge this content once and for all."" He added that the government is developing a white paper addressing ""online harms"", and said it will look at content on suicide and self-harm. Mr Hancock explained: ""Lots of parents feel powerless in the face of social media. But we are not powerless. Both government and social media providers have a duty to act. ""I want to make the UK the safest place to be online for everyone - and ensure that no other family has to endure the torment that Molly's parents have had to go through."" Molly was found dead in her bedroom in November 2017 after showing ""no obvious signs"" of severe mental health issues. Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide. Mr Russell told the BBC: ""Some of that content is shocking in that it encourages self harm, it links self-harm to suicide and I have no doubt that Instagram helped kill my daughter."" Solicitor Merry Varney, who represents the Russell family, said Molly's case ""and the examples of how algorithms push negative material"" show a need to investigate online platforms, and how they could be ""contributing to suicides and self-harm"". If youâve been affected byself-harm, oremotional distress, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. Preventing the British public from visiting some of the most popular internet platforms would be a drastic step. But it is not outside the realms of possibility. The most obvious approach would be to make the country's internet service providers (ISPs) block access to certain internet protocol addresses directly. The risk with this is that IP addresses can sometimes be shared between services. In the past,an effort to block one illegal site led to users being unable to visit the Radio Times. It also doesn't address the fact that banned services could start using alternative IP addresses. So another approach would be to order ISPs to make adjustments to their domain name system (DNS) servers, which act as a sort of internet address book, translating easy-to-type web addresses into the long string of numbers that actually represent the services involved. The aim would be to prevent requests being routed to the correct internet protocol (IP) addresses, effectively blocking access to the platforms. But this alone would not be enough, since some people route their traffic via DNS servers belonging to Google or Cloudflare - a company that optimises web traffic performance and also protects against cyber-attacks - rather than their ISP. These firms are based overseas. It is possible for them to detect DNS requests that originated in the UK and refuse them when appropriate, but there would likely need to be considerable arm-twisting to get them to agree to set such a precedent. But to complicate matters, users could still try to circumvent a ban by using tools to anonymise their location and identity, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or the Tor browser. Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said: ""Many of the ways around such bans are relatively simple unless you also ban all those methods as well, such as happens in countries like China. ""For a ban to be truly effective, the UK government [would have to take steps] that I can't imagine users or ISPs would be happy with."" Matters would become further convoluted if the social media firms decided to help users bypass a ban, as has been the case with some piracy sites. The Pirate Bay, for example, regularly updates a list of proxy sites that act as middle men, sending data to and from the banned database via intermediary servers. The government would therefore need to keep on top of such proxies and ensure they were blocked too.

Brazil search resumes after new dam scare,"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Rescue teams searching for some 300 people missing after a dam collapsed in Brazil on Friday say the chances of finding survivors are ""very low"". No-one was rescued alive on Sunday near the south-eastern town of Brumadinho, as the number of dead rose to 58. ""We've got to have hope,"" said a woman whose 35-year-old husband was missing. The cause of the dam burst remains unclear. Brazil's largest mining company, Vale, which owns the complex, says safety procedures were followed. Search operations were suspended for hours on Sunday amid fears that a separate dam, also owned by Vale, was at risk of giving way in the area. Vale said 305 employees, contractors and residents were still missing. Some 192 people have been rescued alive. ""After 48 hours of work, the chance of finding [someone] alive is very low,"" Col Eduardo Angelo, who is leading the search operation, told relatives of the missing. ""[But] we're working with the possibility that we'll find people alive."" The dam break caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads. Access to the areas is difficult - in some places, the mud is up to 15m (49ft) deep. Search teams have been using helicopters and earth-moving machinery. A bus that was carrying employees has been found but rescuers have yet to reach a train that could contain survivors or more bodies. ""I still have hope,"" NÃ©lia Mary Fonseca told the BBC as she waited for details about her husband, Adriano, who worked as a contractor at the site. An Israeli group of engineers, doctors and members of the navy's underwater missions unit has arrived in Brazil to join the efforts. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais By Julia Carneiro, BBC News, Brumadinho Mining is the main economic activity in Brumadinho and now the cause of this unprecedented tragedy that will mark generations to come. The Paraopeba river that cuts through the town has been tinted by iron ore residue and now smells of dead fish. The first funerals were held on Sunday. Having a body to bury may turn out to be a twisted privilege in this tragedy, with hundreds of people believed to be under the mud and huge challenges to find them. At the information centre set up to assist the families, volunteers sit behind desks with the lists of those missing, and relatives queue up to check for any updates - or to enter more names of people still unaccounted for. I met a woman who was searching for her husband and son. Another man expected news from his brother. A young woman looked from her young husband. The dam burst may have broken their families, too. State prosecutors said they had frozen a total of 11bn reais ($2.9bn; Â£2.2bn) of assets belonging to Vale, Brazil's largest mining company. Brumadinho Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos criticised the company for being ""careless and incompetent"", blaming the firm for the dam burst and the state of Minas Gerais for poor oversight. ""This tragedy destroyed our city."" Rescue efforts have been hampered by the difficult access to areas hit In a television interview, Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the disaster had happened even after the company followed safety recommendations by international experts. ""I'm not a mining technician. I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,"" he said. Mr Schvartsman, who took office in May 2017, promised ""to go above and beyond any national or international standards... We'll create a cushion of safety far superior to what we have today to guarantee this never happens again."" Unlike dams used for water, tailings dams - like that in Brumadinho - are used to store by-products from mining operations. There have been a number of high-profile disasters involving tailings dams in recent years - andthere have been calls, including from the UN, to institute better safety and building regulations,externalaround them. On 5 November 2015, a dam owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton, burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais. It killed 19 people in what was consideredBrazil's worst environmental disasterat the time.

Parents DNA-tested in 'Thai bride' cold case,"Lamduan Seekanya's family say they have not heard from her since 2004 DNA samples have been taken from a Thai couple who believe their daughter may be the woman whose body was found on a hillside in England 14 years ago. The body was discovered in a stream near Pen-y-ghent, in the Yorkshire Dales, in 2004. Police said she may have been a ""Thai bride"". On Thursday a Thai couple came forward to say they believed she may be their daughter, Lamduan Seekanya. Analysis of the samples taken by Thai officials is due to take several days. The results of the tests will then be sent to the UK for comparison, said Setthinaree Veness, the president of the Thai Women Network in the UK, who is working with the family. The couple, Joomsri Seekanya, 72, and her husband Buasa, told a news conference last week their daughter married a British man in 1991 and moved to  north-west England shortly after. DNA samples were taken from husband and wife Buasa and Joomsri Seekanya (centre) Buasa (left) and Joomsri Seekanya have not heard from their daughter since 2004 The family, from Udon Thani, in north-east Thailand, said they had not heard from her since 2004. Mrs Seekanya said: ""A part of me hopes that it's not my daughter - I want her to come back alive. But if it's really her, I can finally sleep at night."" A police artist created an impression of how the woman may have looked Cold-case investigators say they believe the woman found in the UK was murdered and dumped on the hillside. Forensic tests suggest she was aged between 25 and 35, originally from south-east Asia and may have lived in north Lancashire or south Cumbria. She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band. The woman's body was discovered by walkers when they stopped to take photos by a hillside stream Speaking in October, Adam Harland, manager of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Police cold case review team, said they believed the woman may have been a ""Thai bride"". He said: ""[It is possible] she is a lady who has taken up a relationship with a white gentleman, and come back to the UK."" On Friday, North Yorkshire Police confirmed it had received a possible name for the unknown woman and said inquiries were ongoing.

'Red scarves' stage Paris counter-protest,"The red scarves say they are defending democracy and opposing violence A group calling itself the red scarves has held a march in Paris to counter weeks of anti-government protests by the yellow-vest movement. The ""foulards rouges"" are demanding an end to the violence witnessed at yellow-vest (gilets jaunes) rallies. The gilets jaunes movement grew out of fuel tax protests in November. It now embraces wider discontent with President Emmanuel Macron and has seen some of the most serious street violence in Paris since 1968. But the weeks of TV footage showing clashes with riot police and damage to public monuments have triggered a counter-movement. The red scarves now have about 21,000 followers on Facebook. More than 10,000 people took part in Sunday's march, Le Figaro reported. Will Macron's Grand Debate tackle yellow-vest crisis? Spending cuts to fund Macron concessions ""People are tired of the roadblocks. They are bad for business, and children are prevented from getting to school on time,"" red scarves spokesman Alex Brun told French broadcaster RFI. Ahead of Sunday's rally in Paris, the red scarves put out a joint statement with similar-minded groups. ""We denounce the insurrectional climate installed by the yellow vests. We also reject the threats and constant verbal abuse (aimed at non-yellow vests),"" they announced in a joint manifesto. ""Don't touch my republic"" this red scarf protester declared Police kept gilets jaunes and foulards rouges apart during Sunday's rally However, according to French media, a split has already emerged among the red scarves over whether or not to show support for President Macron. One of the organisers of Sunday's march, Laurent SouliÃ©, has rallied supporters on Facebook to back the president, RFI reported. Mr Brun, on the other hand, said the ""foulards rouges"" were ""an apolitical citizens' movement"". He said the best way to resolve problems caused by the yellow vests was to take part in Mr Macron's ""Grand Debate"" rather than confronting protesters on the street. Some red-scarf leaders had urged members not to attend Sunday's rally. The Grand Debate involves town-hall meetings nationwide to address protesters' concerns. Across France, about 69,000 people took part in the 11th consecutive weekend of yellow-vest protests the interior ministry said. That is about 15,000 fewer than last weekend.

Rapper's son born months after his death,"XXXTentacion was shot and killed last year at the age of 20 The girlfriend of the late US rapper XXXTentacion, Jenesis Sanchez, has given birth to a boy - seven months after the artist's death. ""We're happy to confirm that Baby and Mother are healthy,"" a joint statement from Sanchez and the rapper's mother, Cleopatra Bernard, said on Saturday. They said they were ""thrilled"" at the arrival of Gekyume Onfroy. The pregnancy was revealed last June, shortly after XXXTentacion was shot and killed in Florida at the age of 20. The family statement says the late musician, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, ""specifically chose"" the name Gekyume ""for his first born son"".

Louisiana shooting suspect arrested,"Police arrested Dakota Theriot at his grandmother's home in Virginia US police have arrested a man suspected of killing five people, including his parents, in two separate but related shootings in the state of Louisiana. Dakota Theriot, 21, was caught on Sunday, 1,770km (1,100 miles) away at his grandmother's house in Virginia. Saturday's shootings were in Livingston and Ascension parishes, south of Louisiana state capital Baton Rouge. Authorities said the other victims are a woman thought to be his girlfriend, and her brother and father. Police believe Mr Theriot stole his father's grey and silver Dodge Ram pick-up truck, before driving to shoot his parents, Keith and Elizabeth Theriot. He had a gun with him at the time of his arrest, which authorities say he dropped without confrontation. He faces charges of first-degree murder, illegal use of a weapon and home invasion. Authorities say Dakota Theriot was in a relationship with 20-year-old Summer Ernest, and that Mr Theriot had been staying with her family for several weeks. At around 09:00 local time (15:00 GMT), police were called to a trailer park in Livingston parish, where they found Summer, her father Billy Ernest, 43, and her brother Tanner Ernest, 17, shot and killed in their mobile home. A neighbour told local media two children were in the Ernest home at the time of the shooting, and ran to her home distressed but unharmed. Shortly after, other police officers were called for ""domestic incident"" in the city of Gonzales, 25 miles (40km) south of Baton Rouge, Ascension Sheriff Bobby Webre said. When they arrived, they found Elizabeth Theriot, 51, shot dead in her bedroom, while her husband Keith, also 51, was still alive. He told the officers that their son, who had recently been told to leave their house and not return, was the gunman. He was taken to a hospital but later died of his injuries. After the shootings in Louisiana, Dakota Theriot began the 16-hour drive towards his grandmother's home in Warsaw, Virginia. Police there had been in contact with his grandmother who had feared her grandson would show up. Officers were in the home when Mr Theriot drove up in what was believed to be the stolen truck. He was taken into custody without incident in Richmond County, Virginia, and will be returned to Ascension to face charges. Richmond County Sheriff Stephan Smith told the Advocate newspaper that the suspect appeared tired. ""There were some statements made but at this time that's part of the investigation,"" he said. ""My family met him last weekend at a birthday party and didn't get good vibes from him,"",externalCrystal DeYoung, Billy Ernest's sister, told the Associated Press news agency. Kim Mincks, a neighbour of Keith and Elizabeth Theriot, told the Associated Press that the 21-year-old had been recently kicked out of his parents' home over his drug use. ""His dad kicked him out of here. He did have a violent streak."" In a Facebook page that appeared to belong to him, there was a repost made in June saying ""wish i could clear my mind jus for one day"" (sic) with a sad emoji. In May, he posted a message which said: ""If you have a problem with me, tell me. Not everyone else.""

Dominant Djokovic wins Australian Open,"This video can not be played Watch: How 'scary' Djokovic destroyed Nadal Novak Djokovic won a record seventh Australian Open title and a third successive Grand Slam as he swept aside Rafael Nadal in Melbourne. The Serb, rarely troubled on his serve, won 6-3 6-2 6-3 for his biggest victory in a major final over his great rival. Spanish second seed Nadal, 32, looked rattled by the world number one's intensity and made 28 unforced errors. Djokovic, 31, won in two hours and four minutes to move clear of six-time men's winners Roy Emerson and Roger Federer. Djokovic motivated by Federer's record of 20 Grand Slam titles A forehand winner down the line brought up two championship points, Djokovic taking the second when Nadal clubbed a backhand long. Djokovic, who was the top seed, fell to his knees after sealing another triumph on Rod Laver Arena, smacking the court with both hands and screaming towards the sky. The reigning Wimbledon and US Open champion claimed his 15th Grand Slam title, moving him outright third ahead of American Pete Sampras in the all-time list, closing in on Switzerland's Federer (20) and Nadal (17). Djokovic has now won 13 of his past 16 meetings with Nadal, who has not beaten the Serb on a hard court since the US Open final in 2013. He leads 28-25 in their record 53 meetings between two male players. Djokovic continued his fine record of going on to win the tournament every time he has reached the semi-finals, while Nadal lost for a fourth time in the Melbourne showpiece. The result meant the 2009 winner was unable to become the first man in the Open era to win all the Grand Slams at least twice and was the first time he had lost a major final in straight sets. Relive Djokovic's victory over Nadal Djokovic said his clinical semi-final win over French 28th seed Lucas Pouille on Friday was one of his best performances on Rod Laver Arena. Two days later, he surpassed that against the man with whom he shares what many consider to be the greatest male rivalry. Most expected a much closer encounter between the pair, whose previous meeting at Melbourne Park had been the epic 2012 final, which lasted five sets and almost six hours. Quickly it became apparent that a repeat was unlikely in front of a stunned crowd. Djokovic was as close to flawless as he could have been - dominating on serve, controlling the rallies with crisp groundstrokes, rarely making a mistake and showing incredible athleticism around the court. His tally of 34 winners and nine unforced errors highlights how high his level was. The Serb made a fast start by breaking in Nadal's first service game and, although that was the only break in the opener, the gulf between the players felt much wider. He took his first set point after landing a first serve which Nadal could only bat back into the net, wrapping up the opener in only 38 minutes. More pressure came on Nadal's serve immediately in the second set, Djokovic eventually going a break up in the fifth game and, after surviving Nadal taking him to deuce in the following game, broke again to leave him serving for a two-set lead. Djokovic then underlined his dominance by firing down three aces to leave him one set away from the title. Another break for a 2-1 lead in the third put Djokovic on his way to a comfortable win, before he fought off a break point in the sixth game and then sealed victory on the Nadal serve. Rafael Nadal just could not find a way to challenge a brilliant Novak Djokovic Nadal had not dropped a set on his way to the final but, having come into the tournament without competitive action since September's US Open, he was nowhere near the level required to cause problems for an in-form Djokovic. The Spaniard looked like he lacked belief as he made a slow start, winning only one point in the opening three games. Nadal particularly struggled to make an impact on Djokovic's serve, not managing to win a receiving point until the ninth game and with more than half an hour on the clock. Nadal continued to toil in the second and third sets, although a rare error from Djokovic brought up a first break point for the Spaniard after one hour and 46 minutes. However, a backhand into the net left Nadal grimacing and looking up the sky in frustration as the chance - and the championship - slipped from his grasp. The Spaniard won 53 points compared to Djokovic's 89, and took only 13 receiving points. ""I have been going through tough times over the past year. I only played in nine events and had to retire from two, and I was not able to play professional match since the US Open,"" said Nadal. The Spaniard, who cut short his 2018 season with an abdominal muscle problem and to have ankle surgery, retired injured in the quarter-finals in Melbourne last year. ""Even though tonight was not my night, it was very important for me in coming back from injury,"" he said. ""I believe I played a good two weeks of tennis and it is a great energy and inspiration for what is coming. ""I will keep fighting and keep practising to give myself better chances in the future."" If Djokovic is to hold all four Grand Slam titles at once by winning the French Open, he may well have to get past Rafael Nadal, who has won the title a record 11 times Australian great Rod Laver, watching in the arena which bears his name, said before the final he felt Djokovic would eventually overtake both Federer and Nadal in terms of Grand Slam titles. On the evidence of this victory, and his performances over the past six months, few would disagree. Djokovic was ranked outside the world's top 20 in July after coming back from elbow surgery. But he showed he was back to his best with victory at Wimbledon and followed up that performance with another triumph at the US Open in September. Now Djokovic, who reclaimed top spot in the rankings in November, will go to the French Open in May aiming to hold all four major titles simultaneously for the second time. Victory over Britain's Andy Murray in the 2016 French Open final meant Djokovic became the first man since Laver in 1969 to hold all four Slams at once. ""I'm trying to contemplate on the journey in the past 12 months. I had surgery exactly 12 months ago,"" Djokovic said. ""To be standing now here, in front of you today, managing to win this title and three of the four Slams is truly amazing."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This was one of the great Grand Slam final performances by Djokovic. He simply knocked the stuffing out of Nadal. The offensive side of Nadal's game, which had been so eye-catching in earlier rounds, was snuffed out by Djokovic. The world number one took all of Nadal's time away and forced him on the defensive from the very first ball. If he wins Roland Garros in June, he will hold all four Grand Slam titles simultaneously for the second time in his career. This might just be the best chance Djokovic has ever had to win all four Slams in the same calendar year. Nadal will have a lot to say about that - especially in Paris. The Spaniard felt four months away from the Tour caught up with him here: as he says, he was just not able to find the higher gear required to make the match competitive. He is, though, optimistic things will look a lot brighter in a couple of months' time: just as the clay-court season looms into view.

Peru landslide kills 15 at wedding party,"An image said to show the aftermath of the impact at the Alhambra hotel in Abancay At least 15 people were killed when a landslide crashed into a hotel during a wedding celebration in south-eastern Peru, officials say. The impact of the mud and rocks forced the building's walls and roof to cave in while guests were inside dancing. Twenty-nine people were injured and had to be pulled from the debris following the incident on Sunday in the Andean city of Abancay, officials said. Local media report that the incident occurred during heavy rain in the area. About 100 guests were present at the Alhambra hotel at the time of the incident, the head of Peru's National Civil Defence Institute (Indeci), Jorge ChÃ¡vez, told local media. Some 50 people were believed to have been close to one of the walls that collapsed, he added.

Zimbabwe buries 'national hero' singerMusic fans make pilgrimage to Zimbabwean singer Oliver Mtukudzi's home village for his burial.,"Mtukudzi's coffin was taken on a funeral procession through the national stadium Mourners have travelled across Zimbabwe to attend the burial on Sunday of one of the country's most renowned musicians Oliver Mtukudzi. On Saturday, his coffin was taken in a funeral procession through the national stadium in the capital Harare. It was then was transported by helicopter to his home village, north of Harare. The prolific artist has made 67 albums and created his own Afro-jazz sound known as ""Tuku Music"". Mtukudzi died on Wednesday aged 66. On Thursday President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared him a national hero. Saturday's funeral procession was followed by a concert He came to prominence in the 1970s as one of voices of the revolution fighting white-minority rule. His lyrics often carried social messages about HIV/Aids and coded political commentary.

Man ends Booker Prize sponsorshipMan Group's decision to quit the prestigious literary prize comes amid talk of strained relations.,"The Duchess of Cornwall presents the award to 2018's winner Anna Burns Britain's most famous literary award is looking for a new sponsor after hedge fund Man Group said it would end its support after 18 years. The UK-based financial giant said its annual Â£1.6m backing of this year's Man Booker Prize would be its last. The link between the hedge fund and the literary world has not always been smooth, with novelist Sebastian Faulks last year calling the firm ""the enemy"". Man Group said in a statement,externalit had been a privilege to sponsor the prize. But the BBC's arts editor, Will Gompertz, said relations between Man Group and Booker organisers had been strained for some time, with a company source suggesting they felt underappreciated. Mr Gompertz said: ""The news will come as a disappointment to the Booker Prize Foundation, which is said to be confident of finding a new sponsor at a time when the corporate market is far from buoyant."" The annual contest for the best book written in English and published in the UK was first awarded in 1969, with prize money of Â£5,000. Last year's winner, Anna Burns, for her book Milkman, received Â£50,000, with each shortlisted contestant receiving Â£2,500. In recent years Man Group's link with the award has been uneasy. Originally, entries were restricted to British, Irish and Commonwealth authors. In 2014, the award was opened to other writers, and since then two out of five winners have been American. Peter Carey, who twice won the award, was critical of the rule change,saying the prize could lose its ""cultural flavour"".,external And last year, Mr Faulks, whose best-sellers include Birdsong, described the award as ""irritating"" and called Man Group ""the enemy"". He told a podcast that the hedge fund,externalwas ""not the sort of people who should be sponsoring literary prizes; they're the kind of people literary prizes ought to be criticising... I wouldn't feel happy about accepting money from them"". Man Group's chief executive, Luke Ellis, shot back, saying: ""His comments... come at a time when the arts are experiencing an unprecedented withdrawal of public funding. ""Literature and the arts need their champions to step in where public money has been pulled out."" Man Group said it had donated about Â£25m in support for prizes and charitable activities during its sponsorship. The Booker Prize Foundation,externalsaid it is in discussion with a new sponsor, and is ""confident that the new funding will be in place for 2020. In the meantime the two prizes [the Man Booker and the Man Booker International] will run as usual this year"". The company's statement, which made no mention of any criticism, said it would spend the sponsorship money on another project, to ""promote and improve diversity and inclusion at the firm and across the financial services and technology industries more broadly"". Helena Kennedy, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: ""We would like to put on record the Foundation's appreciation of Man Group's sponsorship. ""However, all good things must come to an end and we look forward to taking the prizes into the next phase with our new supporter."" Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor The relationship between the Man Group and the Booker Prize organisation has been strained for some time, according to a senior individual connected to the hedge fund. He said it felt the team behind the annual book award could have communicated more effectively and been more collaborative given the amount of money it was investing in the sponsorship. The news will come as a disappointment to the Booker Prize Foundation, which is said to be confident of finding a new sponsor at a time when the corporate market is far from buoyant. It has the advantage of a high media profile maintained by the significant coverage the prize enjoys. But there are problems, too. Sponsors hate negative publicity, which the prize has attracted recently having broadened its scope to include all novels published in English, in the UK. There is also the issue of brand recognition, which is very important to a sponsor but hard to achieve. It is made that bit more difficult in this instance, as the original sponsor (Booker Group), has become the official name of the prize.

Can you ever be best friends with an ex?,"Two writers have their say... Robbie Harb, 30 I always thought break-ups were simple affairs. Thereâs no point getting sentimental about someone once itâs over. Much better to take a practical approach: delete their number, block their social media accounts and purge their leftover belongings from your home.Â But then, B happened. Unlike my other exes, I didnât meet B on an app or anonymously at a bar. He was my best friend. We grew up together in Sydney and had one of those freakishly close relationships that only really develop during childhood. We shared everything: from school gossip to family problems. He was the first person I came out to, and I was his. We started going out in our mid-twenties when he moved back to Sydney after several years away. The relationship was, well, complicated. Every conversation seemed to turn into an argument. I wish I could say there were good parts but the truth is, it was ugly from the start. Things that we wouldnât have thought twice about as friends, such as innocent teasing or being late to dinner, became a source of bitterness. I was vile, and he was vile back. And because we were already so close, we knew where to land our verbal punches. We lasted about 18 months. One day, after a particularly nasty fight, something between us broke for good. We both felt it.Â âSo I guess thatâs it?â I said. âYeah,â he said. âI guess it is.â He moved out a few days later. We'd been living together for about four months and he didnât give me any warning. One day he was there, and the next he wasnât. That hurt. I had secretly wanted him out for months, but once he was gone the flat felt empty. We didnât speak for six months. It was easier to convince myself that he was a bad person, that Iâd had him wrong from the start, than deal with the tangle of feelings in my head. And for a short while, it worked. But then I got an email with just one word: âCoffee?â It was the shortest olive branch Iâve ever seen, but a peace offering nonetheless. âWhen?â I wrote back. We met â and within the first 30 seconds of seeing him, I realised that I wasnât in love with him any more. When we were going out I either wanted to pounce on him or punch him, but my feelings had mellowed. That meeting made me realise how much I missed him â not as a partner, but as a friend. Although we avoided certain topics, such as dating other people, there was an easy comfort in the way we chatted. For better or for worse, I wanted him in my life and he felt the same. We agreed to give it a go. Over the next few months, we met up regularly. Sometimes we ran out of things to talk about and there were awkward silences. Sometimes it was tense, especially when we tried to talk about issues we had faced in the relationship. Emotional landmines were stepped on, by accident and on purpose. We both had to learn to hold our tongues.Â Sometimes weâd go for a nice dinner and laugh like old times and Iâd go home wondering if I was falling back in love with him. But thatâs all part of the process. We were working out where our boundaries were by a process of trial and error. So we sucked it up and stuck it out for the long game. Eventually, the tension eased - we relaxed, and let our guard down. Our conversations started to flow more naturally and we started to talk about dating other people. When he first told me he was dating somebody else, I felt sick to my stomach even though I was doing the same. But with time, I got used to it and now it feels totally normal. Weâre still very close. Iâve stopped seeing him as my ex and started thinking of him like a brother. He has the keys to my flat and comes and goes as he pleases. We even bought a dog together â he keeps her during the week and I look after her on the weekends and when heâs away for work. One of my friends calls it âa relationship minus sexâ. And Iâm sure to some people thatâs what it looks like. But weâve worked hard on our friendship, and Iâm confident that it works for us. People say that you canât be friends with your ex as though it were a universal truth. But just because itâs difficult doesnât make it impossible. We deal with difficult relationships all the time â at work, with our friends and with our families. Why should an ex be any different? Sure, not every relationship is worth the effort. I have friends who would rather wax their scrotum than go for lunch with their exes. But some people are worth investing in â and for me, B was one of them. Marie-Claire Chappet, 29 As if you can be friends with an ex you were once in love with! When it comes to the type of love that shook you to your very core, whether it ended on good terms or broke your heart, friendship is not an option. I learnt this the hard way. I met my ex â the great love who shoved my heart in a blender â at university. He was instantly attractive in that maddeningly generic way: tall, dark and handsome. We were a one-night stand that somehow turned into a friendship, that somehow turned into a relationship.Â We were together on and off for three years after we graduated, with weekends of coupled-up bliss spent holed-up in his London flat, punctuated by fierce arguments about commitment. Our break-up was as convoluted and protracted as our time together: full of false starts and regretful make-ups. That said, when we ended our romantic entanglement, we agreed that the friendship that had initially kick-started our relationship was worth saving. Which is why we all but pinky-swore to remain BFFs for life - promising to still talk, still meet up and still be part of each otherâs lives. Our so-called terms included telling each other when a future romantic exploit was growing into something serious. I should have known it was doomed from the outset. Plus everyone â from parents to friends â told me we were heading for disaster. Shortly after our break-up, I went into hospital for a jaw operation. My ex visited me, and brought flowers. This moved me â but not in the way you should be when a mate brings you flowers. My heart jumped the way it does when that person you fancy does something nice for you. My heart continued to behave in strange ways throughout our âfriendshipâ - if he texted me late at night, if we met up for coffee and if he lingered on a hug. And without realising it, I was soon analysing his every move as if he was still a romantic prospect. I was jealous when he mentioned girls, I was hopeful when he called. It's because so much of our relationship remained unchanged. Navigating the shift from couple to mates was weirdly easy because the only thing we had stopped doing was anything physical â besides those lingering hugs. We still shared a Netflix account, we still messaged each other all day every day, we still spoke for hours on the phone. I had started dating other people, and true to our promise, I could only assume he may have been doing the same â but with no serious prospects. Yet despite seeing other people, my heart did acrobatics every time we did a âcatch-upâ brunch. My emotions were running a marathon the entire time we were pretending to be âjust friendsâ. And, ultimately, that is what we were doing: pretending. Though I never voiced this to him, I canât help but look back and think my feelings were glaringly apparent. Of course, this all came crashing down six months into our friendship. I was at a house party, and a mutual friend asked if I had met my exâs new girlfriend. I stammered through a response, saying I had no idea. He was surprised: âOh really? Theyâre pretty serious â I thought you guys were really good friends now?â No, weâre not, I ruminated teary and drunk.He is not my best friend whose new relationship I am thrilled about. He is my ex-boyfriend who has a new girlfriend I knew nothing about. I am not thrilled for him, like a good mate should be - I am devastated, like a woman who is still in love with him. I ended our friendship the next day. He was upset and admitted that he had kept the relationship a secret, despite the fact it had become serious, because he had wanted to keep our friendship going. That was touching, yet further proof of how toxic our faux friendship had become. However, ending it was also one of the best decisions of my life. The connection I had with my ex was too deep, too problematic and too fraught with romantic tension to ever be a friendship. What our abortive attempt at being pals taught me was that trying to transform a relationship like that into a smooth-sailing, supportive friendship, is impossible - it does nothing but draw out and prolong the pain of breaking up. Itâs tempting to make a friendship with your ex the success story of your failed relationship, but often leaving it as what it was is more respectful to the time you shared. Today, my ex is a person I only text on his birthday. He does the same with me. Itâs a mature gesture, but that's as far as it needs to go. Because our relationship belongs to a specific time of our lives â in the past â and I've learnt that it doesnât fit anywhere else. Understanding that is the first step to getting over someone. Because, if you loved them like that, you were never truly just friends, so why on Earth would you start now?

The man who went to a stranger's stag party,"Will Novak (second from left) flew from Arizona to Vermont after accidently being invited to a stranger's stag do When he first read the email, Will Novak, from Arizona, thought it was a scam. ""It seemed so urgent, like one of those emails you get from a 'prince' asking you to send them money,"" he told the BBC. The email, titled Angelo's bachelor party, had been intended for a small group of friends. It set out the details of an upcoming ski trip to Vermont, to ""send Angelo off"" into married life. Will doesn't know anyone called Angelo. He decided to reply. It was that decision that started what Will calls the ""strangest"" week of his life. ""I do not know who Angelo is,"" Will wrote. ""I am a Will Novak, who lives in Arizona. Vermont seems like a very far way for me to travel for the bachelor party of a guy I've never met. That being said, count me in."" Will describes his reply as a joke. He offered to bring along his ""sweet Nintendo Switch"" games console or a selection of Sudoku puzzles, if that was more to Angelo's taste. ""I didn't expect them to respond,"" Will said, ""but two days later, they did."" You may also like: Divers take plunge with great white shark Massive ice disc forms in US river Rihanna takes father to court over brand The group of friends, including Bill Novak for whom the initial email was intended, urged him to come along. ""If you think we are kidding, we are not. You better be coming, as we all are all dying to meet you,"" they wrote. ""Not only will this be a weekend Angelo will not forget, it will be one you surely will not forget as well."" After posting the email exchange to social media, Will's story quickly went viral, making headlines around the world and spawning the hashtag #AngelosBachelorParty. Will said the reaction to his post had been ""unbelievable"" but admitted that he had had a couple of reservations. Other than the fact he hadn't skied in 20 years, Will was also concerned about funding the impromptu trip. On the recommendation of a friend, Will decided to set up a GoFundMe page. In under two hours, he surpassed his $750 (Â£580) goal, eventually raising more than $4,000 (Â£3,100). Will Novak raised more than $4,000 (Â£3,100) to attend a stranger's stag do Will is going to give any leftover money to Angelo and his fiancee, who are expecting their first child, as a wedding present. Will described the weekend as ""fast-paced"", ""high energy"" and ""truly surreal"". When he picked up his rental car, it had been upgraded to a Maserati, which was quickly filled with cases of beer donated to Angelo's stag do by a local brewery. The group welcomed Will with fireworks and a heavy metal concert, with Angelo on guitar. Despite sleeping through his first skiing lesson, Will said he ""did all right"" on the slopes. ""I skied into a man and we fell into a fence together. But it was super-slow speed and wasn't a big deal."" Asked what the best part of his ""bizarre"" week as a viral star had been, Will said ""the general feeling of openness and friendliness"" he had encountered. ""Reflecting on it, I could get pretty sentimental, really. It's a great lesson in being open to the universe and to others. ""If a door opens, walk through it. You regret the chances you don't take, rarely the ones you do take. ""I've always been a class-clown type and knowing I made thousands of people laugh makes me so happy.""

'Super poo donors' wanted,"Claudia wants to encourage others to consider donating Claudia Campanella, 31, works as a student support administrator at a UK university, and in her spare time she is a poo donor. ""Some of my friends think it is a bit weird or disgusting, but it doesn't worry me. It's very easy to donate and I just want to help with medical research. I'm glad to contribute."" Her faeces, teeming with ""good"" bugs, will be put into the bowel of a sick patient to help their poorly gut get better. Claudia knows her donation is extremely useful - that is why she does it - but is her poo extra special? Scientists believe some people's poo might contain an ideal mix of healing bacteria to fix gut diseases, making them super-donors. Claudia says she wanted tobecome a donor,externalbecause she had read that vegans might make particularly good candidates. There's no good evidence that vegan poo is better than any other human faeces, but experts are exploring what might make a stool ""super"". Dr Justin O'Sullivan is a molecular biology expert at the University of Auckland and he has been investigating the concept of super poo donors. Why a faecal transplant could save your life What does a faecal transplant do? The brave new world of DIY faecal transplant Our guts house millions of bugs that live inside us as a community. This diverse microbiome is unique to each us - no two are exactly the same. Although faecal transplantation is still a relatively new field of medicine, evidence from the studies that have been done hint that some donors make the best poo for the job. Dr O'Sullivan says: ""We see transplants from super-donors achieve clinical remission rates of perhaps double the remaining average. ""Our hope is that if we can discover how this happens, then we can improve the success of faecal transplantation and even trial it for new microbiome-associated conditions like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and asthma."" Dr Jon Landy is a consultant gastroenterologist for West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust and helps to co-ordinate their faecal transplant unit. He agrees with the idea of a super-donor, but says finding one could be tricky. ""We do not understand yet what makes a super-donor, or why,"" he said. ""We always make sure our donors are healthy and not carrying any disease, but we don't test all of their microbiome to see what that is like. ""These are the sorts of investigations that might need to be done."" Dr O'Sullivan's research, published in the journalFrontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,externalsuggests having lots of different microorganisms in your poo might be the advantage. He says a larger number of species in the donor's stool has been shown to be one of the most significant factors influencing faecal transplantation outcome. And patients who respond well to the transplants develop a more diverse microbiome too. But studies suggest success could also depend on how good a match the donor is for the patient. And it might not only be which bacteria are present in the poo. ""Some cases of recurrent diarrheal infection have even been cured with transplants of filtered stool, that has had all the live bacteria filtered out but still contains DNA, viruses and other debris. ""These viruses could affect the survival and metabolic function of transplanted bacteria and other microbes,"" says Dr O'Sullivan. Clostridium difficile can overwhelm the gut and make vulnerable patients very ill Dr Julie McDonald, a microbiome expert at Imperial College London, has been studying how to boost the success rate of stool transplants. Currently, most donations are used to treat a dangerous bowel condition caused by an infection called clostridium difficile. This infection can take hold when a patient's own ""good"" bowel bugs have been wiped out by antibiotics. For the most vulnerable, it can be deadly. Dr McDonald's work suggests poo transplants do a very specific job, replacing something lost in disease. She found patients suffering from clostridium difficile infections had virtually undetectable levels of a short-chain fatty acid valerate produced by healthy gut microbial metabolism The levels could only be restored with a successful faecal transplant. ""In our lab we are trying to figure out exactly how the transplants work and we are looking at whether we even move away from giving faeces itself."" Instead of giving the patient an injection of faeces they would be given a treatment based on the faeces, which they might find less off-putting. This might help get round the whole poo taboo that's associated with donating, she says. Claudia wants people to ""get over the mental barrier"" and think about becoming a donor. ""It's really very easy to donate. It's simple to do. If you are thinking about it, check if a hospital nearby has a service and get in touch with them. ""I collect my fresh sample at home in a container that my hospital provides. Then I drop it off to the hospital as I pass by it on my way to work. It's just a little bit of effort.""

Dalek shed museum faces extermination,"Lisa Cole said the Dalek had been warmly welcomed by villagers A family-run science fiction museum may be exterminated because a Dalek display does not comply with planning regulations. The owners of the Museum of Classic Sci-Fi have been ordered to remove a shed from the front of their home which houses the replica Doctor Who villain. It has been on display since the museum opened in Allendale in October. Northumberland County Council said the shed did not fit in with the character of the couple's Grade II-listed home. Art teacher Neil Cole, who owns the museum with his wife Lisa, teamed up with members of an after-school club to build the Dalek. The couple call this merging of a Volvo and Tardis the ""Volvardis"" The museum's website describes its attractions as ""a unique collection of original, screen-used props, costumes and artwork, spanning several decades"". However, the Coles said the Dalek cannot be stored in their cellar alongside the other exhibits which include further Doctor Who items and props and costumes from the Marvel movie universe. Mrs Cole said: ""I didn't realise we needed planning permission for a shed. It's not attached to the building and when the museum is shut, the shed is shut."" She said the Dalek would not fit inside the museum and if they had to get rid of it then the fate of the museum was ""unknown"". ""I don't even want to think about [having to close], I would be gutted,"" she added. The museum boasts a Cyberman costume among its other Doctor Who props Mrs Cole said the museum had ""brought more than 900 people into the village"", with the Dalek making people ""smile as they drive up the road"". ""You have to sell your house to be able to afford a real Dalek, but he's built this one so lovingly,"" she added. Northumberland County Council said: ""We wish to work with the property owner to resolve this, and we have written to him to advise that this would require planning permission and, due to the listed status of the property, an application is unlikely to be supported.""

Brazil search resumes after new dam scareThe rescue effort was delayed for hours amid evacuations because of a warning of a second dam burst.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Rescue teams searching for some 300 people missing after a dam collapsed in Brazil on Friday say the chances of finding survivors are ""very low"". No-one was rescued alive on Sunday near the south-eastern town of Brumadinho, as the number of dead rose to 58. ""We've got to have hope,"" said a woman whose 35-year-old husband was missing. The cause of the dam burst remains unclear. Brazil's largest mining company, Vale, which owns the complex, says safety procedures were followed. Search operations were suspended for hours on Sunday amid fears that a separate dam, also owned by Vale, was at risk of giving way in the area. Vale said 305 employees, contractors and residents were still missing. Some 192 people have been rescued alive. ""After 48 hours of work, the chance of finding [someone] alive is very low,"" Col Eduardo Angelo, who is leading the search operation, told relatives of the missing. ""[But] we're working with the possibility that we'll find people alive."" The dam break caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads. Access to the areas is difficult - in some places, the mud is up to 15m (49ft) deep. Search teams have been using helicopters and earth-moving machinery. A bus that was carrying employees has been found but rescuers have yet to reach a train that could contain survivors or more bodies. ""I still have hope,"" NÃ©lia Mary Fonseca told the BBC as she waited for details about her husband, Adriano, who worked as a contractor at the site. An Israeli group of engineers, doctors and members of the navy's underwater missions unit has arrived in Brazil to join the efforts. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais By Julia Carneiro, BBC News, Brumadinho Mining is the main economic activity in Brumadinho and now the cause of this unprecedented tragedy that will mark generations to come. The Paraopeba river that cuts through the town has been tinted by iron ore residue and now smells of dead fish. The first funerals were held on Sunday. Having a body to bury may turn out to be a twisted privilege in this tragedy, with hundreds of people believed to be under the mud and huge challenges to find them. At the information centre set up to assist the families, volunteers sit behind desks with the lists of those missing, and relatives queue up to check for any updates - or to enter more names of people still unaccounted for. I met a woman who was searching for her husband and son. Another man expected news from his brother. A young woman looked from her young husband. The dam burst may have broken their families, too. State prosecutors said they had frozen a total of 11bn reais ($2.9bn; Â£2.2bn) of assets belonging to Vale, Brazil's largest mining company. Brumadinho Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos criticised the company for being ""careless and incompetent"", blaming the firm for the dam burst and the state of Minas Gerais for poor oversight. ""This tragedy destroyed our city."" Rescue efforts have been hampered by the difficult access to areas hit In a television interview, Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the disaster had happened even after the company followed safety recommendations by international experts. ""I'm not a mining technician. I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,"" he said. Mr Schvartsman, who took office in May 2017, promised ""to go above and beyond any national or international standards... We'll create a cushion of safety far superior to what we have today to guarantee this never happens again."" Unlike dams used for water, tailings dams - like that in Brumadinho - are used to store by-products from mining operations. There have been a number of high-profile disasters involving tailings dams in recent years - andthere have been calls, including from the UN, to institute better safety and building regulations,externalaround them. On 5 November 2015, a dam owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton, burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais. It killed 19 people in what was consideredBrazil's worst environmental disasterat the time. After a lengthy court case, the companies reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais ($1.8bn) with the Brazilian government. Have you been affected by the collapsed dam?

Philippines church bomb attack kills 20One bomb went off outside the cathedral on Jolo island while a second exploded as soldiers responded.Asia,"This video can not be played Soldiers were deployed to the area after the explosions Two bombs at a Roman Catholic cathedral in southern Philippines have killed 20 people and injured dozens more, local officials say. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack on Jolo island, where jihadist groups are active. The first blast happened as Sunday Mass was being celebrated. A second device exploded outside as soldiers responded. The attack came days after a majority-Muslim area in the region voted for greater autonomy in a referendum. A statement from IS said the attack was carried out by ""two knights of martyrdom"" against a ""crusader temple"". Jolo has long been a base for militants, including those of the Abu Sayyaf group. Several of its factions have declared allegiance to IS. Who are the Abu Sayyaf group? Philippines country profile The local officials say the first blast happened at 08:45 local time (00:45 GMT) inside the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which has been hit by bombs in the past. The second explosion was shortly afterwards on the doorstep of the church. Police initially put the death toll at 27 but later lowered it to 20, saying there was double counting in earlier official reports. Most of the victims are civilians. The bomb attack devastated the church in Jolo Images posted on social media showed the main road leading to the church sealed off by soldiers in armoured personnel carriers. Some of the wounded were evacuated by air to the nearby city of Zamboanga. Calling the attack a ""dastardly act"", Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana urged the local population to work with the authorities to ""deny terrorism any victory"". ""We will use the full force of the law to bring to justice the perpetrators behind this incident."" The army has been deployed to the area after the bomb blasts In last week's referendum, voters approved the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in majority-Muslim areas of southern Philippines. But voters in Sulu province, where Jolo is located, rejected it. The referendum was the result of a peace deal between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The authorities have previously expressed hopes that the vote could be a political solution to try to end decades of fighting between Islamist separatists and the Philippine army in the predominantly Catholic country. Mindanao vote could end decades of violence More than 120,000 people have died in the violence.

One in 20 denies Holocaust took place,"Six million Jews were murdered during World War Two Five per cent of UK adults do not believe the Holocaust took place and one in 12 believes its scale has been exaggerated, a survey has found. The poll,externalof more than 2,000 people was carried out by Opinion Matters for the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust (HMDT). Meanwhile, people have gathered across the country to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. More than 11,000 activities took place, including a national commemorative ceremony in Westminster. In the survey, 45% of those polled said they did not know how many people were killed in the Holocaust, while one in five (19%) believed fewer than two million Jews were murdered. The actual figure was six million. Holocaust Memorial Day also marks,externalthe 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide and 40 years since the end of the genocide in Cambodia. Prime Minister Theresa May led tributes online with a message she had written in the Holocaust Educational Trust's book of commitment, calling for people to once again remember the catastrophe.

At the ceremony, survivors lit six candles to represent the six million Jewish victims. Grandmother Rachel Levy, 87, who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp as a teenager and came to the UK after the war, said she was frightened by the anti-Semitism in Britain today. ""People are turning nasty again, of all classes,"" she said. ""I don't understand why."" What was the Holocaust? 'I survived two concentration camps' Children listen to grandparents' Holocaust stories Although Jews were the Nazis' main target, a wide range of other groups were persecuted during the Holocaust, including gay people, minority races, political opponents like communists and trade unionists, and Jehovah's Witnesses. A quarter of a million mentally ill and disabled people and half a million Roma (also known as gypsies) were killed. A survivor at Auschwitz to mark International Holocaust Victims Remembrance Day on Sunday The memorial day coincides with the 74th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where people are laying wreaths Holocaust survivor Steven Frank, who was one of 93 children to survive the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia along with his two brothers, said the survey's findings were ""terribly worrying"". His father, who helped hide Jews as part of the Dutch resistance, was arrested in Amsterdam and gassed at Auschwitz, in Nazi-occupied Poland, in January 1943. Mr Frank, who now lives in Hertfordshire, said he was ""surprised"" by the number of people who do not believe the Holocaust took place. The 83-year-old said: ""In my experience, people don't have a solid understanding of what happened during the Holocaust and that's one of the reasons I am so committed to sharing what happened to me. ""At one of my talks, I met someone who said the Holocaust didn't happen. ""The only way to fight this kind of denial and anti-Semitism is with the truth - I tell people what happened, what I saw and what I experienced."" Steven Frank was one of 93 children to survive the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia He added: ""Education is so important. If we ignore the past, I fear history will repeat itself."" The HMDT's chief executive Olivia Marks-Woldman said: ""Such widespread ignorance and even denial is shocking. ""Without a basic understanding of this recent history, we are in danger of failing to learn where a lack of respect for difference and hostility to others can ultimately lead."" She added that the rise in reported hate crime in the UK and the risk of genocide in ongoing international conflicts meant ""we cannot be complacent"". Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""One person questioning the truth of the Holocaust is one too many. ""It is up to us to redouble our efforts to ensure future generations know that it did happen and become witnesses to one of the darkest episodes in our history."" What was the Holocaust?

Dark Hedges tree falls in high windsGale force winds of up to 60 mph hit Northern Ireland overnight on Saturday.Northern Ireland,"The Dark Hedges are estimated to date back to about 1775 A tree made famous by the TV fantasy drama Game of Thrones has fallen in strong winds. Gale force winds of up to 60 mph hit Northern Ireland overnight on Saturday. The Dark Hedges are a tunnel of beech trees on the Bregagh Road near Armoy that have become an an international tourist attraction since featuring in the hit series. Some of the trees were previously damaged during the turbulent weather of Storm Hector in June 2018. The intertwined beech branches and gnarled trunks make the Dark Hedges an iconic sight The trees were originally planted by the Stuart family along the entrance to their Gracehill House mansion. Over the decades, the branches grew over the road and became entangled and intertwined, creating a covered passageway with something of an ethereal feel. Originally, there were about 150 trees, but time has taken its toll and now only about 90 remain. Paddy Cregg, from the Woodland Trust, told BBC News NI that the trees date back to 1775 and by beech tree standards, they were ""old aged pensioners"". He added: ""They are coming to the end of their life, normally beech trees survive around 250 years, they are probably now 240 years old.

Paddy Cregg, from the Woodland Trust, told BBC News NI that the trees date back to 1775 and by beech tree standards, they were ""old aged pensioners"". He added: ""They are coming to the end of their life, normally beech trees survive around 250 years, they are probably now 240 years old. ""It's sad to see that one by one they are actually falling"".

Top Venezuela diplomat defects amid crisisThe military attache in Washington says he no longer recognises NicolÃÂ¡s Maduro as president.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Colonel JosÃ© Luis Silva: 'Juan Guaido is the only legitimate president' Venezuela's top military representative to the US has defected from NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. Col JosÃ© Luis Silva says he now recognises opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as president instead. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday, gaining the backing of several countries including the US. Meanwhile, Mr Maduro has rejected demands by European countries to call elections. Several countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said on Saturday they would recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections were not called within eight days. ""They should withdraw this ultimatum. Venezuela is not tied to Europe. This is complete insolence,"" Mr Maduro told CNN Turk. President Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging, leading to large anti-Maduro protests. Tens of thousands have protested against Mr Maduro, but, crucially, he has retained the support of the country's military so far. Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters fear he could be arrested The security forces are seen as the key player in this crisis, and Mr GuaidÃ³ has asked them to ""put themselves on the side of the Venezuelan people"". Venezuela crisis - in seven charts What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? In a video, filmed at the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, Col Silva called for free elections and urged his ""brothers in the armed forces of the nation to recognise President Juan GuaidÃ³ as the only legitimate president"". ""The armed forces have a fundamental role in the restoration of the democracy in our country. Please, brothers, do not attack our people,"" he said. Later, he told Reuters news agency that two other Venezuelan consular officials in the US also recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as leader. Col Silva appealed to the military, saying: ""The state has given us weapons to defend our country, not to attack our equals"". It is not clear whether more members of the military will be encouraged to defect. Mr GuaidÃ³ thanked Col Silva and urged others to join him, while Venezuela's defence ministry said Col Silva was guilty of treason, and tweeted photos of him with the word ""traitor"" on it.

Meanwhile, Mr Maduro has backed down over his demand that all US diplomats leave the country. Mr Maduro, accusing Mr GuaidÃ³ of attempting a coup, broke off relations with the US on Thursday and ordered US envoys to depart within 72 hours. Washington said it did not recognise his authority to order them out. On Saturday evening, as the deadline was due to expire, Venezuela's foreign ministry said it would withdraw the expulsion order, and instead allow 30 days for the two sides to set up ""interest offices"" in each others' countries. Interest offices are used when countries do not have formal diplomatic relations, but want to have a basic level of contact to represent their interests.

At a UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, Russia accused Washington of plotting a coup. However, more than a dozen Latin American countries and Canada have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. In Europe, Greece's left-wing ruling party has backed Mr Maduro. Venezuela is in economic crisis - hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials has hit its population hard and caused millions to flee. Mr Maduro has faced internal opposition and ongoing international criticism for his human rights record and handling of the economy.

'Thai bride's' family DNA tested,"Lamduan Seekanya's family say they have not heard from her since 2004 DNA samples have been taken from a Thai couple who believe their daughter may be the woman whose body was found on a hillside in England 14 years ago. The body was discovered in a stream near Pen-y-ghent, in the Yorkshire Dales, in 2004. Police said she may have been a ""Thai bride"". On Thursday a Thai couple came forward to say they believed she may be their daughter, Lamduan Seekanya. Analysis of the samples taken by Thai officials is due to take several days. The results of the tests will then be sent to the UK for comparison, said Setthinaree Veness, the president of the Thai Women Network in the UK, who is working with the family. The couple, Joomsri Seekanya, 72, and her husband Buasa, told a news conference last week their daughter married a British man in 1991 and moved to  north-west England shortly after. DNA samples were taken from husband and wife Buasa and Joomsri Seekanya (centre) Buasa (left) and Joomsri Seekanya have not heard from their daughter since 2004 The family, from Udon Thani, in north-east Thailand, said they had not heard from her since 2004. Mrs Seekanya said: ""A part of me hopes that it's not my daughter - I want her to come back alive. But if it's really her, I can finally sleep at night."" A police artist created an impression of how the woman may have looked Cold-case investigators say they believe the woman found in the UK was murdered and dumped on the hillside. Forensic tests suggest she was aged between 25 and 35, originally from south-east Asia and may have lived in north Lancashire or south Cumbria. She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band. The woman's body was discovered by walkers when they stopped to take photos by a hillside stream Speaking in October, Adam Harland, manager of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Police cold case review team, said they believed the woman may have been a ""Thai bride"". He said: ""[It is possible] she is a lady who has taken up a relationship with a white gentleman, and come back to the UK.""

Thousands warned over Brazil dam risk,"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Rescue teams searching for some 300 people missing after a dam collapsed in Brazil on Friday say the chances of finding survivors are ""very low"". No-one was rescued alive on Sunday near the south-eastern town of Brumadinho, as the number of dead rose to 58. ""We've got to have hope,"" said a woman whose 35-year-old husband was missing. The cause of the dam burst remains unclear. Brazil's largest mining company, Vale, which owns the complex, says safety procedures were followed. Search operations were suspended for hours on Sunday amid fears that a separate dam, also owned by Vale, was at risk of giving way in the area. Vale said 305 employees, contractors and residents were still missing. Some 192 people have been rescued alive. ""After 48 hours of work, the chance of finding [someone] alive is very low,"" Col Eduardo Angelo, who is leading the search operation, told relatives of the missing. ""[But] we're working with the possibility that we'll find people alive."" The dam break caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads. Access to the areas is difficult - in some places, the mud is up to 15m (49ft) deep. Search teams have been using helicopters and earth-moving machinery. A bus that was carrying employees has been found but rescuers have yet to reach a train that could contain survivors or more bodies. ""I still have hope,"" NÃ©lia Mary Fonseca told the BBC as she waited for details about her husband, Adriano, who worked as a contractor at the site. An Israeli group of engineers, doctors and members of the navy's underwater missions unit has arrived in Brazil to join the efforts. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais By Julia Carneiro, BBC News, Brumadinho Mining is the main economic activity in Brumadinho and now the cause of this unprecedented tragedy that will mark generations to come. The Paraopeba river that cuts through the town has been tinted by iron ore residue and now smells of dead fish. The first funerals were held on Sunday. Having a body to bury may turn out to be a twisted privilege in this tragedy, with hundreds of people believed to be under the mud and huge challenges to find them. At the information centre set up to assist the families, volunteers sit behind desks with the lists of those missing, and relatives queue up to check for any updates - or to enter more names of people still unaccounted for. I met a woman who was searching for her husband and son. Another man expected news from his brother. A young woman looked from her young husband. The dam burst may have broken their families, too. State prosecutors said they had frozen a total of 11bn reais ($2.9bn; Â£2.2bn) of assets belonging to Vale, Brazil's largest mining company. Brumadinho Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos criticised the company for being ""careless and incompetent"", blaming the firm for the dam burst and the state of Minas Gerais for poor oversight. ""This tragedy destroyed our city."" Rescue efforts have been hampered by the difficult access to areas hit In a television interview, Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the disaster had happened even after the company followed safety recommendations by international experts. ""I'm not a mining technician. I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,"" he said. Mr Schvartsman, who took office in May 2017, promised ""to go above and beyond any national or international standards... We'll create a cushion of safety far superior to what we have today to guarantee this never happens again."" Unlike dams used for water, tailings dams - like that in Brumadinho - are used to store by-products from mining operations. There have been a number of high-profile disasters involving tailings dams in recent years - andthere have been calls, including from the UN, to institute better safety and building regulations,externalaround them. On 5 November 2015, a dam owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton, burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais. It killed 19 people in what was consideredBrazil's worst environmental disasterat the time. After a lengthy court case, the companies reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais ($1.8bn) with the Brazilian government. Have you been affected by the collapsed dam?

Duke 'deeply sorry' after car crash,"The Duke of Edinburgh has written to a woman injured in a car crash he was involved in near Sandringham in Norfolk to say that he is ""deeply sorry"". Prince Philip wished Emma Fairweather a ""speedy recovery"", adding that he was ""somewhat shaken after the accident"". The 97-year-old suggested he did not see the car she was a passenger in on 17 January because of bright sun. His Land Rover Freelander collided with a Kia driven by Ms Fairweather's friend after he pulled out of a driveway. The duke's vehicle flipped over in the crash, which took place on the A149 near the Queen's country estate, and he was helped out by a passing motorist. Speed camera delay on duke crash road Police speak to Philip for not wearing seat belt Prince Philip's car 'careered' across road The other car involved was also carrying a nine-month-old baby boy, and his mother who was driving. The crash took place on an A-road near the Queen's Sandringham estate Ms Fairweather, 46, who broke her wrist, described the letter from the duke, dated 21 January, as a ""nice touch"". She had previously complained of a lack of direct communication from Prince Philip, saying she had only been contacted by a police family liaison officer and one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting. In the note on Sandringham House headed paper,which has been reproduced in the Sunday Mirror,external, the Duke acknowledged her ""very distressing experience"". This video can not be played Emma Fairweather, who broke her wrist in a car crash with the Duke of Edinburgh, describes the ""surreal experience"". He said: ""I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident"". Prince Philip said he had used the crossing many times and was aware of the ""amount of traffic that uses that main road"". He said it was a bright sunny day and at about three in the afternoon, the sun was low. ""In other words, the sun was shining low over the main road. In normal conditions I would have no difficulty in seeing traffic coming... but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences,"" he wrote. He added: ""I was somewhat shaken after the accident, but I was greatly relieved that none of you were seriously injured."" The duke said a crowd began to gather and he had been advised to return to Sandringham by a local police officer. Prince Philip was spotted driving a replacement Land Rover two days after the crash Mother-of-two Ms Fairweather, from King's Lynn, told the Sunday Mirror: ""I thought it was really nice that he signed off as 'Philip' and not the formal title. I was pleasantly surprised because of the personalised nature."" The paper reported Buckingham Palace has confirmed the letter is genuine and it is understood a similar note was sent to the driver of the Kia. The Duke of Edinburgh, who took delivery of a replacement Land Rover after the crash, was later reportedly spoken to by police after being pictured driving without a  seat belt two days after the crash.

City gridlocked after YouTuber visit,"Traffic in parts of the city centre had been at a standstill since Saturday afternoon An appearance by YouTuber James Charles is believed to have brought Birmingham city centre to a standstill after 8,000 fans flocked to the Bullring. The beauty guru was greeted by three floors of screaming supporters during his visit to the shopping centre at about 11:30 GMT on Saturday. But motorists were stuck in gridlocked traffic from 15:00 until 19:30. Drivers trying to leave car parks found they were stuck and some opted to abandon their vehicles overnight. Suffolk Street Queensway, Navigation Street, and Hill Street were all at a standstill. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

James Charles, who has millions of fans in his online ""sisterhood"", was at the Bullring's Morphe store Some fans had begun queuing at 08:00 to see him - but it is believed only about 250 took part in the meet-and-greet appearance inside the Morphe make-up store. Crowds of supporters blocked the aisles, bringing the shopping centre to a standstill. On Snapchat, Charles said he had wanted to say goodbye to fans at the Bullring, but it was a ""hazard"" and he had to get straight in his car. After discovering the traffic chaos caused, he tweeted a cheeky ""oops"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unlike the thousands of teenagers hoping to catch a glimpse of their idol, I'd gone to the Bullring on Saturday morning to shop. The top two floors were filled with excited youngsters (and some slightly bleary-eyed parents). As fans passed the time posing for selfies and jostling for the best position, repeated security announcements begged them to stop pushing. When James Charles finally stepped out into the shopping centre, the deafening scream that erupted wouldn't have sounded out of place at a pop concert. Afterwards, more loudspeaker announcements pleaded with lingering fans to disperse: ""James Charles will not be making any more appearances today."" But they didn't seem to be going anywhere. For the rest of us, the spectacle made for a welcome, if bemusing, distraction from the standard weekend shopping trip. ""What's all the fuss about?"" one man asked a security guard. ""Some bloke off YouTube,"" came the reply. West Midlands Police had earlier said the gridlock was caused by problems with traffic lights at the junction of Bristol Street and The Horsefair. But contractor Amey later said this was incorrect and the lights had been working all day. Birmingham City Council said it was ""analysing the data"" to establish the cause of the congestion which would ""help inform if any changes are needed to the network in future"". The authority added: ""It must also be remembered there are several regeneration projects and related highways work ongoing at present too, so we would continue to urge anyone coming into the city to plan their journeys in advance and use public transport wherever possible."" Crowds gathered on all levels of the shopping centre to catch a glimpse of the star Some shoppers criticised the handling of the event. Richard Simon said it was an ""absolute disgrace"".

Amber Molland-Allman, 20, who was shopping with friends on Saturday, said it was ""ridiculously crowded"". ""There was a lot of people, three storeys of just a queue, the escalators were closed and we had to go down [floors] through different shops,"" she said. However, Ms Allman said the atmosphere was ""excited"" and ""everyone was really happy"". She said security was handled ""quite well"". He is a 19-year-old social media star from Bethlehem, New York. He has a YouTube channel followed by almost 14 million people where he uploads make-up tutorials, reviews and challenges.

Last year, he released his own eyeshadow palette that sent millions of teens and make-up lovers into a tailspin as they tried to get their hands on it. The palette sold out worldwide within hours - twice. West Midlands Police said no extra officers were sent to the Bullring, other than an additional operational support unit that had been agreed in advance. The force added no incidents were reported and no arrests were made. Stephanie Lacey, general manager at Bullring and Grand Central, said: ""We understand there was some congestion in the city caused by roadworks but yesterday's event was hugely popular and many shoppers were delighted to have the chance to catch a glimpse of James Charles."" Drivers were stuck in lengthy traffic jams with some abandoning their cars in the city overnight Drivers took to social media on Saturday evening to express their frustration at the traffic in Birmingham.

Brexit backstop 'is not going to change',"Protests against the potential return of a hard border have been taking place on the island of Ireland The backstop element of the Brexit plan is ""not going to change"", Ireland's deputy prime minister has said. The proposal - aimed at preventing a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - played a major part in Theresa May's deal being voted down by a historic margin last week. But Simon Coveney told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the EU would not ratify a deal without it. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called the comments a ""negotiating position"". Mr Hancock also denied reports that the government was ""specifically"" planning for martial law if the UK left without a deal  - but he did not rule it out. He said that the government ""looks at all the options in all circumstances,"" but when pressed by Andrew Marr, the health secretary added: ""It remains on the statute book, but it isn't the focus of our attention."" Martial law involves the suspension of normal law, and temporary rule by the military. It can include measures such as curfews and travel restrictions. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Reality Check: Red lines on the Irish border Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'? The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. If a hard border comes about, people and goods passing between Ireland and the UK will need to be checked. Meanwhile,a leaked diplomatic note seen by the Guardian,externalclaims that the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, has told Mrs May that to revisit the backstop issue she would need to agree a permanent customs union with the EU. A customs union would mean that no tariffs would be put on goods travelling between the UK and the 27 member states of the EU, but that the UK could not negotiate its own trade agreements with other countries. The comments come ahead of a crunch week in Parliament. Mrs May will return to the Commons on Tuesday for a vote on her deal, which includes the withdrawal agreement - the so-called ""divorce deal"" on how the UK leaves the EU - and the political declaration - a statement on the future relationship. It was voted down by 432 to 202 votes last week, with hard-line Brexiteers in her own party and members of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - on whom Mrs May relies for votes in Parliament - citing the backstop as their main reason for voting against it. A number of MPs have been tabling amendmentsin a bid to force the government to change direction. One amendment, put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper, seeks to introduce a bill that would allow the government to extend Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU - by up to nine months in order to get a deal agreed in Westminster. Yvette Cooper has the support of a number of MPs, including Conservative Remainers Also appearing on Andrew Marr, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to ""block Brexit"" and said the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be. She appealed for the support of the prime minister and MPs, as well as for the backing of her own party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: ""We can't keep waiting for other people to sort this out."" ""We can't carry on with a kind of game of chicken,"" she said. ""In the end, someone has to take some responsibility and say, 'if the prime minister runs out of time, she may need some more time'. ""That is not about blocking Brexit, that is about being responsible and making sure you can get a Brexit deal."" Please upgrade your browser The UK is allowed to scrap Article 50 altogether - and halt Brexit - but to extend it, it would need the approval of the EU. Mr Coveney said Ireland ""won't be an obstacle"" if the UK wanted to go down the route of extending Article 50, adding: ""Ireland wants to help in this process."" ""Britain and Ireland are two islands next to each other,"" he said. ""We have to work out these things together andstop talking about games of chicken."" But Mr Hancock said delaying Brexit would not help solve the arguments between MPs. ""You can't just vote for delay,"" he said. ""You've got to vote positively for a deal"". Allow Twitter content?

Other amendments being put forward ahead of Tuesday's vote include a plan for putting a time limit on the backstop and another for scrapping it altogether. These are in answer to critics who dislike the backstop because they believe it keeps the UK too closely aligned to the EU and fear that it could become permanent. However, Mr Coveney said: ""The European Parliament will not ratify a Withdrawal Agreement that doesn't have a backstop in it. It's as simple as that. ""The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines."" The former chief constable of the police in Northern Ireland (PSNI) echoed previous warnings that the return of a hard border between the two countries would become a target for dissident republicans. Speaking to RTE, Sir Hugh Orde said there would be no way to avoid security patrols if the UK left without a deal, and security officers would be ""at risk"". This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop. Across Sunday's newspapers and political TV programmes, politicians clashed over whether leaving the EU without a deal should remain an option for the government or not. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom wrote in the Sunday Times that trying to rule out a no deal was a ""thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit"". But despite his colleague's words, defence minister Tobias Ellwood wrote: ""It is simply wrong for government and business to invest any more time and money in a no deal outcome that will make us poorer, weaker and smaller in the eyes of the world. ""It is now time to rule out the very possibility of no deal."" Mr Ellwood also said members of his own party seeking to ""crash out"" without a deal ""risk inflaming a dangerous battle for the soul of the Conservative Party"" - saying it could determine the outcome of the next election. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told Sky News no deal needed to remain on the table, although it would ""not be a good outcome"". This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? In other developments,the government is going to consult Parliament on whether to work extra hoursand lose their February half-term break in order to get Brexit delivered by 29 March.

MPs face longer hours for Brexit debate,"MPs are likely to be asked to work longer hours to find a way through the current deadlock MPs may need to work longer and lose their February half-term break if Brexit is to be delivered on time. The government is to consult Parliament on what extra hours will be needed to get its legislation onto the statute book before the planned 29 March exit. Theresa May will seek backing for her deal in another Commons vote on Tuesday. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom described bids by MPs to prevent a no deal as a ""thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit"". Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalshe said this would be an act of ""constitutional self harm"". The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal if no agreement can be reached. A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Brexit: A really simple guide Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'? Ms Leadsom had earlier expressed ""grave concerns"" about a bill, proposed by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which could extend Article 50 - which triggers the UK's withdrawal from the EU - by nine months, unless the prime minister can secure a deal by the end of February. But Ms Cooper said her proposals were an attempt to avoid a no deal scenario rather than block Brexit, stressing that her bill would give parliament the power to decide the length of the delay - which could be less than nine months. She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show she hoped it would put pressure on the prime minister to secure a deal before the end of February. ""I'm trying to get the government to take some responsibility,"" she said. She also called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back her bill, adding ""we can't keep waiting for other people to sort this out"". Shadow Education Secretary Angela Raynor told Sky News that Labour would do ""whatever it takes to avoid a no-deal Brexit"". ""If that means backing an amendment then we will do that,"" she added. In the Observer, her cabinet colleague David Lidington said he understands why MPs are worried by the prospect of no deal  - but urged them to look at Mrs May's revised plan before deciding whether Brexit should be delayed. Mr Lidington, who last weekheld discussions with opposition MPs, said: ""We must keep our focus on the only real way to rule out no deal - and that is to find common ground on a deal"". On 15 January, thewithdrawal deal Mrs May negotiated with the EU last November,externalwas rejected by MPs by a historic margin - 432 votes to 202. Please upgrade your browser BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the government's demand to extend the parliamentary day was a way of Mrs May sending a signal to MPs that she intends to stick to the planned March departure. The House of Commons recess between 14 and 25 February could be cancelled, and MPs would be asked to start earlier and finish later on days they sit. The normal sitting hours for the House of Commons are: Monday: 14:30 - 22:30 Tuesday: 11:30 - 19:30 Wednesday: 11:30 - 19:30 Thursday: 09:30 - 17:30 Friday (if sitting): 09:30 - 15:00 However MPs also work outside of these times dealing with concerns of constituents. The Commons generally only sits on 13 Fridays a year to consider private members' bills, which are put forward by MPs who are not government ministers. The Commons sat for 142 days in the 2016-17 session. Source:Parliament website,external Opposition and backbench MPs have been tabling amendmentsto the PM's motion in a bid to force the government to change direction. It will be up to Speaker John Bercow to select amendments to Mrs May's plans to put to a vote. Among them are the amendment from Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who will ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline, while the Lib Dems will be calling for a ""People's Vote"" - another referendum.

The backstop plan - a fallback position to avoid the return of customs checks at the Irish border if the UK fails to agree a deal with the EU - is a major sticking point for opponents of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement.

"Girl, 12, dies in motorway crash","The girl's family is being supported by specialist officers A 12-year-old girl has died in a crash involving multiple vehicles on a motorway. A Nissan Micra, in which the child from Lancaster was a passenger, left the carriageway between the M61 junction 9 and the M6 at Bamber Bridge, Preston. It hit the central reservation and then was in collision with a motorhome, Lancashire Constabulary added. An Audi then collided into the back of the motorhome and a Ford Fiesta crashed into a central barrier, the force said. The driver of the Micra, a 27-year-old woman also from Lancaster, suffered minor injuries. No-one else was injured in the crash which happened on Saturday evening, police said. Two men who were in the Audi fled the scene and are being sought by officers. They are described as being in their 30s and about 6ft (1.8m) tall. One of the men was bald and wearing a navy ""bomber"" jacket. The other is described as wearing a black beanie hat and all black clothing, and was carrying a black holdall, police said. Sgt Marc Glass said the girl's family were being supported by specialist officers.

"UK cyber-crime victims lose ÃÂ£190,000 a day","Jerry and Carole Tack, who lost nearly Â£10,000 to a TV Licence scam More than Â£190,000 a day is lost in the UK by victims of cyber-crime, police statistics show. More than a third of victims in that period fell prey to the hacking of social media and email accounts. Action Fraud said Â£34.6m was reported to be stolen from victims between April and September 2018, a 24% increase on the previous six months. The City of London Police, which runs Action Fraud, has warned people to keep separate passwords for online accounts. The figures show 13,357 people in the UK reported cyber crimes over six months. More than 5,000 of those people were hacked via their social media and email accounts, costing victims Â£14.8m. Commander Karen Baxter said cyber criminals were targeting people's social media accounts ""in a bid to make money and steal personal details"", adding it could leave victims ""at risk of identity theft"". Action Fraud is the reporting centre for people scammed, defrauded or who experienced cyber crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. When Jerry Tack received an email saying the TV licence needed paying, he didn't think twice about it. Nothing seemed suspicious about the website he clicked on, so he entered his bank details - and began a chain of events that would lose him Â£9,900. Jerry, from Hampshire, was among thousands contacted in what police called a ""particularly nasty"" fraud. But the banks say they cannot reimburse customers who have mistakenly authorised payments to fraudsters. Read the full article here. Commander Baxter said people should ""keep a strong, separate password for their email accounts"" and use the latest software and app updates. ""Always be suspicious of unsolicited requests for your personal or financial information and never call numbers or follow links provided in unsolicited texts or emails,"" she said. Earlier this month Action Fraudreported a ""convincing"" TV licence email scam had led to more than 5,000 complaintsover a three-month period. What happened when sextortion scammers targeted a BBC reporter?

Minister calls for social media 'purge',"This video can not be played After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account Social media firms could be banned if they fail to remove harmful content, the health secretary has warned. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Matt Hancock said: ""If we think they need to do things they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate."" But he said it would be better to work jointly with social media companies. The minister earlier called on social media giants to ""purge"" material promoting self-harm and suicide in the wake of links to a teenager's suicide. Asked if social media could be banned, Mr Hancock said: ""Ultimately parliament does have that sanction, yes"" but added: ""it's not where I'd like to end up."" Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017 after viewing disturbing content about suicide on social media. Speaking to the BBC, her father said he believed Instagram ""helped kill my daughter"". Mr Russell also criticised the online scrapbook Pinterest, telling the Sunday Times: ""Pinterest has a huge amount to answer for."" Instagram responded by saying it works with expert groups who advise them on the ""complex and nuanced"" issues of mental health and self-harm. Based on their advice that sharing stories and connecting with others could be helpful for recovery, Instagram said, they ""don't remove certain content"". ""Instead (we) offer people looking at, or posting it, support messaging that directs them to groups that can help."" But Instagram added it is undertaking a full review of its enforcement policies and technologies. A Pinterest spokesman said: ""We have a policy against harmful content and take numerous proactive measures to try to prevent it from coming and spreading on our platform. ""But we know we can do more, which is why we've been working to update our self-harm policy and enforcement guidelines over the last few months."" Facebook, which owns Instagram,said earlier it was ""deeply sorry"". The internet giant said graphic content which sensationalises self-harm and suicide ""has no place on our platform"". Almost half of UK internet users 'harmed' online University switches off social media Reality TV harms youngsters' body image Papyrus, a charity that works to prevent youth suicide, said it has been contacted by around 30 families in the past week who believe social media had a part to play in their children's suicides. ""We've had a spike in calls to our UK helpline since the BBC first reported this six days ago, all saying the same thing,"" said a spokeswoman for the charity. Mr Hancock said he was ""horrified"" to learn of Molly's death and feels ""desperately concerned to ensure young people are protected"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock: We will and we must act if we have to In a letter sent to Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, Apple, Google and Facebook (which owns Instagram), the minister ""welcomed"" steps already taken by firms but said ""more action is urgently needed"". He wrote: ""It is appalling how easy it still is to access this content online and I am in no doubt about the harm this material can cause, especially for young people. ""It is time for internet and social media providers to step up and purge this content once and for all."" He added that the government is developing a white paper addressing ""online harms"", and said it will look at content on suicide and self-harm. Mr Hancock explained: ""Lots of parents feel powerless in the face of social media. But we are not powerless. Both government and social media providers have a duty to act. ""I want to make the UK the safest place to be online for everyone - and ensure that no other family has to endure the torment that Molly's parents have had to go through."" Molly was found dead in her bedroom in November 2017 after showing ""no obvious signs"" of severe mental health issues. Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide. Mr Russell told the BBC: ""Some of that content is shocking in that it encourages self harm, it links self-harm to suicide and I have no doubt that Instagram helped kill my daughter."" Solicitor Merry Varney, who represents the Russell family, said Molly's case ""and the examples of how algorithms push negative material"" show a need to investigate online platforms, and how they could be ""contributing to suicides and self-harm"". If youâve been affected byself-harm, oremotional distress, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. Preventing the British public from visiting some of the most popular internet platforms would be a drastic step. But it is not outside the realms of possibility. The most obvious approach would be to make the country's internet service providers (ISPs) block access to certain internet protocol addresses directly. The risk with this is that IP addresses can sometimes be shared between services. In the past,an effort to block one illegal site led to users being unable to visit the Radio Times. It also doesn't address the fact that banned services could start using alternative IP addresses. So another approach would be to order ISPs to make adjustments to their domain name system (DNS) servers, which act as a sort of internet address book, translating easy-to-type web addresses into the long string of numbers that actually represent the services involved. The aim would be to prevent requests being routed to the correct internet protocol (IP) addresses, effectively blocking access to the platforms. But this alone would not be enough, since some people route their traffic via DNS servers belonging to Google or Cloudflare - a company that optimises web traffic performance and also protects against cyber-attacks - rather than their ISP. These firms are based overseas. It is possible for them to detect DNS requests that originated in the UK and refuse them when appropriate, but there would likely need to be considerable arm-twisting to get them to agree to set such a precedent. But to complicate matters, users could still try to circumvent a ban by using tools to anonymise their location and identity, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or the Tor browser. Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said: ""Many of the ways around such bans are relatively simple unless you also ban all those methods as well, such as happens in countries like China. ""For a ban to be truly effective, the UK government [would have to take steps] that I can't imagine users or ISPs would be happy with."" Matters would become further convoluted if the social media firms decided to help users bypass a ban, as has been the case with some piracy sites. The Pirate Bay, for example, regularly updates a list of proxy sites that act as middle men, sending data to and from the banned database via intermediary servers. The government would therefore need to keep on top of such proxies and ensure they were blocked too.

Hope fades for Brazil dam survivorsAt least 34 people are confirmed dead as rescue teams try to locate hundreds buried beneath sludge.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide At least 34 people have been killed and about 300 others remain missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in south-eastern Brazil, officials say. Rescue teams have been scouring the site near the town of Brumadinho, following Friday's collapse. It is not clear what caused the failure of the dam, owned by Vale, Brazil's largest mining company. Vale has had 6bn reais ($1.6bn; Â£1.2bn) frozen from its accounts to help fund recovery works and handle damages. The rupture of the dam caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria, where workers were eating lunch, and at least one bus that carried employees. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais On Saturday, emergency services used helicopters and earth-moving machinery in the search for survivors. Some 366 people have been rescued, Minas Gerais state fire department says. Of those, 23 have been taken to hospital. Vale said it could not reach 252 of its employees and contractors. Residents and guests at a local inn were also reported missing. Eight of the victims have been identified. Relatives of those who remain missing await news of their loved ones Search efforts have been hampered by the difficult access to the area, the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Brumadinho reports. Even retrieving the bodies will be complicated because they are thought to be under a thick layer of mud, our correspondent adds. A bus that was carrying workers had been found but it was unclear how many people were inside. But three people who were stranded in a pick-up truck were rescued alive. President Jair Bolsonaro, who flew over the disaster area in a helicopter on Saturday, tweeted that it was hard not to get ""emotional"" after seeing the scale of the devastation. He said he had accepted an offer by Israel to send search equipment that could find people buried in the mud. President Jair Bolsonaro said all efforts were being made to rescue survivors Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, issued Vale with an initial fine of 250m reais ($66.5m; Â£50m) in relation to the incident. Relatives of the missing gathered at a warehouse set up by Vale criticised the lack of information. ""I want to know the truth. There's a disregard for everyone here,"" 43-year-old Sirlene do Carmo JanuÃ¡rio told the BBC - her missing 23-year-old son, Rangel, worked at a company's building that was hit by the sludge. The sea of muddy sludge swept over roads and destroyed buildings Earlier, state Governor Romeu Zema said the chances of finding more survivors were slim. ""We're likely to just be recovering bodies."" The collapse comes just over three years since a dam burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people, in what was consideredBrazil's worst environmental disaster. The dam near FeijÃ£o iron ore mine burst its barrier at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday, flooding another dam down below. The torrent of sludge cut through the dam's complex, nearby farms and the neighbourhood where many of the workers lived, destroying houses and vehicles. There are reports that the dam's alarm system - which local residents had been trained to respond to - failed. Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the collapse may have occurred too quickly for a siren which triggers security protocols to be activated. Built in 1976, the dam was one of several in the area and it was used to hold residue from the mine. It had a capacity of 12m cubic metres and had been an inactive site for three years, Vale said. On 5 November 2015, a dam - also owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton - burst at a Samarco mine in Mariana. More than 60m cubic metres - enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools - spilled over into the surrounding area. After a lengthy court case, BHP Billiton and Vale reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais ($1.8bn) with the Brazilian government.

Djokovic & Nadal renew 'biggest rivalry',"Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal met in the 2012 Australian Open final with Djokovic winning in five sets in five hours 53 minutes Australian Open 2019 men's final Venue:Melbourne ParkDate:27 January Coverage:BBC Radio 5 live commentary from 08:30 GMT, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website, and watch highlights on BBC TV and online at 14:20. Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal will renew their long-standing rivalry in an Australian Open final where both can create new records. Djokovic is aiming for a record seventh men's Melbourne title, while Nadal can become the first man in the Open era to win all the Grand Slams at least twice. Sunday's match will be an ATP record-extending 53rd meeting between them. ""It is the biggest rivalry we've seen in tennis history,"" Australian former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said. The top two seeds meet at Melbourne Park for the first time since their epic five-set final in 2012, which Djokovic won with almost six hours on the clock. The pair have produced some of the greatest matches, meeting in: Seven Grand Slam finals Five Grand Slam semi-finals 17 other Tour-level finals 13 other Tour-level semi-finals One Olympic semi-final Djokovic, 31, leads their head-to-head 27-25, with eight victories in their past 10 matches - including their memorable 2018 Wimbledon semi-final five-setter which stretched over two days. ""I've played so many matches against him, epic matches on this court,"" said the Serb. ""I'm sure we're going to have a good final."" Spaniard Nadal, 32, said he was happy to have shared ""very special moments"" on court with Djokovic. ""We push each other to the limit of our tennis level,"" he added. ""Sunday is going to be another episode."" Live scores, schedule and results Follow the Australian Open on BBC TV, radio and online Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Djokovic set up the tantalising final with a comprehensive semi-final win over French 28th seed Lucas Pouille, which he described as one of his best performances in Melbourne. Spain's Nadal, meanwhile, has not dropped a set in his six matches here. Whoever wins will move closer to Roger Federer's all-time record of 20 Grand Slam victories, although Australian great Rod Laver believes Djokovic is best placed to overhaul the Swiss. Djokovic has won 14 majors after his Wimbledon and US Open victories last year, while Nadal has 17 after claiming the 2018 French Open. ""When you look at his age and form in winning the last two, I'd say Djokovic has the best chance of eclipsing Federer,"" said 11-time Grand Slam singles champion Laver, 80. Djokovic saysbeating Nadal at Wimbledonlast year ""mentally turned things around the most"" for him. Ranked outside the world's top 20 earlier that year after elbow surgery,Djokovic beat Kevin Andersonin the final for his first Grand Slam title since the 2016 French Open. He followed that by winning the US Open in September and reclaiming the world number one spot in November. ""Winning against Nadal 10-8 in the fifth set, that has catapulted me mentally to a different, more confident self,"" Djokovic said. ""It has allowed me to then excel in the months to come after that."" Nadal is playing in his first tournament since the US Open after injury problems and has been surprised by his level of performance in Melbourne. ""I am happy that I am competing that well that early. That's the most important thing,"" he said. ""I felt myself playing well in practice before the tournament. Then you have to compete, see if you can make that happen in the competition. ""I am very happy to have that feeling again. Of course, it is a little bit surprising that it happens that early."" Six-time champion Djokovic is tied with Australian great Roy Emerson and Federer in terms of all-time victories in Melbourne. Emerson, 82, said he is backing Nadal for victory because he does not want to see his record, set in 1967 and matched by Federer in 2018, beaten. ""Well, I don't want Djokovic to do it,"" he joked. ""I don't have that many records to brag about. ""But my six doesn't look too good. ""Djokovic is still young and can still make all sorts of records. ""If he keeps himself in shape, like Federer, he's got another two or three years where he'll be winning majors."" Lindsay Davenport, three-time Grand Slam singles champion Nadal's big push in the off-season has been his serve, trying to get it on to the opponent much faster than he had been. That allows him to play offensive in the second or third shot in the rally. The toughest person to do that against is Djokovic, the best returner, and it will be interesting to see if Rafa tries to do anything differently - tries to put more miles per hour on his serve than their last meeting or if he tries to take the next ball earlier. The way Rafa has played this tournament has been exceptional - but that's not easy to do against Novak.

"UK cyber-crime victims lose Â£190,000 a day","Jerry and Carole Tack, who lost nearly Â£10,000 to a TV Licence scam More than Â£190,000 a day is lost in the UK by victims of cyber-crime, police statistics show. More than a third of victims in that period fell prey to the hacking of social media and email accounts. Action Fraud said Â£34.6m was reported to be stolen from victims between April and September 2018, a 24% increase on the previous six months. The City of London Police, which runs Action Fraud, has warned people to keep separate passwords for online accounts. The figures show 13,357 people in the UK reported cyber crimes over six months. More than 5,000 of those people were hacked via their social media and email accounts, costing victims Â£14.8m. Commander Karen Baxter said cyber criminals were targeting people's social media accounts ""in a bid to make money and steal personal details"", adding it could leave victims ""at risk of identity theft"". Action Fraud is the reporting centre for people scammed, defrauded or who experienced cyber crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. When Jerry Tack received an email saying the TV licence needed paying, he didn't think twice about it. Nothing seemed suspicious about the website he clicked on, so he entered his bank details - and began a chain of events that would lose him Â£9,900. Jerry, from Hampshire, was among thousands contacted in what police called a ""particularly nasty"" fraud. But the banks say they cannot reimburse customers who have mistakenly authorised payments to fraudsters. Read the full article here. Commander Baxter said people should ""keep a strong, separate password for their email accounts"" and use the latest software and app updates. ""Always be suspicious of unsolicited requests for your personal or financial information and never call numbers or follow links provided in unsolicited texts or emails,"" she said. Earlier this month Action Fraudreported a ""convincing"" TV licence email scam had led to more than 5,000 complaintsover a three-month period. What happened when sextortion scammers targeted a BBC reporter? Man held over Â£8.7m cryptocurrency theft Thousands complain about TV licence scam Emails with headlines such as ""correct your licensing information"" would direct users to a fake TV licensing website.

One-in-20 deny Holocaust took place,"Six million Jews were murdered during World War Two Five per cent of UK adults do not believe the Holocaust took place and one in 12 believes its scale has been exaggerated, a survey has found. The poll,externalof more than 2,000 people was carried out by Opinion Matters for the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust (HMDT). Meanwhile, people have gathered across the country to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. More than 11,000 activities took place, including a national commemorative ceremony in Westminster. In the survey, 45% of those polled said they did not know how many people were killed in the Holocaust, while one in five (19%) believed fewer than two million Jews were murdered. The actual figure was six million. Holocaust Memorial Day also marks,externalthe 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide and 40 years since the end of the genocide in Cambodia. Prime Minister Theresa May led tributes online with a message she had written in the Holocaust Educational Trust's book of commitment, calling for people to once again remember the catastrophe.

At the ceremony, survivors lit six candles to represent the six million Jewish victims. Grandmother Rachel Levy, 87, who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp as a teenager and came to the UK after the war, said she was frightened by the anti-Semitism in Britain today. ""People are turning nasty again, of all classes,"" she said. ""I don't understand why."" What was the Holocaust? 'I survived two concentration camps' Children listen to grandparents' Holocaust stories Although Jews were the Nazis' main target, a wide range of other groups were persecuted during the Holocaust, including gay people, minority races, political opponents like communists and trade unionists, and Jehovah's Witnesses. A quarter of a million mentally ill and disabled people and half a million Roma (also known as gypsies) were killed. A survivor at Auschwitz to mark International Holocaust Victims Remembrance Day on Sunday The memorial day coincides with the 74th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where people are laying wreaths Holocaust survivor Steven Frank, who was one of 93 children to survive the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia along with his two brothers, said the survey's findings were ""terribly worrying"". His father, who helped hide Jews as part of the Dutch resistance, was arrested in Amsterdam and gassed at Auschwitz, in Nazi-occupied Poland, in January 1943. Mr Frank, who now lives in Hertfordshire, said he was ""surprised"" by the number of people who do not believe the Holocaust took place. The 83-year-old said: ""In my experience, people don't have a solid understanding of what happened during the Holocaust and that's one of the reasons I am so committed to sharing what happened to me. ""At one of my talks, I met someone who said the Holocaust didn't happen. ""The only way to fight this kind of denial and anti-Semitism is with the truth - I tell people what happened, what I saw and what I experienced."" Steven Frank was one of 93 children to survive the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia He added: ""Education is so important. If we ignore the past, I fear history will repeat itself."" The HMDT's chief executive Olivia Marks-Woldman said: ""Such widespread ignorance and even denial is shocking. ""Without a basic understanding of this recent history, we are in danger of failing to learn where a lack of respect for difference and hostility to others can ultimately lead."" She added that the rise in reported hate crime in the UK and the risk of genocide in ongoing international conflicts meant ""we cannot be complacent"". Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""One person questioning the truth of the Holocaust is one too many. ""It is up to us to redouble our efforts to ensure future generations know that it did happen and become witnesses to one of the darkest episodes in our history."" What was the Holocaust?

"City gridlocked after YouTuber visitRoads were jammed and cars abandoned after 8,000 James Charles fans flocked to Birmingham.Birmingham & Black Country","Traffic in parts of the city centre had been at a standstill since Saturday afternoon An appearance by YouTuber James Charles is believed to have brought Birmingham city centre to a standstill after 8,000 fans flocked to the Bullring. The beauty guru was greeted by three floors of screaming supporters during his visit to the shopping centre at about 11:30 GMT on Saturday. But motorists were stuck in gridlocked traffic from 15:00 until 19:30. Drivers trying to leave car parks found they were stuck and some opted to abandon their vehicles overnight. Suffolk Street Queensway, Navigation Street, and Hill Street were all at a standstill. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

James Charles, who has millions of fans in his online ""sisterhood"", was at the Bullring's Morphe store Some fans had begun queuing at 08:00 to see him - but it is believed only about 250 took part in the meet-and-greet appearance inside the Morphe make-up store. Crowds of supporters blocked the aisles, bringing the shopping centre to a standstill. On Snapchat, Charles said he had wanted to say goodbye to fans at the Bullring, but it was a ""hazard"" and he had to get straight in his car. After discovering the traffic chaos caused, he tweeted a cheeky ""oops"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unlike the thousands of teenagers hoping to catch a glimpse of their idol, I'd gone to the Bullring on Saturday morning to shop. The top two floors were filled with excited youngsters (and some slightly bleary-eyed parents). As fans passed the time posing for selfies and jostling for the best position, repeated security announcements begged them to stop pushing. When James Charles finally stepped out into the shopping centre, the deafening scream that erupted wouldn't have sounded out of place at a pop concert. Afterwards, more loudspeaker announcements pleaded with lingering fans to disperse: ""James Charles will not be making any more appearances today."" But they didn't seem to be going anywhere. For the rest of us, the spectacle made for a welcome, if bemusing, distraction from the standard weekend shopping trip. ""What's all the fuss about?"" one man asked a security guard. ""Some bloke off YouTube,"" came the reply. West Midlands Police had earlier said the gridlock was caused by problems with traffic lights at the junction of Bristol Street and The Horsefair. But contractor Amey later said this was incorrect and the lights had been working all day. Birmingham City Council said it was ""analysing the data"" to establish the cause of the congestion which would ""help inform if any changes are needed to the network in future"". The authority added: ""It must also be remembered there are several regeneration projects and related highways work ongoing at present too, so we would continue to urge anyone coming into the city to plan their journeys in advance and use public transport wherever possible."" Crowds gathered on all levels of the shopping centre to catch a glimpse of the star Some shoppers criticised the handling of the event. Richard Simon said it was an ""absolute disgrace"".

Amber Molland-Allman, 20, who was shopping with friends on Saturday, said it was ""ridiculously crowded"". ""There was a lot of people, three storeys of just a queue, the escalators were closed and we had to go down [floors] through different shops,"" she said. However, Ms Allman said the atmosphere was ""excited"" and ""everyone was really happy"". She said security was handled ""quite well"". He is a 19-year-old social media star from Bethlehem, New York.

Last year, he released his own eyeshadow palette that sent millions of teens and make-up lovers into a tailspin as they tried to get their hands on it. The palette sold out worldwide within hours - twice. West Midlands Police said no extra officers were sent to the Bullring, other than an additional operational support unit that had been agreed in advance. The force added no incidents were reported and no arrests were made. Stephanie Lacey, general manager at Bullring and Grand Central, said: ""We understand there was some congestion in the city caused by roadworks but yesterday's event was hugely popular and many shoppers were delighted to have the chance to catch a glimpse of James Charles."" Drivers were stuck in lengthy traffic jams with some abandoning their cars in the city overnight Drivers took to social media on Saturday evening to express their frustration at the traffic in Birmingham.

Luke Strong told the BBC it took him over three hours to travel 0.8 miles ""We were just stuck on a roundabout so we couldn't just abandon my car,"" said Mr Strong.

Canada PM sacks ambassador to China,"Justin Trudeau (R) appointed John McCallum ambassador to China in 2017 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has fired Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum. It follows controversial comments Mr McCallum made about an extradition case involving a senior executive from the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Mr Trudeau said in a statement he had asked John McCallum to step down, but did not offer a reason. The detention of Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US, angered China and soured Canada's relations with Beijing. Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, is accused by the US of evading sanctions on Iran. Both she and Huawei deny those allegations. Canada 'alone' in China and Huawei dispute No politics behind Huawei arrest - Trudeau Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage In a statement, the Canadian prime minister said: ""Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China."" The veteran diplomat, Mr Trudeau added, had served Canadians honourably and with distinction with many positions in cabinet. He also thanked the diplomat and his family for their service. Mr McCallum caused controversy on Tuesday when he publicly argued that the US extradition request for Ms Meng was seriously flawed. The next day he issued a statement saying that he ""misspoke"" and regretted that his comments had created ""confusion"". But on Friday he was quoted as saying it would be ""great for Canada"" if the US dropped the request. Mr McCallum was appointed Canada's ambassador to China in 2017, stepping down as the immigration minister. Canadian media say he was eager to take over the posting because of his strong personal connection to China. Mr McCallum's wife is ethnically Chinese, and he had a large Chinese-Canadian population in his former constituency in Ontario. Mr McCallum also served as Canada's defence minister in 2002-03. She was arrested on 1 December in Canada's western city of Vancouver at the request of the US. She was later granted a C$10m (Â£5.7m; $7.6m) bail by a local court. But she is under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Meng Wanzhou denies all the allegations against her Earlier this month, US officials confirmed they planned to pursue the extradition of Ms Wanzhou. Washington has 60 days to file a formal demand for extradition, a deadline that will be reached 30 January. US to 'move ahead with Huawei executive extradition' The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Why Huawei matters in five charts China's foreign ministry has urged US officials to withdraw the arrest order and refrain from moving ahead with the extradition request. Ms Meng's case has led to rising diplomatic tensions between Canada and China. Canadian nationals Michael Spavor (left) and Michael Kovrig have been put under ""compulsory measures"" Earlier this month,a Canadian man was sentenced to death in Chinaafter a court said a jail term of 15 years was too lenient. Two other Canadians - businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrg - were arrested following the detention of Ms Meng. Some China analysts believe that the arrests were a tit-for-tat response to her detention, a claim Chinese officials have denied. Canadian's death sentence 'horrific' Canadian ex-diplomat 'held in China' Canada 'alone' in China and Huawei dispute The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress No politics behind Huawei arrest - Trudeau New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

MPs' Brexit amendments,"This video can not be played Chris Mason recaps what has happened to the Brexit deal and explains the next key vote options MPs have voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. Commons Speaker John Bercow selected seven amendments to be debated and voted on. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Here are the amendments, and the results, in the order in which they took place. Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction. Theresa May has already said she will return to Brussels to reopen negotiations on legally-binding alternatives to the ""backstop"".

Philippines church bomb attack kills 21,"This video can not be played Soldiers were deployed to the area after the explosions Two bombs at a Roman Catholic cathedral in southern Philippines have killed 20 people and injured dozens more, local officials say. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack on Jolo island, where jihadist groups are active. The first blast happened as Sunday Mass was being celebrated. A second device exploded outside as soldiers responded. The attack came days after a majority-Muslim area in the region voted for greater autonomy in a referendum. A statement from IS said the attack was carried out by ""two knights of martyrdom"" against a ""crusader temple"". Jolo has long been a base for militants, including those of the Abu Sayyaf group. Several of its factions have declared allegiance to IS. Who are the Abu Sayyaf group? Philippines country profile The local officials say the first blast happened at 08:45 local time (00:45 GMT) inside the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which has been hit by bombs in the past. The second explosion was shortly afterwards on the doorstep of the church. Police initially put the death toll at 27 but later lowered it to 20, saying there was double counting in earlier official reports. Most of the victims are civilians. The bomb attack devastated the church in Jolo Images posted on social media showed the main road leading to the church sealed off by soldiers in armoured personnel carriers. Some of the wounded were evacuated by air to the nearby city of Zamboanga. Calling the attack a ""dastardly act"", Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana urged the local population to work with the authorities to ""deny terrorism any victory"". ""We will use the full force of the law to bring to justice the perpetrators behind this incident."" The army has been deployed to the area after the bomb blasts In last week's referendum, voters approved the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in majority-Muslim areas of southern Philippines. But voters in Sulu province, where Jolo is located, rejected it. The referendum was the result of a peace deal between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The authorities have previously expressed hopes that the vote could be a political solution to try to end decades of fighting between Islamist separatists and the Philippine army in the predominantly Catholic country. Mindanao vote could end decades of violence More than 120,000 people have died in the violence.

Grandmother Rachel Levy, 87, who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp as a teenager and came to the UK after the war, said she was frightened by the anti-Semitism in Britain today. ""People are turning nasty again, of all classes,"" she said. ""I don't understand why."" What was the Holocaust? 'I survived two concentration camps' Children listen to grandparents' Holocaust stories Although Jews were the Nazis' main target, a wide range of other groups were persecuted during the Holocaust, including gay people, minority races, political opponents like communists and trade unionists, and Jehovah's Witnesses. A quarter of a million mentally ill and disabled people and half a million Roma (also known as gypsies) were killed. A survivor at Auschwitz to mark International Holocaust Victims Remembrance Day on Sunday The memorial day coincides with the 74th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where people are laying wreaths Holocaust survivor Steven Frank, who was one of 93 children to survive the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia along with his two brothers, said the survey's findings were ""terribly worrying"". His father, who helped hide Jews as part of the Dutch resistance, was arrested in Amsterdam and gassed at Auschwitz, in Nazi-occupied Poland, in January 1943. Mr Frank, who now lives in Hertfordshire, said he was ""surprised"" by the number of people who do not believe the Holocaust took place. The 83-year-old said: ""In my experience, people don't have a solid understanding of what happened during the Holocaust and that's one of the reasons I am so committed to sharing what happened to me. ""At one of my talks, I met someone who said the Holocaust didn't happen. ""The only way to fight this kind of denial and anti-Semitism is with the truth - I tell people what happened, what I saw and what I experienced."" Steven Frank was one of 93 children to survive the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia He added: ""Education is so important. If we ignore the past, I fear history will repeat itself."" The HMDT's chief executive Olivia Marks-Woldman said: ""Such widespread ignorance and even denial is shocking. ""Without a basic understanding of this recent history, we are in danger of failing to learn where a lack of respect for difference and hostility to others can ultimately lead."" She added that the rise in reported hate crime in the UK and the risk of genocide in ongoing international conflicts meant ""we cannot be complacent"". Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""One person questioning the truth of the Holocaust is one too many. ""It is up to us to redouble our efforts to ensure future generations know that it did happen and become witnesses to one of the darkest episodes in our history."" What was the Holocaust?

Australia Open: Djokovic & Nadal set for final,"Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal met in the 2012 Australian Open final with Djokovic winning in five sets in five hours 53 minutes Australian Open 2019 men's final Venue:Melbourne ParkDate:27 January Coverage:BBC Radio 5 live commentary from 08:30 GMT, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website, and watch highlights on BBC TV and online at 14:20. Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal will renew their long-standing rivalry in an Australian Open final where both can create new records. Djokovic is aiming for a record seventh men's Melbourne title, while Nadal can become the first man in the Open era to win all the Grand Slams at least twice. Sunday's match will be an ATP record-extending 53rd meeting between them. ""It is the biggest rivalry we've seen in tennis history,"" Australian former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said. The top two seeds meet at Melbourne Park for the first time since their epic five-set final in 2012, which Djokovic won with almost six hours on the clock. The pair have produced some of the greatest matches, meeting in: Seven Grand Slam finals Five Grand Slam semi-finals 17 other Tour-level finals 13 other Tour-level semi-finals One Olympic semi-final Djokovic, 31, leads their head-to-head 27-25, with eight victories in their past 10 matches - including their memorable 2018 Wimbledon semi-final five-setter which stretched over two days. ""I've played so many matches against him, epic matches on this court,"" said the Serb. ""I'm sure we're going to have a good final."" Spaniard Nadal, 32, said he was happy to have shared ""very special moments"" on court with Djokovic. ""We push each other to the limit of our tennis level,"" he added. ""Sunday is going to be another episode."" Live scores, schedule and results Follow the Australian Open on BBC TV, radio and online Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Djokovic set up the tantalising final with a comprehensive semi-final win over French 28th seed Lucas Pouille, which he described as one of his best performances in Melbourne. Spain's Nadal, meanwhile, has not dropped a set in his six matches here. Whoever wins will move closer to Roger Federer's all-time record of 20 Grand Slam victories, although Australian great Rod Laver believes Djokovic is best placed to overhaul the Swiss. Djokovic has won 14 majors after his Wimbledon and US Open victories last year, while Nadal has 17 after claiming the 2018 French Open. ""When you look at his age and form in winning the last two, I'd say Djokovic has the best chance of eclipsing Federer,"" said 11-time Grand Slam singles champion Laver, 80. Djokovic saysbeating Nadal at Wimbledonlast year ""mentally turned things around the most"" for him. Ranked outside the world's top 20 earlier that year after elbow surgery,Djokovic beat Kevin Andersonin the final for his first Grand Slam title since the 2016 French Open. He followed that by winning the US Open in September and reclaiming the world number one spot in November. ""Winning against Nadal 10-8 in the fifth set, that has catapulted me mentally to a different, more confident self,"" Djokovic said. ""It has allowed me to then excel in the months to come after that."" Nadal is playing in his first tournament since the US Open after injury problems and has been surprised by his level of performance in Melbourne. ""I am happy that I am competing that well that early. That's the most important thing,"" he said. ""I felt myself playing well in practice before the tournament. Then you have to compete, see if you can make that happen in the competition. ""I am very happy to have that feeling again. Of course, it is a little bit surprising that it happens that early."" Six-time champion Djokovic is tied with Australian great Roy Emerson and Federer in terms of all-time victories in Melbourne. Emerson, 82, said he is backing Nadal for victory because he does not want to see his record, set in 1967 and matched by Federer in 2018, beaten. ""Well, I don't want Djokovic to do it,"" he joked. ""I don't have that many records to brag about. ""But my six doesn't look too good. ""Djokovic is still young and can still make all sorts of records. ""If he keeps himself in shape, like Federer, he's got another two or three years where he'll be winning majors."" Lindsay Davenport, three-time Grand Slam singles champion Nadal's big push in the off-season has been his serve, trying to get it on to the opponent much faster than he had been. That allows him to play offensive in the second or third shot in the rally. The toughest person to do that against is Djokovic, the best returner, and it will be interesting to see if Rafa tries to do anything differently - tries to put more miles per hour on his serve than their last meeting or if he tries to take the next ball earlier. The way Rafa has played this tournament has been exceptional - but that's not easy to do against Novak.

Protesters storm Turkish military camp,"Civilians stormed a Turkish military camp near Dohuk, Iraq At least one person has died and 10 have been injured after an angry crowd stormed a Turkish military camp in Iraq's Kurdish region. Residents set light to vehicles and buildings in protest against Turkish airstrikes in the area, which are said to have killed several people. Turkey conducts frequent raids against the militant group, the PKK, which is based on the Iraqi side of the border. It accuses insurgents of disguising as civilians to fuel conflict in the area. Local official Najib Saeed said Turkish soldiers had shot at protesters and then left, and that the fires had caused several explosions. He said it was not yet clear what caused the death near the city of Dohuk. Turkey warns of fresh anti-Kurd offensive France offers to mediate between Turkey and Kurds Who are the Kurds? Turkey's defence ministry said the attack happened as a result of ""provocation by the PKK terrorist organisation"".

Trump insists border wall will be builtThe US president is defiant despite failing to secure funds in his long confrontation with Democrats.,"President Trump says a wall or fence along the Mexican border is vital for US security US President Donald Trump insists the US will still build a wall along its border with Mexico, despite ending the longest-ever US government shutdown without securing funds for the project. On Twitter, Mr Trump said the deal to temporarily reopen government was ""in no way a concession"" on the wall. The bipartisan agreement announced on Friday covers just three weeks. Mr Trump indicated he might trigger another shutdown or declare a national emergency if his demands are not met. The Republican president has vowed to reject any budget unless Congress includes $5.7bn (Â£4.3bn) to fund his signature campaign pledge. The Democratic Party, which controls the House of Representatives, has flatly refused. US shutdown: Reasons why Trump blinked Trump official mocked over shutdown remark US flight delays amid federal shutdown In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said negotiations between Democrats and Republicans would start immediately but would not be easy because both sides were ""very dug in"". In recent weeks Mr Trump has taken a hard line against thousands of migrants arriving at the US southern border. ""The case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border and through dialogue. We will build the Wall!"" he tweeted. On Friday, the Senate and House unanimously passed a bill to temporarily end the shutdown, after which President Trump signed the bill into law. Following the votes in Congress Mr Trump tweeted that his decision was not a concession but was ""taking care of the millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown"". Unpaid federal workers used food banks and emergency kitchens to survive the shutdown Most US media saw President Trump's move as yielding to political pressure after the unprecedented 35-day shutdown. 'A stinging defeat': US media on shutdown Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump said federal workers affected by the political standoff, whom he called ""incredible patriots"", would receive full back-pay. Mr Trump also said he would not yet resort to ""a very powerful alternative"" - an apparent reference to declaring a national emergency. This video can not be played We have reached a deal - Trump Analysts say this could divert military funding towards building the border wall but would provoke constitutional uproar and legal challenges. On Friday, about 800,000 civil servants missed another payday amid the five-week closure of about a quarter of the federal government. Earlier, hundreds of flights were grounded or delayed at US airports because of unpaid air traffic controllers calling in sick. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) halted arrivals for about an hour at New York's LaGuardia Airport. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? Flights were also delayed at Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport because of staff shortages, the FAA said. Meanwhile, thousands of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees failed to show up after they were ordered to return to work unpaid,the Washington Post reported,external. The Trump administration recalled 26,000 IRS workers this week to handle the looming tax filing season. Trump's border wall - in seven charts How the US shutdown is biting But about 14,000 of them did not come back as of Tuesday, IRS officials told members of Congress. In a video message to agents on Friday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said: ""I'm about as angry as I've been in a long, long time."" Of the shutdown's effects on his agency, he said: ""It's mind-boggling, it's short-sighted, and it's unfair."" His remarks came after an FBI report this week revealed its resources were at ""breaking point"".

"UK newspaper apologises to Melania TrumpThe paper says the US First Lady will get ""substantial damages"" over an article published last weekend.UK","A spokeswoman for Mrs Trump decried 'opportunists out to advance themselves' at her cost The Daily Telegraph has apologised ""unreservedly"" to Melania Trump and agreed to pay her ""substantial damages"" for an article it published last week. The paper said its Saturday Magazine cover story ""The Mystery of Melania"" contained a number of false statements. These included claims the US first lady was struggling in her modelling career before she met her husband and that she cried on election night, it said. A spokeswoman for Mrs Trump said she would not ignore lies told about her. The paper accepted the statements should not have been published and said it would also pay Mrs Trump's legal costs. Melania: I'm world's most bullied person Behind the scenes in the first lady's White House In an apology,externalprinted on Saturday, the paper accepted Mrs Trump was ""a successful professional model in her own right before she met her husband and obtained her own modelling work without his assistance"". It said the article also wrongly claimed that Mrs Trump's mother, father and sister relocated to New York in 2005 to live in buildings owned by Donald Trump. The paper added that Mrs Trump's father was not ""a fearsome presence"" and ""did not control the family"", as alleged in the article. It also accepted that Mrs Trump did not leave her design and architecture course at university for reasons relating to the completion of an exam but because she wanted to pursue a successful career as a professional model. A spokeswoman for the First Lady said she often encountered ""opportunists out to advance themselves by disparaging her name and image"". The spokeswoman continued: ""She will not sit by as people and media outlets make up lies and false assertions in a race for ratings or to sell tabloid headlines.""

The one thing that makes you 30 times more likely to laugh,"US President Donald Trump wasgreeted with laughterin September when he told the UN that he had accomplished more than ""almost any administration"" in his country's history. Mr Trump admitted that he ""didn't expect"" that reaction  - but that it was ""just fine"". It was one example of the many reasons people laugh - and most of them are not because somebody is being particularly funny. Laughter is primarily a form of bonding; we are30 times more likely to laugh,externalif we are with others than if we are alone. It is an ancient, universal reaction that is not even limited to humans; it has been documented in many animal species, including apes and even rats. When rats play with each other or are tickled, they emit a distinct chirping sound whichscientists have linked to laughter.,externalIt is used as a signal that they are only play-fighting rather than displaying aggression. Apes also laugh, scientists say If rats display this kind of behaviour, it is not too surprising that humans employ laughter in a complex and nuanced way. We use laughter to make and maintain social bonds. It is an outward display that we understand each other, and also functions to exclude others who are outside our group. This social and emotional control makes laughter incredibly powerful, so it is unsurprising to find that it is constantly exploited by people in both political and personal ways. Laughter is a spontaneous non-verbal vocal expression, like a scream or a sob. The noise we make when we laugh is very similar to the play grunts that apes make. Unlike speech, producing this sound involves almost no movement of the tongue, jaw or lips. It is closer to the sound that other mammals make than human speech. Although scientists still do not know exactly why we make this sound, it may be because it is one of the simplest way of making a sound with our voices - we are just squeezing air out in bursts. While our use of laughter develops over time, it is an inherent action; blind and deaf babies will laugh when they are tickled. Comedians are given licence to earn our laughter, but there are many others who have used laughter, or tried to use it, to their own ends. Russian officials have been accused ofusing mockery to deflect blame and belittle challengers,most recently overthe 2018 Novichok poisoning  in Salisbury. But humour does not have to be divisive to be powerful. US President Bill Clinton famouslychanged an ill-tempered press statement by Russia's Boris Yeltsin into a hilarious event,,externalsimply by behaving as if Mr Yeltsin was being intentionally witty, and laughing helplessly. However, Mr Clinton took care to not look like he was laughing at him, to suggest they were both in on the joke. Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin at the press conference Other public figures appear to carefully cultivate a ""funny"" image, where they often appear the butt of the joke. For example, MP Boris Johnson was arguably first perceived as funny on satirical TV quiz showHave I Got News For You,external. Mr Johnson kept up this light-hearted, funny persona over the following couple of decades, helping him to bat away critical comments with jokes and bluster. Whether it was getting stuck on a zip wire,or joking about never becoming prime minister, difficult questions could be disarmed, and his personal charm seemed enhanced, by the sounds of laughter. Laughter is also an important part of our everyday lives. For example, I walked slap bang into another woman when I was crossing the road the other day. We both laughed, but not because it was funny. We were laughing to show that we were both OK and not hurt or trying to hurt each other, or trying to steal one another's mobile phones. This interaction was successful because it relies on us both understanding and using laughter in the same way. Observational studies indicate that most laughter actually stems from statements and comments,,externalrather than jokes. The person who has just spoken laughs the most frequently, suggesting laughter is often not only a reaction to something someone else has said. This type of ""bonding"" laughter is finessed over time through social interaction. One of my lab's current studies indicates that our understanding of social laughter develops over our early adult life, and that it is not until we are in our 30s that we become fully adept at using it. It is also dependent on a desire to find affiliation; research suggests that teenage boys at risk of psychopathyfind laughter much less contagious than their peers.,external More stories like this The emotions that make a film a hit... or a miss The ordinary people making the world more right-wing The strange normality of life in a breakaway state Why the world is becoming more allergic Boris Johnson became stuck on a zip wire in Victoria Park Another key use of laughter is to help cope with stressful situations. Couples who discuss an area of disagreement in their relationship with positive expressions like laughter immediately become less stressed,research suggests,external. They are also happier in their relationships and stay together for longer. However, this only works if both members of the couple share the joke. For example, if one person is laughing and saying ""oh yes, I do buy too many books"" and the other person says, unsmilingly, ""it's a massive problem and I wish you would sort it out"", then no-one feels better. Laughter works, not because it is a kind of magic dust that makes people happier, but because it indicates you are comfortable enough to use it as a tool to negotiate a better mood, together. Because the bottom line - for all almost all laughter - is that people laugh when they are with people they like, but also when they feel physically safe. When, where and who you laugh with is telling you something very important about your emotional world. Laughter can be a seriously important part of how we can help ourselves cope with difficult situations.

Canadian PM sacks envoy to China,"Justin Trudeau (R) appointed John McCallum ambassador to China in 2017 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has fired Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum. It follows controversial comments Mr McCallum made about an extradition case involving a senior executive from the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Mr Trudeau said in a statement he had asked John McCallum to step down, but did not offer a reason. The detention of Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US, angered China and soured Canada's relations with Beijing. Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, is accused by the US of evading sanctions on Iran. Both she and Huawei deny those allegations. Canada 'alone' in China and Huawei dispute No politics behind Huawei arrest - Trudeau Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage In a statement, the Canadian prime minister said: ""Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China."" The veteran diplomat, Mr Trudeau added, had served Canadians honourably and with distinction with many positions in cabinet. He also thanked the diplomat and his family for their service. Mr McCallum caused controversy on Tuesday when he publicly argued that the US extradition request for Ms Meng was seriously flawed. The next day he issued a statement saying that he ""misspoke"" and regretted that his comments had created ""confusion"". But on Friday he was quoted as saying it would be ""great for Canada"" if the US dropped the request. Mr McCallum was appointed Canada's ambassador to China in 2017, stepping down as the immigration minister. Canadian media say he was eager to take over the posting because of his strong personal connection to China. Mr McCallum's wife is ethnically Chinese, and he had a large Chinese-Canadian population in his former constituency in Ontario. Mr McCallum also served as Canada's defence minister in 2002-03. She was arrested on 1 December in Canada's western city of Vancouver at the request of the US. She was later granted a C$10m (Â£5.7m; $7.6m) bail by a local court. But she is under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Meng Wanzhou denies all the allegations against her Earlier this month, US officials confirmed they planned to pursue the extradition of Ms Wanzhou. Washington has 60 days to file a formal demand for extradition, a deadline that will be reached 30 January. US to 'move ahead with Huawei executive extradition' The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Why Huawei matters in five charts China's foreign ministry has urged US officials to withdraw the arrest order and refrain from moving ahead with the extradition request. Ms Meng's case has led to rising diplomatic tensions between Canada and China. Canadian nationals Michael Spavor (left) and Michael Kovrig have been put under ""compulsory measures"" Earlier this month,a Canadian man was sentenced to death in Chinaafter a court said a jail term of 15 years was too lenient. Two other Canadians - businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrg - were arrested following the detention of Ms Meng.

Which MPs have had Brexit talks in Westminster?,"Former Brexit Secretary David Davis was among those who went to the Cabinet Office for talks Prime Minister Theresa May has been holding talks with MPs in the aftermath of the heavy defeat of her Brexit deal in the Commons - and following a slim victory in a no-confidence vote. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay arealso holding talks with senior opposition politicians. Meetings are being held in No 10 Downing Street and 70 Whitehall, the Cabinet Office. First up was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who all had talks with the prime minister on Wednesday night. Mr Blackford said that the extension of Article 50 - the two-year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of another EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Ms Saville Roberts said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no-deal Brexit off the table and a people's vote on our European future"". Sir Vince said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". The preferred choice of his party is another referendum. Labour leader and leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""quite happy"" to talk with Mrs May but she had to rule out a no-deal Brexit first. Members of the Tories' influential European Research Group (ERG) had a morning meeting with the prime minister Tory colleagues and Brexiteers Owen Paterson, Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, Mark Francois and Steve Baker were among the first politicians spotted in Whitehall on Thursday morning, as well as Conservative MP and former Northern Irish Secretary Theresa Villiers. They are all members of the Tories' influential European Research Group (ERG).

Former Conservative cabinet minister Mr Paterson described the meeting as ""thoroughly worthwhile"", ""very constructive"" and a ""good exchange"". On the subject of taking a no-deal Brexit off the table, he said:  ""You will lose all the pressure on the EU if we give up no-deal, WTO (World Trade Organization) terms, and you give up the date. And we just drift on month after month and this whole saga continues."" Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, and Cheryl Gillan, MP for Chesham and Amersham and a vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, were also seen arriving at the Cabinet Office. They were later photographed leaving Downing Street with other members of the committee, after a meeting with the prime minister. Members of the 1922 Committee had a meeting with the prime minister in Downing Street 09:00 GMT- After her meeting with the prime minister, Caroline Lucas, the Green Party's only MP, said Mrs May had refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit and resisted the option of extending Article 50. ""I repeatedly urged her again and again to take no-deal off the table because I think it completely skews the talks - because you know that cliff edge is there,"" she said. Caroline Lucas, the Green Party's only MP, said Mrs May had refused to rule out a no-deal 10:40- DUP leader Arlene Foster and DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds arrived for their meeting. The prime minister relies on their party's support to prop up her government. Speaking in Downing Street following their meeting with Mrs May, Ms Foster said the prime minister had been in ""listening mode"" and there had been optimism that a Brexit deal could still be reached. She said she had made a ""clear ask"" in relation to the Irish backstop, urging Mrs May to address it ""in a satisfactory way"". The DUP's Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds gave a statement outside Downing Street Tom Brake, the Lib Dem's Brexit spokesman, Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem's chief whip, and deputy Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson were all spotted arriving to the Cabinet Office.

""If the government were to come out on Monday with that position [of another referendum] then the gridlock, the impasse, the logjam would be broken, and we could move forward,"" Mr Price said. ""We talked in detail about the practicalities of how we could make it [another referendum] happen."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price spoke to journalists after his meeting 11:30- Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Select Committee, arrived at the Cabinet Office. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan arrived for talks on Thursday morning After 12:00- Tory MPs Damian Green and Andrew Mitchell spoke to journalists outside the Cabinet Office after their meeting. ""No two members of Parliament think precisely the same way but now we've got to make progress,"" Mr Mitchell said. ""It's in the national interest and it's the right thing for the prime minister to do, to corral people together and make Parliament focus on what the answer to all of this is and what we agree about, not what we disagree about."" Mr Green, a close ally of Mrs May, criticised Mr Corbyn's decision not to take part in the talks, saying the move was ""completely absurd"". Tory MP Damian Green, a close ally of Mrs May, criticised Mr Corbyn's decision not to take part in the talks John Mann, a Leave-supporting Labour MP and long-term critic of Mr Corbyn, was spotted coming out of the Cabinet Office. 13:05- Tory MPs George Freeman and James Cartlidge arrived at the Cabinet Office. 13:57- Labour MPs Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, and Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit Select Committee, arrived at the Cabinet Office. After meeting Mr Lidington, Mr Benn said the government had to rule out a no-deal Brexit as a first step and secondly the prime minister had to change her ""red lines"". Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn arrive at the Cabinet Office Ms Cooper said: ""The most important thing now is that the government actually listens and it doesn't just think that a defeat that was that huge can simply be dismissed."" They said they had attended the meeting in their capacity as chairs of cross-parliamentary committees, after Mr Corbyn barred Labour MPs from taking part in the talks while a no-deal Brexit remains an option. 14:07- Tory MPs Peter Bone and Tom Pursglove arrived at the Cabinet Office.

Philippines church bomb attack kills 19,"This video can not be played Soldiers were deployed to the area after the explosions Two bombs at a Roman Catholic cathedral in southern Philippines have killed 20 people and injured dozens more, local officials say. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack on Jolo island, where jihadist groups are active. The first blast happened as Sunday Mass was being celebrated. A second device exploded outside as soldiers responded. The attack came days after a majority-Muslim area in the region voted for greater autonomy in a referendum. A statement from IS said the attack was carried out by ""two knights of martyrdom"" against a ""crusader temple"". Jolo has long been a base for militants, including those of the Abu Sayyaf group. Several of its factions have declared allegiance to IS. Who are the Abu Sayyaf group? Philippines country profile The local officials say the first blast happened at 08:45 local time (00:45 GMT) inside the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which has been hit by bombs in the past. The second explosion was shortly afterwards on the doorstep of the church. Police initially put the death toll at 27 but later lowered it to 20, saying there was double counting in earlier official reports. Most of the victims are civilians. The bomb attack devastated the church in Jolo Images posted on social media showed the main road leading to the church sealed off by soldiers in armoured personnel carriers. Some of the wounded were evacuated by air to the nearby city of Zamboanga. Calling the attack a ""dastardly act"", Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana urged the local population to work with the authorities to ""deny terrorism any victory"". ""We will use the full force of the law to bring to justice the perpetrators behind this incident."" The army has been deployed to the area after the bomb blasts In last week's referendum, voters approved the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in majority-Muslim areas of southern Philippines. But voters in Sulu province, where Jolo is located, rejected it. The referendum was the result of a peace deal between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The authorities have previously expressed hopes that the vote could be a political solution to try to end decades of fighting between Islamist separatists and the Philippine army in the predominantly Catholic country. Mindanao vote could end decades of violence More than 120,000 people have died in the violence.

A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments,"This video can not be played Chris Mason recaps what has happened to the Brexit deal and explains the next key vote options MPs have voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. Commons Speaker John Bercow selected seven amendments to be debated and voted on. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Here are the amendments, and the results, in the order in which they took place. Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction. Theresa May has already said she will return to Brussels to reopen negotiations on legally-binding alternatives to the ""backstop"".

Queen shows off 'silky Pointless skills',"The Queen visits the Sandringham branch of the WI each year during her winter stay at the nearby Royal estate The Queen has joined members of her local Women's Institute (WI) in a live version of TV quiz show Pointless hosted by Alexander Armstrong. Her Majesty is said to be an avid viewer of the teatime favourite, in which players compete to find the least obvious answers to questions. Armstrong, the show's presenter, described the Queen as ""our most distinguished viewer"". Her team was crowned winner of the contest at the Sandringham WI. She visits the group every year as part of her winter stay at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. West Newton Village Hall was divided into two teams for the live game - one headed by the Queen and the other by Yvonne Browne, vice-president of the WI group. Alexander Armstrong said meeting the Queen was ""a dream come true"" Five matches took place, with the royal's team winning three. Armstrong - who presented Sandringham WI with a trophy - has previously claimed a ""Palace insider"" told him the monarch was a fan of the programme. He said the Queen gave some answers herself and had ""some deft, silky Pointless skills"". ""I think Her Majesty and the team can be very pleased with themselves tonight and go back covered in glory,"" he said. ""I think they can look back over the match and feel rightly proud of what they achieved."" Speaking before the event, Armstrong said meeting the Queen would be ""a dream come true"". He added: ""I think everyone I've ever spoken to has said they've had a dream where they had tea with the Queen - I'm going to get to do that."" The monarch was all smiles as she arrived at the WI meeting The Queen arrived for the event in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover. She posed for a group photograph, unveiled the branch's centenary plaque and was given a celebratory cake. During her speech to the event, the Queen told her fellow members: ""Of course, every generation faces fresh challenges and opportunities. ""As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture."" Ms Browne said it had been ""a really lovely afternoon"". ""The Queen very graciously said a few words about the fact it was our centenary and she hoped that the fun and friendship would continue into the next century,"" she said.
