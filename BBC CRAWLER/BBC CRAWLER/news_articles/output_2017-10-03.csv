Catalonia independence 'in matter of days',"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont spoke to the BBC on Tuesday evening Catalonia will declare independence from Spain in a matter of days, the leader of the autonomous region has told the BBC. In his first interview since a disputed vote on Sunday, Carles Puigdemont said his government would ""act at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". Meanwhile, Spain's King Felipe VI said the vote's organisers had put themselves ""outside the law"". He said the situation in Spain was ""extremely serious"", calling for unity. Tensions between Spain and the north-eastern Catalonia region continue to mount, days after the vote was marred by violence involving national police. The Spanish High Court said it had begun an investigation into key Catalan figures on Wednesday on suspicion of sedition - inciting rebellion against the state - including the head of Catalonia's regional police. Josep Lluis Trapero, who leads the Mossos d'Esquadra force, is suspected of failing to control a demonstration during a police raid on Catalan government offices before the vote. Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? In his BBC interview, Carles Puigdemont said his government would ""act at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". He also revealed there was currently no contact between the government in Madrid and his devolved administration. When asked what he would do if the Spanish government were to intervene and take control of Catalonia's government, Mr Puigdemont said it would be ""an error which changes everything"". Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the government in Madrid is permitted to impose direct rule on an autonomous regions. Groups in the Catalan parliament have agreed that parliament should meet in full assembly on Monday. Mr Puigdemont could use that occasion to make a unilateral declaration of independence. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold He was due to make a statement at 21:00 (19:00GMT) on Wednesday. The Spanish government has vowed to resist any declaration of independence, with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy saying the vote made a ""mockery"" of democracy. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau has called on both sides to talk. ""Neither a declaration of independence nor article 155. More than ever we need dialogue and bridges,""she tweeted,external. The European parliament was due to debate the crisis on Wednesday afternoon. Many Catalans have been angered by the European Commission's statement on Monday that events in Catalonia were an internal issue for Spain. This video can not be played King Felipe VI: ""Catalan society is fractured"" In his televised address, King Felipe said the Catalan leaders who organised the referendum showed their ""disrespect to the powers of the state"". ""They have broken the democratic principles of the rule of law,"" he said. But many Catalans were more concerned about what the king did not say, reports the BBC's Patrick Jackson, who watched the address in a bar in Barcelona city centre. ""There were no words about the scenes of police beating voters on Sunday, no urgent appeal for dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments, no acknowledgment of the real hunger here for independence or at least a proper, legal referendum, not even a word or two of Catalan,"" he says. This video can not be played Clare and Kike react to the Spanish king's address It was a missed opportunity to push the two sides towards dialogue, said one customer in the bar. Q&A: Do Catalans really want independence? Why Catalan emotions are running high How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote Nearly 900 people were hurt as police violently tried to enforce a Spanish court order suspending the vote, which the government had declared illegal. This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Thirty-three police officers were also injured, local medical officials said. Shocked by what they had seen, hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined street protests on Tuesday. A general strike was also called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"" seen during the ballot. More than 2.2 million people voted on Sunday, according to the Catalan government. Officials put the vote in support of independence at nearly 90%, but official results have not yet been released. There are several reports of gaping irregularities, partly attributed to a system which permitted voters to cast their ballots anywhere in a bid to get around the police measures to stop the vote. Spanish media carried reports of some Catalan areas counting far more votes than residents. Catalan officials said the turnout was 42%, potentially weakening the position of Mr Puigdemont.

Anger over Johnson Libya 'bodies' comment,"Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said Libyan city Sirte could be the new Dubai, adding, ""all they have to do is clear the dead bodies away"". His comments at a Conservative fringe meeting sparked anger, with a number of Tory MPs calling for his sacking and Labour labelling him ""crass and cruel"". Mr Johnson claimed his critics had ""no knowledge nor understanding of Libya"". A Downing Street source said it was not an ""appropriate choice of words"" but the PM regarded the matter as closed.

The host of the conference fringe event, Legatum Institute chief executive Baroness Stroud, stepped in to say ""next question"", as the foreign secretary continued to speak.

""If these words came from the business people themselves, it would be considered offensive enough, but for them to come from the foreign secretary is simply a disgrace. ""There comes a time when the buffoonery needs to stop, because if Boris Johnson thinks the bodies of those brave government soldiers and innocent civilians killed in Sirte are a suitable subject for throwaway humour, he does not belong in the office of foreign secretary.""

Man admits 'frenzied' mum and son murder,"Tracey Wilkinson died at the family home in Stourbridge and her teenage son Pierce died in hospital A ""manipulative"" homeless man who turned on a family who befriended him has admitted the ""frenzied"" murder of the mother and her 13-year-old son. Tracey and Pierce Wilkinson were stabbed to death at their home in Stourbridge, West Midlands in March. The boy's father, Peter, was seriously injured in the attack but survived. Aaron Barley, 24, of no fixed address, admitted the killings at Birmingham Crown Court on what would have been the first day of his trial. He previously admitted the attempted murder of Mr Wilkinson. 'I thought my whole family would die' The family first met Barley after Mrs Wilkinson decided ""off-the-cuff"" to help him when she saw him trying to keep warm in a cardboard box while she was out shopping. She helped him find accommodation and arranged daily meals for him, while her husband went on to employ him as a labourer in April last year. He left the company on ""amicable terms"" last September after he began to take drugs. Aaron Barley admitted the two murders on what would have been the first day of his trial Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC told the court Mr Wilkinson was ""naturally intent"" on trying to continue to support Barley and his work colleagues ""spent a huge amount of time and effort trying to find ways to support the defendant"". But despite this he went on to attack the family just months later. Mr Khalil said Barley killed Mrs Wilkinson in her bed and attacked Pierce in his room while Mr Wilkinson was out walking the dog on the morning of 30 March. He had hidden in the garden shed overnight after failing to gain entry to the home he once shared with the family. CCTV played to the court showed him emerging from the shed with a hammer as Mr Wilkinson returned home. Brandishing a knife over his head, he shouted ""Die you bastard"" as he stabbed Mr Wilkinson a total of six times - twice in the face, twice in the abdomen and twice in the back, the court heard. Barley, described as a ""compulsive liar and manipulator"" with 21 previous convictions, wore a balaclava and was clad entirely in black, even covering his yellow trainers in black socks. Mr Khalil said Mr Wilkinson described the defendant as ""acting like a ninja"". ""He realised immediately who his attacker was"", he said. This video can not be played Murderer Aaron Barley crept through his victims' garden ""The defendant was wielding a knife, stabbing and slashing at Peter in a frenzied attack with such aggression that this alone demonstrated an obvious intention to kill him."" The company director managed to contact emergency services, and was found in the garden of the family home with facial lacerations and deep stab wounds. Barley fled the scene in the family's Land Rover and was pursued by police before he crashed in a nearby road and was arrested. Mrs Wilkinson, 50, was pronounced dead at the scene, while Pierce died after being taken to hospital. Mr Wilkinson, 47, spent 11 days in hospital recovering from his wounds. Before the killings, Barley was reported to police after his former foster carer became concerned about messages posted on Facebook, the court was told. Among the posts was a threat from him towards his family and the possibility of a ""killing spree"". Less than a week before the stabbings, the court heard, the Wilkinsons cancelled a mobile phone contract they had paid for Barley. Pierce Wilkinson (left) was killed in the attack while his father Peter was seriously injured. Pierce's sister Lydia was at university at the time The couple's daughter Lydia, 19, was away at Bristol University at the time. She said she was warned to expect the worst and when she saw her father hooked up to ""countless machines"" she doubted he would survive. When he did eventually regain consciousness, Mr Wilkinson did not know his wife was dead and was unaware his daughter had been to the mortuary to identify her mother and brother. Both the family and police said they did not know what Barley's motive was. Mr Wilkinson said he had shared a ""curry and a couple of bottles of beer"" with Barley about a month before the attack. ""The next time I saw him he was sticking a knife into my shoulder,"" he said. He said Barley had joined the family on Christmas Day last year and he wrote a card to his wife that said 'To the mother that I never had'. ""My wife was very caring and he treated her a bit like a second mother,"" he added. He suggested that Barley, whose parents died when he was young, knew his life was ""going bad ways"" and wanted to take it out on the people that had ""cared and looked after him"". This video can not be played Lydia Wilkinson thought all her family was dead Det Supt Tom Chisholm said Barley has remained uncooperative while in custody and given officers no reason for the ""horrific attack"". Describing the ""random"" murders as the most shocking he had dealt with, the veteran detective added: ""There is usually a build-up or a motive or a grudge of something, but this one is just very random."" The court also heard that psychiatric reports found no evidence of diminished responsibility. Barley fled from the scene in the family's 4x4 Emergency services were called to Greyhound Lane, Norton on 30 March Mr Wilkinson and Lydia have now moved back into the family home and said they have been ""astounded"" by the support they have received. Ms Wilkinson described her mother as a ""stunning"" woman with a ""beautiful personality"". ""To have my best friend taken from me in life at such a young age is a hardship I would never wish on anyone,"" she said. ""Because it has to be the most awful experience. Especially when something happensâ¦ I can't ring her up any more."" She said her brother was ""handsome, funny, clever"" and made friends with everybody around him. ""My mum and brother were just the iconic mother/son relationship,"" she said. Barley will be sentenced on Wednesday. CCTV footage of family's killer.

The headache that changed my life,"David Baldwin developed CSF leak more than four years ago Four years ago David Baldwin woke up with a crippling headache that has completely changed his life. David, from Ross-shire, can no longer sit up or walk without experiencing excruciating pain and he must avoid laughing or sneezing because they are a risk to his health. The 37-year-old is one of about 3,250 people a year in the UK who develop a cerebrospinal fluid leak (CSF leak). The condition occurs when fluid leaks from the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord or brain, leaving the brain less supported. It can be caused by trauma or surgery, such as receiving an epidural during childbirth, and its effects can be devastating. George Clooney said that when he suffered an injury to his spine on the set of his 2005 drama, Syriana, the resulting CSF leak led him to consider suicide. However, despite his story, the condition remains largely unrecognised by most frontline medical staff. David told BBC Radio Scotland'sKaye Adams programme: ""For me it pretty much came out of the blue. ""I used to do white-water kayaking. I was kayaking one evening and I just didn't feel well. ""I had a shortness of breath and I had heart palpitations and I felt a little bit dizzy, but I couldn't really put my finger on it. ""I went home and went to sleep and didn't really think too much about it."" David said that the next morning he had a terrible pain in head. ""It wasn't your normal sort of headache that you could take a paracetamol and forget about it,"" he said. ""It was a very prominent headache and it kept getting worse. ""As I was getting ready to go to work this headache was ramping up and by the end of the day I couldn't even stand. ""I couldn't walk between the bedroom and the bathroom. I had to crawl, it was that extreme."" Doctors think David's leak is somewhere in his upper spine As the days passed, David, who is 37, started to develop other symptoms. His vision started to go blurry, his hearing began to go, he had tinnitus constantly and his concentration and memory were also affected. He said: ""One of the very odd symptoms that people with CSF leak get is this odd feeling that your brain is being pulled down your spine. ""It's a very hard symptom to express to somebody that hasn't felt it. ""It's a kind of unrelenting pressure, as if there is bricks on your head, pushing your brain down."" Doctors have since tried unsuccessfully to treat David's CSF leak, which is thought to be somewhere on his upper spine. He has also been treated in Los Angeles by Dr Wouter Schievink, the same surgeon that successfully treated George Clooney's condition. However, David is yet to resume his former life and says since developing CSF leak, he has lost his job and found that the only way he can get relief is by lying down. ""When you're lying down, you don't have [the symptoms] or they're much reduced,"" he said. ""But as soon as you sit up or stand up, they come back with a vengeance. ""It is that element that makes it such a disabling condition and you just can't live your life like that."" David said that was one of the cruellest elements of CSF leak. He said: ""You can feel like you can get up and go to work, you can live your life. ""But as soon as you sit up, it's like an egg timer, it's only a matter of time before these horrific symptoms come back and force you back to bed again. ""It's a very tough one to live with. It's very disabling for many people and for most it's certainly very life-changing."" David was treated by Dr Wouter Schievink, who also treated George Clooney In the past two and a half years, David has left home no more than 10 or 15 times and most of that has been on a stretcher or in an ambulance to go for treatment or scans. After first developing his life-changing headache, it took three months for David to be diagnosed. However, he was one of the lucky ones. On average Scots with CSF leak face a 13-month wait before they know what is wrong with them. James Walkden, a neurosurgeon who is now helping to treat David, said there was much to be done to educate medical staff on CSF leak. He said: ""I have to say the teaching about this condition at medical school and even at post-graduate is zero. ""It's really only a small sub specialist area of neurosurgery or neurology that even recognises this condition and that's why unfortunately there's often multiple visits to medical professionals, multiple mis-diagnosis before they reach somebody who does understand this condition. ""But by then months have turned into years and your success rate of the investigations and the treatment diminishes as time goes on. ""So, it's not that we're stumped, it's unfortunately recognition of this condition at an early stage and getting the person to the right department with the right expertise."" More information about the condition is available at theCSF Leak Association,external.

"Las Vegas killer 'sick, demented' - Trump","This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes President Donald Trump has described the gunman who killed 59 people and injured 527 in Las Vegas on Sunday as  ""a sick man, a demented man"". Speaking at the White House, he said he would look at gun laws ""as times goes by"" but did not elaborate. Police are still trying to find out why Stephen Paddock, 64, opened fire on an open-air concert from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Hotel. Las Vegas police say there was a high degree of premeditation. In his latest briefing Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said: ""I'm pretty sure he evaluated everything he did in his actions."" Mr Lombardo also revealed that Paddock had set up cameras inside and outside his hotel suite, including one on a service cart, to monitor the police. The sheriff added that the firing had continued for approximately nine minutes. Police still consider the woman thought to have been his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, ""a person of interest"", he said. She is in the Philippines. ""We are in conversation,"" Sheriff Lombardo said. Police found 23 guns in Paddock's hotel room and firearms and explosives at his home. Photos from the hotel room of guns used in the attack have been obtained byBoston 25 News,external. Guns seen on the hotel room floor As yet, no clear reason for the killing has emerged and investigators have found no link to international terrorism. Some investigators have suggested Paddock had a history of mental illness, but this has not been confirmed. Paddock, who appears to have killed himself before police stormed his hotel room, had no criminal record and was not known to police. Speaking to reporters as he was about to board the presidential helicopter, Mr Trump said Paddock was ""a sick man, a demented man. Lot of problems, I guess, and we're looking into him very, very seriously"". When asked, Mr Trump declined to call the attack domestic terrorism. On the issue of gun control, the president said: ""We'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by."" Mr Trump, whose position on gun control has changed over the years, gave no further detail. This video can not be played How countries around the world introduced restrictions following mass shootings How Trump turned against gun control Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Las Vegas shooting - what we know By James Cook, BBC, Las Vegas The bereaved are beginning to tell their stories. They speak of lives wasted, families broken, futures stolen. This is a city in pain but it is also a city of heroes, bursting with tales of bravery and resourcefulness in saving lives. There are the police officers who risked death on the 32nd floor to stop the shooting. There are the music fans who shielded friends and loved ones from bullets, who comforted dying strangers and who commandeered trucks to get the wounded to hospital. There are the surgeons who continue to labour in the operating theatres, saving lives, barely aware if it's day or night. And there are the citizens of Las Vegas proving the selfish, greedy stereotype of their city wrong â queuing from before dawn to give blood, handing out cups of coffee and bagels for free, opening their doors to those most in need. Above all else though there is grief. It is both personal and extensive. The scale of the suffering inflicted here is difficult to comprehend and even harder to bear. Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas More on the victims 'Pandemonium' on the Strip Paddock, a former accountant with a big gambling habit, lived in a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite, north-east of Las Vegas. He reportedly shared his house there with Danley. Initially police had said she was in Japan rather than the Philippines and discounted her involvement. Nineteen firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition with electronic devices were found at the property. Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Officers also found ammonium nitrate in Paddock's car - the chemical compound used in fertilisers can be used to make bombs such as that used in the 1995 Oklahoma City attack. David Famiglietti of the New Frontier Armory told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in North Las Vegas in the spring of this year, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. The fast shooting rate audible in recordings of Sunday night's attack indicates that Paddock may have modified his guns with legal accessories to make them fire at speeds approaching those of automatic weapons. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used Despite the large cache of weapons found in the killer's home, his brother, Eric, is struggling to accept that he acted in this way. He said he was ""in shock, horrified, completely dumbfounded"". So-called Islamic State claimed on Monday to be behind the attack, saying Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. The FBI said it had found ""no connection to an international terrorist organisation"". Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer? The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. According to police, Paddock had booked into the hotel four days earlier, on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room Aside from the 23 guns found in the two-room hotel suite, Sheriff Lombardo said there were 10 suitcases. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out, starting at 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of shots were fired. Concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. The fake photos shared after tragedies What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting It is thought he moved between two windows in his suite as he carried out the attack. A specialised Swat police team later stormed the suite to find Paddock shot dead. Minutes before, a hotel security guard was injured when Paddock fired through the door.

Instagram baby photo scammer banned,"Kati Ringer (face obscured) leaves Norwich Magistrates' Court where she appeared for sentencing A woman who stole photos of babies from Instagram and claimed they were sick or dead in a bid to get money has been banned from social media. Kati Ringer, 21, claimed the pictures, copied from accounts belonging to two unsuspecting mums, were her own. When challenged by her victims, Ringer became abusive and threatening, Norwich Magistrates' Court heard. Ringer, of Soleme Road, Norwich, admitted two malicious communications offences. Ringer was caught after police traced her IP address to a computer at her mother's house. She was sentenced to a two-year criminal behaviour order which bans her from using any social media accounts, passing any other person's photo off as her own or asking any third party for a donation unless as a legitimate volunteer for a registered charity. Ringer was also handed a jail term of 30 weeks, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay Â£225 costs. Kati Ringer was sentenced to a two-year criminal behaviour order which bans her from using any social media accounts Jane Walker, prosecuting, said Ringer had targeted two women, copying photos of their babies from their Instagram accounts and reposting them on her own ""saying they were her child, the child had died and trying to get money"". She said when challenged by the first victim, Ringer ""became threatening towards her and made threats to rape and harm the child"". The court heard Ringer sent the mother a ""laughing face"" emoji on Instagram, then a further message saying ""I've already posted pictures saying she's dead, I've got Â£600 so far"". When the victim accused Ringer of being jealous, Ms Walker said, the defendant replied: ""Jealous of a disgusting little runt that should have been drowned at birth."" Ringer targeted the second victim by using images of her prematurely born daughter. ""The victim challenged the suspect and asked she stop using the images,"" said Ms Walker. ""It was then that she said she would find out where the victim lived and kidnap and rape her daughter. ""She was using the picture of the victim's baby reporting to people that the baby was premature, that she was seriously ill, struggling to pay for her treatment and funeral."" Ian Fisher, mitigating, said Ringer pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and a number of events in her life had contributed to her ""lacking any ability to empathise"". He said of the offences: ""They are made possible by the advent of quite complex social media forms on the internet, and the defendant set about something that no normal, decent human being would do.""

Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist?,"Stephen Paddock has been identified by police as the man behind the deadliest shooting in modern US history As details emerge about the Las Vegas gunman who killed at least 58 people and injured more than 500 others, an online debate has begun about why Stephen Paddock has not been labelled a terrorist. Instead the 64-year-old who opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival on Sunday evening has been described by news outlets as a ""lone wolf"", a ""granddad"", a ""gambler"", and a ""former accountant"", but not a terrorist. We do not know yet what motivated Paddockto carry out the deadly attack. There has been no link found to international terrorism and no confirmation of mental illness. The fake photos shared after tragedies 'We helped three gunshot victims' Yet on social media, many have been pointing out that if Paddock had been a Muslim, the term ""terrorist"" would have been used almost immediately to describe him, as a link to Islamist terrorism would be assumed even without evidence. Celebrities, TV personalities and academics have all been discussing why this hasn't happened in this case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

According toNevada state law,external, an ""act of terrorism"" is described as follows: ""Any act that involves the use of violence intended to cause great bodily harm or death to the general population."" At federal level, the US defines ""domestic terrorism"" as activities that meet three criteria - ""dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law"", those that are intended to intimidate or coerce civilians or governments, and which occur primarily within the US. The FBI, too, suggests there must be an intent to ""intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives"". This element seems to be key - is the perpetrator of violence not only attempting to cause mass harm but trying to influence government or further a particular ideology? What counts as terrorism in the US? Many on social mediashared an image,externalof a definition of Nevada state law and questioned why, despite the clear outline, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Joseph Lombardo said during a press conference about Paddock: ""We do not know what his belief system was at this time. Right now, we believe it is a sole actor, a lone-wolf-type actor."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Twitter the phrase ""lone wolf"" has been used more than 200,000 times since Monday's attack. The words ""terrorist attack"" have been used more than 170,000 times as people argued about why there seemed to be a clear disparity betweenhow white suspects and those of colour are described,external. On Facebook the discussion has also been escalating.Mursal in Indonesia said:,external""He's not considered an international terrorist? Maybe because his face is not Arabic!"" Muslim AmericanFacebook user Mahmoud ElAwadi,externalexpressed his sadness at hearing the news, but described how the attack would not affect white people in the way his family was affected by Islamist attacks. ""Every mass shooting means my wife's life is in danger because she chose to cover her hair, that my son will be attacked at school because his name is Mohamed, that my 4 year old daughter will be treated unfairly because she speaks Arabic, unless the terrorist is a white and Christian then suddenly he is a mentally sick person and everything is normal."" At the BBC there is clear guidance on the use of the words terrorist, or terrorism.BBC editorial guidance says: ""There is no agreed consensus on what constitutes a terrorist or terrorist act. The use of the word will frequently involve a value judgement. ""As such, we should not change the word 'terrorist' when quoting someone else, but we should avoid using it ourselves. ""This should not mean that we avoid conveying the reality and horror of a particular act; rather we should consider how our use of language will affect our reputation for objective journalism."" Despite an overwhelming majority of comments criticising officials and the media for not labelling Paddock a terrorist, there were some counter arguments and suggestions as to why.

Yahoo 2013 data breach hit 'all accounts',"Yahoo has said that all of its three billion user accounts were affected in a hacking attack dating back to 2013.

The stolen data did not include passwords in clear text, payment card or bank account data, it added. Previously the internet giant had said ""more than one billion"" of its accounts had been hit.

The company added that it was ""continuing to work closely with law enforcement"". New AOL-Yahoo company to be called Oath 'One billion' affected by Yahoo hack Verizon: Yahoo data breach may hit deal Yahoo's takeover by the huge US telecoms firm Verizon was completed on 13 June. The deal was first announced last year when the struggling company agreed to sell its main internet business to Verizon for $4.8bn. That figure was later cut to $4.5bn after Yahoo disclosed that it had been the victim, in 2013 and 2014, of two huge security breaches. Verizon has combined its AOL subsidiary and Yahoo into a new business called Oath.

'Stop fights and do your duty',"""The roaring lion"" is theheadline in the Daily Telegraph,external- referring to Boris Johnson's address to the Conservative conference which, it concludes, provided a ""dose of much needed optimism"". Peter Oborne in the Daily Mail agrees,external, calling it one of the best speeches of Mr Johnson's career and praising him for talking about Brexit ""with vim and gusto"". He also thinks he was ""loyal"" to Theresa May, adding this is not a quality with which the foreign secretary is usually associated. The Sun criticises Mr Johnson for being short on solutions,externalfor improving the lot of the young or the fed-up. ""What practical help will this roaring be to those paid less than they were in 2007,"" it asks.

Las Vegas killer 'had cameras in hotel',"This video can not be played Police officers repeatedly shout at bystanders to run for cover Stephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 58 people and injured more than 500 in Las Vegas on Sunday, set up a number of cameras in and around his hotel suite. Two cameras in the hallway and one in the peephole allowed him to see if ""law enforcement or security"" were approaching, police said. Officers are still trying to determine why Paddock, 64, opened fire on a concert from the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The killer's girlfriend has returned to the US from the Philippines. Police consider the woman, Marilou Danley, ""a person of interest"", and while she is not reported to be in custody they are ""in conversation"" with her. She was met by FBI officials on her arrival in Los Angeles. Marilou Danley had a turbulent relationship with Paddock, reports say Ms Danley had been in the Philippines,the Philippine immigration bureau spokeswoman told reporters, but left there on Tuesday to go back to the US. New details of their relationshiphave emerged in the Washington Post,,externalwhich quotes authorities as saying that Paddock transferred about $100,000 to the Philippines - which may have been for his girlfriend - just before he committed mass murder. The pair had a turbulent relationship,The Los Angeles Times reports,external, quoting witnesses as saying that Paddock often verbally abused Ms Danley - an Australian citizen who moved to the US 20 years ago - in public at a coffee shop in Mesquite, Nevada. Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas Who are the victims? 'Pandemonium' on the Strip Although the authorities are so far unable to explain why a 64-year-old gambler and retired accountant should want to carry out a mass shooting by hauling such a vast arsenal of weapons to the hotel, they do know there was a high degree of planning. The authorities in Las Vegas revised the death toll down from 59 on Tuesday evening, saying that one of the bodies was that of the gunman. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters: ""This individual was pre-meditated. Obviously pre-meditated, the fact that he had the type of weaponry and the amount of weaponry in that room. ""It was pre-planned extensively and I'm pretty sure he evaluated everything he did in his actions."" Undersheriff Kevin McMahill suggested the attack may have stopped when Paddock was disturbed, shooting a security guard. The shooting - the worst in modern US history - has sparked debate over US gun laws, but President Donald Trump has said the discussion over what, if anything, needs to be done was ""not for now"". This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes He earlier described Paddock as ""a sick man, a demented man"". But a senior US homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to news agency Reuters, said there was ""no evidence"" of ""mental illness or brain damage"". Nor have police found links to any foreign or domestic terrorist organisations. Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Paddock, who appears to have killed himself before police stormed his hotel room, had no criminal record and was not known to police. However, police found 23 guns in Paddock's hotel room, as well as firearms and explosives at his home. In total, across three locations, 47 firearms have been recovered, officials said. Photos from the hotel room of guns used in the attack have been obtained byBoston 25 News,external. Guns seen on the hotel room floor The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws. But President Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting the Second Amendment during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way. After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate. How Trump turned against gun control Las Vegas shooting - what we know This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Paddock, a former accountant with a big gambling habit, lived in a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite, north-east of Las Vegas. He reportedly shared his house there with Marilou Danley. Initially police had said she was in Japan rather than the Philippines and discounted her involvement. Nineteen firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition with electronic devices were found at the property. Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Officers also found ammonium nitrate in Paddock's car. The chemical compound used in fertilisers can be a component of bombs such as that deployed in the 1995 Oklahoma City attack. David Famiglietti of the New Frontier Armory told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in North Las Vegas in the spring of this year, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. The fast shooting rate audible in recordings of Sunday night's attack indicates that Paddock may have modified his guns with legal accessories to make them fire at speeds approaching those of automatic weapons. This video can not be played How countries around the world introduced restrictions following mass shootings Despite the large cache of weapons found in the killer's home, his brother, Eric, is struggling to accept that he acted in this way. He said he was ""in shock, horrified, completely dumbfounded"". So-called Islamic State claimed on Monday to be behind the attack, saying Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. The FBI said it had found ""no connection to an international terrorist organisation"". Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer? The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. According to police, Paddock had booked into the hotel four days earlier, on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room Aside from the 23 guns found in the two-room hotel suite, Sheriff Lombardo said there were 10 suitcases. Thousands were enjoying a performance by singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out, starting at 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of shots were fired over the course of nine minutes, according to police. Concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. The fake photos shared after tragedies What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting It is thought he moved between two windows in his suite as he carried out the attack.

Fans upset by latest NFL anthem protest,"Fans have criticised three Kansas City Chiefs players who protested during the US national anthem amid a day of national mourning for a mass shooting. The demonstration at Monday's game against the Washington Redskins came a day after a gunman killed 59 people and wounded hundreds in Las Vegas. Fans held up signs such as one urging players, ""protest on your own time"". Some NFL players have been kneeling or sitting during the anthem to protest against racial inequality. Cornerback Marcus Peters was the only player shown on TV seated as the anthem was played on Monday. But his teammate Ukeme Eligwe sat, too, and Justin Houston knelt apparently in prayer. Kansas City Star newspaper sports editor Jeff Rosen tweeted: ""Man, can't get behind Marcus Peters and Ukeme Eligwe sitting tonight. ""No sir. Not tonight."" WATCH: How the Las Vegas shooting unfolded Tales of heroism emerge from aftermath Flags flew at half mast at Arrowhead Field in Kansas City on Monday night, and a moment of silence was observed before the Star-Spangled Banner was sung.

But speaking to some, it was clear that many were not happy with players protesting during the national anthem. One Chiefs fan even told me he wouldn't celebrate a touchdown if a protesting player scored. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here are some of those who took inspiration from Tom Petty. In 2015, Tom Petty and his collaborator Jeff Lynnewere added to the songwriting creditsfor Sam Smith's hit Stay With Me because of similarities to his 1989 track I Won't Back Down. Smith's people said it was ""a complete coincidence"". ""All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen,""a sanguine Petty later said,external.

Petty's song Running Down A Dream was ""the first lyric I heard as a pre-teen that maybe made me understand what grown-up melancholy was"", Ronson said, while as he grew up, You Got Lucky and American Girl ""resonated with a rawness that spoke to me on another level"". After Nirvana ended in 1994, Dave Grohl was recruited to perform with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - who were without a drummer at the time - on Saturday Night Live. Petty was said to have been so impressed that he offered Grohl a permanent place in the band. But Grohl turned him down and started Foo Fighters instead. The biggest musical influence can be seen on the Foos' Wheels, which pays some homage to Petty's Learning To Fly. A ridiculously deep voice chants the words ""Thom Pettie that ho/Free falling, we out all night"" on a song titled Thom Pettie on the former Outkast rapper's 2012 album Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors. Big Boi explained,externalthat it was inspired by Petty's hit Free Fallin'. He said: ""If you're going out for the wild night and you never know where the night is going to take you, we call it free falling. That's called Tom Pettying! If you Tom Petty for the night, you don't know where you're going to end up at in the morning."" ""We've all been trying to copy him,"" Dave Haywood of country megastars Lady Antebellum told BBC Breakfast. ""Everyone's been trying to emulate what he does... He'd be in our top five of influences for us as a band."" Bandmate Charles Kelley added: ""Tom Petty is probably even a bigger influence to our generation of country artists than even some of the traditional country artists, just because that's what we grew up on. Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw... I would say they would put him in their top 10 of artists that influenced them."" Petty and Adams both released albums in 2014. That ledBillboard to snark,externalthat ""the best Tom Petty album to come out this year may be the one by prolific singer-songwriter-guitarist-producer Ryan Adams"".

Russia fined in Kursk sub disaster case,"The Kursk disaster in 2000 was an international embarrassment for the Russian military The European Court of Human Rights says Russia must compensate journalists who were sued for articles about the Kursk nuclear submarine disaster in 2000. The case was won by Novaya Gazeta, an investigative newspaper often critical of the Kremlin. Russia must now pay it 3,388 euros (Â£3,007; $3,984), and 2,170 euros to its correspondent Yelena Milashina. The paper had alleged failure by the military to properly investigate the deaths of 118 Kursk sailors. Russia marks Kursk anniversary TheEuropean court ruled,externalthat by prosecuting the journalists, the Russian defence ministry had violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which safeguards freedom of expression. In an investigation, the paper disputed the conclusion of a naval forensic expert, Viktor Kolkutin, that 23 sailors had died eight hours after explosions which had killed most of the crew immediately. Novaya Gazeta alleged that the sailors had survived longer than that, and that the navy had bungled the rescue attempt. It meant that there was no punishment of Northern Fleet officers for criminal negligence over the Kursk disaster. An official investigation found that two explosions had wrecked the submarine after fuel leaked from a torpedo during a naval exercise. Another military expert reported that dull repeated knocking heard from the sunken submarine was not an SOS message from the survivors, but some other unidentified noise from a surface ship. In 2005 a Moscow court had made the newspaper and Milashina pay 57,000 roubles (Â£744; $985 at today's rates) in fines for defamation, over their reporting of the military experts' conclusions.

Catalan vote illegal - Spanish king,"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont spoke to the BBC on Tuesday evening Catalonia will declare independence from Spain in a matter of days, the leader of the autonomous region has told the BBC. In his first interview since a disputed vote on Sunday, Carles Puigdemont said his government would ""act at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". Meanwhile, Spain's King Felipe VI said the vote's organisers had put themselves ""outside the law"". He said the situation in Spain was ""extremely serious"", calling for unity. Tensions between Spain and the north-eastern Catalonia region continue to mount, days after the vote was marred by violence involving national police. The Spanish High Court said it had begun an investigation into key Catalan figures on Wednesday on suspicion of sedition - inciting rebellion against the state - including the head of Catalonia's regional police. Josep Lluis Trapero, who leads the Mossos d'Esquadra force, is suspected of failing to control a demonstration during a police raid on Catalan government offices before the vote. Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? In his BBC interview, Carles Puigdemont said his government would ""act at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". He also revealed there was currently no contact between the government in Madrid and his devolved administration. When asked what he would do if the Spanish government were to intervene and take control of Catalonia's government, Mr Puigdemont said it would be ""an error which changes everything"". Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the government in Madrid is permitted to impose direct rule on an autonomous regions. Groups in the Catalan parliament have agreed that parliament should meet in full assembly on Monday. Mr Puigdemont could use that occasion to make a unilateral declaration of independence. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold He was due to make a statement at 21:00 (19:00GMT) on Wednesday. The Spanish government has vowed to resist any declaration of independence, with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy saying the vote made a ""mockery"" of democracy. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau has called on both sides to talk. ""Neither a declaration of independence nor article 155. More than ever we need dialogue and bridges,""she tweeted,external. The European parliament was due to debate the crisis on Wednesday afternoon. Many Catalans have been angered by the European Commission's statement on Monday that events in Catalonia were an internal issue for Spain. This video can not be played King Felipe VI: ""Catalan society is fractured"" In his televised address, King Felipe said the Catalan leaders who organised the referendum showed their ""disrespect to the powers of the state"". ""They have broken the democratic principles of the rule of law,"" he said. But many Catalans were more concerned about what the king did not say, reports the BBC's Patrick Jackson, who watched the address in a bar in Barcelona city centre. ""There were no words about the scenes of police beating voters on Sunday, no urgent appeal for dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments, no acknowledgment of the real hunger here for independence or at least a proper, legal referendum, not even a word or two of Catalan,"" he says. This video can not be played Clare and Kike react to the Spanish king's address It was a missed opportunity to push the two sides towards dialogue, said one customer in the bar. Q&A: Do Catalans really want independence? Why Catalan emotions are running high How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote Nearly 900 people were hurt as police violently tried to enforce a Spanish court order suspending the vote, which the government had declared illegal. This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Thirty-three police officers were also injured, local medical officials said. Shocked by what they had seen, hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined street protests on Tuesday. A general strike was also called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"" seen during the ballot. More than 2.2 million people voted on Sunday, according to the Catalan government. Officials put the vote in support of independence at nearly 90%, but official results have not yet been released. There are several reports of gaping irregularities, partly attributed to a system which permitted voters to cast their ballots anywhere in a bid to get around the police measures to stop the vote. Spanish media carried reports of some Catalan areas counting far more votes than residents. Catalan officials said the turnout was 42%, potentially weakening the position of Mr Puigdemont.

Grooming victim fear over Corrie error,"Former chief crown prosecutor Nazir Afzal said up to now the programme was ""to be applauded"" Child sexual exploitation victims may fear coming forward after a courtroom sketch of a grooming victim was shown in Coronation Street, it is feared. The character Bethany Platt, 16, is at the centre of a grooming storyline. The soap showed a sketch of her being drawn during the trial of her alleged abuser. By law, sexual assault victims are granted anonymity for life. Former chief crown prosecutor Nazir Afzal said he was ""concerned"". ITV apologised for the mistake. In the long-running story Nathan Curtis, played by Chris Harper, was arrested for sexual exploitation and accused of forcing the teenager to have sex with his friends in a series of ""parties"". Mr Afzal said up to now the programme had been ""a very accurate reflection of a victim's experience"". The story of Bethany being groomed by Nathan has gripped viewers He said: ""I think it was especially brave before the watershed and it has undoubtedly encouraged victims to come forward. ""But I'm concerned over their mistake. A court artist must always draw from memory and must not draw victims. ""We make an enormous play of telling victims that nobody will know who you are. ""Those victims might pick up the mistake and it might make them uncomfortable and we shouldn't have to do that. ""We're having to put the genie back in the bottle; we're having to fix something, which should be unnecessary."" A spokesman for ITV said the artist was ""solely used to illustrate the passing of time"". He said: ""We accept this wasn't a true representation of court procedure and we apologise for including it. ""We repeatedly focused on support for victims throughout the court process, which we hope would encourage anyone watching to recognise the fact they would be in a safe place when giving evidence."" In June,five complaints were made to broadcast regulator Ofcomafter child grooming scenes involving Bethany Platt were shown before the watershed.

Divided Catalonia traumatised by violence,"The protesters say the violent reaction of the Spanish authorities to their independence demands has strengthened their cause She cried when she saw the news, he could hardly believe what he was watching. Here in 21st Century Spain, police were beating people for trying to hold a vote. Never mind that Ana didn't turn out herself for a ballot she believes was illegal in her beloved Spain. Never mind that Xavier had already made up his mind to break away from the very same Spain. Like many others, both are deeply upset about the violence at the polling stations. At least, though, they have the comfort of being head over heels in love with each other. On Laietana Street, there's no love lost for the police among the protesters. This video can not be played Protesting Catalan student Mauro Castro Soler ""Spanish murderers!"" they chant at the building marked with a furled Spanish flag that looks lonely against the Catalan flags on nearby walls. The building is protected by a line of Catalan riot police and vans. One man all but shoves an ""anti-fascist"" flag into the face of a policeman, like a red rag to a bull. The bull doesn't react, though the two sides are so close, you can imagine they smell each other's breath, as well as the heady fumes of whatever it is people are smoking in the crowd. Many in Catalonia are especially angry with Spanish police officers There is shock that police were used against people for trying to hold a vote It's 24 hours after the referendum and hundreds of hyper-young protesters are jubilantly occupying the street outside the Barcelona headquarters of Spain's National Police. They're on a roll wrapped in their lone-star Catalan rebel flags, yelling up at the windows, demanding Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy takes his 10,000-odd extra police officers out of Catalonia. ""When they're gone, we'll turn the building into a library!"" one young man tells me with a grin. Events on Sunday have left many people traumatised Through the balaclavas, it's hard to tell how the Catalan riot police are taking all this, protecting their Spanish comrades from a hostile crowd, but their helmets hang unused from their belts along with the truncheons and pistols. The only things being thrown this evening are paper planes which come down like volleys of toy darts on the police and their vans, to gales of triumphant laughter from the crowd. On Sunday, in one Catalan town (Carles de la Rapita), there was a particularly bloody clash outside a polling station, and stones were hurled at Spanish police cars. ""If you'd asked me three or four years ago, I would probably have said independence was not the right way - it doesn't matter to me what's on the flag,"" says one of those at the Barcelona protest, 23-year-old Yes voter Jo, who doesn't want to give his full name. ""But every day now, basic rights are being violated. When we ask for more self-government, they only send police to beat old people and kids. ""In the past two weeks, Spain did more for Catalan independence than the Catalans in the past 10 years because if you point a gun at people they feel under attack, and if they feel under attack, it's logical that they won't want to stay with you. ""If we become independent tomorrow, I will congratulate Mariano Rajoy because he has done more than most to bring it about."" In a cafe across town, Xavier Querol, 25, wants to make something very clear. Xavier and Ana speak both Catalan and Spanish ""It's not a fight,"" he says. ""We don't have a good side and a bad side - both sides are right. People are angry and disgusted but we are not fighting each other - that is all politics. ""Sunday was a disgrace and a shock. I know Spanish people who say they feel ashamed to be Spanish, but we still talk. It's the politicians who won't talk."" But his girlfriend Ana Jorques, 20, has noticed how the mood among some groups of Spanish and Catalan friends in Barcelona has soured. ""I am Spanish and there are Catalans who think that I am bad person after what happened on Sunday,"" she says. There does tend to be more arguing, Xavier agrees. ""When they see the pictures of police fighting old people and children, people get stressed and blame those who feel Spanish."" ""I like and respect the police,"" says Ana. ""They were doing their job. They have a boss and they have to do what the boss says, but they didn't behave correctly."" When Xavier saw the pictures on TV he says it felt like he was looking at a report from another country, not Spain. ""I would rather stay in Spain than see this happen again,"" he says. He didn't vote because he couldn't download the referendum app (banned by a court order) and by the time he found his polling station, the huge queue meant he had missed his chance. Fire fighters in Barcelona took part in Monday's protests ""I don't trust politicians but I am Spanish and want to stay in Spain,"" says Ana. So what does she think of Catalans? ""Well, this is a good Catalan,"" she says with a smile, gesturing towards Xavier, who is tickled pink. But it's not easy for her, she adds, to hear Catalans call Spain a ""country full of corruption"". So Spaniards never say mean things about Catalans? They sure do. A common view is that they are moaners who don't know how well off they are, she says. ""And there's corruption in Catalonia too,"" Ana points out. But independence would mean a fresh start, Xavier believes. ""I'm not angry with the Spanish people, but I want to choose my own future."" In his view, Spain is ruled by the same small group of people who were in power under the Franco dictatorship. It's true Mr Rajoy's Popular Party has its roots in the Franco establishment but, 40 years on, can a democratically elected Spanish government really behave like Franco? Huge numbers of people took part in protests against police violence on Monday Ballot boxes used in Sunday's vote were put on display in various parts of Barcelona ""Totally!"" says Josep, 86, a Catalan who grew up under the old regime before migrating to Germany for work. Back living in Barcelona again, he has found his evening stroll with his daughter Maria (they also don't want to give their full names) interrupted by the demo at the police headquarters. ""Both sides are crazy,"" he says. The father and daughter may be proud Catalans, but they see their future inside Spain - ""only not with Rajoy"", Josep adds. Perhaps Spain could adopt a federal structure like in Germany? he suggests. Maria says she feels both Catalan and Spanish and ""it's always better together"", and she is worried about Catalan radicalism. She tried to vote No on Sunday but her designated polling station had been shut down. The police's use of force will have swayed more people towards independence, she thinks, leaving the future even more uncertain. ""Following orders is one thing, but using violence where there is no violence is excessive,"" Maria says. ""People were only demonstrating that they wanted to vote.""

Q&A: Scotland's fracking ban,"The Scottish government has confirmed that it wants to effectively ban fracking in Scotland. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse told the Scottish Parliament that the current moratorium on fracking will be continued indefinitely - which he said means that fracking ""cannot and will not take place in Scotland"". Here's a look at the background to the announcement. This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique used to recover gas and oil from shale rock by drilling down into the earth before directing a high-pressure water mixture at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well, where it can be collected. Fracking allows drilling firms to access difficult-to-reach resources of oil and gas, and has been credited with significantly boosting US oil production. But opponents point to environmental concerns raised by the extensive use of fracking in the US. They say potentially carcinogenic chemicals used in the process may escape and contaminate drinking water supplies around the fracking site, although the industry argues any pollution incidents are the results of bad practice, rather than an inherently risky technique. There have also been concerns that the fracking process can cause small earth tremors. And campaigners say the transportation of the huge amounts of water needed for fracking comes at a significant environmental cost. According to aBritish Geological Survey report published in 2014, there are ""modest"" shale reserves under east Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, Midlothian, north Edinburgh, East Lothian and Fife - many of which include some of Scotland's largest towns. There was estimated to be about 80 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in central Scotland compared to 1,300 trillion cubic feet in the north of England. The report also said the amount of oil and gas which could be commercially recovered was likely to be substantially lower. Ineos, which operates the huge Grangemouth petrochemical plant in central Scotland, holds fracking exploration licences across 700 square miles of the country. The company has alsostarted shipping shale gas ethane to Grangemouthfrom the US. Its chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, has previously claimed a domestic shale gas industry could secure Scotland's energy supply in the future andrevitalise the country's industrial heartlands, with Grangemouth becoming a ""new Aberdeen"". But Prof John Underhill, an expert at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh,published research in Augustwhich he said showed that the geology of the British Isles made large scale hydraulic fracking unviable. Nicola Sturgeon had made clear that she had serious doubts about fracking Under pressure from environmental campaigners, community groups and many grassroots members of its own party, the SNP government at Holyrood announced a moratorium on fracking and a separate process called underground coal gasification (UCG) in 2015. The moratorium led to UCG - a method of extracting gas from coal seams that are too deep underground for traditional mining techniques - effectivelybeing banned last yearafter ""numerous and serious environmental risks"" were identified. Separatereports into the environmental, health and economic impact of frackingwere published a few weeks later, before a full public consultation was held on the issue. The reports found ""inadequate"" evidence to draw a firm conclusion on the health impact of fracking, while the probability of ""felt earthquakes"" was rated as ""very small"". The economic report laid out a series of different scenarios, with anything from 470 to 3,100 jobs potentially created, and value added to the Scottish economy to 2062 anywhere from Â£100m to Â£4.6bn. Holyrood had previously voted to support an outright ban on fracking, although SNP members abstained from the non-binding vote - with Labour also launching a members bill which had the same aim. The Scottish government has officially remained neutral in the fracking debate while it weighed up the evidence for and against. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in March of last year that she waspersonally ""very sceptical"" about frackingand had some ""big questions"" about the impact it could have on health, the environment and local communities. The Scottish government has now confirmed that it will not support the extraction of any unconventional oil and gas in Scotland - meaning that fracking has effectively been banned. Mr Wheelhouse told Holyrood that 99% of people who responded to the Scottish government's consultation backed the move. It means that the SNP, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens are all now officially in favour of a ban, with only the Conservatives opposed - making the final vote on the issue, which is expected to happen after the October recess, something of a formality. The announcement is likely to be given a warm welcome by party activists gathering at the SNP conference, which opens on Sunday. But there have already been reports that Ineos couldconsider legal action against the government,externalto recoup the Â£50m its says it has invested during the fracking moratorium.

Laura Kuenssberg: Conservative fears of downward spiral,"Guess what. It's not about Boris Johnson. He sucks the oxygen, grabs the attention, ""the blond one"" excites the Tory crowds, as well as driving his colleagues up the wall with his behaviour. Today in a speech about ""the lion that will roar"", (wonder what he's trying to say there?) activists may cheer him and colleagues will gnash their teeth as, in a way only he can, he tickles the party's tummy. The fuss around Boris Johnson is the symptom not the cause. The problem that is increasingly on people's minds at this grisly conference is that the Tories might be only at the start of a decline, which becomes impossible to escape. One former minister says, ""there is a smell of decay"", another, that it is ""hopeless, but we are resigned to the nightmare"". Cabinet ministers fret that Theresa May simply doesn't have the ideas or imagination to reboot either her leadership or their party. May: I don't want cabinet of 'yes men' Conservative conference: live updates One of her colleagues says ""how did she blow the party up in 12 months?"", lamenting how her premiership has paralleled Gordon Brown, who after years of hoping to get to Downing Street arrived there with little to say, bewildered by the sudden challenge of the top job. Another says she looks ""bent and broken"". But there is little evidence yet that there is anyone willing or brave enough to confront this publicly, the younger generations of Tory MPs are furious with the top brass, but none of them yet ready to step up to the plate. For now, Mrs May's glum cabinet colleagues mostly believe the best option is to get behind her, to show loyalty with the hope of regaining authority to govern, the slow grind of government competence could restore credibility over time. These are unpredictable times. One minister even told me they feel optimistic about the next election, believing the Corbyn phenomenon can't sustain for five years. But in government and on the backbenches and in Manchester, optimism is a minority view. Stopping the slide the priority. The fear here is not really that Boris Johnson is grabbing all the attention, it's that this party could be dying inside, and it finds itself with a leader who might struggle to stop the downward spiral.

'I was forced from my job for giving birth',"Around one in nine of the more than 3,000 mothers questioned had lost their jobs The scale of maternity discrimination is being hidden because of the use of gagging orders when women who have lost their jobs settle out of court, experts have told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""My boss said if I'm not going back to work, then I'd have to pay back all the maternity payment."" ""Emma"" - not her real name - was working as a beautician when she became pregnant. She did not realise at the time that her boss's request was against the law. She was called into the salon and told by the owner she would no longer be needed at the company. ""I didn't know what to do. I'm a single mum, no family. No-one can help me,"" she tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""How can I pay my rent? How can I pay my bills? I was floored."" Emma went on to settle out of court. She signed a confidentiality agreement preventing her from speaking out about the case - which is why she is anonymous. Around one in nine of more than 3,000 mothers questioned said they had been dismissed, made compulsorily redundant, or treated so badly they felt they had to leave their job,according to the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2015.,external This is despite the Employment Rights Act and Equality Act protecting women from unfair dismissal because they are pregnant or on maternity leave. Last year, the government described the findings as ""shocking"" and ""wholly unacceptable"", but no new protections have been brought in since. Karen Jackson believes confidentiality agreements should not be allowed Karen Jackson, director of law firm Didlaw and a specialist in discrimination cases, says the true scale of the problem is masked by the fact that many women sign settlement agreements containing a confidentiality clause - which stops them from speaking out. ""I've never seen a settlement agreement that didn't have a very strict confidentiality term in it,"" she says. ""I wish I could talk about some of the companies that I've dealt with and their attitudes to pregnancy and maternity. ""Household names, brands that we know, banks, insurers, utility companies, big conglomerates, retail - you name it, these companies have all at some point had some issues. ""If I look at the FTSE 100 there's a good chunk of companies on that list that I've acted against around pregnancy and maternity."" Conservative MP Maria Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, says women must be allowed to speak out. ""The government needs to take this situation very seriously indeed. ""We shouldn't have the problem hidden by confidentiality clauses,"" she explains. Kiran Daurka, an employment solicitor at Leigh Day, says in 14 years she cannot recall one of her clients who was pregnant or had recently given birth taking her employer to a full tribunal. She says such women are likely to settle and ""accept a lower offer, as they don't really want to be in litigation during that time for emotional and financial reasons, which employers often exploit"". Catherine McClennan won a maternity discrimination employment tribunal in 2015 against her employer, the TUC - which represents trade unions. She received damages and costs of Â£21,000. ""My job and job title was omitted from the [company's] directory, which was really hard to see in print to be honest with you. This video can not be played Catherine McClennan received damages and costs of Â£21,000 ""At one point, when I said... 'Look, I've come back. I'm a competent, able, professional woman. I've always done a really good job. I just want to continue with my career', he asked a female colleague if I had post-natal depression,"" she continues. Catherine says she did not expect such treatment from the TUC. ""I was very sad actually because I felt, as an organisation who stand for fairness, equality and justice, a number of individuals were obviously bringing the reputation of that into disrepute."" The TUC says there was ""no malicious or conscious attempt to discriminate"", and that it challenged the tribunal case ""vigorously"". The government says it is ""determined to tackle pregnancy and maternity discrimination"" and there should be ""zero tolerance"" of it. It adds that it is still reviewing whether stronger protections are needed. No date has been given for when a decision will be made. The Women and Equalities Committee has previously recommended to the government that it brings in a ""dismissal ban"", similar to the one in place in Germany. This means that only in very rare circumstances can a woman be dismissed while pregnant, or for four months after they give birth. One German discrimination solicitor, Anna Lindenberg, said in 10 years she had only had to represent one woman who was dismissed during this period of time - such was the effect of the ban. Catherine says she hopes change will come to the UK soon. ""It's a travesty really that women in 2017 are still faced with this level of discrimination,"" she says.

Reality Check: Has Help to Buy helped first-time buyers?,"""The Help to Buy equity loan has achieved much higher take-up than we expected, helping 130,000 families so far with a deposit for their own home,"" Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. Thelatest figures from the Department of Communities and Local Government,externalshow that from the launch of the scheme, in the second quarter of 2013, up to the end of June 2017, 134,558 properties had been bought. The vast majority of these were purchased by first-time buyers - 108,620 of them, or just over 80%. Under the Help to Buy equity loan scheme, people in England trying to buy a new-build property who have a 5% deposit can take out a 20% loan from the government (40% in London) and cover the rest with a mortgage. It is limited to properties costing up to Â£600,000, and it must be the only property you own. You don't have to pay any fees for the first five years. After that, you start having to pay fees, which increase in line with inflation. After 25 years or when you sell the house, you have to repay the loan based not on the amount you borrowed but on how much it is currently worth. So if the value of your home has doubled, then the amount you have to repay the government also doubles. The chancellor will have been talking about only England because housing is a devolved issue. There are similar schemes in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the chancellor is not responsible for them. A high proportion of Help to Buy equity loans went to first-time buyers - but what sort of proportion of first-time buyers is that overall? The housing charity Shelter has criticised the scheme, saying Help to Buy has ""barely helped the first-time buyers it is targeted at"". UK Finance (which used to be the Council of Mortgage Lenders) says that overall for the period 9.6% of first-time buyers used a Help to Buy equity loan. That's an average figure - in the most recent quarter for which we have figures, it was almost 15%. And of course you need to bear in mind that the equity loans can be used to buy only new-build properties. Earlier this year, analysis byBBC News foundone in three new-build properties outside London - but just one in 10 in the capital - had been bought through Help to Buy.

Hugh Pym: A new way to get more trained nurses,"Party conference rhetoric is not noted for understatement and the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's claim to be unveiling the ""biggest expansion of nurse training in the history of the NHS"" should be seen in that light. It became clear after his conference speech that there was some repackaging of previous announcements, but nevertheless it did offer an insight into the direction of policy. In essence, Mr Hunt wants to create a pathway towards qualification as a nurse in England which does not require three years as a student and the consequent loans for tuition fees. The slogan ""earn and learn"" has emerged to describe this route for would-be nurses. Starting perhaps as healthcare assistants, members of NHS staff would continue in employment while being trained as nursing associates and then becoming nursing apprentices. Subject to reaching the required standard, they would then qualify as registered nurses. The plan involves an expansion of training of nursing associates (support staff working alongside fully qualified nurses). There are currently 2,000 such trainees in England - this will increase to 7,500 doing the required two-year course by 2019.  Should they wish to progress further, a nursing associate could then start a nursing apprenticeship over two years which should lead to full qualification as a nurse over a total of four years rather three for degree students. Mr Hunt said he wanted to ""jump-start"" nurse training and the aim was to make sure that ""many of the additional places go to healthcare assistants training on hospital sites, allowing us to expand our nurse workforce with some highly experienced people already working on the NHS frontline."" Mr Hunt said more transparency in the NHS was saving lives as well as money The Health Secretary also announced an increase of 15,500 in the number of places for student nurse training in England by 2020, more than anticipated in August when a 10,000 plan was set out.  The source of the funding for the whole package is not entirely clear - sources indicated some would come from the training scheme funded by the apprenticeship levy with the rest to be confirmed in the Budget. There was a cautious welcome from the Royal College of Nursing, though a spokesperson said there was a concern that students would plug gaps in the current workforce at the expense of quality patient care. Ministers will have to work hard to reassure NHS staff that the ""earn and learn"" route is not cutting corners and allowing a less rigorous training. Mr Hunt's announcement begs a big question - why is the Government flagging up a route to nurse qualification with no tuition costs at the same time as scrapping free tuition for student nurses? Could the Health Secretary have realised that making nurse trainees pay for their tuition might deter future applicants? Whitehall sources deny that the scrapping of nurse bursaries will reduce trainee numbers. They argue universities will be incentivised to create places if they know they can recoup fees from extra students. But the number of nurses starting training in England this autumn is down slightly on last year. Staff shortages are among the biggest challenges for the NHS. Filling nursing vacancies is as problematic as ever for hospital managers. NHS Digital figures showed 11,500 nursing and midwifery vacancies advertised in England in the first three months of this year, up 17% on the same period a year earlier. Professor David Green, Vice Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Worcester, believes that reversing the trend of recent years will be difficult: ""We campaigned actively and publicly against the big cuts announced way back in 2011 to nurse education places. Universities warned then that the cuts would lead to major problems. Very sadly, we have been proved right."" Training more nurses will take time. Patient demand keeps increasing year on year. Time to tackle the staffing problem is something the Government and the NHS does not have much of.

'I thought my whole family was gone',"This video can not be played Lydia Wilkinson thought all her family was dead Lydia Wilkinson was in another county when she found out her whole family had been stabbed in a ""frenzied"" knife attack. The 19-year-old Bristol university student was in halls when her boyfriend called her about a stabbing in her hometown of Stourbridge, West Midlands. Unknown to Lydia, Aaron Barley, a 24-year-old homeless man who had been taken in by the Wilkinsons, had armed himself with a knife and entered her family's home. ""I remember typing into Google 'Stourbridge, stabbings,"" she said. Killer jailed: Latest updates Man admits 'frenzied' mum and son murder ""And the first link showed a photo of my house with police tape around it. I remember ringing him [my boyfriend] back and saying 'It's me, it's us, they've been stabbed'."" Lydia did not yet know Barley had killed her 13-year-old brother Pierce, and her mother, Tracey. Her father, Peter, was gravely wounded in the attack. Shaken by what she had seen online, Lydia went into a friend's room, where she called the police. Her friend took her phone while they waited for officers to arrive. ""West Midlands [Police] got to me and asked what I knew - I said just that they have all been stabbed,"" she said. ""They said 'we are very sorry to tell you that your mum and brother have passed away and your dad is in theatre and we don't know whether he will survive or not, we have had no news'."" Lydia, a first-year biology undergraduate, was set to return to the family home a day after the attack on 30 March. She had promised to meet Pierce at his school gates, and was looking forward to going dress shopping with her mum, she said. Instead, she found herself rushing to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, unaware if her father had survived. ""I remember coming back in the car from Bristol,"" she said. ""I was planning a triple funeral and how I was going to go about that on my own."" Lydia Wilkinson laid flowers at her family home after the murders About three hours after learning her mum and brother had died, Lydia arrived at her father's bedside. ""They took me to critical care and that was the first time I saw my dad - with countless machines hooked up to him, a lot of doctors around his bed,"" she said. ""I remember thinking at that point in time that I was going to lose him as well because nobody could survive that state."" ""I thought he was going to pass away that night."" ""I knew there was nothing I could do to help my mum and Pierce as they had tragically passed away, so my sole focus at that moment in time was my dad, because he was the only thing I had left in life."" This video can not be played Peter Wilkinson woke up in intensive care to learn his son was dead Lydia sat beside her father, who was under heavy sedation, holding his hand. ""I said that I was there and he opened his eyes and looked at me and then went back unconscious,"" she said. ""He woke up later on that evening."" ""I started to hope that he was going to [pull through] because before that there was just no hope. I genuinely thought it was going to be just me,"" she said. ""And from that moment he started to come round."" Pierce Wilkinson (left) died in hospital after paramedics battled to save him Lydia, who has since continued her studies at Bristol, said she did not really talk to her father ""about the outside world"" until he came out of critical care. ""He didn't know I had been to the house [to lay flowers] and he didn't know that I identified the bodies of my mum and brother,"" she said. Tracey Wilkinson had a ""beautiful personality"", her daughter said. Lydia paid tribute to her mother, who had first met Barley when he was living on the streets. She found him meals and accommodation and let him temporarily stay in their home. ""To have my best friend taken from me in life at such a young age is a hardship I would never wish on anyone,"" she said. ""Because it has to be the most awful experience. Especially when something happensâ¦ I can't ring her up any more."" After Barley admitted killing Pierce and Mrs Wilkinson, Lydia faced him in court. Addressing the killer as he stood in the dock, she said: ""My parents helped you - you repaid them with destruction and heartache. ""You have obliterated my life, murdered half my family, very nearly all of it, and for this I will never forgive you.""

Tech giants sorry for false Vegas news,"Google and Facebook promoted inaccurate reports about the Las Vegas shooting Google and Facebook have apologised after their algorithms led to the promotion of inaccurate information about the Las Vegas shooting. Posts from a4chanmessaging board that falsely identified the gunman as an individual who was not involved were circulated online. Google says the posts only appeared in its Top Stories section if users searched for the erroneous name. Facebook said it took down the posts within minutes. The problem occurred when users began speculating about the identity of the gunman on 4chan, a controversial anonymous messaging board. The users named an individual on the Politically Incorrect message board, claiming that the person was a ""far left loon"" and a ""social democrat"". The comments were picked up by several blogs and news sites, including an article by the right-wing political website, the Gateway Pundit. Many users then searched for the erroneous name on Google. The internet giant's algorithms traced the original source of the story back to the 4chan message board and posted a link to it in the Top Stories section. ""Unfortunately, early this morning we were briefly surfacing an inaccurate 4chan website in our search results for a small number of queries,"" a Google spokesperson told the BBC. ""Within hours, the 4chan story was algorithmically replaced by relevant results. This should not have appeared for any queries, and we'll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future."" However, Google said only a small number of search queries were made for the name, which suggests that not many people would have seen the 4chan link. As for Facebook, the social network told theAssociated Press,externalthat it began removing results relating to the Gateway Pundit and 4chan within minutes. The Gateway Pundit's White House correspondent Lucian Wintrich told far-right conspiracy website Infowars that the article was only online for 10 minutes before it was taken down. Despite Facebook's efforts to remove hyperlinks to the story, users had made screenshots of the incorrect story and continued to circulate these images online, which were harder to detect and take down. ""We are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused,"" a Facebook spokesman said. Google and Facebook have been criticised several times in the last 12 months for promoting content later found to be false, particularly relating to breaking news events. Both tech giants haveannounced measures to fight inaccurate newsin the last few months. ""Google and Facebook are much bigger than any media company now, but they insist that they are not publishers, that they are merely platforms, and as platforms, they don't need to take responsibility for their content,"" Prof Tim Luckhurst, head of Kent University's Centre for Journalism told the BBC. ""Governments create laws that allow broadcasters and newspapers to be sued, so it's up to the government to stand up to these websites and say that if anything relating to terrorism or false information is published, they can be sued."" Prof Luckhurst pointed out that in the past, Google and Facebook had been quick to tweak their algorithms when requested to do so by the Chinese government. ""Algorithms are not organic creations - they are the product of very clever software writers. ""They can tweak them when the Chinese government asks them to, they can tweak them to do target advertising, but if you ask them to tweak their algorithms in relation to terrorism or untruths, they say, 'We're not publishers.' ""But they've demonstrated that they clearly can do it, and so they should do it."" Individuals who shared the content online could face legal action. ""It's for individuals to take responsibility for what they post on social media, this person could make a lot of money from suing all these people who shared the screenshot online,"" said Dominic Ponsford, editor of the Press Gazette. ""Google should be only indexing bona fide news sources - it should be straightforward to check what is a bona fide news source and what isn't. ""It's kind of astonishing that Google's not doing that, given the huge concern in America about fake news.""

Anti-police strike grips Catalonia,"This video can not be played Firefighters joined the crowds in a day of defiant protests Thousands of people in Catalonia are rallying and blocking roads in protest over Spanish police violence during Sunday's independence referendum. There is little public transport across the region, after local trade unions called a strike. Spain's King Felipe VI is to address the nation at 19:00 GMT. Almost 900 people were hurt as police tried to prevent the vote. Thirty-three police officers were also injured. The central government in Madrid said the referendum was illegal. Catalonia beset by divided loyalties Spain's biggest crisis for a generation The reasons for the referendum On Tuesday, about 300,000 people took to the streets of Barcelona, city police were quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. Some demonstrators were marching towards the Catalan parliament. More than 50 roadblocks in the city caused big traffic jams. Barcelona's metro traffic was cut to a 25% service during rush hour and no trains at all at other times. Barcelona's port was at a standstill, trade union sources said. Top tourist attractions were also closed, including the city's famous Sagrada Familia church. Mercabarna - Barcelona's massive wholesale market - was left deserted as some 770 food businesses closed for the day. However, the city's El Prat airport and its taxis are operating normally. Protest rallies are also taking place in other major cities and towns of the north-eastern autonomous region. Many small businesses have shut for the day. Schools, universities and medical services are also closed or operating at a minimum level. The day of action drew big crowds in Barcelona and other major Catalan cities A roadblock on Gran Via in central Barcelona: The banner says ""Occupation forces get out!"" The strike was called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"" seen during Sunday's ballot. Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Why Catalan emotions are running high Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the vote made a ""mockery"" of democracy. This video can not be played Protesting Catalan student Mauro Castro Soler On Tuesday, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said: ""We see how day after day the government of Catalonia is pushing the population to the abyss and inciting rebellion in the streets."" He also warned that the central government would take ""all measures necessary to stop acts of harassment"". Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a condemned the ""mafia"" behaviour of those protesters who had earlier gathered around hotels housing Spanish police officers and demanded that they leave. This video can not be played Many Catalans have expressed shock at the use of violent tactics by Spanish police On Sunday, more than 2.2 million people reportedly voted in the referendum. The Catalan government says the vote in support of independence was nearly 90%, but official results have not yet been released. Turnout was relatively low at a reported 42%, potentially weakening the position of Catalan President Carles Puigdemont. Protesters blocked a street outside a police station in Barcelona Barcelona metro: A sign warns commuters that there will be minimum services A huge Barcelona wholesale market - Mercabarna - is paralysed by the strike On Monday evening, the Spanish national football team abandoned a training session in Madrid after fans booed and whistled at defender Gerard Pique, who has strongly backed the Catalan referendum. Guardia Civil police mingled among the crowd, as some fans waved Spanish flags and anti-Pique placards. Pique plays for FC Barcelona, which announced that it had joined the strike. ""None of the professional teams or the youth teams at FC Barcelona will train tomorrow,"" the club said on Monday evening. This video can not be played Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was booed by Spain fans Drumbeats thunder and echo up and down Laietana Street, where last night's anti-police protest of hundreds outside the city's National Police HQ has swollen into a roaring human river above which bob the lone-star flags of Catalan independence. As a surveillance helicopter's blades beat time overhead, vans of the local Mossos police slowly negotiate the alleys as the force fulfils its peculiar role as both guardians of their national colleagues, and heroes of the crowd who cheer and chant: ""Our police are here."" Roger Mayor (left) and his friends show off their flags ""It's more than a flag, it's like a feeling,"" says Roger Mayor, 18, as his friends show off the flags they are wearing. ""We think the Spanish government just want us for the money and they hate us. The Spanish police actions on Sunday were surreal. It felt like being in a horror film. We spent all day in a school [polling station] and we were very scared, though the police didn't come."" Xavi Alba, 28, and his mates pass by with a shopping trolley draped in the Catalan communist flag as the crowd chants: ""The street will always be ours"". It's stuffed with beer mostly, he explains while drinking a can. ""We go around Barcelona occupying the streets to protest at the repression. It's not about independence, it's about democracy. When we see people with Spanish flags, we just hug them. Yeah, they hug us too!"" Meanwhile, political leaders are trying to find a way forward. Mr Puigdemont has said he wants a new understanding with the central government in Madrid, but the Spanish government has warned it could suspend autonomy of the wealthy north-eastern region. How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote The most powerful images of Catalan clashes Given the chaotic nature of the vote, the turnout and voting figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona. This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting Mr Rajoy held talks with Pedro SÃ¡nchez, leader of Spain's main opposition Socialist party, as well as Albert Rivera, the head of the centrist Ciudadanos party, late on Monday. While the Socialist leader urged Mr Rajoy to hold talks with the Catalan president immediately, Mr Rivera said Spain should invoke article 155 of the constitution, in effect suspending Catalonia's autonomous powers. Mr Puigdemont has called on the international community to help mediate between the two sides. However, the European Commission described the crisis as ""an internal matter"" for Spain, that has to be dealt with in line with the constitutional order. A day of protests in Barcelona.

A strange encounter with St Vincent,"St Vincent: ""The tone of the record is quite manic and painful"" ""Are you ready for this?"" St Vincent's press officer is making small talk ahead of our interview, on a scorching hot summer's day in London. ""Sure,"" I reply. I've listened to her new album. I've made copious notes. I've jotted down about two dozen questions. ""No, but are youreadyfor this?"" he asks. ""I'm not sure what you mean."" ""Oh, you'll see."" Sounds ominous... The singer says the inspiration for her new artwork is ""The Cramps playing at a mental institution"" A few minutes later, a cloaked woman appears and, without speaking, leads me by the hand into the street, through a fire escape and into a bare concrete room. She gestures to a billboard-sized poster of St Vincent, which has a non-disclosure agreement at the bottom. I sign it in pink felt tip, and am led to a prefabricated wooden cube. The monk woman unbolts a door, barely big enough for a medium-sized Labrador, and I stoop through. Inside, the walls are bright pink. There are two pink standard lamps, with pink light bulbs, placed in opposite corners. And there, sitting at a cheap wooden table, is St Vincent, playing ambient guitar music through her iPhone. Her hair is, I think, painted blue and cut in a close bob. She makes unwavering eye contact as we shake hands and the door is shut (locked?) behind me. ""Wait til the paint fumes get to you,"" she deadpans. ""It'll be really awesome."" As she describes the room - ""it's like a psychedelic womb"" - the 34-year-old sips a drink through a bendy straw that's been moulded into the word ""No"". ""That's in case there's a yes or no question. We can just save time."" This, I suspect, will not be your average interview. The musician has designed her own brand of guitar, which is more ergonomically suited to women's bodies St Vincent is here, ostensibly, to promote her new album MASSEDUCTION (that's ""mass seduction"", not ""mass education""). It's the follow-up to 2014's St Vincent, an expectation-defying art-pop record that cemented Texas-born Annie Clark as one of her generation's greatest guitarists. If anything, the new record is even better - pitching wildly between jittery electronics and despondent ballads as Clark exposes her feelings on sex, drugs and sadness. ""It's an incredibly sad album,"" she says. ""Quite manic and painful. ""I listen to it, and some points of the album are so sad it makes me laugh. It's just so tragic. But that's human life."" Demi Lovato on dating and disappointment Wolf Alice: 'Our album is like hummus' Madonna interview: 'I want to reinvent pop tours' The first single, New York, is a disarmingly simple ode to lost love. ""New York isn't New York without you, love,"" she sings over lonely piano chords, with the pulsing heartbeat of the city submerged deep within the mix. ""It's a kind of dance song that you listen to in your bed and cry,"" she says. Clark became a tabloid fixture during her relationship with Cara Delevingne New York is one of several break-up songs on the album. It's safe to assume they're about Cara Delevingne, the elaborately-eyebrowed supermodel she dated for 18 months until last September - but Clark isn't going into specifics. ""Songs are Rorschach tests,"" she deflects, referring to the inkblot psychological tests. ""The interpretation of the song, or the feeling of the song, has more to do with the listener than it does with my intention and I'm fine with that. ""But that song's a love letter to New York, certainly, and to me it's a composite of so many people and so many experiences in New York."" The album also continues the saga of Johnny, who first appeared on St Vincent's debut album, Marry Me. Back then, she pleaded to be his partner, singing, ""Let's do what Mary and Joseph did / Without the kid"". By her fourth record, though, they were distant and estranged, as he embraced New York's party scene. In the latest instalment, Johnny is dependent on drugs and living on the street. When Clark crosses his path, he accuses her of abandoning him. ""What happened to blood. Our family?"" he hisses. ""Annie, how could you do this to me?"" It's heartbreaking, and savagely self-critical - but Clark won't say whether it's based on a real person. ""Everybody's real and everybody's a composite,"" she replies. ""It doesn't make sense to make a whole record that's brightly coloured and vibrant and then do an interview in a tea room."" It seems evasive. Itisevasive. But the singer is a thoughtful, considerate interviewee. She seems to taste the questions, chewing them over before answering. Her responses are precise, but never abrupt. So why, then, are we talking inside a bright pink Tardis? The point, Clark explains, is to put both of us ""in uncomfortable positions"". ""You've done a million interviews. I've done a million interviews. There's only so many times you can repeat your Wikipedia page to someone. ""So what happens if we shake that up? Maybe you and I react differently, and that's interesting."" Whatactuallyhappens is that we spend 15 minutes talking about the process of being interviewed. She winces as she recalls a journalist quizzing her on the time she played New York while dressed as a toilet. ""I had just made a horror movie,""  she says, referencing her short filmBirthday Party,external, ""and this was a costume from it"". ""Then I had an interviewer say to me, 'Was that some Freudian display, as if you feel you've been pissed upon?' ""I was like, 'Wow, that says a whole lot more about you than it does about me.'"" This video can not be played Highlights of St Vincent at Glastonbury 2014 Principally, though, she's bored of being asked the same old questions. ""I'll give you an example!"" she says, grabbing her phone and scrolling through a series of about 30 voice memos. ""I get asked to justify my existence as a woman in music all the time, so here is an example of something I might say."" She clicks play and sits back in her chair, arms crossed. Her voice, in a bored monotone, emits from the speaker. ""Being a woman in music means being asked about being a woman in music. And when you ask me a question about being a woman in music, what you're really doing is presenting me with two very tired narratives, and asking me to choose one of them. ""The first one goes like this: I am a victim, and now is the time to list, in great detail, my many grievances in order to assert my place in the hierarchy of victimhood. ""Or you're asking me to defend now, in words, as if my work wasn't enough, why I deserve a spot at the table. ""I refuse to participate in either narrative."" Her protest duly noted, we proceed to safer ground. Clark notes that her new album was finished exactly 10 years after her debut was released, and marvels that she's made it this far. ""I've been happy every place that I've been - and every place that I've been, I felt like I had made it. Even when I was playing pizza parlours, or clubs in London for six people - three of whom were listening - I was like, 'I'm playing in London!' ""So for me, it's been a constant, irrepressible desire to make things."" The album was recorded in New York, and is set to appear in two versions - one electronic and one acoustic Making this album with Jack Antonoff (Taylor Swift, Lorde), she employed the absurdist tactics of her idols David Bowie and David Byrne, placing ""motivational phrases"" on the music stand as she sang. One, shared on Instagram last year, simply read ""dead meat."" ""Sometimes, when you're doing vocal takes you have a pad and pencil there so you can make notes, and I'd subconsciously written 'Dead Meat'. It just made me laugh that that was whatever was coming out of my brain at that time."" Her Freudian scribbling had no impact on the song, though. ""Self laceration is just another form of ego. It doesn't really help,"" she insists. ""I've learned that the hard way. Trust me, it's not that usable. You really have to get out of your own way, especially when singing."" And that, it transpires, is what really motivates her - the ""meditative state"" she achieves while making music. ""I need it. And I realise I need it when I haven't done it for a while and I feel very agitated. ""You know, it's like some people get really frustrated and angry and they're like, 'Oh, I need to have an orgasm!'. And then you do that and you feel so much better. It's just that easy."" At that moment, the cloaked woman knocks at the door and our time is up. ""Thank you very much, it was a pleasure to meet you,"" says Clark. ""You too,"" I reply, expressing relief that I didn't trigger any of her ""stock answers"". ""You've done well!"" she laughs. ""You passed! Bye!""

Tube strike off after talks 'progress',"Drivers from the Aslef union had been due to walkout for 24 hours from midnight on Thursday A 24-hour strike by London Underground (LU) drivers which was due to take place on Thursday has been called off. Aslef union members were due to walkout at midnight in a dispute over working conditions. Union representative Finn Brennan said ""sufficient progress"" had been made during talks for the planned industrial action to be suspended. Transport bosses had warned the strike would cause ""significant disruption"" with no service on most routes. A separate rail strike by RMT union members at Southern, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and Greater Anglia on Thursday over the scrapping of guards is still set to causedisruption for commuters. Railway stations have become very busy during previous Tube strikes Mr Brennan said he was ""pleased"" the strike could be called off, following a meeting chaired by the conciliation service Acas. But he also warned: ""Our ballot remains live and we will not hesitate to call action in the future if needed to ensure all the commitments made are fully delivered."" Aslef had accused bosses of failing on a commitment to give its members the opportunity to work a four-day week and reduce the number of weekend shifts. But LU's director of network operations Nigel Holness said it had ""delivered on all our commitments to provide the best possible work-life balance for our staff"". He added that Transport for London (TfL) would continue ""to explore options that will further improve work-life balance for our staff"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""pleased"" the strike  had been suspended and that ""discussions can continue without disruption"". The Tube strike had been due to coincide with England's football match against Slovenia at Wembley Stadium. Additional National Express services and parking - which had been arranged in preparation for the strike - will remain in place, TfL has previously said.

Man admits murdering mother and son,"Tracey Wilkinson died at the family home in Stourbridge and her teenage son Pierce died in hospital A ""manipulative"" homeless man who turned on a family who befriended him has admitted the ""frenzied"" murder of the mother and her 13-year-old son. Tracey and Pierce Wilkinson were stabbed to death at their home in Stourbridge, West Midlands in March. The boy's father, Peter, was seriously injured in the attack but survived. Aaron Barley, 24, of no fixed address, admitted the killings at Birmingham Crown Court on what would have been the first day of his trial. He previously admitted the attempted murder of Mr Wilkinson. 'I thought my whole family would die' The family first met Barley after Mrs Wilkinson decided ""off-the-cuff"" to help him when she saw him trying to keep warm in a cardboard box while she was out shopping. She helped him find accommodation and arranged daily meals for him, while her husband went on to employ him as a labourer in April last year. He left the company on ""amicable terms"" last September after he began to take drugs. Aaron Barley admitted the two murders on what would have been the first day of his trial Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC told the court Mr Wilkinson was ""naturally intent"" on trying to continue to support Barley and his work colleagues ""spent a huge amount of time and effort trying to find ways to support the defendant"". But despite this he went on to attack the family just months later. Mr Khalil said Barley killed Mrs Wilkinson in her bed and attacked Pierce in his room while Mr Wilkinson was out walking the dog on the morning of 30 March. He had hidden in the garden shed overnight after failing to gain entry to the home he once shared with the family. CCTV played to the court showed him emerging from the shed with a hammer as Mr Wilkinson returned home. Brandishing a knife over his head, he shouted ""Die you bastard"" as he stabbed Mr Wilkinson a total of six times - twice in the face, twice in the abdomen and twice in the back, the court heard. Barley, described as a ""compulsive liar and manipulator"" with 21 previous convictions, wore a balaclava and was clad entirely in black, even covering his yellow trainers in black socks. Mr Khalil said Mr Wilkinson described the defendant as ""acting like a ninja"". ""He realised immediately who his attacker was"", he said. This video can not be played Murderer Aaron Barley crept through his victims' garden ""The defendant was wielding a knife, stabbing and slashing at Peter in a frenzied attack with such aggression that this alone demonstrated an obvious intention to kill him."" The company director managed to contact emergency services, and was found in the garden of the family home with facial lacerations and deep stab wounds. Barley fled the scene in the family's Land Rover and was pursued by police before he crashed in a nearby road and was arrested. Mrs Wilkinson, 50, was pronounced dead at the scene, while Pierce died after being taken to hospital. Mr Wilkinson, 47, spent 11 days in hospital recovering from his wounds. Before the killings, Barley was reported to police after his former foster carer became concerned about messages posted on Facebook, the court was told. Among the posts was a threat from him towards his family and the possibility of a ""killing spree"". Less than a week before the stabbings, the court heard, the Wilkinsons cancelled a mobile phone contract they had paid for Barley. Pierce Wilkinson (left) was killed in the attack while his father Peter was seriously injured. Pierce's sister Lydia was at university at the time The couple's daughter Lydia, 19, was away at Bristol University at the time. She said she was warned to expect the worst and when she saw her father hooked up to ""countless machines"" she doubted he would survive. When he did eventually regain consciousness, Mr Wilkinson did not know his wife was dead and was unaware his daughter had been to the mortuary to identify her mother and brother. Both the family and police said they did not know what Barley's motive was. Mr Wilkinson said he had shared a ""curry and a couple of bottles of beer"" with Barley about a month before the attack. ""The next time I saw him he was sticking a knife into my shoulder,"" he said. He said Barley had joined the family on Christmas Day last year and he wrote a card to his wife that said 'To the mother that I never had'. ""My wife was very caring and he treated her a bit like a second mother,"" he added. He suggested that Barley, whose parents died when he was young, knew his life was ""going bad ways"" and wanted to take it out on the people that had ""cared and looked after him"". This video can not be played Lydia Wilkinson thought all her family was dead Det Supt Tom Chisholm said Barley has remained uncooperative while in custody and given officers no reason for the ""horrific attack"". Describing the ""random"" murders as the most shocking he had dealt with, the veteran detective added: ""There is usually a build-up or a motive or a grudge of something, but this one is just very random."" The court also heard that psychiatric reports found no evidence of diminished responsibility. Barley fled from the scene in the family's 4x4 Emergency services were called to Greyhound Lane, Norton on 30 March Mr Wilkinson and Lydia have now moved back into the family home and said they have been ""astounded"" by the support they have received. Ms Wilkinson described her mother as a ""stunning"" woman with a ""beautiful personality"". ""To have my best friend taken from me in life at such a young age is a hardship I would never wish on anyone,"" she said. ""Because it has to be the most awful experience. Especially when something happensâ¦ I can't ring her up any more."" She said her brother was ""handsome, funny, clever"" and made friends with everybody around him. ""My mum and brother were just the iconic mother/son relationship,"" she said. Barley will be sentenced on Wednesday. CCTV footage of family's killer.

Boris Johnson: Let the British lion roar,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson:  ""It is up to us now... to let that lion roar."" Boris Johnson has said it is time to ""let the British lion roar"" as he called for Brexit to be a moment of national renewal. The foreign secretary told Tory activists the UK ""can win the future"" and should stop treating the referendum result as if it were ""plague of boils"". In his speech, he praised Theresa May's ""steadfast"" leadership over Europe. And he insisted the whole cabinet was united behind her aim of getting a ""great Brexit deal"". In a tub-thumping speech which was cheered by Tory activists, he played down claims of Brexit divisions, saying he and his colleagues agreed with ""every syllable"" of the PM's recent Florence speech about Brexit. And he suggested that the UK's best days lay ahead once it left the European Union. Conservative conference: live updates Anger over Johnson Libya 'bodies' comment May: I don't want cabinet of 'yes men' Fox and Davis call for Brexit optimism MEPs urge Brexit trade talks delay ""We can win the future because we are the party that believes in this country and we believe in the potential of the British people. ""We are not the lion. We do not claim to be the lion. That role is played by the people of this country. But it is up to us now - in the traditional non-threatening, genial and self-deprecating way of the British - to let that lion roar."" Mr Johnson's highly-anticipated speech, which Mrs May is reported to have read in advance, followed criticism of his recent interventions over Brexit, which have prompted speculation about a leadership challenge and led to calls from some MPs for him to be replaced. Mr Johnson said global Britain would be ""team players"" around the world The foreign secretary took aim at Labour's claim that it had won the snap election which saw the Tories lose their majority, pointing out that it had won nearly 60 fewer seats than the Conservatives. ""Jeremy Corbyn didn't win. You won - we won. Theresa May won. ""She won more votes than any party leader and took this party to its highest share of the vote in any election in the last 25 years and the whole country owes her a debt for her steadfastness in taking Britain forward as she will to a great Brexit deal."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson wants to send the ""superannuated space cadet from Islington"" into space Amid talk of continuing cabinet division over the terms of the UK's exit, he said he shared the PM's goal of creating a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU after it leaves and believed that the UK would remain a ""quintessential European nation"". ""Based on that Florence speech on whose every syllable, I can tell you the whole cabinet is united,"" he said. ""Since it is manifestly absurd to argue that European values or culture or civilisation are somehow defined or delimited by the institutions of the EU, we will be no less European. Britain will continue to be European in culture, geography, history, architecture, spiritually, morally, you name it."" The prime minister was not in the hall for her foreign secretary's speech Throwing down the gauntlet to Labour, he joked Jeremy Corbyn was ""Caracas"" for his support for socialist regimes in Venezuela and elsewhere. But, Mr Johnson said, at the same time as the Conservatives defended the benefits of free markets they must do more to make capitalism ""work better"" for people. ""We may have the most illustrious battle honours of any political party but now we have to win the battle for the future,"" he said. ""The way to win the future is not to attack the market economy, not to junk our gains but to make it work better."" ""Make it work for all those who worry their kids will never find a home to own and make it work better for parents who can't find good enough childcare."" Mr Johnson's Labour shadow, Emily Thornberry, said mentions of the Yemen crisis, and Saudi Arabia's role, had been ""conspicuous by their absence"" in his speech. Sale of acids to under-18s to be banned Plans for 5,000 new nurse training places In the run-up to Mr Johnson's speech, the prime minister insisted she was in charge of the government and Brexit negotiations but believed a range of voices around the cabinet table made for better decision-making. ""I think leadership is about ensuring you have a team of people who aren't yes men,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played In full: Theresa May speaks to Laura Kuenssberg Mr Johnson was one of a succession of top Tories to bang the drum for Brexit on day three of the conference.

Mr Mckeague has not been seen since he went on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016, when CCTV showed him entering a bin loading bay. Suffolk Police spent 20 weeks trawling through the landfill in Milton, near Cambridge, before calling off the searchin July. The search will restart this week and is expected to take up to six weeks. It will focus on an area next to the site of the earlier search, which was identified as that most likely to contain Mr Mckeague. The mystery of the airman who disappeared The force said it took the decision to restart the search in conjunction with East Midlands Special Operations Unit, which is reviewing its investigation. Detectives spent 20 weeks searching the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire Det Supt Katie Elliott, from the Suffolk force, said: ""We can't be 100% certain, and that's because of the variances there are with what happens to waste, but the information we have gathered has given us the case to go back there."" Audio: 'Why we resumed landfill search' She said officers have ""explained fully"" why they are restarting the search to Mr Mckeague's family. ""They are pleased that there is a further active line of inquiry and some hope we may be able to provide the answers.""

Fire risk cable 'in homes across UK',"Some seven million metres of the hazardous cable was destroyed - but the remainder remains unaccounted for and much of it may be in homes or businesses Millions of metres of dangerous electrical cable may be in homes across the UK, a BBC investigation has found. In 2010 it was discovered Atlas Kablo, a now-defunct Turkish company, had sold 11 million metres of cable that posed a potential fire risk in the UK. The Health and Safety Executive decided against a compulsory recall and only seven million metres were recovered. Critics say more should have been done. The HSE insisted its response was proportionate to the risk. The British Approvals Service for Cables (Basec) had found the cable had too little copper, meaning it was at risk of overheating. Chief executive Jeremy Hodge told the BBC: ""We identified about seven million metres, which was intercepted and scrapped, which means four million metres or 40,000 reels of cable are still out there. ""It will be tricky to find - most electricians don't keep a record of where cable has gone and there's no requirement to do that."" The unaccounted-for cable was enough to fully rewire 8,000 houses, electrical experts told the BBC. Under the Electrical Equipment Safety Regulations (1994) it was within the HSE's power to order a full statutory recall of the cable, forcing retailers to act. But after Basec raised the alarm, the HSE decided on a voluntary approach, writing to wholesalers and warning them about the product. It was subsequently found on sale at four branches of Homebase and was still on shelves at the stores as late as 2013, although it is unclear how much of the cable the shops sold. Sam Gluck, technical manager at electrical fire consultants Tower Electrical Fire and Safety, said this approach had ""planted a bomb in the system"". He explained: ""If it overheats, it will ignite anything that touches it. If it's against a plasterboard wall that will ignite. ""There should have been an immediate recall and they [shops and electricians] should have been instructed to hand the cables back."" In laboratory conditions Basec replicated how the cable might reach 150C, melting and giving off smoke Dr Maurizio Bragagni, chief executive of leading London-based cable manufacturer Tratos, said: ""It could be in any shopping centre, any venue, any building."" Of the potential risk of fire, he said: ""On a scale of one to 10 it's an eight. I would not like to have this inside my house."" Andy Slaughter MP, a Labour shadow minister for both housing and London, said: ""It's extremely alarming. It's revealed that we have inadequacy both in the regulations that are there, and we are not enforcing the ones we have."" He pointed out that both the Grenfell disaster and another fire in his Hammersmith constituency were caused by faulty white goods, and said it was sad that it had taken so many deaths to bring the issue of electrical fire safety into sharp focus. ""This shouldn't have happened. This is cable that's now hidden away in peoples' homes and could be a latent problem for years,"" he said. ""Clearly it should have been recalled. The horse has bolted."" The cable was sheathed in grey plastic and marked with the manufacturer's name. Basec advised that anybody worried about the cable in their home should commission an electrician to test the system. The BBC has also learned that after the concerns were raised, a three-year sampling programme carried out by the HSE suggested 5% of cable on the market was not up to safety standards. An HSE spokesman said: ""We acted as soon as we became aware of these claims. After the cabling failed independent tests, we worked to ensure that Atlas Kablo took steps to withdraw or recall the cabling from the market voluntarily. ""As a result, many millions of metres of the non-compliant cabling were taken off the market."" He continued: ""Following this issue, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy funded HSE to carry out a market surveillance project between 2010 and 2012. Most of the tested cabling met the relevant standards. ""HSE reminded distributors of their legal obligations and their liability for trading unsafe products."" A spokeswoman for Homebase said: ""The Atlas Kablo cable was withdrawn from sale in 2010, when Homebase was still owned by Home Retail Group. ""Following a full review, Home Retail Group's team of experts deemed the product low-risk, due to the specified usage of the cable for low-voltage items, and did not issue a public product recall. ""Homebase, which was acquired by Bunnings in February 2016, no longer sells this product. The safety of our customers is our number one priority."" The BBC was unable to trace anyone connected with Atlas Kablo to comment. Grenfell 'cyanide' foam in sheltered homes What happened at Grenfell Tower?

Gunman a high-roller and 'psychopath',"""It was like living next to nothing,"" said a former neighbour of Paddock Las Vegas concert gunman Stephen Paddock was a wealthy former accountant and high-stakes gambler who appeared to be living in quiet retirement with his girlfriend in a desert community. The 64-year-old, of Mesquite, Nevada, had pilot's and hunting licences and no criminal record, said authorities. One former neighbour said twice-divorced Paddock was ""weird"". But his brother described him as a regular guy who liked playing video poker, live music and eating burritos. Is the gunman a terrorist? What we know so far Who are the victims? Paddock has been identified by police as the man behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with the death toll surpassing the 49 killed at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He opened fire from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino on Sunday night, killing 58 people and wounding almost 500 others, before turning the gun on himself as police closed in, said officials. Police shared this updated timeline of events on Wednesday Stephen Paddock had a troubled childhood, with a bank robber for a father, who regularly beat him, and a mother who struggled to bring him and his three brothers up, according to reports. One of the gunman's brothers, Eric Paddock, told reporters the family were stunned. ""He liked to play video poker,"" he said. ""He went on cruises. He sent his mother cookies."" Their father was once on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used Twenty-three weapons were found in the 32nd-floor hotel room that Paddock checked into last Thursday. Police found ""in excess of"" 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his Mesquite home, within a quiet retirement community 80 miles (130km) north-east of Las Vegas. They also found several pounds of an explosive called tannerite, and ammonium nitrate, a type of fertiliser used as an explosive, in his car. From 1976 to 1985 worked as a postman, an Internal Revenue Service agent and an auditor for the Defense Contract Audit Agency Worked for the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin in the 80s Maintained relations with his younger brother Eric but estranged from older brothers Bruce and Patrick Grew up in Sun Valley, California, and attended California State University in Northridge He was married twice and had no children Sources: US media reports Police said no manifesto or anything else had been discovered to explain Paddock's actions. ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,"" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. The FBI said its agents had established no connection between Paddock and any overseas terrorist group, despite so-called Islamic State describing him as a ""soldier of the caliphate"". Paddock only previous known brush with the law was a routine traffic violation. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded David Famiglietti, of the New Frontier Armory, told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in north Las Vegas last spring, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. Country music stars react Five reasons US gun control won't happen Two gun stocks were found in the hotel room, AP news agency reported, which can enable a weapon to fire hundreds of shots per minute. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter According to NBC News,external, Paddock recently made several gambling transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars, but it was unclear if those bets were wins or losses. Bruce Paddock told NBC his brother was a multi-millionaire property investor. This video can not be played Trump on Las Vegas shooting: 'It was an act of pure evil' He had shown no sign of financial problems and reports said he owned a number of properties that he rented out. Separately, Eric Paddock said that Stephen came up with the cash to ensure that family members - including their elderly mother - were provided for. ""Steve took care of the people he loved. He helped make me and my family wealthy. He's the reason I was able to retire. This is the Steve we know, we knew. The people he loved and took care of,""Eric Paddock said in a news conference, according to CBS News,external. He described his brother as ""intelligent"" and ""successful."" This video can not be played Witnesses say people were being trampled Stephen Paddock moved to his two-storey house in Mesquite from Reno, Nevada, in June 2016. He lived in the property in Babbling Brook Court with his girlfriendMarilou Danley, 62. What do we know about Marilou Danley? Police have ruled out any involvement by Ms Danley, who was overseas at the time of the massacre but has nowreturned to the US, where she is facing questioning. She is an Australian citizen who moved to Nevada 20 years ago, the government in Canberra said. Marilou Danley, initially described as a person of interest, was located by police outside of the US A former neighbour, Diane McKay, 79,told the Washington Post,externalthe couple always kept the blinds closed at home. ""He was weird,"" she said. ""Kept to himself. It was like living next to nothing. ""You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet."" Elsewhere the newspaper quoted neighbours in ""several states"" where Paddock owned retirement homes, describing him as ""surly, unfriendly and standoffish"". But those who lived close to a house he owned in Melbourne, Florida, have described him as ""very friendly"". According to US media, Paddock had a licence to fly small planes and owned two aircraft. In 2012, he filed a negligence lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas, after a fall he said was caused by an ""obstruction"" on the floor, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. The legal action was reportedly dropped in 2014. The relative lack of red flags in Paddock's personal history has only heightened the sense of bewilderment as a shocked nation asks: Why?

Calls for Amazon to ban 'anorexia hoodie',"Beth Grant, who has lived with anorexia for 13 years, said selling the product was ""absolutely disgraceful"" Amazon has been described as ""irresponsible"" for selling a hoodie that describes anorexia as ""like bulimia, except with self control"". One woman living with anorexia said it could ""damage"" the mental health of those with the conditions. Anorexia expert Dr Susie Orbach told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the online retailer should ""remove it immediately"". Amazon said the hoodie was not sold on its UK website. It haspreviously been criticisedfor stocking T-shirts which say: ""Keep calm and rape a lot"". Beth Grant, who has lived with anorexia for 13 years, said selling the product was ""absolutely disgraceful"". ""It could be extremely damaging to anyone suffering with either bulimia or anorexia,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I think it could damage their mental health even further and cause them to potentially harm their life."" Dr Susie Orbach, a psychotherapist and expert on anorexia, described the hoodie as ""a way to make people feel really awful"" when they were ""already anguished enough"". ""This is terribly irresponsible on Amazon's part,"" she said. ""We're breeding a culture [where people think] you should transform your body, you should comment on it, and if it isn't the way you want it to be it's got to be some other way."" Dr Orbach called for Amazon to ""remove it immediately"". ""They really don't need to be making money this way,"" she added. Amazon declined to offer a statement, but a spokesman said the hoodie was not available to buy from the company's UK website. Beth Grant said this would make little difference to those with anorexia or bulimia. ""You can still see it on the internet,"" she said. ""It can still harm them, even if they're not wearing it.

'Women's' college fields all-male quiz team,"A former all-female Oxford college, that was set up by a woman for women, has been criticised for fielding an all-male team in University Challenge. St Hugh's College began admitting men in 1987, but presenter Jeremy Paxman joked: ""On the basis of tonight's team, we could be forgiven for thinking they'd (men) rather taken it over."" The quiz show hasfaced complaints in the past,externalthat it is male-dominated. St Hugh's said team members were selected by students. The BBC said each university has its own selection process. Why University Challenge contestants go viral How do you get picked for University Challenge? St Hugh's was set up in 1886 by Elizabeth Wordsworth for women who could not afford the cost of existing colleges. Famous alumnae include Theresa May, politician Barbara Castle and actor and writer Rebecca Front. Some questioned the decision to have an all-male team on social media, including the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of Brighton, Professor Tara Dean: Allow Twitter content?

Catalonia vote: Spain's biggest crisis for a generation,"This video can not be played Spanish police clashed with people trying to get to polling stations to vote The sight of masked police smashing their way into polling stations was evidence - if any were needed - that Catalonia's independence drive has plunged Spain into its biggest political crisis for a generation. After the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spaniards approved the current constitution in 1978. But the democratic will of all political forces was tested, and ultimately consolidated, by an attempted military coup on the night of 23 February, 1981, when Lt Col Antonio Tejero of the Guardia Civil held lawmakers at gunpoint. That night the then king of Spain, Juan Carlos, remained loyal to democracy and the putsch was suppressed. This video can not be played Witness: Spanish Coup The deadly violence of Basque Country militant group Eta also tested Spain's democratic consensus. But the organisation laid down its weapons in 2011 and the stated aim of today's Basque leaders is that they, and Catalonia, be allowed to hold a legal referendum resulting from a negotiation with Madrid. Spain profile - history timeline It is unclear how the Catalan crisis can be resolved. Spain's conservative Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, defended Sunday's fierce crackdown, making no mention of the more than 800 people injured while participating in a ballot deemed illegal by Spanish courts. ""We did what we had to do. We are the government of Spain and, as its leader, I assume my responsibility,"" he said. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is also sticking stubbornly to his script, saying the Yes vote is a first step on the road to declaring independence and creating a new republic. Barcelona the day after: Catalan students protest against Spanish police Read more of our Catalonia coverage: Who will move next in Catalan crisis? Catalans 'not seeking traumatic split' A tale of two Spanish cities - and one divisive vote Powerful images from Catalan referendum Where, some Spaniards ask, is today's king in the midst of a political crisis that threatens the future of his kingdom? ""Where is he? He should be defending our cause,"" said a woman who only wished to be named as Africa, at an anti-independence demonstration in Madrid. While Juan Carlos enjoyed an active role in the cut and thrust of politics, King Felipe cuts a distant figure. He has cancelled all appointments for the coming week, but the Royal Household said there were no plans for meetings or public statements at this stage. Meanwhile, across Spain, criticism of the Rajoy administration's dogged defence of the constitutional status quo is not confined to Catalan and Basque nationalists. The leaders of Spain's second- and third-largest parties, the traditionally socialist PSOE and left-wing Podemos, both expressed alarm at the images beamed around the world of heavy-handed police intervention. PSOE's Pedro SÃ¡nchez said Spain was in need of a ""national political regeneration"", while Podemos chief Pablo Iglesias expressed his ""disgust at what [Rajoy's] Popular Party is doing to our democracy"".

What will stop these self-driving lorries colliding?,"Scania believes 5G could improve communications between ""platooning"" lorries What impact could 5G - the new high-speed mobile technology being trialled around the world - have on the way we work and play? Swedish transport company Scania believes lorries could use far less fuel if they drove much closer together, controlled by wirelessly communicating onboard computers. But to prevent these ""platooning"" lorries crashing into each other, you'd better be sure your communications are fast and reliable. So Scania is working with Ericsson on trials of the new 5G (fifth generation) wireless broadband technology, due to be rolled out globally in 2020. It promises much faster data transfer speeds, greater coverage and more efficient use of the spectrum bandwidth. ""Platooning works very well with wi-fi, but in dense traffic situations with many vehicles communicating, 5G is designed to offer more reliable communication,"" says Andreas Hoglund, Scania's senior engineer for intelligent transport systems. This is because 5G direct communication is designed to handle fast moving objects and congestion more efficiently, he says. ""Faster communication will make it possible to reduce the distance between vehicles in the platoon, which might further reduce the air drag and give positive effects on fuel consumption,"" he explains. This could help create ""a more efficient, greener"" world. This video can not be played WATCH: What is 5G? 5G is designed to accommodate the growing number of devices reliant on a mobile internet connection - from fridges to cars - and is 10 times faster than the highest speed 4G can manage. ""It will enable a lot of applications which were unthinkable before,"" says Mischa Dohler, professor in wireless communications at King's College London. South Korea has plans to implement 5G for the Winter Olympics in February 2018, giving visitors access to virtual reality (VR) content on their mobiles. One of the UK's first 5G test-beds is in Brighton, where non-profit innovation hub, Digital Catapult Centre, has just completed a series of workshops for small businesses. ""Hypothetically, 5G is fast enough to download a 100GB 4K movie in two-and-a-half minutes,"" says Richard Scott, innovation manager at Digital Catapult. ""But it isn't just about speed - [5G] has specific features that will unlock and enable new technologies."" Chiefly, these include fewer dropped connections and lower latency - the time it takes for data to be stored or retrieved. Could wood pulp make cars lighter and more efficient? Where will the deadly floods strike next? How 'the invisible network' poses a major security threat Why switching to fully electric cars will take time ""Wi-fi is fine if you are sitting with a few people in a meeting, or moving slowly around indoors,"" explains Rahim Tafazolli, head of Surrey University's 5G Innovation Centre. ""However, once you start to move quickly and the number of people increases to more than 10 - at Waterloo Station, for example - you need to have a system that can hand over connection between radio cells without causing a drop in signal, and which can accommodate several people simultaneously. ""Wi-fi can't do that."" This is because every wi-fi signal has a defined range, whereas 5G will be flexible, enabling mobile devices to switch automatically between the various newly available frequencies. One frequency will be for long-range connections, across rural areas for example; one will be for urban environments, providing high numbers of users with high-speed connectivity; and there will also be a high-capacity frequency for densely populated areas, such as sports stadiums and railway terminals. This flexibility will lead to ""an ever-expanding array of new business services"", Mr Tafazolli believes, and could be critical to the success of autonomous vehicles and the internet of things. Faster wireless connectivity should also give VR and augmented reality (AR) technologies a boost, argues Digital Catapult's Mr Scott. Faster mobile connectivity could greatly improve virtual reality experiences ""If you have a very detailed, immersive VR experience and you try to run it over a mobile headset currently, there is enough latency... that it makes you feel sick,"" he explains. So high-quality VR experiences rely on headsets being ""tethered"" to a computer, which provides the necessary computing power. 5G offers the opportunity to recreate high-quality experiences on the move. ""It could enable you to have an experience comparable with home gaming on your mobile,"" says Mr Scott, ""allowing you to compete or collaborate with other people in real time."" Andy Cummins of Brighton-based digital agency, Cogapp, says 5G will allow his firm to create much more exciting AR and VR content for visitors to museums and galleries. ""Without [5G] these types of experiences... would at best seem laggy and unintuitive,"" he says. And Tim Fleming, founder of Future Visual, another Brighton company preparing to trial 5G, says: ""We are very interested in in-store retail VR experiences, and creating a flagship VR experience that can be taken to any location. ""At the moment we have to use a dedicated PC, but with 5G you just need a headset and a mobile device. The heavy lifting is done in the cloud. That's very interesting."" 5G enthusiasts say it could underpin smart cities and augmented reality services Of course, 5G roll-out is not without its technical challenges. Installing all the base stations and antennae is very expensive, and many of today's devices will not be compatible with the new technology. It is not clear at the moment who is going to pay for it. But Ericsson's head of 5G commercialisation, Thomas Noren, is confident that 5G services will be cheaper to run because the network will be more energy efficient and production and operational costs will be lower. There is clearly still much detail to iron out, but research consultancy Ovum predicts that there will be 389 million 5G subscriptions globally by the end of 2022. Users still struggling with patchy 4G coverage maybe forgiven for being a little sceptical about the ambitious claims being made for 5G. But the potential to transform a number of businesses - and create many new ones - is clearly there.

Scottish government backs fracking ban,"The decision has drawn praise from environmental groups but criticism from industry The Scottish government has announced an ""effective ban"" on fracking. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse told MSPs that the practice ""cannot and will not take place in Scotland"". He said an existing moratorium on the technique, which has been in place since 2015, would continue ""indefinitely"" after a consultation showed ""overwhelming"" opposition. The government will seek Holyrood's endorsement for the ban in a vote following the October recess. But with only the Conservatives now opposed to a ban, the vote is likely to be a formality. The move was welcomed by environmental groups but has been slammed by Ineos, operators of the huge Grangemouth petrochemical plant, which holds fracking exploration licences across 700 square miles of the country. Scotland and fracking: how did we get here? The Scottish government has previously imposed asimilar block on underground coal gasification(UCG) - a separate technique used to extract gas from coal seams deep underground - on environmental grounds. It followed the introduction of a moratorium on both fracking and UCG in 2015, which sawa series of expert reportspublished on the potential health, environmental and economic impact of the controversial techniques, as well as apublic consultation being carried out. Mr Wheelhouse said the consultation came back with ""overwhelming"" opposition to fracking, with 99% of the 60,000 respondents supporting a ban. He said this showed that ""there is no social licence for unconventional oil and gas to be taken forward at this time"". Paul Wheelhouse said there was overwhelming public opposition to fracking The move comes almost exactly a year on from the UK governmentgiving the go-aheadto horizontal fracking in Lancashire. Shale gas is currently processed in Scotland at a site in Grangemouth, having beenshipped in from abroad, but cannot be extracted from beneath Scottish soil under the current moratorium, which is enforced through planning regulations. Mr Wheelhouse said local authorities would be instructed to continue this moratorium ""indefinitely"" - calling this ""action sufficient to effectively ban the development of unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland"". He said: ""The decision I am announcing today means that fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland."" Look back on the fracking statement on Holyrood Live Mr Wheelhouse's announcement was welcomed by environmental groups, with Friends of the Earth Scotland and WWF Scotland both hailing a victory for campaigners. WWF Scotland official Sam Gardner said it was ""excellent news"", saying ""the climate science is clear"" that fossil fuels should be ""left in the ground"". Mary Church from Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was a ""huge win for the anti-fracking movement"" which would be ""warmly welcomed across the country and around the world"". However Ineos said the move could see ""large numbers of Scottish workers leaving the country to find work"". Tom Pickering, operations director of Ineos Shale, said: ""It is a sad day for those of us who believe in evidence-led decision making. The Scottish government has turned its back on a potential manufacturing and jobs renaissance and lessened Scottish academia's place in the world by ignoring its findings."" Ken Cronin of UK Onshore Oil and Gas also said it was a ""poor decision"", which ignored ""extensive independent research"" and was ""based on dogma not evidence or geopolitical reality"". And the GMB Scotland trade union said the move was ""mired in dishonesty"" and ""an abandonment of the national interest"", saying Scotland would now be dependent on gas shipped in from ""the likes of Qatar and Russia"". The first shipment of shale gas from the US arrived at Grangemouth in September 2016 The Scottish Conservatives also said Scotland would miss out on a ""much needed economic boost"" and high-skilled jobs as a result of the decision. Tory MSP Dean Lockhart said ministers had ignored scientific and economic evidence to take a ""short-sighted and economically damaging decision which is nothing more than a bid to appease the green elements of the pro-independence movement"". However Labour MSP Claudia Beamish said the move did not go far enough, arguing that ministers were merely extending the existing moratorium which ""could be overturned at any point at the whim of a minister"". Ms Beamish has amember's bill tabledat Holyrood calling for a ""full legal ban"", but Mr Wheelhouse said this would not be needed until his proposals. The Scottish Greens said the announcement was ""a step in the right direction"". However, they also wanted a more permanent ban, with MSP Mark Ruskell saying the moratorium was ""legally shaky"" and open to challenge. This was also echoed by Friends of the Earth Scotland, with Ms Church saying ministers should ""go further than relying on planning powers"" and ""instead commit to passing a law to ban the fracking industry for good"". Scottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur welcomed the decision, saying that ministers had taken the ""scenic route"" but had ultimately decided ""effectively to ban fracking"". MSPs havepreviously voted to support a banon fracking, but SNP members abstained from that vote. Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. The extensive use of fracking in the US, where it has revolutionised the energy industry, has prompted environmental concerns. The first is that fracking uses huge amounts of water that must be transported to the fracking site, at significant environmental cost. The second is the worry that potentially carcinogenic chemicals used may escape and contaminate groundwater around the fracking site. But the industry suggests fracking of shale gas could contribute significantly to the UK's future energy needs Find out more.... Scotland and fracking: How did we get here?

How Trump turned against gun control,"This video can not be played Trump on Las Vegas shooting: 'It was an act of pure evil' When attempting to interpret Donald Trump's statements on firearm regulation, and how they could shape a presidential policy response to the Las Vegas mass shooting, the key is to note when he said them. As with many of his political opinions, Mr Trump's views on gun control have shifted to the right over the years. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Mr Trump expressed support for a ban on so-called assault weapons - long rifles with military-style features to more easily fire multiple rounds. ""I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,"" he wrote in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve. In 2012 Mr Trump praised Democrat Barack Obama's call for more firearm regulation after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, school that claimed 26 lives, including 20 children. As Mr Trump began more seriously contemplating a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, however, his views on gun control changed. By the time he announced his entry into the race in 2015, he was well within the mainstream of the Republican Party, which viewed most forms of additional gun regulation as a violation of Second Amendment constitutional protections. It was Mr Trump's way of establishing his conservative cultural bona fides - proving that he wasn't the big-city liberal he had at times seemed. In an October 2015Republican debate,external, for instance, he boasted that he carried handguns ""a lot"" and said government-mandated gun-free zones in places like schools, churches and military bases were a ""catastrophe"" and made for ""target practice for the sickos"". Mr Trump would frequently say the answer to mass shootings was having more citizens with firearms - contending that the death toll in the Paris and San Bernardino attacks would have been much lower if bullets had been going ""both ways"" - towards the victims and the assailants. Trump at a National Rifle Association event, the largest US gun lobby, in April To the surprise of many, Mr Trump secured the endorsement of the National Rifle Association in May 2016, at a time when some Republicans were still uncomfortable with the New Yorker as their presumptive nominee. ""Now is the time to unite,"" NRA Executive Director Chris Cox said at the time. ""If your preferred candidate got out of the race, it's time to get over it."" From then on Mr Trump - in his statements and on his campaign website - largely echoed the NRA's hard line on firearm issues. The group would end up spending more than $30m (Â£22m) to support Mr Trump's presidential bid. During the general election, Mr Trump attacked Democrat Hillary Clinton as being in favour of stringent gun control and pledged that he was the candidate that would protect the rights of the estimated 55 million Americans who currently own firearms. There was one moment during last year's campaign, however, when Mr Trump did break with the NRA's line. After the Orlando nightclub shooting in June, he appeared to endorse limiting gun purchase for national security purposes. ""I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns,"" he tweeted. Nothing came of that meeting, however, and as president Mr Trump appears to have made little effort to follow through on it. Mr Trump's only significant action on guns as president has been to sign a law rolling-back Obama-era limitations on the ability of those being treated for mental illness to purchase firearms. During a recent campaign rally in Alabama, Mr Trump even revisited his old attacks against Mrs Clinton, warning ""you'd be handing in your rifles"" if she had been elected. Congress is currently considering legislation that would make it easier for Americans to purchase silencers for their weapons - a proposal Mrs Clinton criticised in atweet,externalafter the Las Vegas attack. The president, so far, has not commented publicly on the legislation, which was expected to be approved by the House of Representatives but has little chance of passage in the Senate. If the legislation becomes the centre of post-Las Vegas political controversy, however, it may be difficult for the White House to stay above the fray. In the meantime, Mr Trump now has the unenviable task of trying to heal the nation after yet another ""deadliest mass shooting in modern US history"" and explaining what - if anything - he proposes to do to stop future tragedies. George W Bush's turn came in April 2007, as a shocked nation mourned 32 dead on a Virginia college campus. Barack Obama had his moment in June 2016, following the Orlando Pulse nightclub attack that left 49 dead. ""This massacre is â¦ a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theatre, or in a nightclub,"" he said after Orlando. ""And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well."" This video can not be played Barack Obamaâs mass shooting speeches The story of Mr Trump's response is still unfolding. The number of dead has risen to 58, with the estimated number of wounded an astounding, incomprehensible 500. After tweeting out his ""warmest sympathies"" to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting on Monday morning, Mr Trump took to the lectern at the White House to deliver a statement heavy on prayers, mourning and calls for unity but light on hints of what comes next. During his morning remarks the president said that, in the search for ""meaning in the chaos"", answers do not come easy. In coming days and weeks ahead, many answers for how to respond to the bloodshed in Las Vegas will be offered. They're already pouring in from the president's friends and critics. Many will be policies - often contradictory - that Mr Trump, at one time or another, has supported.

Police hunt for Las Vegas killer's motive,"This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes Police are working to establish the motive behind a mass shooting which left 59 people dead and another 527 injured at a Las Vegas concert. Gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival on Sunday evening. Police found 23 guns in his hotel room, as well as firearms and explosives at his Nevada home. But as yet, no clear reason for the killing has emerged. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State (IS). Some investigators have suggested Paddock had a history of mental illness, but there is no confirmation of this. Paddock had no criminal record and was not known to police. In his latest comment on the shootings, President Donald Trump said he would be ""talking about gun laws as times goes by"". Speaking to reporters at the White House, he gave no further detail on the gun laws issue. Mr Trump described the gunman as a ""very, very sick individual"". Las Vegas shooting - what we know How Trump turned against gun control Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas Stephen Paddock, a former accountant with a big gambling habit, lived in a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite, north-east of Las Vegas. He reportedly lived with a woman called Marilou Danley who was out of the country in Japan and did not appear to be involved in the shootings, police said. Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said that when police searched the property after the attack, they found 19 ""additional firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo, along with some electronic devices we're evaluating at this point"". Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Officers also found ammonium nitrate in Paddock's car. David Famiglietti of the New Frontier Armory told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in North Las Vegas in the spring of this year, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. The fast shooting rate audible in recordings of Sunday night's attack indicates that Paddock may have modified his guns with legal accessories to make them fire at speeds approaching those of automatic weapons. Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer? Despite the large cache of weapons found in the killer's home, his brother, Eric, is struggling to accept that he acted in this way. He said he was ""in shock, horrified, completely dumbfounded"". IS has claimed to be behind the attack, saying Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter The IS claim of responsibility for the Las Vegas attack is very unusual in that the perpetrator's profile does not fit that of supporters or ""soldiers"" that the group has claimed in the past, writes Mina al-Lami, who monitors jihadist groups for the BBC. The FBI said it had found ""no connection to an international terrorist organisation"". The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. According to police, Paddock had booked into the hotel four days earlier, on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room Sheriff Lombardo said there were 10 suitcases in the suite, which had two rooms. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. The fake photos shared after tragedies What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting It is thought he moved between two windows in his suite as he carried out the attack. ""One man had blood all over him and that's when I knew something was seriously wrong,"" Mike Thompson from London told the BBC. ""People were running and there was chaos."" Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene were placed on police lockdown and parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut. The authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of those killed. But many have been identified by family members and in local media. They include a 29-year-old nurse who was shot in the back while he tried to save his wife, a Navy veteran who had just returned from a tour of Afghanistan, and an off-duty police officer who also coached youth football. More on the victims 'Pandemonium' on the Strip Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as gun owners. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement from the couple on the steps of the Capitol, saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

Coogan awarded damages over hacking,"This video can not be played Steve Coogan said the phone hacking was ""a disgrace"" to the record of the newspaper group Comedian Steve Coogan is to receive a six-figure sum in damages from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) after it admitted to unlawful phone hacking. Speaking after the High Court judgement, the actor and comedian said he felt ""vindicated"" by the agreement. It follows an action by Coogan for misuse of his private information. Publisher Trinity Mirror said it had ""no comment"" on the case but lawyers for MGN, which is part of Trinity Mirror, said the group had apologised. MGN's lawyer admitted Coogan was the target of unlawful activities and that they were concealed until years later. They said: ""MGN apologises to Mr Coogan and accepts that he and other victims should not have been denied the truth for so long."" The exact figure of the settlement has not been revealed - but most of the money would be distributed to good causes, Coogan said. More than40 celebrities have already settled phone-hacking claimsagainst MGN, including Lord Archer, footballer Kevin Keegan and actresses Patsy Kensit and Michelle Collins. Clockwise (L-R) Kevin Keegan, Patsy Kensit, Lord Jeffrey Archer, Denise Van Outen, Joe Swash, Michelle Collins They were resolved by the payment of undisclosed sums and an apology from the newspaper group. Phone hacking was used to listen to people's mobile voicemails, giving journalists access to private information to use for stories. Coogan's lawyer, David Sherborne, told the court that the Mirror had written stories using unlawfully obtained personal information - including phone hacking, from third parties and surveillance by private investigators. He claimed 62 news articles were ""likely to have been produced by use of these means,"" adding that they caused ""enormous distress"" to Coogan, who wrongly suspected people he knew were leaking his private information. Before bringing the case, Coogan gave evidence to theLeveson Inquiryinto press ethics, which was launched in 2011 after revelations of phone-hacking first became public and concluded in 2012. It followed the closure of the News of the World by its owner, Rupert Murdoch, following the revelation that the mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler had been hacked. Coogan's lawyer said his participation in the inquiry led to a number of attacks on him by national newspapers. The actor then complained to MGN in July 2015 and it admitted to misusing his private information. Coogan issued his claim in October 2016, and tried to find out the extent of the wrongdoing and identify the relevant newspaper articles. Coogan believed that if Trinity Mirror had conducted a proper investigation at an early stage, then the unlawful activity could have been stopped - and prevented the distress and damage it caused its victims, their family and friends, his lawyer said.

Sale of acids to under-18s to be banned,"The government will ban the sale of acids to anyone under the age of 18, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said. Her pledge, at the Conservative Party conference, comes as more than 400 attacks using corrosive substances were recorded in the six months to April. She also said she would ""drastically limit"" sales of sulphuric acid, given that it can be used to make explosives. And Ms Rudd called on internet firms and social media platforms to ""act now"" and remove extremist content online. Speaking at the conference in Manchester, she said: ""Acid attacks are absolutely revolting. ""We have all seen the pictures of victims that never fully recover - endless surgeries, lives ruined. ""So today, I am also announcing a new offence, to prevent the sale of acids to under-18s."" What has led to the rise to acid attacks? Sharp rise in acid attacks in London 'It felt like fire' - acid attack victim The government said new laws to target people caught carrying acid would be modelled on current legislation around knife carrying, which carries a maximum of four years in prison, a fine, or both. Plans to tackle the sale of corrosive substances would be similar to the law involving knives, which bans the sale to anyone under the age of 18 and carries a penalty of six months in prison, or a fine. ""We are currently considering the range of substances this would cover,"" the government added. More than 400 acid or corrosive substance attacks were carried out in the six months to April this year, according to figures from 39 police forces in England and Wales. According to NHS Digital data, there have been 624 admissions since 2011/12 because of an ""assault by corrosive substance"". In 2016/17, there were 109 hospital admissions due to such attacks. Mrs Rudd said the ""drastic"" crackdown on the sale of sulphuric acid would help tackle homemade explosive devices containing triacetone triperoxide - often referred to as ""mother of Satan"" explosives. Similar devices were used in this year's Manchester Arena bombing and last month's attack at Parsons Green, in west London. ""This is how we help make our communities safer as crime changes,"" she told delegates. The home secretary also unveiled plans to make it harder for people under the age of 18 to buy knives online and announced a major investment in technology to help track down indecent images of children online and remove them quickly. She announced more than Â£500,000 of investment in a ""cutting-edge web crawler"", which experts say can process thousands of image hashes per second as a way of removing child abuse images. This video can not be played Andreas Christopheros was attacked with acid in 2013 Mrs Rudd told the conference there had been ""an exponential surge in the volume of child sexual abuse referrals"" and called on messaging service WhatsApp to help tackle the problem. ""Our investment will also enable internet companies to proactively search for, and destroy, illegal images in their systems,"" she said. ""We want them to start using it as soon as they can."" In another policy announcement, she also said people who repeatedly view extremist material onlinecould face up to 15 years in prison. She said extending prison sentence for those viewing extremist content online would close an important gap in the legislation, with tougher sentences only applying at the moment if people have downloaded or stored the material. Ms Rudd told party activists in Manchester that security services had foiled seven terrorist plots this year. Longer jail terms for web terror viewers I survived an acid attack.

Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more?,"Bump-stocks can be fitted to standard semi-automatic rifles like the Colt AR-15 Police say that the gunman who killed almost 60 people at a concert in Las Vegas had outfitted a legal but controversial accessory onto 12 of his semi-automatic rifles to enable them to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. Officials say that theses devices - known as bump-stocks - have been found along with 23 guns inside Stephen Paddock's room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Bump-stocks, or slide fire adapters, allow semi-automatic rifles to fire at a high rate, similar to a machine gun, but can be obtained without the extensive background checks required of purchasing automatic weapons. Audioanalysis,externalof one clip estimated that about 90 rounds were unleashed in only 10 seconds - far faster than a human being could repeatedly pull a trigger. Lawmakers have questioned the legality of these devices while gun owners - sensing a legislative crackdown -have reportedly begun stockpiling them,external. Las Vegas shooting - what we know How Trump turned against gun control Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer? One of the rifles recovered from the crime scene appears to be fitted with a bump stock Since Congress passed the Firearm Owners' Protection Act in 1986, it has beenrelatively difficult,externalfor civilians to buy new, fully automatic weapons, which reload automatically and fire continuously as long as the trigger is depressed. However, thousands of ""grandfathered"" weapons - those manufactured and registered before 1986 - can still be bought but are very expensive and all sales must be approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes It is alsoillegal,externalto modify the internal components of semi-automatic rifles - which typically manage about 60 aimed shots per minute - to make them fully automatic. Gun owners can instead legally buy accessories to increase the rate of fire. One option is a ""trigger crank,external"", ""hellfire trigger"", or ""gat crank"", which bolts onto the trigger guard of a semi-automatic rifle and depresses the trigger several times with every rotation. But the bump-stock, which was used by Stephen Paddock in Sunday's Las Vegas shooting, harnesses a rifle'srecoil,external. It replaces the weapon's stock, which is held against the shoulder, and allows the rest of the rifle to slide back and forward with every shot despite having no mechanical parts or springs. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used The motion makes the trigger collide with, or bump, the shooter's finger as long as they apply forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and rearward pressure with the shooting hand. Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in 2012, California Senator Dianne Feinsteinintroduced,externala bill that sought to ban bump-stocks and similar devices, saying that manufacturers were exploiting ""loopholes"" to circumvent gun laws. However, the bill was defeated in the Senate. In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, Mrs Feinstein re-introduced a bill on Wednesday that would outlaw the sale and possession of bump-stock equipment and other similar devices.

Monarch chief 'devastated' at closure,"This video can not be played The chief executive of failed airline Monarch tells Today projected losses were too great to stay operating Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield has said he is ""absolutely devastated"" at the airline's collapse. Mr Swaffield said the decision not to continue trading was made on Saturday night after estimating that losses for 2018 would be ""well over Â£100m"". He toldthe BBC's Today programmethat Monday was a ""heartbreaking day"". Meanwhile, the first stage of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) rescue scheme led to nearly 12,000 people being brought back to the UK on Monday. A similar number of people are due to return to the UK on Tuesday. Monarch Airlines ceased trading early on Monday, leading to nearly 1,900 job losses and the cancellation of all its flights and holidays. The collapse of the 50-year old company is the largest ever for a UK airline. Mr Swaffield said every effort was being made to help Monarch's staff Mr Swaffield blamed the company's demise on ""terrorism and the closure of some markets like Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt,"" which led to more competition on routes to Spain and Portugal. ""Flights were being squeezed into a smaller number of destinations and a 25% reduction in ticket prices on our routes created a massive economic challenge for our short-haul network,"" he told the BBC. What are your rights? The rise and fall of Monarch 'Shock and anger' among passengers Four reasons why Monarch failed He explained that it was impossible for the airline to keep on flying beyond the weekend once the decision to close had been taken. ""The UK insolvency framework doesn't allow airlines to continue flying unlike in Germany and Italy, where we see that Air Berlin and Alitalia continued when they were in administration. ""We tried to operate a normal schedule all day Sunday so we could be ready for the CAA rescue flights on Monday morning without causing a massive backlog."" This video can not be played What happened when passengers turned up at Manchester airport for their flights? Mr Swaffield said the staff at Monarch had been a ""great family"" and said every effort was being made to find new employment for the 2,000 people who had lost their jobs. ""We are doing all we can,"" he said. ""We are talking to our competitor airlines, trying to organise job fairs and trying to connect staff with our competitors. ""We also have hundreds of head office staff in Luton and are trying to organise the same kind of conversations with employers in Luton and Bromley."" Administrators KPMG said all Monarch employees would receive packs of correspondence later this week to help them with making claims to the Redundancy Payments Office. CAA chair Dame Deirdre Huttontold the BBCthat their programme to return holidaymakers to the UK had got off to a good start. ""Day one went really well and day two is going well so far but it is a huge undertaking and I'm sure there will be some glitches on the way,"" she said. Dame Deirdre denied that the collapse of Monarch and cancellation of some winter flights by Ryanair meant that the airline industry was in trouble. ""The industry is very buoyant and during this year passenger numbers have been up, airlines have been doing very well and airports have been reporting record numbers of passengers,"" she said. She also explained why the CAA could not act before Monarch's announcement, even though it was known the firm was in difficulty. ""The regulator really can't step in until a company goes into administration, that is completely a matter for the company directors,"" she said. ""It would be neither possible nor legal for us to give out confidential financial information while a company is still operating legally. ""Monarch didn't own the planes, the planes were leased so as soon as the company went into administration, the owners of the planes took them back and that's why we've had to acquire planes from 16 different countries."" The government is set to pick up the tab for flying Monarch passengers home, but is talking to credit card companies about sharing some of the cost. Customers in the UKyet to travel:Don't go to the airport, the CAA says Customers abroad:Everyone due to fly in the next fortnight will be brought back to the UK at no cost to them up to 15 October.

MH370 mystery 'inconceivable in modern era',"MH370 was carrying 239 people when it disappeared in 2014 Australian investigators have delivered their final report into missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370, saying it is ""almost inconceivable"" the aircraft has not been found. MH370 disappeared in 2014 while flying to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. The search for the jet, also involving Malaysia and China, was called off in January after 1,046 days. Australian searchers said they ""deeply regretted"" it had not been found. ""It is almost inconceivable and certainly societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era with 10 million passengers boarding commercial aircraft every day, for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board,"" the Australian Transport Safety Bureausaid,externalon Tuesday. ""Despite the extraordinary efforts of hundreds of people involved in the search from around the world, the aircraft has not been located."" Their final report reiterated estimates fromDecemberandAprilthat the Boeing 777 was most likely located in a 25,000 sq-km (9,700 sq-miles) area to the north of the earlier search zone in the southern Indian Ocean. Families criticise MH370 search halt Missing Malaysia plane MH370: What we know Relatives of those missing have called for the search to be resumed The hunt formed one of the largest surface and underwater searches in aviation history. After the initial 52-day surface search failed, investigators trawled the sea floor and ultimately ruled out an area of more than 120,000 sq km. In 2015 and 2016, suspected debris from MH370 washed up on islands in the Indian Ocean and the east coast of Africa. Investigators came up with its current likely location after analysing drift modelling of debris and satellite data. In the report, investigators said their understanding of MH370's location was ""better now than it has ever been"". The Australian government has said only ""credible"" new evidence will prompt it to resume the search. The Malaysian government is continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance.

Is Mumbai India's most unliveable city?,"People say the stampede that killed 23 people on Friday was an accident waiting to happen A deadly stampede at a busy Mumbai station that killed 23 people last Friday has caused anger, not only because it could have been avoided, but because residents feel that it is yet another example of the city suffering due to officials' apathy, writes the BBC's Ayeshea Perera. The feeling is overwhelming. The stampede at Mumbai's Elphinstone Road railway station was an accident waiting to happen. The stairway leading out of the station into a busy office district in central Mumbai was far too narrow to handle the thousands of passengers who used the station every single day. Daily commuters spoke of how it would unnervingly shake every time a train pulled in or out of the station. Mumbai, with a population of roughly 22 million, is the world's fourth most populated city.  And population has been its nemesis. Surrounded by water on three sides, the city has no space to expand.  And the result is an enormous pressure on public services. There had been a number of petitions to civic authorities, asking for Elphinstone bridge to be renovated, but to no avail. ""The foot overbridge and staircases are cramped, and the station was always at risk of a stampede. We often brought this up, but railway authorities ignored our concerns,"" Subash Gupta, a member of Mumbai's railway passengers' association told BBC Marathi. A report said Mumbai's residents showed an unusual ""willingness to put up with inconveniences for a livelihood"" In a twist of irony, one newspaper reported that the long overdue funds to renovate the station bridges had been granted on the same day as the deadly accident. Another quoted the former minister of railways Suresh Prabhu as saying he had allocated 120m rupees ($1.8m;Â£1.3m) towards boosting theinfrastructure in 2015,externaland did not know why it had not been used. Public documents accessedby a television channel,externalshow that of that sum, a meagre 1,000 rupees had been set aside for the repairs. And it's not just the railways that are the problem. A few weeks ago, heavy rains caused severe flooding, stranding tens of thousands of residents as roads literally turned into rivers. A few days later, a residential building collapsed, killing more than 30 people. The crumbling infrastructure of India's financial capital seems to be breaking down all at once. Mumbai railway station stampede kills 22 Heavy rains bring Mumbai to a standstill Mumbai flooding causes transport chaos TheMumbai Human Development Report,externalof 2009, noted that a ""willingness to put up with inconveniences for a livelihood"" appear to be among the unique features of the city's residents. So inconveniences like cramped and unhygienic housing, diminishing open space and crowded train travel are accepted as part and parcel of daily life. But now people have just about had enough. The anger is palpable. Fed up residents are being vocal about how much they feel their city is suffering due to political and official apathy. Allow Twitter content?

Politicians either don't understand or they don't care. Mumbai pays a bulk of India's taxes, but it gets nothing back,"" senior urban planner Chandrashekhar Prabhu told the BBC. The problem, according to Mr Prabhu, is that Mumbai is being ""slowly strangled"" by politicians and corporate lobbies who treat the city as a ""milking cow"" and have no sense of responsibility towards its people. ""We only notice when a stampede kills 23 people in one go. But about eight to 10 people die every day in stations due to issues like unsafe crossings and overcrowding. It's become so normal, no-one talks about it. It's like these deaths mean nothing"". Mumbai's train system, according to a 2010 estimate by the World Bank, suffers from some of the most severe overcrowding in the world, carrying 4,500 passengers in trains with a rated capacity of just 1,700. It funded a project to increase the number of carriages from 9 to 12 in an effort to decongest the lines, but the project took so long that, by the time it was implemented, it did very little to change the situation. Naresh Fernandes, the editor of Indian news portal scroll.in and an author of several books on the city, said the lack of planning in Mumbai could only be described as ""criminal"". Some urban planners believe Mumbai's infrastructure is in serious trouble ""Mumbai has had so many wake up calls and yet it's as if these things don't sink in,"" he told the BBC. ""Take the terrible flooding the city saw in 2005. There was so much anger and yet officials continue to pass and enact policies that only exacerbate the issue."" The 2005 Mumbai floods, when the city received an unprecedented 944 mm of rain, killed some 500 people and brought the city to a complete halt. The airport was shut for more than 30 hours, offices and schools were closed and citizens were stranded in waist deep water across the city. The biggest issue at the heart of everything, both Mr Prabu and Mr Fernandes say, is poor urban planning, driven by Mumbai's high real estate values and a powerful builders lobby that influences policy in the city. The result is that money is sucked out of essential public infrastructure projects and pushed instead into things like clearing land for new housing projects, gated communities for the very rich and infrastructure projects that not everyone can use. ""Mumbai is being taken away from its people,"" said Mr Fernandes who described this as his ""pet peeve"". ""It has given up on the notion of the public."" The 2005 floods were a ""wake up call"" that have not been heeded, says local journalist Naresh Fernandes Mr Fernandes alleged that the railways suffered in particular because there was no money or kickbacks to be had from them any more. ""This is why we end up with things like sea links and the upcoming coastal road, which are essentially vanity projects,"" he said. Travel expert Sudhir Badami believes that part of the solution, at least, is a radical overhaul of the transport system. He is an avid proponent of introducing a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system to ease the congestion on the railways and give people another viable commuting option. But Mr Fernandes says that Mumbai's citizenry also has to stand up and be counted. ""It is a callous system. It is tempting to blame individuals and yes, we are being serviced very badly, but plastic is in the drains because someone put it there. We should also take some responsibility.""

Thank you Tom Petty for all the music. To me you will live forever."" Petty also found solo success in 1989 with his album Full Moon Fever, which featured one of his most popular songs, Free Fallin', co-written with Jeff Lynne. In 2002, Petty was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This video can not be played Tom Petty was known for his songs American Girl and and Free Fallin' Petty was born in Gainesville, Florida, on 20 October, 1950. He endured a rough childhood, living in poverty with an alcoholic, abusive father  - but his life changed in 1961 when he met Elvis Presley and shook his hand. ""That was the end of doing anything other than music with my life,"" he said. He joined two bands at school, The Sundowners and The Epics, before dropping out to play with Mudcrutch, aged 17. After that band broke up, Petty and several of its members formed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, releasing their debut album in 1976. Tom Petty (right) and The Heartbreakers just last week wrapped up a tour to mark 40 years of the band Their career was slow to take off, but heavy touring - including a well-received support slot with future E Street Band member Nils Lofgren in the UK - eventually pushed them into the chart. Over the next four decades, they became one of rock's most reliable live acts, doggedly sticking to their no-frills rock template, and producing a stream of radio staples including Don't Come Around Here No More and the Stevie Nicks duet Stop Draggin' My Heart Around. Petty scored solo hits with the platinum-selling albums Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers, while the 1991 album Into The Great Wide Open gave the band a number one single, Learning To Fly. The video for the title track was also in constant rotation on MTV, thanks in no small part to cameos by Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway and a then-unknown Matt LeBlanc. Petty gave his last live shows just a week ago, playing three sold-out dates at the Hollywood Bowl as part of a 40th anniversary tour. Last December,he told Rolling Stone magazine,external: ""I'd be lying if I didn't say I was thinking this might be the last big one. We're all on the backside of our 60s.

Family's tragedy becomes Netflix film,"This video can not be played The film Kingdom of Us is due for a 13 October release A mother and her seven children trying to come to terms with their father's suicide have had their story turned into a Netflix documentary. Vikie Shanks from Warwickshire, whose husband Paul died in September 2007, said the film was ""brutally honest"". Six of her children, who were aged six to 16 at the time, are on the autism spectrum, and she hopes the film will raise awareness about the condition. Lucy Cohen spent three years filming the family forKingdom of Us,external. It will be premiered at theLondon Film Festival,externalon Saturday and released globally on Netflix on 13 October. There are six daughters and one son in the Shanks family Filmmaker Cohen described the Shanks as a ""fascinating and warm family"". ""Entering the Shanks household in the early days was a bit like walking into a whirlwind,"" she said. ""There are a lot of siblings, each with very different characters. Midlands Live: Mother dies after flat fire; alleged IS recruiter to be extradited ""There's laughter, tears and every emotion in between - sometimes all at once - as well as at least eight cats and dogs and sometimes chickens. ""But beyond the chaos, I immediately thought there was something very special there, an openness and a bravery in them all."" Vikie Shanks said her children had very different needs and experiences after her husband's death Mrs Shanks - an advocate and campaigner from Kenilworth calling for a better understanding of autism and mental health - said the film was originally going to be about autism but via an ""evolutionary process"" became much wider. ""Lucy just felt the story was about more than just autism and she put her life into it for four years,"" she said. ""We built a very solid relationship with her, very much based on trust."" The filmmaker looked through hours of home videos made by Mr Shanks, who documented the children's lives, including shows and songs they had written with him. Mrs Shanks said her husband could not have left ""any greater gift"" than the children This footage was combined with her own during a year of editing. The children talked to her about their father, the enormous impact of his death and their lives since. ""When we started filming we were all absolutely adamant that it had to be real, completely real, nothing staged,"" Mrs Shanks said. ""And when we started to see the edits, there were things in it that were very uncomfortable and we weren't happy with - but we had to stand by that initial philosophy."" Mrs Shanks said she knew her husband had been suffering with mental health problems and depression but he became much worse about six years before his death. ""He started to become quite scary and very worrying, and I also thought that was the point I felt it started to really affect the children more which I found very worrying,"" she said. After his death, she found he had built up debts of about Â£1m and had to deal with this while running the family's corporate entertainment business and caring for her grieving children. Paul Shanks filmed hours of home videos of his children Mrs Shanks said the documentary traces how the ""mental process works"". ""I hope it raises a lot of awareness for mental health and also for autism and how autism affects the way you recover from things like this,"" she said. Mirie, 22, one of her six daughters, found it difficult to watch ""because it is so honest as to who we all are as a family"". But Mirie and sister Kacie, 23, said there was also much hope and laughter. ""It is a beautiful film. It has been made beautifully by Lucy,"" Mirie added. Speaking about the time after her husband's death, Mrs Shanks said: ""I look back and think I was a bit like a runaway train. ""You just do it, bit by bit: it is sometimes minute by minute or hour by hour, day by day.""

May: I don't want cabinet of 'yes men',"This video can not be played Theresa May is asked if Boris Johnson has undermined her Theresa May says she has not been undermined by Boris Johnson's recent interventions on Brexit, saying she does not want a cabinet of ""yes men"". The prime minister said the foreign secretary's vision of Brexit reflected the government's approach. ""This isn't about an individual personality, it's about how we can deliver for people,"" she added. Mr Johnson has delivered his party conference speech, saying it is time to ""let the British lion roar"". Johnson: Let the British lion roar Anger over Johnson Libya 'bodies' comment Conference live: Rolling text and video updates Kuenssberg: Fears of a downward spiral Fox and Davis call for Brexit optimism But his recent comments on Brexit - including setting out ""red lines"" in a newspaper article - have triggered calls for him to be sacked. Asked what it would take for him to be fired, Mrs May told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that strong leadership involved ""having a range of voices sitting around the table"". Responding to some Tory figures' concerns she was being undermined by the foreign secretary, she said: ""It doesn't undermine what I'm doing at all."" She was speaking on day three of the Tory conference in Manchester, as: Mr Johnsonalso faced criticismfor remarks about Libya at a fringe event Home Secretary Amber Ruddpromised to banthe sale of acids to anyone under the age of 18 Liam Fox and David Daviscalled for an end to pessimismover Brexit and for the British public to ""keep their eyes on the prize"" on offer Health Secretary Jeremy Huntsaid 5,000 new placeson nursing training courses would be created in England Ahead of its publication, Downing Street'saudit of how people from different backgroundsare treated was said to contain ""uncomfortable truths"" Mr Johnson set out his Brexit ""red lines"" at the weekend, triggering anger from some colleagues and accusations that he was targeting Mrs May's job. But the PM played down any differences with the government's position. ""If you look at the issues Boris has been talking about they reflect the position we've taken in the Florence speech, setting out a vision of what this country can be doing in terms of its partnership with Europe in the future,"" she said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson:  ""It is up to us now... to let that lion roar."" Asked whether his interventions made her ""cross"", she replied: ""Crucially, there's a lot of talk about Boris's job or this job or that job inside the cabinet. ""Actually what people are concerned about - they don't want us to be thinking about our jobs they want us to be thinking about their jobs and their futures. ""What government is for is about delivering for the public. That's where our focus must be."" In his much-anticipated speech in Manchester, Mr Johnson called for Brexit to be a moment of national renewal. The foreign secretary told Tory activists the UK ""can win the future"" and should stop treating the referendum result as if it were ""plague of boils"". He also praised Theresa May's ""steadfast"" leadership over Europe and insisted the whole cabinet was united behind her aim of getting a ""great Brexit deal"". This video can not be played In full: Theresa May speaks to Laura Kuenssberg Mrs May has faced repeated questions about her leadership during the conference, having seen the Conservatives lose their Commons majority in June's general election. She insisted she had the authority and ideas to improve the Tories' standing - and that her party was still setting the political agenda, adding that she had ""listened"" to voters' concerns on tuition fees and home ownership. And she repeatedly stressed her ""mission"" in government, as set out when she took office, ""to ensure that we no longer see people in this country that feel left behind"". Earlier during a round of media interviews the PM was asked by BBC Breakfast whether there were any ""red lines"" which Mr Johnson himself should not cross. This video can not be played The prime minister Theresa May rejects accusations of weak leadership on Radio 4's Today ""I don't set red lines. Everybody uses this phrase 'red lines'. I don't set those sort of red lines,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""All I would say is actually I think leadership is about ensuring you have a team of people who aren't yes men, but a team of people of different voices around the table, so you can discuss matters, come to an agreement and then put that government view forward, and that's exactly what we've done."" On BBC Radio 4's Today, Mrs May said the foreign secretary and the rest of the cabinet were united behind her Brexit strategy, insisting that European leaders knew what the UK wanted and that her Florence speech had ""changed the dial"". ""What I am very clear about is of course the prime minister is in charge,"" she said. She acknowledged that her message ""did not come across in the general election"" as she would have wanted and it was apparent the concerns of the British people were ""more keenly felt"" than people had thought. Mrs May said the election had shown that many people felt ""left behind and ignored"" but she insisted that change would not happen overnight and no ""great phrase"" would transform things. In the run-up to Mr Johnson's speech, pro-Remain Tory MP and former business minister Anna Soubry told Channel 4 News that she had asked the foreign secretary to resign over the weekend, describing him a ""troublemaker"". Speaking ahead of his own conference speech, in which he called for greater optimism about Brexit, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I think it's easier if we are all on a very strict script, it's very clear that the prime minister is in charge of this process."" Also on the third day of the Conservative conference in Manchester, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised5,000 new training places for nurseswhile International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced new conditions on foreign aid spending to prevent ""fat cats"" from monopolising contracts.

But the PM played down any differences with the government's position. ""If you look at the issues Boris has been talking about they reflect the position we've taken in the Florence speech, setting out a vision of what this country can be doing in terms of its partnership with Europe in the future,"" she said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson:  ""It is up to us now... to let that lion roar."" Asked whether his interventions made her ""cross"", she replied: ""Crucially, there's a lot of talk about Boris's job or this job or that job inside the cabinet. ""Actually what people are concerned about - they don't want us to be thinking about our jobs they want us to be thinking about their jobs and their futures. ""What government is for is about delivering for the public. That's where our focus must be."" In his much-anticipated speech in Manchester, Mr Johnson called for Brexit to be a moment of national renewal. The foreign secretary told Tory activists the UK ""can win the future"" and should stop treating the referendum result as if it were ""plague of boils"". He also praised Theresa May's ""steadfast"" leadership over Europe and insisted the whole cabinet was united behind her aim of getting a ""great Brexit deal"". This video can not be played In full: Theresa May speaks to Laura Kuenssberg Mrs May has faced repeated questions about her leadership during the conference, having seen the Conservatives lose their Commons majority in June's general election. She insisted she had the authority and ideas to improve the Tories' standing - and that her party was still setting the political agenda, adding that she had ""listened"" to voters' concerns on tuition fees and home ownership. And she repeatedly stressed her ""mission"" in government, as set out when she took office, ""to ensure that we no longer see people in this country that feel left behind"". Earlier during a round of media interviews the PM was asked by BBC Breakfast whether there were any ""red lines"" which Mr Johnson himself should not cross. This video can not be played The prime minister Theresa May rejects accusations of weak leadership on Radio 4's Today ""I don't set red lines. Everybody uses this phrase 'red lines'. I don't set those sort of red lines,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""All I would say is actually I think leadership is about ensuring you have a team of people who aren't yes men, but a team of people of different voices around the table, so you can discuss matters, come to an agreement and then put that government view forward, and that's exactly what we've done."" On BBC Radio 4's Today, Mrs May said the foreign secretary and the rest of the cabinet were united behind her Brexit strategy, insisting that European leaders knew what the UK wanted and that her Florence speech had ""changed the dial"". ""What I am very clear about is of course the prime minister is in charge,"" she said. She acknowledged that her message ""did not come across in the general election"" as she would have wanted and it was apparent the concerns of the British people were ""more keenly felt"" than people had thought. Mrs May said the election had shown that many people felt ""left behind and ignored"" but she insisted that change would not happen overnight and no ""great phrase"" would transform things. In the run-up to Mr Johnson's speech, pro-Remain Tory MP and former business minister Anna Soubry told Channel 4 News that she had asked the foreign secretary to resign over the weekend, describing him a ""troublemaker"". Speaking ahead of his own conference speech, in which he called for greater optimism about Brexit, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I think it's easier if we are all on a very strict script, it's very clear that the prime minister is in charge of this process."" Also on the third day of the Conservative conference in Manchester, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised5,000 new training places for nurseswhile International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced new conditions on foreign aid spending to prevent ""fat cats"" from monopolising contracts.

Catalonia prepares for regional strike,"This video can not be played Firefighters joined the crowds in a day of defiant protests Thousands of people in Catalonia are rallying and blocking roads in protest over Spanish police violence during Sunday's independence referendum. There is little public transport across the region, after local trade unions called a strike. Spain's King Felipe VI is to address the nation at 19:00 GMT. Almost 900 people were hurt as police tried to prevent the vote. Thirty-three police officers were also injured. The central government in Madrid said the referendum was illegal. Catalonia beset by divided loyalties Spain's biggest crisis for a generation The reasons for the referendum On Tuesday, about 300,000 people took to the streets of Barcelona, city police were quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. Some demonstrators were marching towards the Catalan parliament. More than 50 roadblocks in the city caused big traffic jams. Barcelona's metro traffic was cut to a 25% service during rush hour and no trains at all at other times. Barcelona's port was at a standstill, trade union sources said. Top tourist attractions were also closed, including the city's famous Sagrada Familia church. Mercabarna - Barcelona's massive wholesale market - was left deserted as some 770 food businesses closed for the day. However, the city's El Prat airport and its taxis are operating normally. Protest rallies are also taking place in other major cities and towns of the north-eastern autonomous region. Many small businesses have shut for the day. Schools, universities and medical services are also closed or operating at a minimum level. The day of action drew big crowds in Barcelona and other major Catalan cities A roadblock on Gran Via in central Barcelona: The banner says ""Occupation forces get out!"" The strike was called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"" seen during Sunday's ballot. Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Why Catalan emotions are running high Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the vote made a ""mockery"" of democracy. This video can not be played Protesting Catalan student Mauro Castro Soler On Tuesday, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said: ""We see how day after day the government of Catalonia is pushing the population to the abyss and inciting rebellion in the streets."" He also warned that the central government would take ""all measures necessary to stop acts of harassment"". Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a condemned the ""mafia"" behaviour of those protesters who had earlier gathered around hotels housing Spanish police officers and demanded that they leave. This video can not be played Many Catalans have expressed shock at the use of violent tactics by Spanish police On Sunday, more than 2.2 million people reportedly voted in the referendum. The Catalan government says the vote in support of independence was nearly 90%, but official results have not yet been released. Turnout was relatively low at a reported 42%, potentially weakening the position of Catalan President Carles Puigdemont. Protesters blocked a street outside a police station in Barcelona Barcelona metro: A sign warns commuters that there will be minimum services A huge Barcelona wholesale market - Mercabarna - is paralysed by the strike On Monday evening, the Spanish national football team abandoned a training session in Madrid after fans booed and whistled at defender Gerard Pique, who has strongly backed the Catalan referendum. Guardia Civil police mingled among the crowd, as some fans waved Spanish flags and anti-Pique placards. Pique plays for FC Barcelona, which announced that it had joined the strike. ""None of the professional teams or the youth teams at FC Barcelona will train tomorrow,"" the club said on Monday evening. This video can not be played Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was booed by Spain fans Drumbeats thunder and echo up and down Laietana Street, where last night's anti-police protest of hundreds outside the city's National Police HQ has swollen into a roaring human river above which bob the lone-star flags of Catalan independence. As a surveillance helicopter's blades beat time overhead, vans of the local Mossos police slowly negotiate the alleys as the force fulfils its peculiar role as both guardians of their national colleagues, and heroes of the crowd who cheer and chant: ""Our police are here."" Roger Mayor (left) and his friends show off their flags ""It's more than a flag, it's like a feeling,"" says Roger Mayor, 18, as his friends show off the flags they are wearing. ""We think the Spanish government just want us for the money and they hate us. The Spanish police actions on Sunday were surreal. It felt like being in a horror film. We spent all day in a school [polling station] and we were very scared, though the police didn't come."" Xavi Alba, 28, and his mates pass by with a shopping trolley draped in the Catalan communist flag as the crowd chants: ""The street will always be ours"". It's stuffed with beer mostly, he explains while drinking a can. ""We go around Barcelona occupying the streets to protest at the repression. It's not about independence, it's about democracy. When we see people with Spanish flags, we just hug them. Yeah, they hug us too!"" Meanwhile, political leaders are trying to find a way forward. Mr Puigdemont has said he wants a new understanding with the central government in Madrid, but the Spanish government has warned it could suspend autonomy of the wealthy north-eastern region. How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote The most powerful images of Catalan clashes Given the chaotic nature of the vote, the turnout and voting figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona. This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting Mr Rajoy held talks with Pedro SÃ¡nchez, leader of Spain's main opposition Socialist party, as well as Albert Rivera, the head of the centrist Ciudadanos party, late on Monday. While the Socialist leader urged Mr Rajoy to hold talks with the Catalan president immediately, Mr Rivera said Spain should invoke article 155 of the constitution, in effect suspending Catalonia's autonomous powers. Mr Puigdemont has called on the international community to help mediate between the two sides. However, the European Commission described the crisis as ""an internal matter"" for Spain, that has to be dealt with in line with the constitutional order. A day of protests in Barcelona.

'An act of pure evil',"Many front-page headlines use US President Donald Trump's words to describe the Las Vegas shootings: ""An act of pure evil."" The Daily Mirror's headline,externalis ""Slaughter in Sin City"". The Daily Mail asks,external: ""What turned Mr Normal into a mass killer?"" The Times describes Stephen Paddock,externalas a retired accountant with no criminal record. According to the Sun,external, he is thought to have had gambling debts. The Daily Telegraph quotes an official,externalas saying Paddock had a ""history of psychological problems"". Despite this, the paper adds, he was able to buy his arsenal legally. The Guardian says Las Vegas will be seen as the first major test,externalof a president for whom the gun lobby was a key part of his electoral coalition. The Las Vegas Herald says Paddock's massacre of music fans sent chills down every American's spine. What distinguished his lethal attack from most mass shootings, theWashington Post says,external, were the size of the arsenal he smuggled into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and the great height from which he shot. For the Las Vegas Review-Journal,external, the massacre has tarnished the Strip's reputation as one of the safest streets in the US. It says experts believe hotels will have to rethink security procedures. While they cannot install metal detectors or other elements deemed intrusive without damaging the whole concept of hospitality, the paper adds, they will have to rely even more on the eyes and ears of housekeeping and front desk staff to detect unusual behaviour. Elsewhere, there is extensive coverage of the collapse of Monarch Airlines. The Telegraph says it understands the government was pre-warned,externalthat the airline faced financial ruin and has been planning for its collapse for a month. The Daily Express reports that in the scramble for alternative flights,externalpassengers accused rival airlines of profiteering, with prices reportedly going up every minute as demand outstripped supply.

According to the Sun,external, he has signalled that he has no wish to see the next phase through, saying: ""Someone else can do that, Boris can do that."" Government proposals for a ""deposit return scheme"" for plastic bottles in England are welcomed. The Sun thinks the plan by Environment Secretary Michael Gove,externalto keep plastic bottles out of rivers and off beaches is worth pursuing. Only 57% of them are recycled, it says, and must increase it somehow. The Mail,which has campaigned on the issue,external, says after the charge on plastic bags and a ban on microbeads, the plastic bottles scheme would be another massive contribution to cleaning up polluted oceans, rivers and open spaces.

'Uncomfortable truths' in PM's race audit,"Theresa May will promise to confront ""uncomfortable truths"" exposed by a review into the way people from ethnic minorities are treated in Britain. The prime minister said the audit, due to be published next week, would ""hold a mirror up to society"". Its findings include that white Britons are far more likely to have a job than black and ethnic minority people. Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson are due to speak at the Tory conference. Mr Johnson has been accused of undermining Mrs May and positioning himself for a leadership bid with his interventions on Brexit strategy. Some Conservative MPs have called for him to be fired. Chancellor Philip Hammond said on Monday that he operates on the basis ""everyone is sackable"". But asked whether he would be ""loyal"" in his speech on Tuesday, the foreign secretary told Newsnight: ""Contrary to some of the stuff that I notice has been knocking around in the media, you have a cabinet that is totally united behind every comma, every full stop, every syllable of the prime minister's excellent Florence speech. ""That's the agenda that we're going to deliver and we're going to deliver a great Brexit for this country."" When she became PM, Theresa May pledged to tackle ""burning injustices"" arising from people's race and background BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said Mrs May was keen to demonstrate priorities beyond leaving the EU and was returning to a theme she had first highlighted on taking office last year. She ordered the audit, which the government said was ""the most extensive review of its kind ever undertaken"", when she became prime minister. Government departments were told to identify and publish details of the varying experiences and outcomes of different groups when using public services. The audit is aimed at highlighting racial and socio-economic disparities and showing how outcomes differ due to background, class, gender and income. Schools, hospitals, employers and courts are all covered. ""Britain has come a long way in my lifetime in spreading equality and opportunity, but this audit will be definitive evidence of how far we must still go in order to truly build a country that works for everyone,"" Mrs May said. According to a selection of the findings released by the government ahead of the 10 October publication, two in three white adults own their home, compared with only two in five householders from any other ethnic group. It has also found that white pupils from state schools had the lowest university entry rate in 2016.

News Daily: What drove the Las Vegas killer?,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Why?What could possibly have motivated Stephen Paddock, a retired accountant, to open fire from a balcony above a Las Vegas music festival, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500? Police found 23 guns in Paddock's hotel room, but have not discovered any connection to international terrorism, despite a claim of involvement from so-called Islamic State. President Donald Trump described the act as ""pure evil"" and some investigators say there isreason to believe the gunman, 64, had a history of psychological problems. Meanwhile, searches have uncovered explosives at Paddock's home in a retirement community in the small town of Mesquite, north east of Las Vegas. There is a second house in northern Nevada which Swat teams are due to check for booby-traps before carrying out a search. The authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the people killed, but Jordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been named as a victim of the attack by CBC News.Here's what we know so far about the shooting. By Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter As Donald Trump began more seriously contemplating a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, his views on gun control changed. By the time he announced his entry into the race in 2015, he was well within the mainstream of the Republican Party, which views most forms of additional gun regulation as a violation of Second Amendment constitutional protections. It was Mr Trump's way of establishing his conservative cultural bona fides - proving that he wasn't the big-city liberal he had at times seemed.

NHS patients to test 'universal' flu jab,"Researchers are seeking about 500 NHS patients to try out a new ""universal"" vaccine against seasonal flu. The experimental vaccine works differently from the one currently available, which has to be remade each year based on a ""best guess"" of what type of flu is likely to be about. The new jab targets part of the virus that does not change each year. This means the vaccine should work against human, bird and swine flu, say the team at University of Oxford. It will offer people better protection, they believe. Immunisation is the best defence we have against flu but it is not always effective. Last winter's vaccine cut the risk of flu in adults under the age of 65 by about 40%, butbarely worked in people over 65,,externaldespite being a good match for the type of flu in circulation. As people age, their immune systems are often weaker and their bodies may not respond as well to a vaccine as younger people's bodies. Prof Sarah Gilbert and colleagues believe that using their vaccine alongside the current one could help. It is the world's first widespread human testing of such a vaccine, according to the National Institute for Health Research, which is supporting the project. Patients aged 65 or older and living in Berkshire and Oxfordshire will be invited to take part in the trial. Half of the 500 volunteers will receive the usual seasonal flu jab and a placebo or dummy jab, while the other half with get the regular vaccine plus the new experimental one. The new vaccine uses a novel way to get the body to ward off flu. Flu viruses look a bit like a ball covered in pins. Current flu jabs work by getting the body's immune system to recognise and attack the pin heads or surface proteins of the virus. But these surface proteins can change, meaning the vaccine must change too. The experimental vaccine instead encourages the body to make other immune system weapons, called T cells, against unchanging core proteins housed within the ""ball"" part of the virus. It should fight multiple strains of influenza and will not need to be redesigned each year, unlike the current one used by the NHS. Prof Gilbert, co-founder of Vaccitech, a spin-out company from University of Oxford's Jenner Institute that is part-funding the work, told the BBC: ""We expect that the protection from the new vaccine will last longer than a year, but we will need to test that with more clinical trials in the future. ""It is possible that, in future, vaccinations against flu might be given at longer intervals - maybe every five years instead of every year. But first we have to test protection in the first flu season following vaccination."" Free NHS flu jabs are available for: People over 65 Pregnant women Children and adults with chronic health conditions, such as asthma, or weakened immune systems Residents of long-stay care home or other facilities Children aged two and three on 31 August 2017, plus reception-age schoolchildren, as well as children in school years one, two, three and four (children eligible and between the ages of two and 17 will usually be offered a flu vaccine nasal spray rather than a jab) Carers Source:NHS Choices,external She said the current trial will take two years to complete. If further studies go well the vaccine could then be licensed for wider use. The NHS is braced for a bad flu season this winter, following the worst outbreak in many years in Australia and New Zealand. Flu is easily transmitted and even people with mild or no symptoms can infect others.

Rudd to techies: Stop patronising us,"Amber Rudd has accused tech giants of not doing enough in the fight against extremism Home Secretary Amber Rudd has accused technology experts of ""patronising"" and ""sneering"" at politicians who try to regulate their industry. She said Silicon Valley had to do more to help the authorities access messages on end-to-end encrypted services like WhatsApp. And she said she did not need to understand how they worked to know they were ""helping criminals"". She was speaking at a Spectator fringe meeting at the Conservative conference. Message encryption a problem - Rudd WhatsApp says all messages sent on WhatsApp have end-to-end encryption, meaning they are designed to be unreadable if intercepted by anyone, including law enforcement and WhatsApp itself. The service is used by MPs, including Tory backbenchers, to swap confidential gossip, the meeting was told. Ms Rudd is concerned it and other encrypted services, provided by Facebook and Google among others, are being used by terrorists to plot attacks. She insisted she does not want ""back doors"" installed in encryption codes, something the industry has warned will weaken security for all users, nor did she want to ban encryption, just to allow easier access by police and the security services. Asked by an audience member if she understood how end-to-end encryption actually worked, she said: ""It's so easy to be patronised in this business. We will do our best to understand it. ""We will take advice from other people but I do feel that there is a sea of criticism for any of us who try and legislate in new areas, who will automatically be sneered at and laughed at for not getting it right."" She added: ""I don't need to understand how encryption works to understand how it's helping - end-to-end encryption - the criminals. ""I will engage with the security services to find the best way to combat that."" Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, which represents Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other US tech giants, said it was an ""understandable goal"" for the home secretary to ""want to remove it from end-to-end"". But, he went on, ""since it is just math and it has been invented it can't uninvented"". ""So even if every internet company that we represent said 'ok we are turning off encryption' you are just weakening the security for everybody in this room but that math, that technology still exists for others to use on other platforms."" ""I am not suggesting you give us the code,"" the home secretary shot back, telling him: "" I understand the principle of end-to-end encryption - it can't be unwrapped.
