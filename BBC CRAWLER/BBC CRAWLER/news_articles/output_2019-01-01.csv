Nasa probe survives distant flyby,"Alan Stern and Alice Bowman celebrate the arrival of New Horizons' signal The US space agency's New Horizons probe has made contact with Earth to confirm its successful flyby of the icy world known as Ultima Thule. The encounter occurred some 6.5bn km (4bn miles) away, making it the most distant ever exploration of an object in our Solar System. New Horizons,externalacquired gigabytes of photos and other observations during the pass. It will now send these home over the coming months. The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up by one of Nasa's big antennas, in Madrid, Spain. It had taken fully six hours and eight minutes to traverse the great expanse of space between Ultima and Earth. Agonising wait for Ultima Thule news Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' Tributes paid to 'Mother of the Hubble' A good, clear signal was picked up by the radio antenna system in Spain Controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland greeted the reception of the signal with cheers and applause. ""We have a healthy spacecraft,"" announced Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman. ""We've just accomplished the most distant flyby."" This first radio message contained only engineering information on the status of the spacecraft, but it included confirmation that New Horizons executed its autonomous flyby observations as instructed and that the probe's onboard memory was full. A later downlink on Tuesday will see some choice images returned to give scientists and the public a taster of what New Horizons saw through its cameras. If there is one note of caution it is that the timing and orientation of the spacecraft had to be spot on if the probe was not to shoot pictures of empty space! As a result, there will continue to be some anxiety until the data can be examined. ""The highest resolution images taken at closest approach required perfect pointing, almost,"" said Project Scientist Hal Weaver. ""We think, based on everything we've seen so far, that was achieved."" Taken from a few hundred thousand km: A last image on approach to the target Why cheese is no longer my friend US military sorry for New Year nuke tweet New Year 2019 celebrations in pictures Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto which New Horizons visited in 2015. It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. The vast separation between New Horizons and Earth, coupled with the probe's small, 15-watt transmitter, mean data rates are glacial, however. They top out at 1 kilobit per second. To retrieve all of the imagery stored on the probe is therefore expected to take until September 2020. The first of the very highest resolution pictures should come down to Earth in February. But this wouldn't delay the science, said Principal Investigator Alan Stern. ""The [lower resolution] images that come down this week will already reveal the basic geology and structure of Ultima for us, and we're going to start writing our first scientific paper next week,"" he told reporters. Even just the final picture released from the approach phase to the flyby contained tantalising information. Ultima appears in it as just a blob, but immediately it has allowed researchers to refine their estimate of the object's size - about 35km by 15km. Several factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists. One is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed. Another factor is that Ultima is small (about 30km across), and this means it doesn't have the type of ""geological engine"" that in larger objects will rework their composition. And a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt. Unlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up. Alan Stern said: ""Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique."" First, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission. The hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade. New Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s. The longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System. The two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November. And in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s. TheBBC's Sky At Night programmewill broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. PresenterChris Lintott,externalwill review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.

Manchester knifings suspect detained,"This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect A terror suspect arrested over a ""frenzied"" knife attack on three people in Manchester has been detained under mental health laws. The 25-year-old is being held on suspicion of attempted murderafter the stabbings on New Year's Eve at the city's Victoria railway station. Police said there was nothing to suggest others were involved. Officers have been praised for their ""fearless"" response in containing the attacker with pepper spray and Tasers. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said the suspect had been assessed by specialist staff and detained under the Mental Health Act. The victims were stabbed at about 21:00 GMT and taken to a nearby hospital with ""serious"" but not life-threatening injuries. A woman, aged in her 50s, suffered injuries to her face and stomach, while a man - also in his 50s - has injuries to his stomach. Police raided a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester The officer, a police sergeant in his 30s, sustained knife wounds to his shoulder during the attack, but has since been released from hospital. The suspect lived in the Cheetham Hill area of the city, said police. This video can not be played GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins says the incident is being treated as ""a terrorist investigation"" Officers raided a semi-detached house on Schoolside Close, a mile north of Manchester city centre. Nearby resident Nousha Babaakachel, 40, said a Somali family lived at the address - a mother and father of five in their 40s, who came to live in the street about 12 years ago from the Netherlands. She said two of the four sons were at university, one worked at Manchester Airport and the youngest was back in Somalia. They also have a daughter. Both parents attend the local Khiza Mosque. At the briefing, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I know that the events of last night will have affected many people and caused concern. ""That the incident happened so close to the scene of the terrorist attack on 22 May 2017 makes it even more dreadful."" Mr Jackson had said that ""given how frenzied the attack was"" officers had been considering the state of the suspect's mental health. ""There is wide reporting in the press about what the attacker allegedly said during the incident and because of this we want to be clear, we are treating this as a terrorism investigation,"" he said. He explained officers were ""retaining an open mind in relation to the motivation for this attack"". Police recovered two knives at the scene, but do not yet know if both were used. The station was shut after the attack and police remain at the scene Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both said the victims were in their thoughts, with Mrs May praising the ""courageous response"" of the emergency services, and Mr Corbyn highlighting their ""bravery"". The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he wished those injured a full recovery. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan, from British Transport Police, said he was ""incredibly proud"" of the four officers who detained the suspect. They were ""fearless, running towards danger and preventing further harm coming to passengers,"" he said. BBC 5 live producer Sam Clack, who was at the station at the time, said he saw a man stabbed on a tram platform at the station ""feet from me"". Mr Clack also said he heard the knifeman shouting ""Allah"" during the attack, along with a slogan criticising Western governments. A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder He added he was close to jumping on the tracks as the attacker had a long kitchen knife. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said the attacks appeared to be an isolated incident. This video can not be played Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham: Stabbings appear to be ""an isolated incident"" Mr Clack said he heard a ""blood-curdling scream"" before he looked down the platform. ""It looked like they were having a fight, but the woman was screaming. ""He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good, 12in blade. It was just fear, pure fear."" Police said there was ""no intelligence to suggest that there is any wider threat at this time"" He said police used pepper spray and a Taser on the detained man, who he said had been resisting arrest. He said he saw six or seven officers on top of the man, who he described as ""very skittish"". ""He was very aggressive and very intent on causing more harm than he actually did,"" he said. ""It was very, very scary."" A support service which was set up after the Arena bomb in 2017 is offering help to those caught up in the Victoria station knife attack.

Tense wait for news from Ultima Thule,"Guests at mission control in Maryland celebrated as the news was announced I suspect it's not that unusual to wake on New Year's Day still wondering about what happened the night before, but it's not exactly what you'd expect the team behind a Nasa spacecraft gathered at mission control to do. Nonetheless, that's the story of two very different celebrations that happened here at Maryland's Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) over the last day or so. I'm writing this from the heart of the New Horizons mission, which just after midnight local time last night flew just 3,500 kilometres away from the icy surface of a rock nicknamed Ultima Thule. There was a bit of a party here last night, and accompanying the team at mission control was everyone from scientific celebrities - Walter Alvarez, discoverer of the K-Pg boundary (formerly known as the K-T boundary) that provided evidence of the asteroid impact that did for the dinosaurs - to, well, actual celebrities. Dr Brian May is officially part of the New Horizons team, and drew quite a crowd to his briefing. As the countdown to the flyby reached its climax, the crowd went as crazy as any New Year crowd would as the fireworks lit up the night sky. Nasa probe survives distant flyby Tributes paid to 'Mother of the Hubble' This video can not be played Brian May: ""I want to merge the science with the music to contribute to the whole experience"" Few of those assembled slept well though, without confirmation that the spacecraft was safe. It reminded me of a similar moment in the same place in July 2015, as the world watched as New Horizons flew past Pluto. Then, as now, the team celebrated while knowing that they had to wait to see if their plucky spacecraft had survived its encounter. A debris detection effort preceded both encounters, but with the craft moving at 14km/s, even a collision with something the size of a pea could be fatal. New Horizons can't talk to Earth and point to take observations at the same time, and so only after a post-flyby signal is received can the team really relax and begin to anticipate the scientific bonanza heading their way. This morning's celebration was the real one. There was a brief delay as the mission operations manager, Alice Bowman (MOM to the team) waited for the signal from the ground station in Madrid to confirm that all is well. Chief scientist Alan Stern (centre, back) celebrates with schoolchildren It is - and the first decent images of Ultima Thule are likely already on their way back to Earth from the spacecraft. We'll get to see them in the next couple of days, and it will take 20 months or so to get all the data back to Earth, but as ever at big space events I'm left thinking about the human contribution to these robotic missions. Some of the New Horizons team have been working on the mission since the early 1990s, and others will have careers that depend on a successful return of data from this flyby. All are anticipating a couple of sleepless nights as they struggle to make sense of a world that until now has been visible only as a couple of pixels. Scattered amongst the crowd are those who will carry on New Horizons' legacy - I've spotted team members from Nasa's Osiris-ReX spacecraft which entered orbit around the asteroid Bennu yesterday, and the leaders of upcoming missions to a strange metal asteroid called Psyche and to the trojan asteroids that share an orbit with Jupiter. Wherever we've explored in the Solar System, we've found the unexpected. As we wait for our close up look at Ultima Thule, it's hard not to get excited about what happens next. TheBBC's Sky At Night programmewill broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT.

Manchester knifings 'a terrorist inquiry',"This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect The stabbing of three people - including a police officer - in Manchester is being treated as a terrorist investigation, police say. A man, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the attack on New Year's Eve at the city's Victoria railway station. Two knives were recovered at the scene and a property is being searched in the Cheetham Hill area. The BBC understands the security services are assisting police. The three victims were taken to a nearby hospital with ""serious"" but not life-threatening injuries. A woman, aged in her 50s, suffered injuries to her face and stomach, while a man - also in his 50s - has injuries to his stomach. Police raided a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester The officer, a police sergeant in his 30s, sustained knife wounds to his shoulder during the attack, but has since been released from hospital. Manchester Victoria railway station has reopened after the stabbings.

Brazil's new far-right leader urges unity,"This video can not be played President Bolsonaro calls for an end of corruption in his inauguration speech Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has used his inaugural speech to promise to build a ""society without discrimination or division"". The former army captain told Congress he wanted a ""national pact"" to free Brazil of corruption, crime and economic mismanagement. In a swipe at the left, he vowed to free Brazil of ""ideology"". He is seen as a deeply divisive figurewhose racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks have angered many. Mr Bolsonaro, 63, won the presidential election by a wide margin against Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party on 28 October. He was propelled to victory by campaign promises to curb Brazil's rampant corruption and crime. US President Donald Trump commended him for his speech on Tuesday, saying the US was ""with"" him.

Among the foreign guests at the inauguration were US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Mr Bolsonaro arrived at Congress with his wife Michelle Analysis by Katy Watson, BBC News, Brasilia Jair Bolsonaro may have struck a more presidential tone in today's speeches compared with the fiery rhetoric used during his campaign, but he made it clear his values remained the same - family, conservatism and God. And despite having won the elections, he's not given up his criticism of Brazil's leftist politics that he feels have ruined the country. The rhetoric he used was familiar - that from today Brazilians are now freed from socialism - and it strikes a chord with millions fed up with corruption scandals that have embroiled Brazilian politics in recent years. With Donald Trump and the so-called ""Trump of the Tropics"" exchanging tweets about their mutual support for each other and commitment to work together, the bromance with one of the world's most powerful presidents has begun. It's a relationship that everyone will be watching very closely. ""Brazil will return to being a country free of ideological constrictions,"" he told Congress in the capital, Brasilia. ""I will divide power in a progressive, conscientious and responsible way."" Guards were on duty in ceremonial dress at the Congress for the inauguration His administration, he said, was ""committed to those Brazilians who want good schools to prepare their kids for the job market and not for political militancy"". Pledging support for the military and police, he said: ""The national motto  is order and progress. No society can develop without respecting these."" On the economy, he promised to ""create a new virtuous cycle to open markets"" and ""carry out important structural reforms"" to tackle the public deficit. In an apparent reference to gun control, he said: ""Good citizens deserve the means to defend themselves."" On Saturday, he tweeted that he would issuea decree to allow citizens who did not have a criminal record to own guns,external. A giant figure of Mr Bolsonaro was erected for the inauguration in Brasilia After being sworn in in front of Congress, Mr Bolsonaro went on to the Planalto Palace where the outgoing President, Michel Temer, handed over the presidential sash. Jair Bolsonaro gestures after receiving the presidential sash Speaking afterwards, he said Brazil would ""start to free itself of socialism"" and ""political correctness"". On a day filled with pageant, he travelled around Brasilia in an open-top vintage Rolls Royce escorted by cavalry on white horses and jogging security guards, as crowds of supporters cheered. ""I came here just for the inauguration,"" supporter Antonio Vendramin told AFP. ""I made a lot of money and saved money to buy the ticket, to be able to buy the plane ticket because it's a long way to come by car but we managed to make it all the way to be here on this day for President Bolsonaro's inauguration. We're full of pride."" Despite portraying himself as a political outsider during his campaign, Mr Bolsonaro served seven terms in Brazil's lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, before being elected president.

He has been a member of several political parties but is currently in the Social Liberal Party (PSL), which has grown from having a tiny presence in Congress to becoming the party with the second largest number of deputies in the lower house. Firefighters kept Bolsonaro followers cool outside the presidential palace in Brasilia Before becoming a politician, Mr Bolsonaro served in Brazil's military, where he was a paratrooper and rose to the rank of captain. During the election race in September,he was stabbed at a rally and seriously injured, taking more than a month to recover. Mr Bolsonaro has chosen ex-military officers for many key government posts During his time as a lawmaker, Mr Bolsonaro represented the interests of the armed forces and since his election he has named seven former military men to head key ministries. He has also expressed nostalgia for the time when Brazil was under military rule and the hard-line policies enforced during the period, which saw thousands jailed and tortured. Brazil only returned to democracy in 1985 after more than 20 years under military rule, and some critics see his election as a threat to the country's democracy. Previous comments he has made endorsing the use of torture and disparaging women, gay people and Afro-Brazilians have left many Brazilians worried.

The election campaign which brought him to power has left the country deeply divided into those who see him as the man to put Brazil on to the right track after massive corruption scandals, and those who fear he could lead Brazil into an authoritarian future. Mr Bolsonaro's promise to drive down crime and stamp out corruption comes after scores of top businessmen and high-ranking politicians, including former left-wing President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, were jailed. Brazil's Lula must start prison term Days after being elected,he picked Brazil's most famous anti-corruption judge, Sergio Moro, as his minister of justice.

There was concern among environmentalists when Mr Bolsonaro suggested during the election campaign that the ministry of agriculture might be merged with that of the environment.

Sharp rise in air crash deaths in 2018,"Airliners are still one of the safest modes of transport, say experts Last year saw a sharp rise in fatalities from air crashes compared with 2017 but 2018 was still the ninth safest year on record, figures show. Airliner accidents killed 556 people last year compared with 44 in 2017, the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) reports. Last year's worst civilian accident was in October when a Lion Air plane crashed in Indonesia, killing 189. The year 2017 was the safest in historyfor commercial airlines with no passenger jet crashes recorded. The Netherlands-basedASN said there had been a total of 15 fatal airliner accidents,externalin 2018. Among the deadliest: In the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, a Boeing 737 Max plane crashed into the Java Sea shortly after departing from Jakarta. It wasdeemed to have not been airworthy A plane crashed shortly after taking off from Cuba's main airport in Havana in May, killing 112 people.An investigation was launchedinto the cause of the crash. In February,66 people were killed in a plane crash in Iran's Zagros mountains Fifty-one people died when a plane crashed on landing at Nepal's Kathmandu airportin March. However, the picture has been improving generally over the past 20 years. ""If the accident rate had remained the same as 10 years ago there would have been 39 fatal accidents last year,"" ASN CEO Harro Ranter said. ""At the accident rate of the year 2000, there would have been even 64 fatal accidents. This shows the enormous progress in terms of safety in the past two decades."" But ASN said what it terms loss-of-control (LOC) accidents were a major safety concern for the aviation industry as these accounted for at least 10 of the worst 25 accidents in the past five years. LOC refers to an unrecoverable deviation from an intended flight path, and can be caused by mechanical failure, human actions or environmental disturbances.  Most of those accidents were not survivable, says the ASN. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the 2018 air crash in Cuba happened in July. It also said human error was to blame but this was the view of the Mexican charter company that owns the plane. That view was criticised by a Mexican pilots' union and the official Cuban investigation has yet to reach a conclusion.

"US man held in Russia is not spy, say family","The Whelan family released an undated photo of Paul Whelan The brother of a US citizen arrested on Friday for spying in Russia has told BBC News he is innocent and was in Moscow to attend a wedding. The family of ex-Marine Paul Whelan, 48, learnt of his arrest on Monday from news reports after wondering why they had not heard from him for days. His twin brother David Whelan says he knew Russia well and cannot believe he would have broken any laws. Russia's FSB state security agency says he was ""caught spying"" in Moscow. The Michigan man was charged with the crime of espionage, for which he could be sentenced to at least 10 years in prison. The US state department has requested consular access after being notified by the Russian authorities of the detention. Spy scandals have erupted between Russia and America at regular intervals since the Cold War, while Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014, and allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, have seen relations plummet. The FSB says he was detained ""during an act of espionage"", a wording which implies that Mr Whelan was caught red-handed, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports. In a statement tweeted by David Whelan, his family said it had been out of character for him not to be in contact even when travelling. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to BBC News on Tuesday, David Whelan said his brother had arrived in Russia on 22 December and had been due to return on 6 January. He had been attending the wedding of a fellow former Marine to a Russian citizen and had planned to visit Russia's second city, St Petersburg, in addition to Moscow. Paul Whelan, his brother said, has been visiting Russia for business and pleasure since 2007, working in corporate security, with automotive industry components firm BorgWarner his most recent employer. As well as serving in the US military, he has worked in law enforcement in the past. Mr Whelan has also been planning to visit St Petersburg Paul Whelan would stand out in a crowd, his brother suggested, as he is ""about six foot [1.8 metres] and kind of hefty with a former soldier's build"". But asked if he could think of any reason why he had attracted the attention of Russian security services, David Whelan was adamant there was none. ""I can't imagine how someone with a law enforcement background who is also a former US Marine, and who is now working in corporate security and is also aware of the risks of travel, would have broken any law let alone the law related to espionage,"" he said. ""His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected,"" the family said in its statement. Paul Whelan's three siblings have contacted Congressional representatives, the US embassy and the state department, which David Whelan described as ""very helpful"". ""Russia's obligations under the Vienna Convention require them to provide consular access,"" a state department representative told BBC News. ""We have requested this access and expect Russian authorities to provide it. Due to privacy considerations, we have no additional information to provide at this time."" The two countries have been spying on each other for decades but very few US citizens have been arrested for espionage on Russian territory: In 2013,US diplomat Ryan Fogle was arrested and expelledafter being accused of trying to recruit a Russian intelligence officer as a spy In 2000,former naval intelligence officer Edmond Pope was tried and convicted of espionage but pardoned by Russian President Vladimir Putin,external The two countries have expelled each other's diplomatsat intervals, notably last year over the nerve agent attack in the UK, which was blamed on Russia. Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far Have Russian spies lost their touch? Last month, a Russian gun rights activist held in the US, Maria Butina, pleaded guilty to conspiracy.US prosecutors say she acted as a Russian state agent, infiltrating conservative political groups. In 2010,10 Russian agents were arrested in the US for deep-cover espionageand later swapped for four Russians convicted of spying for the West.

George Fawkes has received about 20 kangaroos, wallabies and koalas since losing his cuddly ""Kangaroo"". The 10-year-old's mother Gildacontacted the BBC last monthto help find the toy, which had accompanied George through years of surgery. Mrs Fawkes, of King's Lynn, said the response had been ""unbelievable"". All of the toys were donated anonymously but came with lovely messages for George George, who has Floating-Harbor Syndrome, requires regular surgery and always took Kangaroo with him. He lost his cuddly friend on a train as he travelled from Norfolk to Bristol Children's Hospital on 16 November. Mrs Fawkes said she was contacted by the hospital, whose reception was ""full of parcels"" for him, including a toy platypus from Taronga Zoo in Sydney. ""They had all been anonymously sent with lovely notes attached,"" she said. ""It's unbelievable."" The original Kangaroo is still missing but George has since picked out a toy ""very similar to his friend"". ""We explained he was a cousin from Australia,"" Mrs Fawkes said. ""George still asks where Kangaroo is, but we have told him he found someone who needed a friend and now he seems a bit happier."" George in hospital with the original Kangaroo by his side George, who did not want to have any more operations without Kangaroo, has now got his surgery schedule back on track. He even made a festive visit to the children's hospital to donate gifts to patients on Penguin Ward, where he has often stayed. Mrs Fawkes said a special thanks needed to go to ""Chris from the GWR lost property team and Martin, the children' disability officer at the hospital, who tweeted the 'Where are you, Kangaroo?' appeal"".

He has been a member of several political parties but is currently in the Social Liberal Party (PSL), which has grown from having a tiny presence in Congress to becoming the party with the second largest number of deputies in the lower house. Firefighters kept Bolsonaro followers cool outside the presidential palace in Brasilia Before becoming a politician, Mr Bolsonaro served in Brazil's military, where he was a paratrooper and rose to the rank of captain. During the election race in September,he was stabbed at a rally and seriously injured, taking more than a month to recover. Mr Bolsonaro has chosen ex-military officers for many key government posts During his time as a lawmaker, Mr Bolsonaro represented the interests of the armed forces and since his election he has named seven former military men to head key ministries. He has also expressed nostalgia for the time when Brazil was under military rule and the hard-line policies enforced during the period, which saw thousands jailed and tortured. Brazil only returned to democracy in 1985 after more than 20 years under military rule, and some critics see his election as a threat to the country's democracy. Previous comments he has made endorsing the use of torture and disparaging women, gay people and Afro-Brazilians have left many Brazilians worried.

The election campaign which brought him to power has left the country deeply divided into those who see him as the man to put Brazil on to the right track after massive corruption scandals, and those who fear he could lead Brazil into an authoritarian future. Mr Bolsonaro's promise to drive down crime and stamp out corruption comes after scores of top businessmen and high-ranking politicians, including former left-wing President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, were jailed. Brazil's Lula must start prison term Days after being elected,he picked Brazil's most famous anti-corruption judge, Sergio Moro, as his minister of justice. Mr Moro was the key force behind the massive ""Car Wash"" corruption investigation. There was concern among environmentalists when Mr Bolsonaro suggested during the election campaign that the ministry of agriculture might be merged with that of the environment. But he has backtracked on that and also revoked a pledge to quit the Paris climate accord, which sets targets for cutting greenhouse gases. Mr Bolsonaro has been very clear about who he considers to be his international allies and those he views as foes. Mr Trump is ""an example"" to him, and Mr Bolsonaro has promised to follow the US lead andrelocate Brazil's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Mr Bolsonaro visited a synagogue with Benjamin Netanyahu in Rio Mr Bolsonaro has accused Cuba of holding back some of the salaries paid to Cuban doctors working in Brazil,prompting Cuba to pull out its doctors in retaliation. Brazil looks to loosen gun laws Brazil 'replaces' leaving Cuban doctors Cuba pulls doctors out of Brazil amid row Netanyahu welcomes Brazil embassy vow Brazil top judge becomes justice minister Can Bolsonaro ride the 'Bullsonaro wave'?

Four injured in German 'racist attack',"The area of Bottrop where the attack happened has been cordoned off by police A 50-year-old German man has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out a xenophobic attack after driving his car into a group of people, including Syrian and Afghan citizens. Four people were wounded, one of whom remains in hospital. German police said the man rammed his car into pedestrians in a crowded plaza in the north-west town of Bottrop, just after midnight on New Year's Eve. He reportedly made racist comments when he was later stopped and arrested. Police said the driver had earlier tried to mow down one pedestrian, who managed to get out of the way. Later, he also targeted a group of people at a bus stop in the nearby city of Essen, they said. Germany country profile ""A German man deliberately drove into crowds of people... that were largely made up of foreigners,"" Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, said. ""There was a clear intention by this man to kill foreigners."" An earlier statement from police and prosecutors said: ""Investigators suspect it was a deliberate attack that may be linked to the xenophobic views of the driver. In addition, investigators have preliminary information about a mental illness of the driver.""

'Outrageous' cost to be football mascot,"Swansea City charge up to Â£478 for a match-day mascot experience Swansea City may play in football's second tier but they are charging parents Premier League prices for children to be mascots. It costs up to Â£478 for a match-day mascot ""package"" at the Championship club, research by BBC Wales found. Only three teams in the Premier League charge more, while the experience is free at most of the top clubs. Cardiff City charge Â£255. Swansea City said prices were reduced this year following relegation. Consumer groups have branded the higher prices as ""outrageous"". For many youngsters, the chance to walk out onto the pitch with their football heroes is a dream come true. Indeed many clubs tell parents the package is the ""ultimate gift your child will never forget"". Many clubs sell the experience as ""once in a lifetime"" Yet while many of the biggest clubs in the country, including Premier League champions Manchester City, do not charge for the opportunity, others are cashing in more than Â£700 per child. West Ham United charges Â£700 for matches against the ""top six"" teams, less for other opponents. The club also has one free mascot per game. Being a mascot for Everton costs Â£718 for two to three fixtures a year, which goes to charity, but is free for other matches. Most packages include full kit, match tickets, photographs and autographs as well as walking onto the pitch before kick-off. But a Â£185 package at Bournemouth does not come with a ticket to the game. Martyn James, of consumer website Resolver, said: ""It's absolutely outrageous that some richer kids can effectively buy their way to the top of the mascot list. ""When I was younger, being a mascot was a reward for super loyalty or for having been through a great deal. The Premier League's oldest mascots? Mascot to wear 'Swansea City legs' ""Charging any money for these packages is unacceptable - and it's pretty unknown too. ""It makes a mockery of all the things that our national game is supposed to represent."" Supporters on fan forums have slammed the prices as ""unfair"" and ""scandalous"". Swansea City said the ""truly once in a lifetime experience"" includes four hospitality places, a meal and half-time penalty competition on the pitch. A spokesman added: ""We've reduced prices this year following relegation, from Â£450 plus VAT to Â£399 plus VAT for weekend, and Â£349 plus VAT for weekday matches. ""We also give one space free to charity every match and this was brought in this season."" Swansea City give one free mascot place to charities and good causes each game Mascots at the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United are picked at random from their junior fan club and are free. Cardiff City offer the chance for children aged between four and 10 to turn ""dream into reality"" for Â£255 and have sold out for many of their most popular home fixtures. Claire Blake, of Penarth, arranged for her eight-year-old son Cian to be a mascot before the Bluebirds' game against champions Manchester City as a birthday gift in September. ""We were lucky to get such a big game but I'm not sure we would be happy paying the same amount for games against other teams,"" she said. ""Cian got a kit, signed photos and met Neil Warnock and had a great time, but the seats were poor and it was a bit rushed meeting the players."" Cian Blake had ""a great time"" as a Cardiff City mascot this season Season-ticket holder Tracy Morgan paid for her eight-year-old son Leo to be a mascot. She said: ""It was very expensive but it was worth every penny to see my son's face - and my husband's."" Ryan Moore bought a mascot package as a Christmas gift for his six-year-old son Niall. He said: ""It's free for some big clubs like Liverpool but a money-making scheme at others and there are so many mascots that it dilutes the experience. ""But we were pretty happy with the whole day. Niall loved it - apart from the team being hammered 4-1."" Everton Â£718 West Ham United Â£700 Leicester City Â£600 Tottenham Hotspur Â£405 Wolves Â£395 Crystal Palace Â£375 Brighton Â£350 Burnley Â£300 Cardiff City Â£255 Watford Â£250 Bournemouth Â£185 Free: Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham, Huddersfield, Liverpool, Man City, Man United, Newcastle United and Southampton. Clubs have been urged to find a ""good deal"" for fans. The Football Supporters' Federation said: ""Clubs should speak to their supporters about what they think represents a good deal for parents and if fans have specific concerns, we'd be happy to look into it. ""Our campaign focus will primarily remain on affordable ticket prices - particularly fair concessionary and fair young adult prices.""

Germany adopts legal third gender identity,"Intersex people can register themselves as such on birth certificates, passports and other official documents Intersex people in Germany can now legally identify themselves as such under a new law adopted in December. People who do not fit the biological definition of male or female can now choose the category ""diverse"" on official documents. Those choosing the option will need a doctor's certificate to register. Intersex people are born with both male and female sex characteristics, which can appear at birth or later in life. Other countries have approved laws in recent years to help recognise intersex people. Austria's constitutional court made a similar ruling to Germany's in June, while Australia, New Zealand, Malta, India and Canada have all passed measures to redress issues facing intersex citizens. The UN saysup to 1.7% of the world's population are born with intersex traits,external- about the same number of people with red hair.

"Boy, 10, sent toys after losing kangaroo","George Fawkes with his favourite of the newly-donated toys - the lost kangaroo's ""cousin from Australia"" A boy with a rare form of dwarfism has been sent a number of soft animal toys by wellwishers after losing one he always took on regular hospital visits. George Fawkes has received about 20 kangaroos, wallabies and koalas since losing his cuddly ""Kangaroo"". The 10-year-old's mother Gildacontacted the BBC last monthto help find the toy, which had accompanied George through years of surgery. Mrs Fawkes, of King's Lynn, said the response had been ""unbelievable"". All of the toys were donated anonymously but came with lovely messages for George George, who has Floating-Harbor Syndrome, requires regular surgery and always took Kangaroo with him. He lost his cuddly friend on a train as he travelled from Norfolk to Bristol Children's Hospital on 16 November. Mrs Fawkes said she was contacted by the hospital, whose reception was ""full of parcels"" for him, including a toy platypus from Taronga Zoo in Sydney. ""They had all been anonymously sent with lovely notes attached,"" she said. ""It's unbelievable."" The original Kangaroo is still missing but George has since picked out a toy ""very similar to his friend"". ""We explained he was a cousin from Australia,"" Mrs Fawkes said. ""George still asks where Kangaroo is, but we have told him he found someone who needed a friend and now he seems a bit happier."" George in hospital with the original Kangaroo by his side George, who did not want to have any more operations without Kangaroo, has now got his surgery schedule back on track. He even made a festive visit to the children's hospital to donate gifts to patients on Penguin Ward, where he has often stayed. Mrs Fawkes said a special thanks needed to go to ""Chris from the GWR lost property team and Martin, the children' disability officer at the hospital, who tweeted the 'Where are you, Kangaroo?' appeal"". She also said she had been contacted by two families who saw the original BBC article and have the same rare condition as George.

Baby found alive in rubble of Russia blastRescuers pull an 11-month-old boy from the rubble after a block of flats collapsed in Magnitogorsk.,"This video can not be played Magnitogorsk: Russian rescuers pull baby from rubble An 11-month-old boy rescued from the ruins of a collapsed apartment block in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk is said to be conscious but in an ""extremely serious"" condition. The country's health ministry says he has severe frostbite to his limbs, a head injury and multiple leg fractures. The boy, named Ivan, has been evacuated to Moscow for treatment. His mother also survived the suspected gas explosion, which killed at least 14 people. Twenty-seven people remain unaccounted for. Ivan was found after spending more than 30 hours in sub-zero temperatures in the rubble of the apartment block. He was found wrapped in a blanket and in his cot in the Urals region city, about 1,695km (1,053 miles) east of Moscow, where the daytime temperature is about -17C. One rescuer, Pyotr Gritsenko has described how the infant, whom he initially thought to be a girl, was found. ""[We made sure there was] silence so we could hear if sounds were coming or not,"" he told Russian state TV channel Rossia 24. ""One of the rescuers in our group, Andrei Valman, heard a child crying near the adjacent apartment block, near the part that was still standing. This video can not be played Rescuers searched for survivors after a gas explosion in a Russian apartment block ""After that, we stopped all our equipment in order to make sure again, and listened. When we said 'Quiet!' the baby reacted and went quiet too. When we said 'Where are you?' she started to react again. ""When we were certain, the head of our centre, who is more experienced, said 'This is where we'll work' and told us to start removing the rubble."" Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the city to assess the situation The blast, at 06:02 local time is thought to have ripped through the first floor, which houses some offices, and the seven storeys above then collapsed. The building was home to 120 people, and 48 flats collapsed in the blast. Nearby flats were also damaged. The dangerously unstable building had to be secured before the rescue could continue ""I woke up and felt myself falling,"" one witness told Russian television, according to news agency AFP. ""The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried."" Another witness spoke of a ""wave of fire"" which followed the explosion. A criminal investigation has been opened into the disaster. Wednesday has been declared a day of mourning in Magnitogorsk.

Self-storage warehouse destroyed in blaze,"At its height, about 120 firefighters tackled the blaze in Purley Way, Croydon Hundreds of people have lost belongings after a self-storage warehouse was destroyed in a large fire. Dozens of firefighters are continuing to tackle the fire at the south London building, which has 1,198 rented units. At height of the blaze on New Year's Eve, the whole of the four-storey Shurgard store in Purley Way, Croydon, was alight, with up to 120 firefighters tackling it. Customers were told it was ""highly unlikely"" any items would be salvaged. About 70 firefighters are expected to remain at the scene into the night as the fire, which has been contained, continues to burn. No one has been hurt in the blaze. Marianna Georgiou lost everything she owns, except her car and the clothes she was wearing Marianna Georgiou, 51, had all of her belongings in the self-storage unit because she had temporarily moved in with her daughter in Mitcham after being made redundant. Ms Georgiou, who works in retail, said: ""I cannot believe it. Thirty years of my whole life have just gone in an instant."" ""Someone called my daughter at 11:45 GMT last night and said, 'Doesn't your mum store her stuff there?' She [the caller] could see the flames from her bedroom window. ""I've literally got the clothes I'm wearing and my car,"" she added. ""I got made redundant last year from my job so I gave up my home so I put everything in storage."" ""Furniture is furniture, but it's the memories and the sentimental things that you cannot replace."" Giacomo Malvermi said his pinball machine business is ""over"" after his stock was destroyed Giacomo Malvermi told BBC London he heard about the fire while at a New Year's Eve party. He had been using the warehouse to store personal belongings as well as his stock of vintage pinball machines which he restored for his business, Pinball Creative. ""It's taken me many years to accumulate these pinball machines, which are both rare and vintage,"" he said. ""All the stock that's gone - we're talking pinball machines from the 60s, 70s - I don't think I'll ever be able to replace them. ""That's me over, that's my business gone."" Firefighters have been at the scene since about 20:00 on Monday In an email sent to customers, which has been seen by the BBC, the company said the fire started ""despite the appropriate safety measures"". ""We are devastated by this event and we sympathize with your loss. Please accept our sincerest apologies,"" it added. A Shurgard spokesman said: ""The entire building has been destroyed. Shurgard will undertake every effort to support all customers for which the event means a loss of their stored goods. ""As a first measure, a dedicated Shurgard team will be contacting every customer of the store within the next 48 hours to help them and support them with their claim procedures."" Graham Ellis, assistant commissioner of London Fire Brigade, said it was ""challenging"" to contain the fire. ""Self-storage units are generally full of items like furniture which when packed tightly provide a lot of materials to burn and so these sorts of incidents tend to create large fires that burn hard for a long time, creating a lot of smoke,"" he said. ""Firefighters have worked hard to ensure that while the fire is burning, it is contained and won't spread to nearby buildings."" Firefighters said tightly-packed possessions make fires in self-storage units difficult to control Local residents have been warned to keep windows and doors shut, with drivers urged to avoid the area after roads were closed. The brigade was called at 19:47 GMT on New Year's Eve. The cause of the fire is not yet known.

Self-storage warehouse destroyed in blazePeople lose all of their possessions as the fire destroys an entire Shurgard unit in south London.London,"At its height, about 120 firefighters tackled the blaze in Purley Way, Croydon Hundreds of people have lost belongings after a self-storage warehouse was destroyed in a large fire. Dozens of firefighters are continuing to tackle the fire at the south London building, which has 1,198 rented units. At height of the blaze on New Year's Eve, the whole of the four-storey Shurgard store in Purley Way, Croydon, was alight, with up to 120 firefighters tackling it. Customers were told it was ""highly unlikely"" any items would be salvaged. About 70 firefighters are expected to remain at the scene into the night as the fire, which has been contained, continues to burn. No one has been hurt in the blaze. Marianna Georgiou lost everything she owns, except her car and the clothes she was wearing Marianna Georgiou, 51, had all of her belongings in the self-storage unit because she had temporarily moved in with her daughter in Mitcham after being made redundant. Ms Georgiou, who works in retail, said: ""I cannot believe it. Thirty years of my whole life have just gone in an instant."" ""Someone called my daughter at 11:45 GMT last night and said, 'Doesn't your mum store her stuff there?' She [the caller] could see the flames from her bedroom window. ""I've literally got the clothes I'm wearing and my car,"" she added. ""I got made redundant last year from my job so I gave up my home so I put everything in storage."" ""Furniture is furniture, but it's the memories and the sentimental things that you cannot replace."" Giacomo Malvermi said his pinball machine business is ""over"" after his stock was destroyed Giacomo Malvermi told BBC London he heard about the fire while at a New Year's Eve party. He had been using the warehouse to store personal belongings as well as his stock of vintage pinball machines which he restored for his business, Pinball Creative. ""It's taken me many years to accumulate these pinball machines, which are both rare and vintage,"" he said. ""All the stock that's gone - we're talking pinball machines from the 60s, 70s - I don't think I'll ever be able to replace them. ""That's me over, that's my business gone."" Firefighters have been at the scene since about 20:00 on Monday In an email sent to customers, which has been seen by the BBC, the company said the fire started ""despite the appropriate safety measures"". ""We are devastated by this event and we sympathize with your loss. Please accept our sincerest apologies,"" it added. A Shurgard spokesman said: ""The entire building has been destroyed. Shurgard will undertake every effort to support all customers for which the event means a loss of their stored goods.

Graham Ellis, assistant commissioner of London Fire Brigade, said it was ""challenging"" to contain the fire. ""Self-storage units are generally full of items like furniture which when packed tightly provide a lot of materials to burn and so these sorts of incidents tend to create large fires that burn hard for a long time, creating a lot of smoke,"" he said. ""Firefighters have worked hard to ensure that while the fire is burning, it is contained and won't spread to nearby buildings."" Firefighters said tightly-packed possessions make fires in self-storage units difficult to control Local residents have been warned to keep windows and doors shut, with drivers urged to avoid the area after roads were closed.

"UK can 'turn corner' with Brexit, says May","The UK can ""turn a corner"" and start to ""put its differences aside"" if Parliament backs the proposed Brexit deal, Theresa May has said. In her new year message, the prime minister said 2019 would mark a new chapter for the country outside the EU. Should MPs approve the exit terms later this month, she said the UK could ""move forward together"" and concentrate on other issues like housing and health. Labour has said the Brexit process is a ""complete mess"" due to Tory divisions. The UK is scheduled to leave the union on 29 March, but it is unclear what will happen if MPs reject the withdrawal agreement and the framework for future relations. Corbyn warns of 'complete Brexit mess' Sturgeon: EU migrants welcome in Scotland US ambassador issues trade deal warning MPs are due to vote in the Commons in mid-January on the proposals reached with the EU. Downing Street has said there is ""still work to do"" - as the PM seeks to persuade sceptical Conservative MPs, some of whom believe the agreement does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. The prime minister is continuing to seek further assurances from European leaders about aspects of the agreement, notably the controversial Irish border ""backstop"", designed to prevent physical customs checks on the island of Ireland.

No 10 said the prime minister had been in contact with European counterparts during the Christmas break and that would continue in the coming week. In her message, Mrs May said MPs had an ""important decision to make"". ""In 2019 the UK will start a new chapter. The Brexit deal I have negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people. If Parliament backs a deal, Britain can turn a corner. ""The referendum in 2016 was divisive. But we all want the best for our country and 2019 can be the year we put our differences aside and move forward together, into a strong new relationship with our European neighbours and out into the world as a globally trading nation."" An orderly Brexit, she argued, would enable the UK to ""focus its energy"" on other challenges, such as addressing housing shortages, improving technical education and ensuring the Â£20bn in extra spending planned for the NHS during the next five years ensures the health service continues to be ""there for us when we need it"". With employment at a record high and debt falling, the PM said the UK's economic foundations were strong but she acknowledged more needed to be done to ensure ""everyone in every community can feel the benefit"". Labour has warned uncertainty over Brexit has plunged the country into a state of crisis and the agreement on the table would not satisfy either Leave or Remain voters. The opposition is seeking to force a general election by calling a vote of no confidence in the government if the deal is rejected by MPs. However, Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that the decision to leave the EU cannot be reversed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his new year message, Mr Corbyn said Mrs May could not be allowed to ""drive through a bad deal"" and Labour, if it was in power, would seek to reopen negotiations with Brussels to pursue a better outcome. Only his party, he claimed, was capable of uniting the UK, with policies to tackle inequality and job insecurity. ""Eight years of damaging Tory failure has left us with a divided country where millions are struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. ""We cannot go on like this. ""Labour is ready to deliver a radical alternative to rebuild and transform our country. We will stand up to the powerful few so the wealth you create is shared fairly, not hoarded by a privileged elite. ""We will work to create a society where the talent of everyone is unleashed. That is how we will unite our country.""

Revellers stuck on New Year's Eve fair rideA helicopter rescued eight French people after eight hours spent 52 metres (171ft) above Rennes.,"A helicopter was eventually called in to rescue the trapped revellers It's not the best way to spend New Year's Eve, but it's certainly an unforgettable one.

The revellers, one as young as 13, climbed aboard the 52-metre (171ft) BomberMaxxx in the Breton city of Rennes for a brief ride above the city. But a new part broke on the attraction, and the firefighters' ladders were too short to rescue the trapped group.

Baby found alive in rubble of Russia blast,"This video can not be played Magnitogorsk: Russian rescuers pull baby from rubble An 11-month-old boy rescued from the ruins of a collapsed apartment block in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk is said to be conscious but in an ""extremely serious"" condition. The country's health ministry says he has severe frostbite to his limbs, a head injury and multiple leg fractures. The boy, named Ivan, has been evacuated to Moscow for treatment. His mother also survived the suspected gas explosion, which killed at least 14 people. Twenty-seven people remain unaccounted for. Ivan was found after spending more than 30 hours in sub-zero temperatures in the rubble of the apartment block. He was found wrapped in a blanket and in his cot in the Urals region city, about 1,695km (1,053 miles) east of Moscow, where the daytime temperature is about -17C. One rescuer, Pyotr Gritsenko has described how the infant, whom he initially thought to be a girl, was found. ""[We made sure there was] silence so we could hear if sounds were coming or not,"" he told Russian state TV channel Rossia 24. ""One of the rescuers in our group, Andrei Valman, heard a child crying near the adjacent apartment block, near the part that was still standing. This video can not be played Rescuers searched for survivors after a gas explosion in a Russian apartment block ""After that, we stopped all our equipment in order to make sure again, and listened. When we said 'Quiet!' the baby reacted and went quiet too. When we said 'Where are you?' she started to react again. ""When we were certain, the head of our centre, who is more experienced, said 'This is where we'll work' and told us to start removing the rubble."" Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the city to assess the situation The blast, at 06:02 local time is thought to have ripped through the first floor, which houses some offices, and the seven storeys above then collapsed. The building was home to 120 people, and 48 flats collapsed in the blast. Nearby flats were also damaged. The dangerously unstable building had to be secured before the rescue could continue ""I woke up and felt myself falling,"" one witness told Russian television, according to news agency AFP. ""The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried."" Another witness spoke of a ""wave of fire"" which followed the explosion. A criminal investigation has been opened into the disaster. Wednesday has been declared a day of mourning in Magnitogorsk.

Kim Jong-un warns of 'change in direction',"Kim Jong-un was seated on a sofa in a room with portraits of his father and grandfather North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has said he is committed to denuclearisation, but warned he will change course if the US continues its sanctions. He made the remarks during his closely-watched annual New Year's address. Last year's speech set the country on an unprecedented path of international diplomacy with South Korea and the US. Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump to discuss denuclearisation in June 2018 but with few results so far. Last year's rapprochement came after a turbulent 2017 marked by North Korea testing missiles that could reach the US mainland and an escalation in rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington with both sides trading insults and threats of nuclear destruction. When Trump met Kim: What happened next? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's breakdown of communication The annual New Year's address is a tradition Mr Kim picked up from his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founder of the communist country. The speech is aimed primarily at a domestic audience and, as in previous years, focused largely on the economy - but international observers scan every line for clues to Pyongyang's international agenda as well. In this year's speech, broadcast on state television early on Tuesday, Mr Kim said, ""if the US does not keep its promise made in front of the whole world... and insists on sanctions and pressures on our republic, we may be left with no choice but to consider a new way to safeguard our sovereignty and interests"". The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says this could mean that North Korea is waiting for the US to act in 2019 and unless it does, the current pause on nuclear weapons testing could be over. North Korea is subject to various sets of United Nations Security Council sanctions related to its banned nuclear and ballistic missile weapons programmes. North Korea for now has stopped its nuclear and missile testing Mr Kim said that North Korea had already pledged not to make, use or spread nuclear weapons and had taken concrete steps to implement this. He also said he was ready to meet Mr Trump again at any time. ""The tone was what many had expected,"" Oliver Hotham of news site NK News, told the BBC. ""In all, a speech that boosts his standing at home on key issues while sending a conciliatory but firm message to the US, all the while continuing to woo Seoul with the prospects of renewed cooperation."" Korean soldiers cross border in peace South Korea unveils Kim Jong-un's puppies Seeing through Kim Jong-un's K-pop sign It was in last year's New Year's message that Mr Kim announced North Korea would take part in the Winter Olympics hosted by the South, which led to a thaw in relations. After a flurry of diplomatic activity, in April Kim Jong-un met South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a summit at the inter-Korean border. This was a historic moment in June, but Kim and Trump have grown further apart since They met twice more after that, but the most historic summit of 2018 was the North Korean leader's meeting with US President Donald Trump in Singapore in June. In the first meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president, the two signed a vaguely-phrased agreement to improve ties and work towards denuclearisation. Since the Trump-Kim summit though, less progress has been made than at least optimists had been hoping for. While the North has stopped missile and nuclear testing, there's been little indication that Pyongyang is working towards complete and verifiable denuclearisation as the US has called upon it to do. The North has dismantled some testing facilities butthere are allegations it is continuing its weapons programme. President Trump has said he expects a second summit to take place as early as February, but there has been no confirmation yet. There are also plans for Kim Jong-un to travel to the South's capital Seoul for another inter-Korean summit but again, those plans have not been confirmed yet.

Baby found alive in rubble of Russia blastRescuers pull an 11-month-old baby from the rubble after an apartment block collapsed in Magnitogorsk.Europe,"This video can not be played Magnitogorsk: Russian rescuers pull baby from rubble An 11-month-old boy rescued from the ruins of a collapsed apartment block in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk is said to be conscious but in an ""extremely serious"" condition. The country's health ministry says he has severe frostbite to his limbs, a head injury and multiple leg fractures. The boy, named Ivan, has been evacuated to Moscow for treatment. His mother also survived the suspected gas explosion, which killed at least 14 people. Twenty-seven people remain unaccounted for. Ivan was found after spending more than 30 hours in sub-zero temperatures in the rubble of the apartment block. He was found wrapped in a blanket and in his cot in the Urals region city, about 1,695km (1,053 miles) east of Moscow, where the daytime temperature is about -17C. One rescuer, Pyotr Gritsenko has described how the infant, whom he initially thought to be a girl, was found. ""[We made sure there was] silence so we could hear if sounds were coming or not,"" he told Russian state TV channel Rossia 24. ""One of the rescuers in our group, Andrei Valman, heard a child crying near the adjacent apartment block, near the part that was still standing. This video can not be played Rescuers searched for survivors after a gas explosion in a Russian apartment block ""After that, we stopped all our equipment in order to make sure again, and listened. When we said 'Quiet!' the baby reacted and went quiet too. When we said 'Where are you?' she started to react again. ""When we were certain, the head of our centre, who is more experienced, said 'This is where we'll work' and told us to start removing the rubble."" Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the city to assess the situation The blast, at 06:02 local time is thought to have ripped through the first floor, which houses some offices, and the seven storeys above then collapsed. The building was home to 120 people, and 48 flats collapsed in the blast. Nearby flats were also damaged. The dangerously unstable building had to be secured before the rescue could continue ""I woke up and felt myself falling,"" one witness told Russian television, according to news agency AFP. ""The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried."" Another witness spoke of a ""wave of fire"" which followed the explosion. A criminal investigation has been opened into the disaster. Wednesday has been declared a day of mourning in Magnitogorsk.

Revellers stuck on New Year's Eve fair ride,"A helicopter was eventually called in to rescue the trapped revellers It's not the best way to spend New Year's Eve, but it's certainly an unforgettable one. Eight French people have been rescued by helicopter after becoming trapped for eight hours atop a fair ride. The revellers, one as young as 13, climbed aboard the 52-metre (171ft) BomberMaxxx in the Breton city of Rennes for a brief ride above the city. But a new part broke on the attraction, and the firefighters' ladders were too short to rescue the trapped group. ""We saw sparks, heard a big metal noise and feared the worst,"" one woman told AFP news agency. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The owner of the ride, Alexandre Thiel, said the broken part blocked it and while there was no danger to those on board, ""the only problem was getting them down"". After several attempts to reach them from the ground, a helicopter arrived and one by one they were winched to safety. The first was rescued just before midnight, with the last person reaching the ground at about 06:00 local time (05:00 GMT). ""I never thought I'd get out. It was very traumatic,"" 23-year-old Antoine said. ""It was long, it was cold and it was frightening."" ""Next year, I'm staying at home with my champagne and biscuits,"" another man said.

Van rams crowd in Tokyo's fashion district,"A male student is in critical condition after the incident A small van has ploughed into pedestrians celebrating the new year on one of Tokyo's most famous streets. The man driving the car fled the scene but was later arrested by police for attempted murder. Nine people were injured, one seriously, by the attacker who struck in the Harajuku fashion district shortly after midnight. The street, which was sealed off to traffic, was packed with people heading to a shrine for New Year's prayers. The 21-year-old driver of the van was identified as Kazuhiro Kusakabe. Police told broadcaster NHK that he initially told them he had conducted a terrorist act, but then later claimed it was related to executions. It was not clear if he was referring to a specific execution or capital punishment in general. Kyodo news agency cites investigative sources saying a tank of kerosene had been found in his car and that he had allegedly planned to set the vehicle on fire. Three stabbed at Manchester rail station Japan picks 'disaster' to define 2018 Skies light up as world welcomes new year Takeshita Street in Shibuya ward is a popular shopping area known for its quirky fashion and youth culture. It also attracts international tourists in large numbers. NHK footage showed the van with a smashed front and paramedics carrying the injured on stretchers into ambulances.

Manchester station re-opens after stabbing,"This video can not be played Manchester stabbing: Police restrain suspect The stabbing of three people - including a police officer - in Manchester is being treated as a terrorist investigation, police say. A man, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the attack on New Year's Eve at the city's Victoria railway station. Two knives were recovered at the scene and a property is being searched in the Cheetham Hill area. The BBC understands the security services are assisting police. The three victims were taken to a nearby hospital with ""serious"" but not life-threatening injuries. A woman, aged in her 50s, suffered injuries to her face and stomach, while a man - also in his 50s - has injuries to his stomach. Police raided a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester The officer, a police sergeant in his 30s, sustained knife wounds to his shoulder during the attack, but has since been released from hospital. Manchester Victoria railway station has reopened after the stabbings. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), told reporters at a briefing at force HQ the suspect lived in the Cheetham Hill area of the city.

She said two of the four sons were at university, one works at Manchester Airport and the youngest is back in Somalia. They also have a daughter. Both parents attend the local Khiza Mosque. At the briefing, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I know that the events of last night will have affected many people and caused concern. ""That the incident happened so close to the scene of the terrorist attack on 22 May 2017 makes it even more dreadful."" Mr Jackson added that ""given how frenzied the attack was"" officers were considering the mental health of the arrested suspect. ""There is wide reporting in the press about what the attacker allegedly said during the incident and because of this we want to be clear, we are treating this as a terrorism investigation,"" he said. He explained officers were ""retaining an open mind in relation to the motivation for this attack"", and said there was no information ""to suggest at this time others are involved"". Police recovered two knives at the scene but do not yet know if both were used in the attack. Manchester Metrolink said services to the station were operating ""to the normal pattern"" but advised of ""minor delays"". Officers said counter terrorism police were leading the inquiry.

The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he wished those injured a ""full recovery"".

"UK can 'turn corner' with Brexit, says MayIn a new year message, Theresa May says the country can move on if MPs back her EU exit plan.UK Politics","The UK can ""turn a corner"" and start to ""put its differences aside"" if Parliament backs the proposed Brexit deal, Theresa May has said. In her new year message, the prime minister said 2019 would mark a new chapter for the country outside the EU. Should MPs approve the exit terms later this month, she said the UK could ""move forward together"" and concentrate on other issues like housing and health. Labour has said the Brexit process is a ""complete mess"" due to Tory divisions. The UK is scheduled to leave the union on 29 March, but it is unclear what will happen if MPs reject the withdrawal agreement and the framework for future relations. Corbyn warns of 'complete Brexit mess' Sturgeon: EU migrants welcome in Scotland US ambassador issues trade deal warning MPs are due to vote in the Commons in mid-January on the proposals reached with the EU. Downing Street has said there is ""still work to do"" - as the PM seeks to persuade sceptical Conservative MPs, some of whom believe the agreement does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. The prime minister is continuing to seek further assurances from European leaders about aspects of the agreement, notably the controversial Irish border ""backstop"", designed to prevent physical customs checks on the island of Ireland.

No 10 said the prime minister had been in contact with European counterparts during the Christmas break and that would continue in the coming week. In her message, Mrs May said MPs had an ""important decision to make"". ""In 2019 the UK will start a new chapter. The Brexit deal I have negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people. If Parliament backs a deal, Britain can turn a corner. ""The referendum in 2016 was divisive. But we all want the best for our country and 2019 can be the year we put our differences aside and move forward together, into a strong new relationship with our European neighbours and out into the world as a globally trading nation."" An orderly Brexit, she argued, would enable the UK to ""focus its energy"" on other challenges, such as addressing housing shortages, improving technical education and ensuring the Â£20bn in extra spending planned for the NHS during the next five years ensures the health service continues to be ""there for us when we need it"". With employment at a record high and debt falling, the PM said the UK's economic foundations were strong but she acknowledged more needed to be done to ensure ""everyone in every community can feel the benefit"". Labour has warned uncertainty over Brexit has plunged the country into a state of crisis and the agreement on the table would not satisfy either Leave or Remain voters. The opposition is seeking to force a general election by calling a vote of no confidence in the government if the deal is rejected by MPs. However, Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that the decision to leave the EU cannot be reversed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his new year message, Mr Corbyn said Mrs May could not be allowed to ""drive through a bad deal"" and Labour, if it was in power, would seek to reopen negotiations with Brussels to pursue a better outcome. Only his party, he claimed, was capable of uniting the UK, with policies to tackle inequality and job insecurity. ""Eight years of damaging Tory failure has left us with a divided country where millions are struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. ""We cannot go on like this. ""Labour is ready to deliver a radical alternative to rebuild and transform our country. We will stand up to the powerful few so the wealth you create is shared fairly, not hoarded by a privileged elite. ""We will work to create a society where the talent of everyone is unleashed.

Energy price cap comes into force,"A new energy price cap has now come into force - but householders can still get a better deal by shopping around, consumer groups say. Regulator Ofgem has estimated that the new cap will save 11 million people an average of Â£76 a year. Typically, the cap means that typical usage by a dual fuel customer paying by direct debit will cost no more than Â£1,137 a year. Consumer organisations say that people could save more by switching suppliers. ""The introduction of this cap will put an end to suppliers exploiting loyal customers. However, while people on default tariffs should now be paying a fairer price for their energy, they will still be better off if they shop around,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""People can also make longer-term savings by improving the energy efficiency of their homes. Simple steps, such as better insulation or heating controls, are a good place to start."" Households in England, Scotland and Wales on default tariffs - such as standard variable tariffs - should be better off after the cap is introduced. Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap. Those on a prepayment meter already have a price cap in place. Those who chose their tariff are ineligible. Cap to rise for vulnerable customers Savings depend on how much energy is used in the household and how the bill is paid. The cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less. The cap is on the unit price of energy, and the standing charge. So the cost of electricity - for those on default tariffs - is capped at 17p per kWh. Gas is capped at 4p per kWh. Dual fuel users will pay no more than Â£177 a year for a standing charge; electricity-only users will pay no more than Â£83, and gas users Â£94. Ofgem will review the tariff in February, and then adjust it in April and October each year. It has said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy. As a result, the average annual saving in 2019 is likely to be lower than Â£76. The regulator will then judge the effect on the energy market in 2020, and the secretary of state will then decide whether to extend it by another year, or whether to end it at that time. ""The energy price cap can only be a temporary fix - what is now needed is real reform to promote competition, innovation and improved customer service in the broken energy market,"" said Alex Neill, from Which?. Some have already changed the way they organise their tariffs. Centrica - which owns the largest UK supplier, British Gas - has said that it will mount a legal challenge to the way the cap has been calculated. It isapplying for a judicial reviewagainst Ofgem, saying the regulator had set the threshold too low. ""Through this action Centrica has no intention to delay implementation of the cap, and does not expect the cap to be deferred in any way,"" the company has said in a statement. ""As we have previously said, we do not believe that a price cap will benefit customers but we want to ensure that there is a transparent and rigorous regulatory process to deliver a price cap that allows suppliers, as a minimum, to continue to operate to meet the requirements of all customers."" Those who have argued against the introduction of a price cap have said it will be counter-productive, as it will lead to fewer people switching - where the potential savings are greater. Which? has argued that some of the cheapest deals on the market have already disappeared, as suppliers needed to make up some of the money lost as a result of the cap. It analysed deals priced at Â£1,000 a year or less for a medium energy user at the beginning of the year compared to now, and found there had been a sharp drop in availability.

Nasa waits for signal from Ultima Thule probeThe New Horizons probe should be flying past the most distant object ever explored in the Solar System.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Where is Ultima Thule? BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains The American space agency is waiting for a signal from its New Horizons probe to confirm that it has made a successful flyby of Ultima Thule. The craft should have hurtled by the 30km-wide icy object earlier on Tuesday, acquiring a swathe of pictures and other scientific measurements. At 6.5 billion km from Earth, the encounter is the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System body. The ""phone home"" message should be picked up by Nasa around 15:30 GMT. It is expected to tell controllers that New Horizons is healthy and that its memory banks are full of data. Some choice pictures will then be downlinked for public release, most probably on Wednesday. Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km (1.25bn miles) further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015. It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. Ultima appears elongated: One of the last pictures returned to Earth before the flyby ""Go New Horizons!"" enthused chief scientist Alan Stern at 05:33 GMT, the moment when the spacecraft would have been at its closest point to Ultima Thule in the flyby sequence. ""Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away."" Earlier, he said: ""I'd be kidding you though if I didn't tell you that we're also on pins and needles to see how this turns out. ""We only get one shot at it. Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,"" he told reporters. The risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima. With the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components. New Horizons was programmed to get as close as 3,500km to Ultima's surface, and to observe its rotation, geology, composition and environment. Scientists want to know in particular how such far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized icy grains. This could say something about how all planetary bodies came into being at the start of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago - including the Earth. But the researchers will have to be patient. Because of the great separation between the New Horizons and Earth, transmissions take over six hours to arrive home. The data rates from New Horizons' 15-watt transmitter are also glacial as a consequence. Information trickles into Nasa's big antenna network at a maximum of 1,000 bits per second. This video can not be played Brian May: ""I want to merge the science with the music to contribute to the whole experience"" New Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images. Mission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima. ""It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,"" he said. ""But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing."" Children invited to mission control celebrate the moment of closest approach When the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface. Mission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May. The rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images. ""[New Horizons at Ultima Thule] touches me because it's very emblematic in my mind of the human spirit having a need and a desire to reach out,"" he told BBC News. ""To me the song is about that quality in human beings that makes them question and makes them want to understand the Universe they live in."" Allow Twitter content?

Archbishop calls for 'spirit of openness',"The Most Rev Justin Welby's sermon will be shown on BBC One The Archbishop of Canterbury has used his New Year's sermon to encourage the public to go into 2019 ""in a spirit of openness towards each other"" after the ""struggles and divisions of recent years"". The Most Rev Justin Welby said the UK is now ""wonderfully"" more diverse. But he added that people ""disagree on many things, and we are struggling with how to disagree well"". The sermon was shown on BBC One on New Year's Day at 12:55 GMT. Watch: The Queen's Christmas message Pope Francis urges peace in Christmas message Delivering his message from Lambeth Palace in London, the archbishop said: ""Turn on the television, read the news, and you see a lot that could tempt you to despair. But the leading figure in the Church of England added: ""Hope lies in our capacity to approach this new year in a spirit of openness towards each other - committed to discovering more of what it means to be citizens together, even amid great challenges and changes. ""That will involve choosing to see ourselves as neighbours, as fellow citizens, as communities each with something to contribute. ""It will mean gathering around our common values, a common vision, and a commitment to one another. ""With the struggles and divisions of recent years, that will not be easy. But that difficult work is part of the joy and blessing of being a community."" In his Christmas service at Canterbury Cathedral, the archbishop urged people to forget the ""languages of hatred, tribalism [and] rivalry"". Instead, he told his congregation to aim for peace and unity at a time of challenge and discord. He stressed the importance of the language of love replacing the language of conflict.

Shed radio DJ broadcasts one-hour special,"Deke Duncan in 1974 in his shed in Stevenage - and preparing for his New Year's Eve show at BBC Three Counties Radio in Dunstable A DJ whose shed-based radio station was only ever heard by his wife has said it was ""an absolute pleasure"" to expand his audience after 44 years. Deke Duncan, 73, was the subject of a 1970s BBC Nationwide television report from his home in Stevenage. He was tracked down by BBC Three Counties Radio and broadcast a one-hour special on the station on Monday night. Opening the show he said his aim was to ""put a grin on your chin"" and a ""smile on your radio dial"". ""Welcome to the big wide world of Deke Duncan,"" he said. ""Uncle Deke is in the air chair... and a mountain of music is guaranteed."" This video can not be played Shed station DJ given BBC local radio slot Duncan started playing records from his back garden in Stevenage, Hertfordshire in 1974. He said his interest in radio was sparked by pirate stationRadio Caroline, which broadcast from a ship off the coast of Essex in the 1960s. He set up Radio 77 - named after a job-lot of second hand jingles bought from a US station of the same name. But with no licence, the station could only be beamed through a speaker in his living room to wife Teresa. He presented non-stop weekend slots on the station with friends Richard St John and Clive Christie and made regular references on air to the fact he was broadcasting from - and to - 57 Gonville Crescent. The Nationwide report was recently tweeted by BBC Archive and BBC Three Counties Radio broadcaster Justin Dealey tracked him down to Stockport, Greater Manchester, where he still broadcasts Radio 77 to just his wife. The station then offered him theone-hour special. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
