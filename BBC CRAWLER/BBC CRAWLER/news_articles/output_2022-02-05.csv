Tragic end for boy trapped in Moroccan well,"This video can not be played Cheers turn to tears as news of Rayan's death emerges A five-year-old Moroccan boy who was trapped in a well for four days has died, despite painstaking efforts to rescue him. A royal statement announced his death soon after his removal from the well. The bid to free the boy, Rayan Oram, had gripped the country, with hundreds of people gathered at the well and thousands more following online. The boy plunged 32m (104ft) through the well's narrow opening. The rescue had been hampered by fears of a landslide. Rescuers finally brought the boy out of the well on Saturday evening. No word had been given at the time about his condition, and the apparent rescue was initially met with cheers from the crowds. How Morocco held its breath for Rayan On social media, people using the hashtag #SaveRayan, which had been trending across the country and around the world, expressed their jubilation. But this turned to heartbreak minutes later when the statement came announcing that Rayan had died. Twitter users then began paying tribute and expressing sadness using the same hashtag. ""Rayan's courage will stay in our memories and continue to inspire us,"" AC Milan's Algerian midfielder Ismael Bennacer tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

In a Facebook post, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote: ""Tonight, I want to tell the family of little Rayan and the Moroccan people that we share their pain."" The statement from Morocco's royal palace described Rayan's death as a ""tragic accident"", adding: ""His Majesty King Mohammed VI called the parents of the boy who died after falling down the well."" The king had expressed his deepest condolences and sincere compassion, it added. Rayan's father was repairing the well at the time of the accident on Tuesday. He told local media the following day that his son had fallen down the shaft at ""that one moment I took my eyes off him"", adding: ""I haven't slept a wink."" Rayan's parents leaving the scene after their son's body is taken away by ambulance Led by Morocco's Civil Protection Directorate, rescue operations in the small northern town of Tamorot, around 100km (62 miles) from the city of Chefchaouen, began on Tuesday evening. Footage on Thursday from a camera lowered into the well showed that the boy was alive and conscious, but there had been no update on his condition since then. Rescuers tried to get oxygen, food and water to the boy but it was unclear whether he was able to use them. The mixture of rocky and sandy soils meant rescuers deemed opening the water well's narrow shaft to be too dangerous. Instead, bulldozers were used to cut a huge trench next to the well. Rescuers then started digging horizontally to reach the boy. Some worked round the clock, using powerful floodlights during the night. The operation had to be paused briefly several times to allow crews to check that the hillside was safe from collapsing and that no soil was entering the well. Large pipes were also used to protect rescue teams by providing a secure passage to the shaft. Rescuers dug a huge hole next to the well (front, centre) Hundreds of people gathered to watch the operation, singing religious songs, praying and chanting ""Allahu Akbar (God is greatest)"". Some even camped at the site. One local resident, Hafid El-Azzouz, told AFP news agency that he was there to show ""solidarity with this child, who is dear to Morocco and the whole world"". The incident is reminiscent of a similar tragedy in Spain in 2019, in whicha two-year-old boy died after falling into a borehole near the city of Malaga.

'UK first' in Tesco's carbon reduction pushThe UK's largest supermarket chain has started using electric trucks to deliver food and goods.Wales,"This video can not be played Trucker ""never thought I'd be plugging my HGV in"" Tesco has started using battery-powered delivery lorries in what it said was a UK supermarket first in a bid to reduce its carbon footprint. The UK's largest supermarket chain said it was the ""start of us learning how to do electric trucks"" as allnew UK HGVs need to be zero-emission,externalby 2040. Latest official figures showsmore than a quarter of UK emissions,externalcome from transport - with almost 5% from HGVs. ""The challenge for this is huge,"" said John Steventon of Tesco. A global climate agreement was reached at last year's COP26 summit wherecountries agreed to keep temperature rises within 1.5Cwhich scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Five of the UK's biggest supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Co-op and M&S - have promised tohalve the environmental impact of a weekly food shopby the end of the decade. What's your diet's carbon footprint? The best climate solution you've never heard of Waitrose and Lidl top greenest supermarket ranking Aldi has pledged to put doors on all fridgesin its UK stores and now Tesco is trialling fully-electric trucks as the retail giant aims tobecome net carbon zero by 2035,external. Asda, Sainsbury's and Aldi have claimed they are trialling natural gas-powered lorries which they said would cut emissions by up to 90% compared to diesel. Tesco has more than 2,000 delivery trucks serving its more than 2,500 UK stores from 22 distribution depots But Tesco said it was the only major UK supermarket to use fully-electric articulated trucks and it comes after research showsbattery-powered HGVs can compete with diesel lorries. ""We as a business have set ourselves some challenging targets to get its carbon zero by 2035 and being involved in this being the first to introduce an electric HGVs is part of that journey,"" said Mr Steventon. ""The fleet will be over 2,000 trucks that will have to find a solution to get to carbon neutral."" The two electric lorries operating in south Wales will be Tesco's first battery-operated trucks Two 37-tonne DAF lorries, running on batteries, have started moving Tesco food and goods from its train depot on the outskirts of Cardiff to its distribution centre about 18 miles away at Magor, near Newport. ""This will represent less than 1% of our total fleet,"" said Mr Steventon. With a range of about 100 miles (161km), he said the current generation of electric lorries was not the solution for long-distance journeys. ""But this is the start of us learning how to do electric trucks with a view to rolling that out further,"" he added. ""The technology has not been available until now."" Tesco have more than 2,000 home delivery vans across he UK and say they will be all be electric within six years Tesco has already started using electric vehicles for its home delivery service and has pledged that it will be ""fully electrified by 2028"". ""Now we will try and follow the same journey with the HGV fleet,"" added Mr Steventon. The haulage firm operating the service for Tesco is FSEW of Cardiff and it was chosen because it helped the retailer ""drive some of that technology to become the first"". FSEW boss Geoff Tomlinson's said electric lorries cost about three times more than a diesel one ""The industry was basically saying 'no, it's not going to happen, it's too soon and the electric the range is too short',"" said FSEW boss Geoff Tomlinson. ""I say make it work because we have to change what we do as soon as possible."" He said by charging the lorries while unloading, his electric lorries can make three round-trips from Wentloog to Magor before needing to charge for several hours. Supermarkets pledge to halve environmental impact Why supermarket chiller aisles may soon not be so chilly A really simple guide to climate change ""We are showing the public, our competitors and our customers that we can deliver with low noise-polluting vehicles and no tailpipe emissions,"" he added. ""We hope, as a business, we have ordered our last diesel trucks."" The driver making the first delivery said, after 35 years on the roads, he never thought he would be ""plugging in"" his lorry. Darren Evans said he was surprised by the power of the electric lorry and prefers its quiet ride ""I was thinking 'this is going to be a boring thing for an old trucker, give me back my diesel motor' - but no, I'm quite happy, I think I'll stick with it,"" said Darren Evans. ""I've got four grandchildren. I do believe this is the way forward, it's an easier way to drive, it's not polluting and it's cheaper to run."" Tesco's move into using electric delivery trucks has been called a ""small step"" in the ""revolution"" of decarbonising commercial freight deliveries. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprint The head of Cardiff University's electric vehicle centre of excellence said the average daily trip for a UK lorry was 250 miles (402km) and the UK government's electric truck target was achievable with improved charging infrastructure. ""The replacement of diesel vehicles is coming, step by step,"" said Prof Liana Cipcigan. ""For the moment, electrification is the right solution and if these vehicles are charging from renewables we will have a better future for our children.""

"Levelling up: 'It's about people, not shiny new buildings'","This week the government published its eagerly awaited White Paper, setting out plans to reduce regional inequality. Levelling up aims to revitalise communities in places like Rhyl, where BBC News has been tracking progress of this key policy. But lessons from previous efforts are not being learnt, claim critics. And the focus should be on people rather than ""shiny new buildings"", says the former head of a flagship scheme in Newcastle. Florist Carol Parr clips the ends of flower stems on a bouquet as she explains the dilemma she faced. ""I had a little battle with myself. Do I stay? Do I commit to Rhyl?"" she says. ""Not many people say good things about Rhyl, which I can understand based on crime, there's a lot of trouble."" Despite that, Carol opted to move into a larger shop on the high street three years ago. ""I'm very optimistic and over the last two or three years I have seen a change in Rhyl. I think it's an up-and-coming town again."" Such optimism is not always evident in the seaside town, which was struggling long before its economy was pounded by the pandemic. But Carol's act of faith may be repaid. The local MP and the county council want to transform the town centre and recently prepared a Â£10m bid from the UK government's levelling up fund. Money from the Â£4.8bn fund aims to narrow the gap between richer and poorer parts of the UK. It will allow overlooked and undervalued communities to take back control of their destiny, the levelling up minister, Michael Gove,told parliament on Wednesday. But there are concerns that vital lessons from the past are being ignored. A generation ago, West Newcastle was undergoing a radical plan for change. It was one of 39 English communities that received funds under Labour's New Deal for Communities (NDC). Within a few years levels of deprivation fell. Graeme Williams ran the scheme and on a freezing cold January afternoon he gives us a tour of the area. We walk in shadows cast by the tower blocks of Cruddas Park, not far from the city centre. Twenty years ago ""they looked awful"", says Mr Williams. ""They were awful."" Some of the blocks were refurbished, others demolished as part of the Â£55m spent in West Newcastle during a decade of regeneration. But most of the money didn't go on capital projects, such as buildings. His team appointed eight people who knew the area well to work with residents to prioritise what changes were needed. Decisions were taken by a management board made up mostly of residents. The emphasis was ""around training, education and supporting people to move into employment"", says Mr Williams. ""People recognised they had agency where they could actually generate change."" It gave them hope. An independent assessment of the New Deal for Communities by academics at Sheffield Hallam University concluded ""in many respects these neighbourhoods have been transformed"". It said: ""The biggest improvements were for indicators of people's feelings about their neighbourhoods."" Mr Williams still works in the city. He is now a director of the Centre West charity. And while proud of some of his achievements, he says a lot of work was ""undone by austerity"" which ""hammered areas like the west end of Newcastle"". ""It's massively disheartening and incredibly frustrating because we seem to take two steps forward and then two or three steps back as far as urban regeneration is concerned,"" he says. ""There's an awful lot of really good evaluation work that's been done to identify what works and how we can do things better and it's not being used. "" Levelling up ""might produce some nice shiny new buildings. But I don't think it will necessarily improve the lives and prospects of people living in them communities"". REACTION:Hope and doubt in the towns in need of help EXPLAINED:What is levelling up and how is it going? ANALYSIS:Can the UK improve inequalities without spending? Supporters of what the Labour government policy achieved include a former Tory speech writer for Theresa May. Will Tanner, now director of the Onward think tank, assessed 60 years of regeneration projects by previous governments. ""This isn't a party-political point. This is just about the right policy based on the evidence,"" he says. He said putting power in the hands of communities worked best, ""so they are pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, rather than relying on a top-down government programme"". He says the government is right to want to change the economic geography of the UK and is supportive of its plans. But adds: ""The most important thing for the levelling up fund to do is to let go of power from Whitehall and to empower community organisations right down at the hyper-local level."" The White Paper acknowledges the importance of local decision-making and promises more regional mayors. It isn't yet clear what role will be played by people at a neighbourhood level. Back in Rhyl, we stroll around the town centre with Conservative MP James Davies, walking past boarded up and shuttered shops. He agrees. ""Just building things, bricks and mortar is not the answer. It needs to be a cleverly thought through scheme that's going to boost economic activity."" We pause outside the derelict Queen's Market, which is being bulldozed. It's hoped a new food hall with flats and offices will be developed on the site through a mix of funding from the Welsh government, Denbighshire County Council, the levelling up fund and private businesses. The plans would also see the town reconnected to the seafront. Incredibly, though an expansive sandy beach is just yards away, you can't see it from the high street.  Dr Davies says there is local backing. A master plan went out to consultation and has ""the support of local councils, residents, businesses"". But a potential obstacle is the number of high street shops owned by absentee landlords. A sample of Land Registry documents seen by BBC News show only five out of 25 High Street properties are owned by people local to Rhyl. ""That's a real challenge,"" Dr Davies acknowledges. ""All you can do is invest in the areas that the local authority and willing partners own as a priority. And then you hope that economic activity will encourage others to follow over time."" The BBC is tracking progress of the government's key levelling up policy in towns and cities around the UK. You can read more of our reporting from Rhyl here: The seaside town fighting against violence and frustration The town debating how to 'level up' How do locals out and about on a beautiful, bright winter's morning feel about their town centre and the plans to regenerate it? ""I'm not quite sure how to put this. It's appalling,"" says a man who moved to Rhyl seven years ago. ""Shops closing, shutting arcades. Rhyl just isn't what it used to be. I don't think it will ever come back."" But octogenarian former mayor, Diana Hannan, out on her mobility scooter, loves the town so much she moved back after emigrating to Australia. ""We've got the best seaside resort in Wales,"" she says. ""We get all this negative press about drugs and alcohol and all the rest of it, but we've got a lovely community living here. Rhyl is going to boom. You wait until all of these stores go up."" On the road out of town we stop off at a food bank run out of the back of the Wellspring church. Amid shelves straining under the weight of tins of baked beans, pastor Mark Jones explains how Rhyl is full of ""fabulous people"". But he says ""there's a lack of energy, a lack of enthusiasm"". ""There's this sense of hopelessness amongst the people. If you walk down the high street, you can just see it in people's eyes."" Mr Jones, who has lived in the town for more than 40 years, supports the levelling up plans but says the proposals ""need to show the people of Rhyl that there is a hope and a future for them"". ""It's OK to invest,"" he says. ""But you also need to inspire.""

Joe Rogan apologises for past use of racial slurs,"The US podcast host Joe Rogan has issued an apology over his past use of racist language on his popular show. A widely-shared compilation video showed him repeatedly using the N-word in early episodes of his show, which has been running for over a decade. The 54-year offered his ""deepest"" apologies and called his past use of the slur ""shameful"". Rogan also apologised for making a racist comment about visiting a predominantly black neighbourhood. He said he ""felt sick"" watching the compilation, and wished he could take his comments back. During a six minute video posted to his Instagram page, the MMA commentator also said that he hoped his errors could help to educate others. ""I do hope that this can be a teachable moment for anybody that doesn't know how offensive that word can be coming out of a white person's mouth,"" the Spotify star said. But Rogan also sought to defend himself, saying that many of the clips had been ""taken out of context of twelve years of conversations on my podcast"". He said that he had often used the slur while quoting comedians such as Paul Mooney and Lenny Bruce, or while discussing the use of the word in movies directed by the filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. India Arie, the Grammy-winning artist who first posted the compilation video on her Instagram page, condemned Rogan's use of the slur and said she would remove her music from Spotify in protest. ""He shouldn't even be uttering the word. Don't even say it, under any context. Don't say it. That's where I stand. I have always stood there,"" Arie said. Several artists have recently quit Spotifyin protest at what they allege is Rogan's role in spreading coronavirus misinformation. Spotify is thought to have paid more than $100m (Â£74m) for exclusive rights to the podcast in 2020.

Tech giants targeted in harmful content crackdown,"Sending ""genuinely threatening"" or ""knowingly false"" messages are among new criminal offences being added to proposed online safety laws. If passed, the government's online safety bill could see social networks fined 10% of their global turnover if they fail to remove harmful content. The changes mean they will also have to proactively remove harmful content. The bill also covers revenge porn, human trafficking, extremism and promoting suicide online. It already stated that websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, that host user-generated content would have to swiftly remove illegal content once it was reported to them. Now they will also have to put in place proactive measures to stop illegal activity. The issue has become a talking point recently with theracist abuse of footballers, revenge porn andcyberflashing, andCovid disinformationbeing highlighted as key safety concerns for social media companies to address. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries urged online platforms to start making the changes now before the bill comes into force. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: ""They can start doing what they need to do to remove those harmful algorithms and to remove much of the damage that they do, particularly to young people and to society as a whole."" The minister added the move would ""hold the feet to the fire"" of social media companies that have ""damaged lives"" and hold them to account for the first time. Harmful content could evade new online law - MPs Facebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Twitter says Online Safety Bill needs more clarity I get abuse and threats online - why can't it be stopped? Judy Thomas, whose daughter Frankie took her own life aged 15 in September 2018, said her school tablet and computer had been used to access distressing material in the hours and months before her death. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Back in January, February, March [2018] she'd been accessing, at school, horrendous sites."" Ms Thomas called for mandatory age verification to protect children online and said all websites should be included in the scope of the bill, rather than just larger platforms. ""We need to ensure young people simply cannot access online harms, and that if companies do the wrong thing... that there is a real price to pay,"" she said. Ms Thomas added these penalties must not just be financial, as many businesses could ""absorb that easily"", but the heads of these firms must also be ""held to account"". The big technology companies say they welcome the ""clarity"" that the online safety bill brings and that they recognise the need for regulation. They have, in many cases, not waited for governments to step in and they have invested in tech such as machine learning in order to identify harmful content at scale. However, while many say the bill does not go far enough, social media businesses point to free speech issues. They say they want to ensure that new rules don't stifle people's access to information by causing companies to ""over-moderate"" by removing too much content, in order to comply with them. The vast scope of the online safety bill means it will always have its critics. But experts underline that its introduction will be nothing short of a revolution in how the online world is policed, and mean it will be a very different place for the next generation. Asked about age verification, Ms Dorries said the government was looking at the idea, but said there was a ""downside"" to requiring all children to verify their age to access the internet. ""And young people go on to the internet to go shopping, you know, on clothes. Do we need to ensure that they verify their age when they're doing that?"", she added. This video can not be played Fitness influencer Elle Edwards speaks about dealing with explicit messages and cyber-flashing The government confirmed offences to have been added to the list of priority offences, which must be removed by platforms under the changes, include: Revenge porn Hate crimes Fraud The sale of illegal drugs or weapons The promotion or facilitation of suicide People smuggling Sexual exploitation Previously, companies were only forced to take down these posts after they were reported - but will now be required to be proactive in preventing people from seeing them in the first place. The government said naming these offences also enabled Ofcom - the proposed regulator - to take faster action. The changes come after three separate parliamentary committee reports warned the bill required strengthening and more clarity for tech firms. In addition, three new criminal offences have been added to the bill. The first is sending ""genuinely threatening communications"" such as a threat to rape, kill or cause financial harm, or coercive and controlling behaviour and online stalking. Sending ""harmful communications"", such as a domestic abuser sending an ex-partner a photograph of their front door to frighten them, is the second. However, offensive content with no intent to cause serious distress would not be illegal. The final new offence is ""knowingly false communications"", which would cover messages deliberately sent to inflict harm"", such as a hoax bomb threat. The government said the bill would not prohibit ""misinformation"", such as a social media post promoting a fake coronavirus cure, as long as those spreading it were unaware what they were saying was false.

Could Northern Ireland have an early election?Paul Givan's resignation as first minister has triggered a political crisis for devolution in NI.Northern Ireland,"Paul Givan said the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland were being tested Theresignation of the DUP's Paul Givan as first ministerhas triggered a political crisis for devolution in Northern Ireland. With the move meaningSinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill was also removed from her role as deputy first minister, the Stormont executive can no longer meet. An assembly election is due to happen in May, but some parties have called for it to be brought forward. How might that work and is it likely? BBC News NI takes a closer look. It has been nearly five years since the last assembly election, which took place on 2 March 2017. It was a snap poll that took place because the previous power-sharing government had collapsed afterMartin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in January that year, unseating Arlene Foster from her role as first minister. Under existing rules, it triggered a seven-day countdown for those roles to be filled or it fell to then-NI Secretary James Brokenshire to call an election, which he did. Assembly elections are scheduled to happen every five years, and usually on the first Thursday in May. Bearing that in mind, the next election is due to take place on 5 May 2022. Yes. Sinn FÃ©in said it believes an early election should take place because it is no longer ""business as usual"" at Stormont. The DUP has also supported the idea, saying ""it is time"" for the public to have its say. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald (centre) called for an early election on Thursday Both parties have argued that the collapse of the executive presents a natural break and opportunity for an early poll. However, the SDLP, Alliance and Ulster Unionists have dismissed the proposal as a mistake. Any move to dissolve the assembly earlier than is currently scheduled at the end of March would affect legislation that can be passed in the time left. There are about 28 outstanding bills that have yet to complete their passage, an early election means at least some of them would fail to make it into law. That appears to be in question. Under existing rules in the Northern Ireland Act (1998) - which set up the modern power-sharing institutions after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed - once the seven-day countdown to renominate a first and deputy first minister expires,the secretary of state is obliged to set a date for an election,external. However, new rules due to take effect after being signed off in Westminster next week are set to change this. Brandon Lewis is Northern Ireland's secretary of state The Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Bill,externalwill amend previous legislation to override the seven-day window with an initial six-week ""cooling off"" period. A reading of this suggests Mr Lewis could only call an assembly election ""at any time"" after those six weeks have elapsed. The bill will need to receive royal assent before next Friday to ensure it can take effect. Westminster sources said the legislation would mean Mr Lewis's power to call the election after six weeks would only arise if he considered it was necessary to ensure sufficient representation among executive ministers to command cross-community confidence. Under those rules the earliest he could intervene would be late March, which is not far off the current scheduled polling day. Separately, the secretary of state does retain a power under the Northern Ireland Act (1998) to ""alter the date of a scheduled election by up to two months either side of the original date"". Westminster sources have indicated that Mr Lewis is unlikely to amend the date of the election, but final decisions have not been made. On Friday, the Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie called for clarity from the secretary of state about his intentions around the election. There exists a provision within the NI Act (1998) that sets out the terms and conditions for ""extraordinary elections"". It states that the Stormont Assembly can vote by at least a two-thirds majority that the assembly should be dissolved and leave it to the secretary of state to propose a date for the next election. However, that would still put the ball back in Brandon Lewis's court in terms of discretion around a date. This piece of legislation has also never been enacted. And it appears unlikely that a two-thirds majority would be reached, given the number of parties currently opposed to an early poll. The Electoral Office is still working on the basis that the election will happen on 5 May. But much of what is happening right now means Northern Ireland politics is in uncharted territory, with more than its share of grey areas.

Platinum Jubilee events announced,"The Queen will be 96 when the main Jubilee celebrations kick off in June Buckingham Palace has unveiled the full line-up of celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee this year. Street parties, a concert with some of the world's ""biggest entertainment stars"" and a chance to see the Queen's homes up close are all part of the plan to mark her 70 years on the throne. It will culminate in a four-day UK bank holiday weekend from 2 to 5 June. The first event begins on Monday, with a competition to invent a new pudding to celebrate the Queen's reign. Finalists will be judged by an expert panel including Dame Mary Berry and Masterchef's Monica Galetti. The winning recipe will be made available to the public and the pudding will be enjoyed at Big Jubilee Lunches during the bank holiday weekend. What do people buy the Queen for her Jubilee? On 6 February the Queen will become the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, marking a 70-year reign. A series of celebrations will take place throughout the year. The Queen marked 50 years on the throne in 2002, with the Duke of Edinburgh by her side She rode in the Golden State Coach as part of the celebrations As with the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, the first week in June has been chosen for the celebratory weekend, with the summer offering a better chance of good weather than February. To create the four-day weekend, the late May Spring Bank Holiday will be moved to 2 June and an additional one-off bank holiday on 3 June created. It is not clear which events the Queen will attend herself. She was advised by her medical team to rest for several weeks after an overnight hospital stay in October. The majority of the jubilee duties will probably be given to the rest of the family, including the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. This jubilee will be the Queen's first without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died in April last year. It's going to be puddings, parties, parades and pageants, in honour of the platinum jubilee. There isn't really a template for celebrating a British monarch's 70-year reign, because it's not happened before. The nearest was Queen Victoria's 63 years and elsewhere you have to go back to 18th-Century France and Louis XIV, who reached 72 years. In this current bleak mid-Covid winter, the jubilee offers the warming prospect of a four-day bank holiday in June, with concerts, parties and pubs open until 1am. The ""platinum pudding"" competition is in the tradition of royal-related dishes like Coronation Chicken, invented for the Queen's coronation in 1953. So expect a lot of trifling puns. The celebrations are also a reminder of how much the Queen has been a constant figure. A recent study showed for 85% of the population she's the only monarch they've ever known. This will be a marker for memories in many people's lives. Prince Philip joined the Queen on board the Royal Barge Spirit of Chartwell as part of the celebrations in 2012 The Queen taking part in a Silver Jubilee walkabout in 1977 During the festivities, Sandringham and Balmoral will be open for visitors to enjoy the celebrations across the long weekend in June. And during the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, a River Of Hope - made up of 200 silk flags decorated with images of hope drawn by children - will make its way along the Mall in central London. As part of the Queen's Green Canopy initiative, some 60,000 trees have already been planted to mark the year, as people have been encouraged to""plant a tree for the jubilee"". On10 Januarythe Platinum Pudding Competition starts. Members of the public are invited to create a dish to dedicate to the Queen's reign. From12 to 15 May, more than 500 horses and 1,000 performers will take part in a 90-minute show at Windsor Castle, taking the audience on a journey through history from Elizabeth I to present day. The first day of the long weekend isThursday 2 Juneand will see Trooping the Colour held in full for the first time since the pandemic. There will be more than 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians taking part. Tickets are available to the public from next weekon this site,external. Also that day, Platinum Jubilee beacons will be lit in more than 1,500 locations across the UK, the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories. For the first time, the capital cities of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons. OnFriday 3 June- the second day of the Bank Holiday weekend - a Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen's reign will be held at St Paul's Cathedral. OnSaturday 4 Junethe Queen will be joined by members of the Royal Family at the Derby, held at Epsom Downs. There will also be a Platinum Party at Buckingham Palace, with members of the public invited to apply to attend a live concert. Performers have yet to be named, but it is billed as bringing together some of the world's biggest stars to celebrate the most significant moments from the Queen's seven-decade reign. The ballot for UK residents to secure tickets will be launched in February. OnSunday 5 Junepeople across the country will be invited to sit down together to take part in the Big Jubilee Lunch, with street parties held across the UK. That day's events will also include the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will feature 5,000 people from the UK and the Commonwealth performing around the area of Buckingham Palace. The palace promises ""pomp and ceremony, street arts, theatre, music, circus, costumes as well as cutting-edge visual technology"". Primary and secondary school children are invited tocreate a picture of their hopes and aspirations,externalfor the planet over the next 70 years. A selection of these will be transferred on to silk flags, which will carried by secondary school pupils in the pageant. InJuly, three displays marking the Queen's accession to the throne, the coronation and jubilees will be put on at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It will include portraits as well as the jewellery and outfits worn for each occasion. What are your plans for the Jubilee?

Former minister joins calls for PM to resign,"Another Conservative MP has called for Boris Johnson to resign as the turmoil at 10 Downing Street continues. Former minister Nick Gibb is the latest Tory to submit a letter of no confidence in the row over events held at No 10 during lockdown. And Tory MP Stephen Hammond said he is ""considering very carefully"" whether he still has confidence in the PM. But Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries insisted the ""vast majority"" of Conservative MPs supported Mr Johnson. Meanwhile,the Daily Mirror reports,externala photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at a birthday gathering has been handed to police investigating Covid breaches. The paper said the picture was one of 300 submitted tothe Metropolitan Police investigation into 12 alleged gatheringsand was thought to have been taken by the PM's official photographer, who is funded by the taxpayer. It said it showed the prime minister holding a can of beer at an event in No 10's Cabinet Room in June 2020, alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was holding a soft drink. At the time, gatherings of more than two people inside werebanned by law. It comes at the end of a difficult week for the PM, which has seenfive No 10 aides resignand the publication of theinitial findings of the Sue Gray reportinto events at Downing Street while Covid restrictions were in place. Tory MP sends letter of no confidence in PM What do key resignations mean for PM? The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Gibb, who has served under three prime ministers and who lost his position as schools minister in Boris Johnson's reshuffle last September, said his constituents were ""furious about the double standards"" and that ""to restore trust, we need to change the prime minister"". He said Covid restrictions imposed by Mr Johnson were ""flagrantly disregarded"" in Downing Street, and the PM was inaccurate when, in December, he told the House of Commons there was no party. ""Some argue that eating a few canapes with a glass of prosecco is hardly a reason to resign. But telling the truth matters, and nowhere more so than in the House of Commons where, like a court of law, truth must be told regardless of the personal consequences,"" he wrote. Stephen Hammond, Conservative MP for Wimbledon, told the BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster programme: ""I think all Conservative colleagues, all of whom I know, are in it for trying to do the best for their constituents, and the country will be wrestling with their consciences this weekend."" Mr Hammond said he had not yet submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister but would be considering his next steps ""very carefully over the weekend"". He added it ""certainly looks like"" the beginning of the end for Tory confidence in the prime minister. Mr Gibb said fellow backbench Tory Aaron Bell had ""struck a chord"" when hecriticised Mr Johnson over lockdown partiesearlier this week. Mr Bell had asked the prime minister if he took him for a fool for following the rules himself - including not hugging his family at his grandmother's funeral, or going for a cup of tea after the service. This video can not be played Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries defends the PM saying he does tell the truth On Friday, Mr Bell said the ""breach of trust"" over the rule breaking and how it had been handled made the PM's position untenable, as he confirmed he had also submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady - the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. At least 54 MPs need to write to Sir Graham to trigger a vote on the PM's leadership of the party. Other Conservative MPs are expected to consider whether to put in their letters over the weekend. Mr Johnson has written to all Tory MPs to say he is committed to improving the way 10 Downing Street works. What does Sue Gray's parties report say? How many parties are police investigating? Fact-checking Boris Johnson's Jimmy Savile claim Ms Dorries told the BBC most MPs were ""right behind the prime minister because he has delivered... and will continue to do so"" and said Mr Johnson had been ""very positive"" when she communicated with him within the past 24 hours. She said a huge amount of change was now under way within No 10, but she was ""cautious"" of asking him to change too much, because of achievements such as having the biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher. Ms Dorries said those speaking out against Mr Johnson were ""the same names"" that ""keep cropping up"" and ""no prime minister would please any of those"". She said there were ""a few voices being amplified"" by the media, describing the comments made by Mr Gibb and Mr Bell as ""disappointing"". This video can not be played Aaron Bell asked the PM on Monday if he considered him a ""fool"". Speaking on Newsnight, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen suggested it was now the job of the cabinet to ""show leadership"" and ""confront"" the issue of the prime minister's leadership. But his fellow Tory MP Richard Bacon suggested it was not for politicians to change governments - that was for the electorate to take care of. And Liam Fox, former trade secretary, said there was a danger the party was becoming distracted from big issues such as inflation, the energy crisis and the situation in Ukraine. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There will need to be closure on this issue, in the Conservative Party and in the country, and I think when there's more to say, we should say it, and there are questions that will need to be answered."" Some of Mr Johnson's supporters, including one former cabinet minister, have criticised the Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who this week distanced himself from the prime minister's controversial comments about Sir Keir Starmer, for being disloyal at a difficult time. No 10 policy chief Munira Mirza quit on Thursday, describing Mr Johnson's comments on Sir Keir as ""scurrilous"". The prime minister falsely claimed the Labour leader had failed to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile during his time as director of public prosecutions. Mr Sunak said he ""wouldn't have said it"", while on Friday Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Sir Keir ""did a good job and should be respected for it"". The government has faced intense pressure over gatherings held in and around Downing Street during Covid lockdowns. A police investigation into several of the events has now concluded, with more than 100 fines having been issued to attendees. Here is what we know about the gatherings and the restrictions in place at the time: 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said ""those people were at work talking about work"". The rules: Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. This event was not investigated by the police. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson apologised to MPs for attending the event, saying he spent 25 minutes thanking staff, before returning to his office. The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time. We know at least one fine has been issued after the government's former head of ethics admitted receiving one and apologised for attending the event. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had ""gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes"". The rules: Restrictions at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time. We know at least three attendees have received fines from the police, with the PM, his wife Carrie Symonds and Chancellor Rishi Sunak all confirming they have paid fixed penalty notices. 13 November 2020 Two gatherings are understood to have taken place in Downing Street on this date: one to mark the departure of a special adviser and one in the Downing Street flat. According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the gathering in the flat where Mr Johnson and his wife live was to celebrate the departure of Dominic Cummings, the PM's former senior adviser. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. The rules: Eight days earlier Boris Johnson had announced a new lockdown in England. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. The police investigation determined that an event on this date did breach the rules in place at the time but they have not confirmed whether it was one or both of the events. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. This event was not investigated by the police. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. The rules: Eight days earlier, London had been placed in restrictions which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless ""reasonably necessary"" for work purposes. This event was not investigated by the police. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an ""unauthorised gathering"" took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. In December, police said they would be contacting two people who attended the party. This event was not included in Sue Gray's report. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - shows Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. The rules:At this time, the rules in London banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless ""reasonably necessary"" for work purposes. This event was not investigated by the police. 16 December 2020 The Department for Transport has apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices, calling it ""inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment"" by staff. This event was not included in Sue Gray's report. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was ""truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result"". A second gathering was held in the Cabinet Office to hold an online Christmas quiz for the Cabinet Secretaryâs private office. A third gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of a No 10 official The police investigation determined that an event on this date did breach the rules in place at the time but they have not confirmed whether it was one or all of the events. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street on this date. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton joking about reports of the event, saying: ""This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced."" The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time. 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it ""should not have happened at the time that it did"". Boris Johnson was not at either party. The rules The rules had been eased in England on 12 April, but working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households.

'I turned away and my little sister was gone',"Ricki turned away for just a few seconds and his little sister was taken. She would never be seen again. For five decades he has wrestled with his guilt. Now he has opened up to the BBC's Jon Kay in a new true-crime podcast Fairy Meadow. ""People tell me it wasn't my fault. I've been told that thousands of times. I know I was only seven years old, but I shouldn't have left her."" Ricki is walking a personal pilgrimage. His waterproof trousers are splattered with mud and ripped from barbed wire fences. His boots have started to leak and his feet are covered in blisters. But still, he is walking. He was planning to hang photos of his little sister onto trees as he walked in her memory, but suddenly the idea is too painful. He puts the black and white pictures back inside his rucksack. ""I can't leave her out in the cold. I just can't do it. I can't bear the idea of her smiling face being out here. Not in the wind and rain."" He has brought the ribbon-tied bundles more than 16,000km (10,000 miles) - from his home in Melbourne, Australia - to northern Spain. He is trekking 200km through the chilly Cantabrian Mountains along part of the Camino pilgrim route. ""I'm not a religious person. Not at all. I mean, what kind of religion would allow it to happen? She was only three years old."" Hearing his accent, other walkers ask why he has come to Europe to hike alone in the depths of winter. It must be summer back home. Wouldn't he rather be on the beach? Ricki's smile becomes a wrinkled frown. Now in his late 50s, he tells them he doesn't like the beach. Cheryl - Ricki's three-year-old sister - vanished in broad daylight from Fairy Meadow beach in New South Wales in early 1970. Family snapshot of Cheryl on the beach The family had recently arrived in Australia having emigrated from the UK. He was only seven years old at the time, but Ricki has always blamed himself for what happened - because he was looking after Cheryl when she disappeared from the changing rooms at the top of the beach. He turned away for just a few seconds. The police have always been convinced the toddler was abducted, but nobody has ever been convicted. Ricki stops walking for a moment and looks out across the rugged Spanish landscape. ""When I go to my grave, I'll take with me what my eyes have seen and we can share those sights together. I've been talking to her this whole journey - my whole life."" A few yards off the main pathway, we come across an ancient stone chapel. Inside, Ricki places his bundle of pictures on the altar next to some candles. He sits in silence for a few minutes, staring at the images of his smiling little sister. ""She's safe here."" When I walked that section of the Camino with Ricki in 2018, he had never really spoken to a journalist before. He had made the occasional appearance at police press conferences asking for information, but had never opened up about what had happened to Cheryl - and the impact on his life. He wanted to talk to me because, suddenly, this cold case seemed to be moving again. Cheryl with one of her brothers by a swimming pool in the sunshine Police in Australia had recently found a confession in an old box of evidence. It was made by a teenage boy a year after the toddler disappeared. After a new public appeal, detectives tracked down the ""boy"" - who was now a man in his sixties - and charged him with murder. He pleaded not guilty. Trekking through Spain was Ricki's way of clearing his head and preparing for the trial. ""I need to know. For Cheryl. For all of us. We need answers."" However, when Ricki returned to Australia, a judge ruled the confession could not be used as evidence after all. The prosecution was dropped and the former defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, walked free from court. ""We couldn't believe it. We never knew about the confession,"" Ricki told me after the case collapsed. ""For years, we didn't even know there had been a suspect. Our lives could have been so different. Did we have to go through all this pain and suffering? I don't want any other family to go through what our family has been through. I'm angry. Angry at myself. Angry at the world. Just angry."" The next time I see Ricki in person is in Australia, shortly after the 2019 judgment. He's agreed to work with me on a BBC podcast series about Cheryl's case. We talk about when he first arrived in New South Wales with his family all those years ago. ""We were all so excited,"" he recalls. ""We'd left cold, wet, England to live in the Aussie sunshine. We couldn't believe our luck. It was a fresh start. A new beginning. A new life."" Listen to the Fairy Meadow podcast on BBC Sounds Jon Kay tracks down people who were on Fairy Meadow beach when Cheryl Grimmer disappeared - and speaks to detectives on the case in the 1970s and more recently. He investigates possible sightings of the toddler and the bizarre ransom note sent to the family shortly after she vanished. Stream or download now Watch the story of how Cheryl went missing The Grimmer family's new home, Fairy Meadow, was an idyllic-sounding beachside community on the outskirts of Wollongong, New South Wales, an hour south of Sydney. They were among more than a million ""Ten Pound Poms"" who headed Down Under after World War Two on the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme. The Australian Government was offering foreign families the opportunity to emigrate for just a tenner, to help build the country's population and economy. Ricki takes me to the beach where he last saw Cheryl. From the car park, he points over to what remains of the old migrant hostel where the Grimmers stayed. Fairy Meadow beach today - the open-air ladies' changing rooms, where Cheryl was last seen, are closest to the camera A couple of accommodation huts have been preserved by a local history group. ""It was like a huge holiday camp. There were thousands of us - mums, dads and kids from all over the world. A real melting pot. There was entertainment at the weekend, a big canteen to eat in. We spent most of our time outdoors - playing cricket and riding bikes. We couldn't believe our luck."" Photos from those early days show hopeful, happy smiles. Carol and Vince Grimmer had four children. Ricki was the eldest. He was followed by brothers Stephen and Paul. Cheryl was the couple's youngest child. Their only daughter. Cheryl with her father Vince, who got a job in the Australian Army Ricki remembers her constant smile: ""The best way to describe Cheryl was cheeky and cute. She was always cheerful. Our little princess. She was also a rascal."" But, on 12 January 1970, the Grimmers' dreams fell apart. It's a boiling hot mid-summer's day. The accommodation huts are stifling and full of bugs. After lunch, Ricki begs his mum to take him and his three younger siblings down to Fairy Meadow beach for a refreshing splash in the sea. At around two o'clock in the afternoon, the wind suddenly changes. Locals call it a ""southerly buster"". Sand blows everywhere. Families race to pack up and leave. The children's mum, Carol, tells Ricki to take his brothers and sister up to the changing block at the top of the beach and to wait for her there. It's only a short walk. Three-year-old Cheryl runs giggling into the ladies' changing rooms. Ricki and his brothers are too embarrassed to follow her. So, after pleading with her to come out, they decide to go back to the beach to get their mum. ""It happened so fast. It took us about 90 seconds to find mum and bring her up to the shower block,"" Ricki remembers. ""But, by the time we returned, there was no sign of Cheryl. She was there - and then she was gone. It was so quick. ""My mother looked around and then she started shaking me and shouting, 'Where did you leave her?' It went crazy after that. Everybody started calling out her name. There was panic. Complete chaos."" Locals joined the search for Cheryl Police and soldiers searched nearby bushland and creeks Despite one of the biggest searches in the history of New South Wales - involving thousands of police officers and soldiers - Cheryl was never found. More than 50 years later, that single moment still dominates every aspect of Ricki's life: ""Try putting yourself in my shoes. I'm haunted by it. Consumed by it. I can still see her standing there, laughing and smiling. I still see her running up and down the shoreline. Those images will never go away."" Initially, I thought this story would make a short news bulletin piece. I had no idea how my investigation would develop into oureight-part Fairy Meadow podcast. I've spent a lot of time listening to Ricki. He has told me how that single moment in his childhood has ruined the rest of his life. Flashbacks and nightmares still torment him. There have been broken marriages, fractured relationships with his kids and times when he has felt unable to carry on. So what keeps him going? ""Before they died, I promised my mum and dad I would find Cheryl - or at least find out what happened to her. I will."" Carol Grimmer with her three sons (Ricki centre) the day after Cheryl disappeared As part of his quest for answers, Ricki has also come back to the UK. Back to the city of Bristol where he and his family lived before they emigrated to Australia. It's also the city where I live and work as a BBC reporter. Here, in a hotel room, Ricki shows me a leather-bound journal which he keeps in his travel bag. It is filled with drawings and letters which he still writes to his missing sister every day. ""My psychologist said it might help. I tell Cheryl about my life and what the family is up to. I ask her about her life. What she might be doing. I scribble little stick figures - trying to make sense of things. This book goes with me everywhere. Every plane trip. Every holiday. Everywhere. It never leaves my side. If I die, it dies with me."" For Ricki, Bristol is a place where he feels he can maintain his connection with his sister. A place filled with memories from the time before she was taken. He shows me the small terraced house where the Grimmer children were born. He remembers their suitcases floating down the hallway in floodwater just before they headed to the New South Wales sunshine. He shows me the playground where he would push Cheryl on the swing. Ricki's treasured photo of him holding hands with Cheryl Over the decades, the pain of losing his sister meant Ricki cut himself off. He tried to move on. He tried to forget. He refused to confront his past. But the reopening of the police investigation in 2016, the rediscovery of the confession and the case coming to court forced him to face things and mend some of the relationships he had ignored. In a Bristol pub, he meets some of the English cousins he didn't speak to for years. Now close again, they tease him about his choice of Australian Shiraz, rather than local beer. Ricki updates them on his campaign for justice and thanks them for their continued support: ""We can't let this go. We are going to keep fighting. We can never give up."" The disappointments and frustrations of the past few years have at least reunited the Grimmer family on both sides of the world. They hope theNew South Wales Government's recent offerof a A$1m reward (Â£528,000) for information will persuade somebody to come forward. Driving Ricki from Bristol to Heathrow Airport, to catch a flight back to Australia, he asks me if we can stop at a local cemetery for a few minutes. The wooden cross in memory of Cheryl In the far corner of this quiet, rural graveyard, beneath some pine trees, he shows me the Grimmer family plot where his grandparents are buried. Then, he tells me to look more closely. A small wooden sign has been nailed onto the headstone by one of his relatives. It says: ""Cheryl Grimmer. Rest in Peace."" Ricki places some flowers on the grave. The ornamental teddy bear he left here on his last trip to Bristol has faded a little, but it makes him smile. ""It's nice to have somewhere to come. Somewhere to remember."" Listen to the Fairy Meadow podcast on BBC Sounds Stream or download now Â© 2025 BBC.

Could Northern Ireland have an early election?,"Paul Givan said the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland were being tested Theresignation of the DUP's Paul Givan as first ministerhas triggered a political crisis for devolution in Northern Ireland. With the move meaningSinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill was also removed from her role as deputy first minister, the Stormont executive can no longer meet. An assembly election is due to happen in May, but some parties have called for it to be brought forward. How might that work and is it likely? BBC News NI takes a closer look. It has been nearly five years since the last assembly election, which took place on 2 March 2017. It was a snap poll that took place because the previous power-sharing government had collapsed afterMartin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in January that year, unseating Arlene Foster from her role as first minister. Under existing rules, it triggered a seven-day countdown for those roles to be filled or it fell to then-NI Secretary James Brokenshire to call an election, which he did. Assembly elections are scheduled to happen every five years, and usually on the first Thursday in May. Bearing that in mind, the next election is due to take place on 5 May 2022. Yes. Sinn FÃ©in said it believes an early election should take place because it is no longer ""business as usual"" at Stormont. The DUP has also supported the idea, saying ""it is time"" for the public to have its say. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald (centre) called for an early election on Thursday Both parties have argued that the collapse of the executive presents a natural break and opportunity for an early poll. However, the SDLP, Alliance and Ulster Unionists have dismissed the proposal as a mistake. Any move to dissolve the assembly earlier than is currently scheduled at the end of March would affect legislation that can be passed in the time left. There are about 28 outstanding bills that have yet to complete their passage, an early election means at least some of them would fail to make it into law. That appears to be in question. Under existing rules in the Northern Ireland Act (1998) - which set up the modern power-sharing institutions after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed - once the seven-day countdown to renominate a first and deputy first minister expires,the secretary of state is obliged to set a date for an election,external. However, new rules due to take effect after being signed off in Westminster next week are set to change this. Brandon Lewis is Northern Ireland's secretary of state The Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Bill,externalwill amend previous legislation to override the seven-day window with an initial six-week ""cooling off"" period. A reading of this suggests Mr Lewis could only call an assembly election ""at any time"" after those six weeks have elapsed. The bill will need to receive royal assent before next Friday to ensure it can take effect. Westminster sources said the legislation would mean Mr Lewis's power to call the election after six weeks would only arise if he considered it was necessary to ensure sufficient representation among executive ministers to command cross-community confidence. Under those rules the earliest he could intervene would be late March, which is not far off the current scheduled polling day. Separately, the secretary of state does retain a power under the Northern Ireland Act (1998) to ""alter the date of a scheduled election by up to two months either side of the original date"". Westminster sources have indicated that Mr Lewis is unlikely to amend the date of the election, but final decisions have not been made. On Friday, the Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie called for clarity from the secretary of state about his intentions around the election. There exists a provision within the NI Act (1998) that sets out the terms and conditions for ""extraordinary elections"". It states that the Stormont Assembly can vote by at least a two-thirds majority that the assembly should be dissolved and leave it to the secretary of state to propose a date for the next election. However, that would still put the ball back in Brandon Lewis's court in terms of discretion around a date. This piece of legislation has also never been enacted. And it appears unlikely that a two-thirds majority would be reached, given the number of parties currently opposed to an early poll. The Electoral Office is still working on the basis that the election will happen on 5 May. But much of what is happening right now means Northern Ireland politics is in uncharted territory, with more than its share of grey areas.

"Levelling up: 'It's about people, not shiny new buildings'When it comes to levelling up, can places like Rhyl learn from other towns and cities?","This week the government published its eagerly awaited White Paper, setting out plans to reduce regional inequality. Levelling up aims to revitalise communities in places like Rhyl, where BBC News has been tracking progress of this key policy. But lessons from previous efforts are not being learnt, claim critics. And the focus should be on people rather than ""shiny new buildings"", says the former head of a flagship scheme in Newcastle. Florist Carol Parr clips the ends of flower stems on a bouquet as she explains the dilemma she faced. ""I had a little battle with myself. Do I stay? Do I commit to Rhyl?"" she says. ""Not many people say good things about Rhyl, which I can understand based on crime, there's a lot of trouble."" Despite that, Carol opted to move into a larger shop on the high street three years ago. ""I'm very optimistic and over the last two or three years I have seen a change in Rhyl. I think it's an up-and-coming town again."" Such optimism is not always evident in the seaside town, which was struggling long before its economy was pounded by the pandemic. But Carol's act of faith may be repaid. The local MP and the county council want to transform the town centre and recently prepared a Â£10m bid from the UK government's levelling up fund. Money from the Â£4.8bn fund aims to narrow the gap between richer and poorer parts of the UK. It will allow overlooked and undervalued communities to take back control of their destiny, the levelling up minister, Michael Gove,told parliament on Wednesday. But there are concerns that vital lessons from the past are being ignored. A generation ago, West Newcastle was undergoing a radical plan for change. It was one of 39 English communities that received funds under Labour's New Deal for Communities (NDC). Within a few years levels of deprivation fell. Graeme Williams ran the scheme and on a freezing cold January afternoon he gives us a tour of the area. We walk in shadows cast by the tower blocks of Cruddas Park, not far from the city centre. Twenty years ago ""they looked awful"", says Mr Williams. ""They were awful."" Some of the blocks were refurbished, others demolished as part of the Â£55m spent in West Newcastle during a decade of regeneration. But most of the money didn't go on capital projects, such as buildings. His team appointed eight people who knew the area well to work with residents to prioritise what changes were needed. Decisions were taken by a management board made up mostly of residents. The emphasis was ""around training, education and supporting people to move into employment"", says Mr Williams. ""People recognised they had agency where they could actually generate change."" It gave them hope. An independent assessment of the New Deal for Communities by academics at Sheffield Hallam University concluded ""in many respects these neighbourhoods have been transformed"". It said: ""The biggest improvements were for indicators of people's feelings about their neighbourhoods."" Mr Williams still works in the city. He is now a director of the Centre West charity. And while proud of some of his achievements, he says a lot of work was ""undone by austerity"" which ""hammered areas like the west end of Newcastle"". ""It's massively disheartening and incredibly frustrating because we seem to take two steps forward and then two or three steps back as far as urban regeneration is concerned,"" he says. ""There's an awful lot of really good evaluation work that's been done to identify what works and how we can do things better and it's not being used. "" Levelling up ""might produce some nice shiny new buildings. But I don't think it will necessarily improve the lives and prospects of people living in them communities"". REACTION:Hope and doubt in the towns in need of help EXPLAINED:What is levelling up and how is it going? ANALYSIS:Can the UK improve inequalities without spending? Supporters of what the Labour government policy achieved include a former Tory speech writer for Theresa May. Will Tanner, now director of the Onward think tank, assessed 60 years of regeneration projects by previous governments. ""This isn't a party-political point. This is just about the right policy based on the evidence,"" he says. He said putting power in the hands of communities worked best, ""so they are pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, rather than relying on a top-down government programme"". He says the government is right to want to change the economic geography of the UK and is supportive of its plans. But adds: ""The most important thing for the levelling up fund to do is to let go of power from Whitehall and to empower community organisations right down at the hyper-local level."" The White Paper acknowledges the importance of local decision-making and promises more regional mayors. It isn't yet clear what role will be played by people at a neighbourhood level. Back in Rhyl, we stroll around the town centre with Conservative MP James Davies, walking past boarded up and shuttered shops. He agrees. ""Just building things, bricks and mortar is not the answer. It needs to be a cleverly thought through scheme that's going to boost economic activity."" We pause outside the derelict Queen's Market, which is being bulldozed. It's hoped a new food hall with flats and offices will be developed on the site through a mix of funding from the Welsh government, Denbighshire County Council, the levelling up fund and private businesses. The plans would also see the town reconnected to the seafront. Incredibly, though an expansive sandy beach is just yards away, you can't see it from the high street.  Dr Davies says there is local backing. A master plan went out to consultation and has ""the support of local councils, residents, businesses"". But a potential obstacle is the number of high street shops owned by absentee landlords. A sample of Land Registry documents seen by BBC News show only five out of 25 High Street properties are owned by people local to Rhyl. ""That's a real challenge,"" Dr Davies acknowledges. ""All you can do is invest in the areas that the local authority and willing partners own as a priority. And then you hope that economic activity will encourage others to follow over time."" The BBC is tracking progress of the government's key levelling up policy in towns and cities around the UK. You can read more of our reporting from Rhyl here: The seaside town fighting against violence and frustration The town debating how to 'level up' How do locals out and about on a beautiful, bright winter's morning feel about their town centre and the plans to regenerate it? ""I'm not quite sure how to put this. It's appalling,"" says a man who moved to Rhyl seven years ago. ""Shops closing, shutting arcades. Rhyl just isn't what it used to be. I don't think it will ever come back."" But octogenarian former mayor, Diana Hannan, out on her mobility scooter, loves the town so much she moved back after emigrating to Australia. ""We've got the best seaside resort in Wales,"" she says. ""We get all this negative press about drugs and alcohol and all the rest of it, but we've got a lovely community living here. Rhyl is going to boom. You wait until all of these stores go up."" On the road out of town we stop off at a food bank run out of the back of the Wellspring church. Amid shelves straining under the weight of tins of baked beans, pastor Mark Jones explains how Rhyl is full of ""fabulous people"". But he says ""there's a lack of energy, a lack of enthusiasm"". ""There's this sense of hopelessness amongst the people. If you walk down the high street, you can just see it in people's eyes."" Mr Jones, who has lived in the town for more than 40 years, supports the levelling up plans but says the proposals ""need to show the people of Rhyl that there is a hope and a future for them"". ""It's OK to invest,"" he says. ""But you also need to inspire.""

Joe Rogan apologises for past use of racial slursA video shared online showed the podcast host using a racial slur on several occasions.Entertainment & Arts,"The US podcast host Joe Rogan has issued an apology over his past use of racist language on his popular show. A widely-shared compilation video showed him repeatedly using the N-word in early episodes of his show, which has been running for over a decade. The 54-year offered his ""deepest"" apologies and called his past use of the slur ""shameful"". Rogan also apologised for making a racist comment about visiting a predominantly black neighbourhood. He said he ""felt sick"" watching the compilation, and wished he could take his comments back. During a six minute video posted to his Instagram page, the MMA commentator also said that he hoped his errors could help to educate others. ""I do hope that this can be a teachable moment for anybody that doesn't know how offensive that word can be coming out of a white person's mouth,"" the Spotify star said. But Rogan also sought to defend himself, saying that many of the clips had been ""taken out of context of twelve years of conversations on my podcast"". He said that he had often used the slur while quoting comedians such as Paul Mooney and Lenny Bruce, or while discussing the use of the word in movies directed by the filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. India Arie, the Grammy-winning artist who first posted the compilation video on her Instagram page, condemned Rogan's use of the slur and said she would remove her music from Spotify in protest.

Joe Rogan apologises for past use of racial slursA video shared online showed the podcast host using a racial slur on several occasions.Entertainment & ArtsHarmful messaging offences added to online safety billSending genuinely harmful communications will become illegal if the bill becomes law.Technology,"The US podcast host Joe Rogan has issued an apology over his past use of racist language on his popular show. A widely-shared compilation video showed him repeatedly using the N-word in early episodes of his show, which has been running for over a decade. The 54-year offered his ""deepest"" apologies and called his past use of the slur ""shameful"". Rogan also apologised for making a racist comment about visiting a predominantly black neighbourhood. He said he ""felt sick"" watching the compilation, and wished he could take his comments back. During a six minute video posted to his Instagram page, the MMA commentator also said that he hoped his errors could help to educate others. ""I do hope that this can be a teachable moment for anybody that doesn't know how offensive that word can be coming out of a white person's mouth,"" the Spotify star said. But Rogan also sought to defend himself, saying that many of the clips had been ""taken out of context of twelve years of conversations on my podcast"". He said that he had often used the slur while quoting comedians such as Paul Mooney and Lenny Bruce, or while discussing the use of the word in movies directed by the filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. India Arie, the Grammy-winning artist who first posted the compilation video on her Instagram page, condemned Rogan's use of the slur and said she would remove her music from Spotify in protest. ""He shouldn't even be uttering the word. Don't even say it, under any context. Don't say it. That's where I stand. I have always stood there,"" Arie said.

Harmful messaging offences added to online safety billSending genuinely harmful communications will become illegal if the bill becomes law.Technology,"Sending ""genuinely threatening"" or ""knowingly false"" messages are among new criminal offences being added to proposed online safety laws. If passed, the government's online safety bill could see social networks fined 10% of their global turnover if they fail to remove harmful content. The changes mean they will also have to proactively remove harmful content. The bill also covers revenge porn, human trafficking, extremism and promoting suicide online. It already stated that websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, that host user-generated content would have to swiftly remove illegal content once it was reported to them. Now they will also have to put in place proactive measures to stop illegal activity. The issue has become a talking point recently with theracist abuse of footballers, revenge porn andcyberflashing, andCovid disinformationbeing highlighted as key safety concerns for social media companies to address. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries urged online platforms to start making the changes now before the bill comes into force. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: ""They can start doing what they need to do to remove those harmful algorithms and to remove much of the damage that they do, particularly to young people and to society as a whole."" The minister added the move would ""hold the feet to the fire"" of social media companies that have ""damaged lives"" and hold them to account for the first time. Harmful content could evade new online law - MPs Facebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Twitter says Online Safety Bill needs more clarity I get abuse and threats online - why can't it be stopped? Judy Thomas, whose daughter Frankie took her own life aged 15 in September 2018, said her school tablet and computer had been used to access distressing material in the hours and months before her death. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Back in January, February, March [2018] she'd been accessing, at school, horrendous sites."" Ms Thomas called for mandatory age verification to protect children online and said all websites should be included in the scope of the bill, rather than just larger platforms. ""We need to ensure young people simply cannot access online harms, and that if companies do the wrong thing... that there is a real price to pay,"" she said. Ms Thomas added these penalties must not just be financial, as many businesses could ""absorb that easily"", but the heads of these firms must also be ""held to account"". The big technology companies say they welcome the ""clarity"" that the online safety bill brings and that they recognise the need for regulation. They have, in many cases, not waited for governments to step in and they have invested in tech such as machine learning in order to identify harmful content at scale. However, while many say the bill does not go far enough, social media businesses point to free speech issues. They say they want to ensure that new rules don't stifle people's access to information by causing companies to ""over-moderate"" by removing too much content, in order to comply with them. The vast scope of the online safety bill means it will always have its critics. But experts underline that its introduction will be nothing short of a revolution in how the online world is policed, and mean it will be a very different place for the next generation. Asked about age verification, Ms Dorries said the government was looking at the idea, but said there was a ""downside"" to requiring all children to verify their age to access the internet. ""And young people go on to the internet to go shopping, you know, on clothes. Do we need to ensure that they verify their age when they're doing that?"", she added. This video can not be played Fitness influencer Elle Edwards speaks about dealing with explicit messages and cyber-flashing The government confirmed offences to have been added to the list of priority offences, which must be removed by platforms under the changes, include: Revenge porn Hate crimes Fraud The sale of illegal drugs or weapons The promotion or facilitation of suicide People smuggling Sexual exploitation Previously, companies were only forced to take down these posts after they were reported - but will now be required to be proactive in preventing people from seeing them in the first place. The government said naming these offences also enabled Ofcom - the proposed regulator - to take faster action. The changes come after three separate parliamentary committee reports warned the bill required strengthening and more clarity for tech firms. In addition, three new criminal offences have been added to the bill. The first is sending ""genuinely threatening communications"" such as a threat to rape, kill or cause financial harm, or coercive and controlling behaviour and online stalking. Sending ""harmful communications"", such as a domestic abuser sending an ex-partner a photograph of their front door to frighten them, is the second. However, offensive content with no intent to cause serious distress would not be illegal. The final new offence is ""knowingly false communications"", which would cover messages deliberately sent to inflict harm"", such as a hoax bomb threat. The government said the bill would not prohibit ""misinformation"", such as a social media post promoting a fake coronavirus cure, as long as those spreading it were unaware what they were saying was false.

Trump was wrong to seek to stop Biden win - PenceMike Pence issues his strongest rebuttal of Donald Trump's claim over the 2021 election result.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Mike Pence says he had ""no right to change the outcome"" of the presidential election Former US Vice-President Mike Pence has dismissed claims by Donald Trump that he could have stopped Joe Biden becoming president last year. In his strongest rebuttal yet, he said Mr Trump was wrong to suggest he had had the right to overturn the election. Separately the Republican Party censured two of its top lawmakers for investigating the Capitol riots. A mob stormed the Capitol as lawmakers met to confirm President Joe Biden's poll win on 6 January last year. Four people died during the riots. The two legislators, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, are the only Republicans on a congressional select committee investigating the riots. The statement by the Republican National Committee (RNC) accused the pair of helping to persecute ""ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse"". The RNC appeared to suggest rioters had been involved in legitimate political actions but RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel clarified that it was a reference to ""legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol"". Capitol riot inquiry asks Ivanka Trump to testify US Capitol riot committee targets Rudy Giuliani Five big questions about Trump and the riot The vote was passed by an overwhelming majority of the 168 RNC members at their winter meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, reports say. The committee said it would ""immediately cease any and all support of them"" as party members without removing them from the party. Both lawmakers issued statements in advance of the vote. ""The leaders of the Republican Party have made themselves willing hostages to a man who admits he tried to overturn a presidential election and suggests he would pardon 6 January defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy,"" Ms Cheney said. They also received support from other opponents of Mr Trump in the party.Senator Mitt Romney tweeted,external: ""Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience, who seek truth in the face of vitriol."" Speaking in Orlando, Florida, Mr Pence was responding to Mr Trump's comments on Sunday that he could have overturned the election if he had wanted to. Mr Trump has falsely claimed that the election was stolen by Mr Biden. Days later Mr Trump said the select committee should be investigating Mr Pence instead of the rioters. ""President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people, and the American people alone,"" Mr Pence said. ""And [current Vice-President] Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024."" Last May, House Republicans voted to remove Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her leadership position because, they said, her criticism of Donald Trump prevented the party from focusing on upcoming elections. On Friday, however, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution that will put Mr Trump, the 6 January Capitol riots and shifting Republican attitudes toward both into national headlines again. The committee also did so in a way that will generate storms of criticism, by censuring Ms Cheney and Congressman Adam Kinzinger for, in part, helping Democratic ""persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse"". Republicans say the line - added in a last-minute revision - was meant to reference individuals who protested the election results and not those who attacked the Capitol, but its inartful wording will ensure it is construed to include both. The resolution is just the latest example of the grip Mr Trump holds on the Republican Party apparatus, even if polls indicate that the loyalty of some conservatives may be slipping. The practical purpose behind the committee's move is that it frees the party to shift financial support from Ms Cheney to her Republican primary opponent. The political fireworks were a collateral - if not unintended - effect.

Voters are furious so PM must go - former minister,"Another Conservative MP has called for Boris Johnson to resign as the turmoil at 10 Downing Street continues. Former minister Nick Gibb is the latest Tory to submit a letter of no confidence in the row over events held at No 10 during lockdown. And Tory MP Stephen Hammond said he is ""considering very carefully"" whether he still has confidence in the PM. But Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries insisted the ""vast majority"" of Conservative MPs supported Mr Johnson. Meanwhile,the Daily Mirror reports,externala photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at a birthday gathering has been handed to police investigating Covid breaches. The paper said the picture was one of 300 submitted tothe Metropolitan Police investigation into 12 alleged gatheringsand was thought to have been taken by the PM's official photographer, who is funded by the taxpayer. It said it showed the prime minister holding a can of beer at an event in No 10's Cabinet Room in June 2020, alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was holding a soft drink. At the time, gatherings of more than two people inside werebanned by law. It comes at the end of a difficult week for the PM, which has seenfive No 10 aides resignand the publication of theinitial findings of the Sue Gray reportinto events at Downing Street while Covid restrictions were in place. Tory MP sends letter of no confidence in PM What do key resignations mean for PM? The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Gibb, who has served under three prime ministers and who lost his position as schools minister in Boris Johnson's reshuffle last September, said his constituents were ""furious about the double standards"" and that ""to restore trust, we need to change the prime minister"". He said Covid restrictions imposed by Mr Johnson were ""flagrantly disregarded"" in Downing Street, and the PM was inaccurate when, in December, he told the House of Commons there was no party. ""Some argue that eating a few canapes with a glass of prosecco is hardly a reason to resign. But telling the truth matters, and nowhere more so than in the House of Commons where, like a court of law, truth must be told regardless of the personal consequences,"" he wrote. Stephen Hammond, Conservative MP for Wimbledon, told the BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster programme: ""I think all Conservative colleagues, all of whom I know, are in it for trying to do the best for their constituents, and the country will be wrestling with their consciences this weekend."" Mr Hammond said he had not yet submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister but would be considering his next steps ""very carefully over the weekend"". He added it ""certainly looks like"" the beginning of the end for Tory confidence in the prime minister. Mr Gibb said fellow backbench Tory Aaron Bell had ""struck a chord"" when hecriticised Mr Johnson over lockdown partiesearlier this week. Mr Bell had asked the prime minister if he took him for a fool for following the rules himself - including not hugging his family at his grandmother's funeral, or going for a cup of tea after the service. This video can not be played Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries defends the PM saying he does tell the truth On Friday, Mr Bell said the ""breach of trust"" over the rule breaking and how it had been handled made the PM's position untenable, as he confirmed he had also submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady - the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. At least 54 MPs need to write to Sir Graham to trigger a vote on the PM's leadership of the party. Other Conservative MPs are expected to consider whether to put in their letters over the weekend. Mr Johnson has written to all Tory MPs to say he is committed to improving the way 10 Downing Street works. What does Sue Gray's parties report say? How many parties are police investigating? Fact-checking Boris Johnson's Jimmy Savile claim Ms Dorries told the BBC most MPs were ""right behind the prime minister because he has delivered... and will continue to do so"" and said Mr Johnson had been ""very positive"" when she communicated with him within the past 24 hours. She said a huge amount of change was now under way within No 10, but she was ""cautious"" of asking him to change too much, because of achievements such as having the biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher. Ms Dorries said those speaking out against Mr Johnson were ""the same names"" that ""keep cropping up"" and ""no prime minister would please any of those"". She said there were ""a few voices being amplified"" by the media, describing the comments made by Mr Gibb and Mr Bell as ""disappointing"". This video can not be played Aaron Bell asked the PM on Monday if he considered him a ""fool"". Speaking on Newsnight, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen suggested it was now the job of the cabinet to ""show leadership"" and ""confront"" the issue of the prime minister's leadership. But his fellow Tory MP Richard Bacon suggested it was not for politicians to change governments - that was for the electorate to take care of. And Liam Fox, former trade secretary, said there was a danger the party was becoming distracted from big issues such as inflation, the energy crisis and the situation in Ukraine. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There will need to be closure on this issue, in the Conservative Party and in the country, and I think when there's more to say, we should say it, and there are questions that will need to be answered."" Some of Mr Johnson's supporters, including one former cabinet minister, have criticised the Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who this week distanced himself from the prime minister's controversial comments about Sir Keir Starmer, for being disloyal at a difficult time. No 10 policy chief Munira Mirza quit on Thursday, describing Mr Johnson's comments on Sir Keir as ""scurrilous"". The prime minister falsely claimed the Labour leader had failed to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile during his time as director of public prosecutions. Mr Sunak said he ""wouldn't have said it"", while on Friday Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Sir Keir ""did a good job and should be respected for it"". The government has faced intense pressure over gatherings held in and around Downing Street during Covid lockdowns. A police investigation into several of the events has now concluded, with more than 100 fines having been issued to attendees. Here is what we know about the gatherings and the restrictions in place at the time: 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said ""those people were at work talking about work"".

Trump was wrong to seek to stop Biden win - PenceMike Pence issues his strongest rebuttal of Donald Trump's claim over the 2021 election result.,"This video can not be played Mike Pence says he had ""no right to change the outcome"" of the presidential election Former US Vice-President Mike Pence has dismissed claims by Donald Trump that he could have stopped Joe Biden becoming president last year. In his strongest rebuttal yet, he said Mr Trump was wrong to suggest he had had the right to overturn the election. Separately the Republican Party censured two of its top lawmakers for investigating the Capitol riots. A mob stormed the Capitol as lawmakers met to confirm President Joe Biden's poll win on 6 January last year. Four people died during the riots. The two legislators, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, are the only Republicans on a congressional select committee investigating the riots. The statement by the Republican National Committee (RNC) accused the pair of helping to persecute ""ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse"". The RNC appeared to suggest rioters had been involved in legitimate political actions but RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel clarified that it was a reference to ""legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol"". Capitol riot inquiry asks Ivanka Trump to testify US Capitol riot committee targets Rudy Giuliani Five big questions about Trump and the riot The vote was passed by an overwhelming majority of the 168 RNC members at their winter meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, reports say. The committee said it would ""immediately cease any and all support of them"" as party members without removing them from the party. Both lawmakers issued statements in advance of the vote. ""The leaders of the Republican Party have made themselves willing hostages to a man who admits he tried to overturn a presidential election and suggests he would pardon 6 January defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy,"" Ms Cheney said. They also received support from other opponents of Mr Trump in the party.Senator Mitt Romney tweeted,external: ""Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience, who seek truth in the face of vitriol."" Speaking in Orlando, Florida, Mr Pence was responding to Mr Trump's comments on Sunday that he could have overturned the election if he had wanted to. Mr Trump has falsely claimed that the election was stolen by Mr Biden. Days later Mr Trump said the select committee should be investigating Mr Pence instead of the rioters. ""President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people, and the American people alone,"" Mr Pence said. ""And [current Vice-President] Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024."" Last May, House Republicans voted to remove Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her leadership position because, they said, her criticism of Donald Trump prevented the party from focusing on upcoming elections. On Friday, however, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution that will put Mr Trump, the 6 January Capitol riots and shifting Republican attitudes toward both into national headlines again. The committee also did so in a way that will generate storms of criticism, by censuring Ms Cheney and Congressman Adam Kinzinger for, in part, helping Democratic ""persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse"". Republicans say the line - added in a last-minute revision - was meant to reference individuals who protested the election results and not those who attacked the Capitol, but its inartful wording will ensure it is construed to include both. The resolution is just the latest example of the grip Mr Trump holds on the Republican Party apparatus, even if polls indicate that the loyalty of some conservatives may be slipping. The practical purpose behind the committee's move is that it frees the party to shift financial support from Ms Cheney to her Republican primary opponent. The political fireworks were a collateral - if not unintended - effect.

Executive return 'difficult' if protocol remains,"DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said it will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after an election if issues around the NI Protocol are not addressed. He was speaking after Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday. Ittook effect at midnightand meant Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in also lost her post. Mr Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"". The move by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was part of their opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which places a trade border in the Irish Sea. On Wednesday the DUP's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, ordered officials to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain. However, that directionhas been suspended by the High Court, pending the outcome of legal challenges. ""I have withdrawn the first minister on the basis that the protocol issues have not been addressed despite clear commitments and promises given by the prime minister that they would be addressed,"" Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""If the protocol issues are not resolved by the time of the election, then of course it is difficult for us to form a government, because of the instability that the protocol creates."" Mr Donaldson said that last week Boris Johnson told him the prospect of an agreement being reached with the EU on the protocol within the next few weeks was ""20 to 30%"". Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald (centre) called for an early election on Thursday Sinn FÃ©in have called for an early election. The party's finance minister described the DUP's decision to resign from the post of first minister as ""cynical and reckless"". Conor Murphy reiterated his party president's call for an early election and said the assembly could sit extra days if parties were willing to get legislation through. ""Let's get the parties together, let's get the legislation completed in the next number of weeks however long that takes to sit in the assembly, let's go to the people and ask them their verdict on what the DUP have done,"" he said. ""We can't sit by and pretend it is business as usual and that things are OK, I think we need to give the people their verdict in all of this."" Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis In quotes: Reactions to Paul Givan's resignation Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said ""no one party should have a veto"" over the future of Stormont. ""I believe that decision is very damaging to politics itself, and to people's trust in politics,"" he added. Conor Burns said the DUP should return Paul Givan to the role of first minister Northern Ireland Office (NIO) minister Conor Burns urged the DUP to return Stormont to a stable government. ""We want Sir Jeffrey to reconsider, to put Paul Givan back in and get it stabilised and up and running again,"" he told BBC News NI. ""We'll spend time now thinking about what happens if that doesn't actually come to pass and we'll make those decisions."" Mr Burns said he did not want to speculate about the NIO's next actions but confirmed the Northern Ireland secretary does have the power to call an early election. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon of the SDLP said her party were ""not going to fall into this trap that the DUP have set where we fall into an early election"". ""It's all about creating this toxic, hostile environment where they can terrify people to the polls by telling them their identity is in crisis,"" she said. ""There are real concerns within loyalism and within unionism, we are listening to that, we want to work through it but this is being manipulated by the DUP and it is shameful,"" she added. Alliance assembly member Andrew Muir said his party was up for an election ""at any time"", but said MLAs were there to do a job and ""they should get it done"". Meanwhile, a virtual meeting of several of the NI Executive party leaders has taken place. The politicians discussed how the assembly and the executive might operate after Mr Givan's resignation. There was some confusion earlier if the meeting would take place after the DUP leader was not originally invited by Sinn FÃ©in. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday The UUP and Alliance said the DUP should have been invited. It is understood the party whips at Stormont are to meet to discuss how assembly business can be handled in the days ahead. UUP leader Doug Beattie was invited to the meeting but due to other commitments was unable to attend. However, he called on the secretary of state to say if he intended to call an early election ""because if we know when it's coming, we know how we can deal with the legislation"". ""But right now,we simply don't know what to do."","" he added. As the dust settles after Paul Givan's resignation - the parties and pressure groups lobbying for legislation must now assess what can be rescued in the coming days. The difficulty in holding a cross-party meeting is an example of how difficult it is to chart a way forward. Looking ahead there is also much talk about an early election and there is a clear divide. Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP want one, but the Alliance, the SDLP and the UUP say voters should go to the polls as scheduled in May. Some are now asking if full devolution can be restored after an election. Whilst the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says that depends on what happens to the protocol. There are also questions if a DUP MLA would serve as deputy first minster if Sinn FÃ©in take the first minster's role. Not for the first time the long term future of how we are governed is shrouded in doubt. An election for the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently scheduled for May. Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. Northern Ireland's Assembly continues in shadow form, but the executive - effectively Northern Ireland's government - will no longer meet. Paul Givan's political career Michelle O'Neill profile Ministers in charge of departments will be able to stay in post, but they will be limited in terms of what they can do. Ahead of the midnight deadline on Thursday, the outgoing first and deputy first ministers made a number of appointments, includingnaming Ian Jeffers as Northern Ireland's new victims' commissioner, and keeping in place for another three years Brenda King as Northern Ireland's attorney general. There are questions over key pieces oflegislation requiring executive approval, including a multi-year budget and the lifting of Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he would be seeking legal advice on his powers as health minister Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Alex Maskey, assembly speaker, said the Northern Ireland Act 1998 calls for the first and deputy first minister offices to be filled within seven days, by 12:01 on Friday 11 February. Mr Maskey also said he was aware that legislation due to be completed at Westminster next week may leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdraw DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks.
