Vueling 'most delayed' airline in UK,"Vueling Airlines is the least punctual major airline flying from airports in the UK, new research shows. The Spanish carrier's UK departures were delayed by an average of 31 minutes last year, according to analysis of Civil Aviation Authority data by the PA news agency. Thomas Cook also performed poorly, with average delays of 24 minutes, followed by Wizz Air on 23 minutes. Vueling said it had been ""hugely affected"" by strikes in France. The research, which covered more than 40 airlines flying from UK airports, found the average delay across all flights was 16 minutes. EasyJet 'misled' customers during Gatwick shutdown Flights delayed due to airport fire alarm Other poor performers included Norwegian Air UK, a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, and Eurowings, both of which had average delays of 22 minutes. Cathay Pacific Airways was the most punctual carrier, although its flights still typically took off eight minutes behind schedule. Airline passengers faced chaos last summer as French air traffic controllers staged a series of strikes. Vueling, which serves UK airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Edinburgh, said its flights in and out of Barcelona had been hit by action in Marseille. This video can not be played Flight delay compensation: When can you claim? ""During these strikes, Vueling flights to and from Barcelona and the UK could not fly straight across France but instead flew south of the Pyrenees and into the Atlantic, before looping back towards Britain,"" a spokesman said. ""The location of Vueling's [Barcelona] hub close to Marseille means it has been particularly badly affected."" The carrier, which is owned by International Airlines Group - which also owns British Airways - also saw its own pilots walk out in May, leading to hundreds of cancellations. Under EU rules, airline passengers are only entitled to compensation if they arrive at their destination more than three hours late. However, consumer magazine Which? said flight delays could leave holidaymakers ""hundreds of pounds out of pocket because of missed connections, transfers and fines for picking up their hire car late"". Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, which represents UK-registered carriers, said too many flights are affected by the country's ""antiquated airspace"". He added: ""We support government in its efforts to introduce much-needed modernisation so we can continue to safely and effectively accommodate the ever rising demand for air travel.""

Galileo sat-nav system hit by service outage,"Europe's satellite-navigation system, Galileo, remains offline. The network suffered an outage on Friday due to what has been described as a ""technical incident related to its ground infrastructure"". Engineers worked around the clock over the weekend but there is no update yet on when the service will resume. The problem means all receivers, such as the latest smartphone models, will not be picking up any useable timing or positional information. These devices will be relying instead on the data coming from the American Global Positioning System (GPS). And depending on the sat-nav chip they have installed, cell phones and other devices might also be making connections with the Russian (Glonass) and Chinese (Beidou) networks. Galileo is still in a roll-out, or pilot phase, meaning it would not yet be expected to lead critical applications. ""People should remember that we are still in the 'initial services' phase; we're not in full operation yet,"" a spokesperson for the European GNSS Agency (GSA) told BBC News. ""This is something that can happen while we build the robustness into the system. We have recovery and monitoring actions, and we are implementing them, and we are working 24/7 to fix this as soon as possible."" Money released for 'UK sat-nav' study EC seeks to boost space spending QE Engineering Prize lauds GPS pioneers The GSA issued a notification on Thursday warning users that Galileo's signals might become unreliable. An update was then sent out at 01:50 Central European Time on Friday to say that the service was out of use until further notice. The search and rescue function on Galileo satellites that picks up the distress beacon messages from those at sea or up high mountains is said to be unaffected by the outage. A project of the European Commission and the European Space Agency 24 satellites constitute a full system but it will also have spares in orbit 24 spacecraft are in orbit today; two more will launch next year Original budget was â¬3bn but will now cost more than three times that Works alongside the US GPS, Chinese Beidou and Russian Glonass systems Promises eventual real-time positioning down to a metre or less Galileo is a multi-billion-euro project of the European Union and the European Space Agency. The EU owns the system, and Esa acts as the technical and procurement agent. There are currently 22 operational satellites in orbit (another two are in space but in testing), with a further 12 under construction with industry. In addition to the spacecraft, Galileo relies on a complex ground infrastructure to control the network and monitor its performance. Europe's alternative to GPS went ""live"" with initial services in December 2016 after 17 years of development. The European Commission promotes Galileo as more than just a back-up service; it is touted also as being more accurate and more robust. An outage across the entire network is therefore a matter of significant concern and no little embarrassment. Since its launch in 1978, GPS has become integral to the functioning of all modern economies. Usage goes far beyond just finding one's way through an unfamiliar city. The system's timing function has now become ubiquitous in many fields, including in the synchronisation of global financial transactions, telecommunications and energy networks.

Brexit campaigner threatens no deal court battle,"Businesswoman Gina Miller brought the Brexit legal case Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller says she will take the government to court if the next PM tries to shut down Parliament to push through no deal. Ms Miller,who won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50,said the step would be ""an abuse"" of powers. She told Sky News she wanted to ""defend Parliamentary sovereignty"", not stop Brexit. Brexiteer MP Priti Patel said it was ""not acceptable"" to use the courts to try to tie the hands of MPs. Most MPs are against leaving the EU without a deal and could try to stop it from happening. Shutting down - or proroguing - Parliament could potentially provide a way for a prime minister to force through a no-deal Brexit against MPs' wishes. With Parliament not sitting, MPs would not be able to block it - for example, by holding a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. What is proroguing? No deal - what you need to know Who is Gina Miller? Boris Johnson, Conservative leadership candidate and favourite to win the race to be prime minister, has vowed to leave the EU by the current deadline of 31 October with or without a deal. He has refused to rule out proroguing Parliament in order to achieve that - his rival, Jeremy Hunt, has insisted he would not take that step. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, immediately exiting the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to facilitate trade. Opponents of no deal say it would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but politicians in favour of no deal insist disruption could be quickly overcome. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major told the BBCthis week he would seek a judicial review in the courts if the new prime minister tried to suspend Parliament, describing such a move as ""utterly and totally unacceptable"". Now Ms Miller and her legal team have sent a letter to Mr Johnson warning him about their plans for legal action too. How ready is the UK for no deal? Tory leadership - compare the candidates She told Sky: ""I have never been a fan of Brexitâ¦ but that is completely separate, completely different, from defending the central pillar of our constitution."" She said it would be an abuse of power for a PM ""through desperation"" to ""try to limit the voice of the MPs we all elect"". ""We think that it's beyond the prime minister's powers because parliamentary sovereignty is actually the jewel in the constitutional crown."" Ms Patel, a supporter of Mr Johnson, told Sky: ""I'm not surprised [at Ms Miller's remarks] because there seems to be a relentless movement to delay Brexit, to stop Brexit happeningâ¦ to question the integrity of a future government in its renewed determination to exit the European Union"". She said the process of leaving must be ""down to Parliament, not third parties going through the courts"". Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has previously warned strongly against no deal, but told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday she accepted ""we now need to allow no deal to be part of the leverage to make sure that people compromise more"". ""I would hope that the EU will compromise and that [Tory Brexiteer group] the ERG will compromise too,"" she said. Ms Rudd - who backs Mr Hunt for the leadership - said she was still concerned about the economic impact of no deal, but added: ""I am no longer saying that I will lie down in front of the bulldozers if it arrives."" By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The process of judicial review is a tried and trusted legal procedure which helps hold policy-makers to account, but it can last a long time - usually months. In judicial review cases, it's not the court's job to rule on whether the decision made by the public organisation is correct or not. Instead, it is concerned about the way in which the decision or action has been taken: have the right procedures been followed? Has the public body exceeded its powers? And is that decision or action ""irrational"" - in other words, so unreasonable that no sensible person could have arrived at it? Only the Queen can decide to suspend Parliament, but it's highly unlikely there would be a legal challenge against any decision Her Majesty made. Instead, any judicial review would probably revolve around the legality of the advice to suspend Parliament offered to the Queen by the new prime minister. Read more. Meanwhile,Chancellor Philip Hammond has warnedthe UK will not be able to control key elements of a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Panorama the EU would control many of the ""levers"" - including what happens to the flow of goods through the port of Calais in France. ""The French can dial that up or dial it down, just the same as the Spanish for years have dialled up or dialled down the length of the queues at the border going into Gibraltar,"" he said. The Treasury has spent Â£4.2bn on Brexit preparations, but Mr Hammond has warned that, even with careful planning, a no-deal exit could cost the country up to Â£90bn. French officials have previouslyrejected suggestions they could resort to a ""go-slow"" policyat Calais if there is no Brexit deal - insisting that closing the port would be ""economic suicide"".

Trump under fire over racially-charged tweets,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) US President Donald Trump has been accused of racism after posting tweets attacking Democratic congresswomen. He claimed the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"", before suggesting they ""go back"". The tweet was directed at a group of four congresswomen of colour; three were born and raised in the US while the fourth moved to the US as a child. Republican Party representatives kept quiet amid a wave of criticism. The congresswomen - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar, who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - have all called the president racist, and have been backed by members of the Democratic Party. Ms Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York, approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May said President Trump's remarks were ""completely unacceptable"". In a three-tweet thread, Mr Trumpaccused the congresswomen of ""viciously"" criticising him and the US,external. The president did not explicitly name the women he was talking about, but the context - and references to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - made a clear link. He said Ms Pelosi would happily organise for them to leave the country. A week ago, Ms Pelosi clashed with the four women - sometimes nicknamed ""the squad"" - but she has since come to their defence following his tweets. The president wrote: ""So interesting to see 'progressive' Democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Trump scrapped Iran deal 'to spite Obama' The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Trump retreats on census citizenship question ""Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. ""These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"" President Trump has been accused of racism and white nationalism There have been internal feuds among Democrats over a border funding package, with Ms Pelosi arguing in favour of the package, and the four women - all newcomers to Congress with a progressive agenda - voting against. Last week, Ms Ocasio-Cortez accused Ms Pelosi of singling out women of colour for criticism. Ms Pelosi quoted Mr Trump's tweets and described them as ""xenophobic"". ""When @realDonaldTrump tells four American congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power,"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump has tweeted since, further criticising ""people who speak so badly of our country"". Mr Trump did not specifically mention a link to recent news events, but immigration at the southern border was a dominant topic in US news at the weekend. On Friday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Tlaib and Ms Pressley testified to a House committee about conditions in a migrant detention centre they had visited. They expressed horror about alleged mistreatment happening ""under American flags"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez said migrants told her they had drunk water from toilets because sinks were broken. This video can not be played Ocasio-Cortez on detained migrants: 'The women were told to drink out of a toilet bowl' Vice-President Mike Pence also toured a facility on Friday. He said everyone was being ""well cared for"". The president tweeted that children's detention centres had had ""great reviews"" and the adult male areas were ""loaded up with a big percentage of criminals"". Mr Trump has been accused of racism many times in connection with different incidents. For years, he made false claims thatformer President Barack Obama was not born in the US- propagating the racist ""birther"" conspiracy. He has also made numerous slurs against Central American migrants, calling them criminals and rapists. In 2018, he faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans after reports said that during a meeting at the White House he called African nations ""shitholes"". When white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulting in the death of 32-year-old counter protester Heather Heyer, the president said there were ""good people on both sides"". Mr Trump and his father Fred Trump were sued by the Department of Justice in 1973 for discrimination against African Americans in their renting practices. They settled the case without admitting guilt in 1975 but were accused again by the justice department in 1978 of an ""underlying pattern of discrimination"" against black tenants.

Brexit campaigner threatens no deal court battleGina Miller says she will take legal action if the next prime minister tries to shut down Parliament.,"Businesswoman Gina Miller brought the Brexit legal case Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller says she will take the government to court if the next PM tries to shut down Parliament to push through no deal. Ms Miller,who won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50,said the step would be ""an abuse"" of powers. She told Sky News she wanted to ""defend Parliamentary sovereignty"", not stop Brexit. Brexiteer MP Priti Patel said it was ""not acceptable"" to use the courts to try to tie the hands of MPs. Most MPs are against leaving the EU without a deal and could try to stop it from happening. Shutting down - or proroguing - Parliament could potentially provide a way for a prime minister to force through a no-deal Brexit against MPs' wishes. With Parliament not sitting, MPs would not be able to block it - for example, by holding a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. What is proroguing? No deal - what you need to know Who is Gina Miller? Boris Johnson, Conservative leadership candidate and favourite to win the race to be prime minister, has vowed to leave the EU by the current deadline of 31 October with or without a deal. He has refused to rule out proroguing Parliament in order to achieve that - his rival, Jeremy Hunt, has insisted he would not take that step. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, immediately exiting the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to facilitate trade. Opponents of no deal say it would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but politicians in favour of no deal insist disruption could be quickly overcome. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major told the BBCthis week he would seek a judicial review in the courts if the new prime minister tried to suspend Parliament, describing such a move as ""utterly and totally unacceptable"". Now Ms Miller and her legal team have sent a letter to Mr Johnson warning him about their plans for legal action too. How ready is the UK for no deal? Tory leadership - compare the candidates She told Sky: ""I have never been a fan of Brexitâ¦ but that is completely separate, completely different, from defending the central pillar of our constitution."" She said it would be an abuse of power for a PM ""through desperation"" to ""try to limit the voice of the MPs we all elect"". ""We think that it's beyond the prime minister's powers because parliamentary sovereignty is actually the jewel in the constitutional crown."" Ms Patel, a supporter of Mr Johnson, told Sky: ""I'm not surprised [at Ms Miller's remarks] because there seems to be a relentless movement to delay Brexit, to stop Brexit happeningâ¦ to question the integrity of a future government in its renewed determination to exit the European Union"". She said the process of leaving must be ""down to Parliament, not third parties going through the courts"". Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has previously warned strongly against no deal, but told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday she accepted ""we now need to allow no deal to be part of the leverage to make sure that people compromise more"". ""I would hope that the EU will compromise and that [Tory Brexiteer group] the ERG will compromise too,"" she said. Ms Rudd - who backs Mr Hunt for the leadership - said she was still concerned about the economic impact of no deal, but added: ""I am no longer saying that I will lie down in front of the bulldozers if it arrives."" By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The process of judicial review is a tried and trusted legal procedure which helps hold policy-makers to account, but it can last a long time - usually months. In judicial review cases, it's not the court's job to rule on whether the decision made by the public organisation is correct or not. Instead, it is concerned about the way in which the decision or action has been taken: have the right procedures been followed? Has the public body exceeded its powers? And is that decision or action ""irrational"" - in other words, so unreasonable that no sensible person could have arrived at it? Only the Queen can decide to suspend Parliament, but it's highly unlikely there would be a legal challenge against any decision Her Majesty made. Instead, any judicial review would probably revolve around the legality of the advice to suspend Parliament offered to the Queen by the new prime minister. Read more. Meanwhile,Chancellor Philip Hammond has warnedthe UK will not be able to control key elements of a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Panorama the EU would control many of the ""levers"" - including what happens to the flow of goods through the port of Calais in France. ""The French can dial that up or dial it down, just the same as the Spanish for years have dialled up or dialled down the length of the queues at the border going into Gibraltar,"" he said. The Treasury has spent Â£4.2bn on Brexit preparations, but Mr Hammond has warned that, even with careful planning, a no-deal exit could cost the country up to Â£90bn. French officials have previouslyrejected suggestions they could resort to a ""go-slow"" policyat Calais if there is no Brexit deal - insisting that closing the port would be ""economic suicide"".

US says Iran breaches 'extortion',"This video can not be played Iran's representative to the UN: Europeans ""are not honouring their commitments"" on nuclear deal The US has accused Iran of a ""crude and transparent attempt to extort payments from the international community"" by violating the 2015 nuclear deal. The US ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency said there was no credible reason for Iran to breach two key commitments on uranium enrichment. Iran has said the steps were a response to the sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal last year. It has vowed to reverse them if it is given compensation for economic losses. European powers still party to the deal have set up a mechanism for facilitating legitimate trade without direct financial transactions that they hope will circumvent the US sanctions. However, Iran has said it does not meet its needs. Iran's representative to the UN in New York told the BBC that the Europeans could do more, and that if they did not Iran would take further steps. Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead? Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words ""If nothing happens in the next 60 days we will have to go to the third phase. The elements of the third phase are not known yet, but when it comes to that we will announce what we are going to do,"" Majid Takht-Ravanchi warned. Iran's president told a French envoy ""the path of diplomacy and talks"" was ""completely open"" At Wednesday's special meeting of the IAEA board of governors in Vienna, diplomats were reportedly told that the global watchdog's inspectors had verified Iran was enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration - above the 3.67% limit set by the nuclear deal. The country announced the step three days ago, saying it wanted to be able to produce fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The IAEA was also said to have verified that Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium had grown since the 300kg (660lb) limit was exceeded on 1 July. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Experts have said the breach of the stockpile limit does not pose a near-term proliferation risk, but that enriching uranium to a higher concentration would begin to shorten Iran's so-called ""break-out time"" - the time required for it to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. Iran insists it has never sought to develop a nuclear weapon. But the international community does not believe Iran, and negotiated a nuclear deal to prevent it from doing so. US President Donald Trump said the deal did not go far enough to restrict Iran's nuclear programme and unilaterally withdrew from the accord in May 2018. He wants to replace it with one that would also curb Iran's ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. But Iran has so far refused. US ambassador Jackie Wolcott said it was imperative that Iran's ""misbehaviour"" not be rewarded At the IAEA meeting,US ambassador Jackie Wolcott said Iran's recent actions and statements were deeply concerning,external, and affected security and stability. ""Iran's current nuclear posture is clearly aimed at escalating tensions rather than defusing them, and underscores the serious challenges Iran continues to pose to international peace and security,"" she said. ""Such brinkmanship and extortion tactics will neither resolve the current impasse nor bring Iran sanctions relief. The path the regime is now on will only deepen its international isolation and raise the dangers it faces."" Ms Wolcott said it was imperative that Iran's ""misbehaviour"" not be rewarded. ""For if it is, Iran's demands and provocations will only escalate - as has happened all too often in the past,"" she warned. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump did not give any further details. But the IAEA had repeatedly verified Iran's compliance with the deal until this month and Iran's ambassador to the agency, Kazim Gharib Abadi, said it had ""nothing to hide."" Meanwhile, the top diplomatic adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron held talks in Tehran with Iranian officials to try to avoid further escalation.

Police criticised over leak warning,"UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch (l) called President Trump's administration ""inept"" in leaked emails Scotland Yard has been criticised for warning media organisations against publishing leaked government documents. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu advised editors it ""could be a criminal matter"". His comments came as a criminal investigation was launched into the leak of diplomatic emails from the UK ambassador in the US, Sir Kim Darroch. Evening Standard editor George Osborne described Mr Basu's statement as ""stupid"" and ""ill-advised"". The investigation was launched by the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command, which takes national responsibility for investigating allegations of criminal breaches of the Official Secrets Act. ""The publication of leaked communications, knowing the damage they have caused or are likely to cause, may also be a criminal matter,""said Mr Basu.,external He added: ""I would advise all owners, editors and publishers of social and mainstream media not to publish leaked government documents that may already be in their possession, or which may be offered to them, and to turn them over to the police or give them back to their rightful owner, Her Majesty's Government."" Police launch probe of ambassador emails 'leak' Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? 'No evidence' Sir Kim Darroch email was a hack Mr Osborne, the former chancellor,tweeted,externalthat to maintain credibility the Met Commissioner, Cressida Dick, should distance herself from ""this very stupid and ill-advised statement from a junior officer who doesn't appear to understand much about press freedom"". Other newspaper editors and MPs were also critical of Mr Basu's statement. Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman asked if Ms Dick had cleared the ""sinister, absurd, anti-democratic statement... threatening journalists with arrest for printing government leaks?"" He added, onTwitter:,external""Do you have any comprehension of a free society? This isn't Russia."" Peter Spiegel, Financial Times US managing editor,wrote:,external""Well, this is rather chilling from a major police force in a western democracy. What are you going to do, Met Police, arrest us?"" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he defended ""to the hilt"" the right of the press to publish leaks if they ""judge them to be in the public interest"". Allow Twitter content?

His Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson said it was correct the person responsible for the leak was ""hunted down and prosecuted"" but it was wrong for police to target the media. He said: ""A prosecution on this basis would amount to an infringement on press freedom and have a chilling effect on public debate."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said freedom of the press was ""vital"" and it was right there were ""considerable protections"" in place for journalists to reveal information. MP Tom Tugenhadt, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""a reasonable request"" to ask the media not to publish leaked documents which undermine security, but he ""doubted"" whether it was a crime. However, former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the leak was a clear breach of the Official Secrets Act and the police were entitled to try to prevent further disclosures. ""If they [the press] are receiving stolen material they should give it back to their rightful owner,"" he told the Today programme. ""They should also be aware of the huge damage that has already been done, and the potentially even greater damage to be done by further breaches ofthe Official Secrets Act."" Journalists are not above the law, but it is understood ""in a free, liberal and democratic society"" that the media ""should be free to report on leaked documents that they believe are in the public interest"", says Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors. Mr Murray maintains it is unlikely police are going to ""shoot the messenger"", adding that to hold authority to account journalists can't be allowed to be bullied into handing over documents. Who decides what is in the public interest, however, can be contentious. ""It's a difficult line to tread between what's in the public interest and what interests the public,"" Mr Murray says. However, he adds that the idea that one particular body would make that decision - or no-one would have to decide because journalists have ""dutifully"" handed in documents to the police is ""appalling"". The government has already opened an internal inquiry into the publication of the memos, which were critical of the Trump administration - and prompted a furious reaction from the US president, who said he would no longer deal with Sir Kim. President Trump branded him ""a very stupid guy""after confidential emails emerged where the ambassador had called his administration ""clumsy and inept"". Sir Kim stepped down as ambassador on Wednesday, saying it was ""impossible"" for him to continue.

According to some Whitehall sources, Sir Kim decided to resign after Mr Johnson failed to fully support him during a TV debate on Tuesday night.

UK ambassador to US resigns,"This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Sir Kim Darroch has resigned as UK ambassador to the US, as a row over leaked emails critical of President Trump's administration escalates. Theresa May said Sir Kim's departure was ""a matter of deep regret"" after the ambassador said it was ""impossible"" for him to continue. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson has faced strong criticism for failing to fully support him. President Trump said on Monday that the US would not deal with Sir Kim. The US president had branded him""a very stupid guy""after confidential emails emerged where the ambassador had called his administration ""clumsy and inept"". In a letter to the Foreign Office, Sir Kim said he wanted to end speculation about his position: ""The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like."" Five things we learned from the UK ambassador spat Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full His resignation has prompted widespread support for Sir Kim as well as criticism of Tory frontrunner Boris Johnson. According to some Whitehall sources, Sir Kim decided to resign after Mr Johnson refused to support him during the Tory leadership debate on Tuesday night, said BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. Mr Johnson was asked repeatedly by fellow leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt whether he would keep Sir Kim in post if he became prime minister, but refused to answer. It is understood Mr Johnson spoke to Sir Kim on the phone on Wednesday afternoon. Sources close to Mr Johnson said that he praised Sir Kim's dedication and hard work and claimed the conversation was warm and cordial. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Following Sir Kim's resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""a superb diplomat"" and whoever was responsible for the leak ""has done a grave disservice to our civil servants"". Asked why he was not more supportive of Sir Kim, he said it was ""wrong to drag civil servants into the political arena"". Europe Minister Sir Alan Duncan - who backs Mr Hunt in the leadership contest - said it was ""contemptible negligence"" of Mr Johnson not to support Sir Kim. ""He's basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under a bus to serve his own personal interests,"" he said. However, Sir Michael Fallon - a supporter of Mr Johnson - told BBC Newsnight Sir Kim's position became untenable ""long before the debate on Tuesday night"" and he understands the ambassador did not watch it. The backlash against Mr Johnson was ""a shabby attempt to politicise"" the affair and the leadership contender had ""made it clear he supports all our diplomats"", he said. This video can not be played Sir Alan Duncan says Boris Johnson has ""thrown our top diplomat under a bus"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said,externalMr Johnson wanted a ""sweetheart trade deal"" with the US and his lack of support for Sir Kim ""shows he won't stand up to Donald Trump"". Tory MP and chairman of the Commons' foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhatsaid in a tweet,external: ""Leaders stand up for their men. They encourage them to try and defend them when they fail."" Fellow Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt told the BBC Sir Kim was ""doing his job"" and his resignation was ""a black day for British diplomacy"". Mrs May said Sir Kim had had the full backing of the cabinet and he was owed an ""enormous debt of gratitude"" for his ""lifetime of service"" to the UK. Public servants should be able to give ""full and frank advice"", she added. by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent So was it Boris Johnson what done it? Was the failure of the former foreign secretary to defend Sir Kim in last night's Tory leadership debate the crucial factor in the ambassador's decision to resign? Without Sir Kim speaking publicly on the subject, we are reliant on others to speak for him. And certainly, according to well-placed sources in Whitehall, Mr Johnson's decision to avoid criticising President Trump and his lack of support for Sir Kim was said to be the straw that broke the camel's back. If you are an embattled diplomat under fire from your host country, you need cover from London. And if that is lacking from the man tipped to be your next boss, you realise the writing is on the wall. Certainly, there is genuine anger across Westminster and Whitehall at Mr Johnson's refusal six times last night to come to the aid of our man in Washington. Mr Johnson's supporters have offered varying counter theories. Some have accused Mr Hunt's supporters of politicising the resignation. Others have insisted that the decision had been made before the debate, once Mr Trump declared he would no longer deal with Sir Kim. Realising they were on the receiving end of potentially damaging criticism, Mr Johnson's aides also let it be known that he called Sir Kim this afternoon and praised his dedication and hard work. The problem is that few in Westminster were giving much credence to these defences. In the House of Commons, Theresa May pointedly urged MPs to ""reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure"". It was not hard to decipher what she was talking about. Head of the diplomatic service Sir Simon McDonald said it was the first time in his career that a head of state had refused to work with a British ambassador. He described the leak as ""malicious"" and told Sir Kim: ""You are the best of us."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - a supporter of President Trump - said Sir Kim had done ""an outstanding job"" as ambassador and his resignation was ""a chilling moment"". ""Ambassadors need to be able to talk to their governments without fear of being compromised,"" he said. Mr Johnson pictured with Sir Kim in 2017 while he was in Washington DC as foreign secretary In a letter to Sir Kim, Cabinet Secretary and civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill said that while he understood his reasons for resigning it was ""a matter of enormous regret that you were put in this position after a shocking betrayal of trust"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said he was ""enraged"" by the situation and morale in the senior ranks of the civil service had taken ""a very heavy blow"". Former head of the civil service Lord O'Donnell told the BBC Sir Kim's successor could be chosen within two weeks - while Mrs May is still prime minister. President Trump could well wake up this morning thinking he has the power to veto who the UK has as its ambassador. It wasn't his more colourful remarks on Twitter that really ended Sir Kim's time, but Mr Trump's public announcement that he would no longer work with him. The effects of that were felt immediately. There was a banquet that Sir Kim was immediately dis-invited from. Next, he couldn't attend an event with minister Liam Fox. It was clear he was being frozen out and for an ambassador access is everything. Without it, it's impossible to do the job. More broadly, it's like this... There's never been parity in the special relationship between the UK and US - it's never been a relationship of equals but right now it seems particularly lopsided. The US knows that Britain is fairly isolated right now internationally and needs the US more than ever. Donald Trump has wielded that power mercilessly in this row. In theemails leaked to the Mail on Sunday,external, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true. The government has opened an internal inquiry into the publication of the memos and police have beenurged to open a criminal investigation. Downing Street confirmed there had been some ""initial discussions"" with police regarding the leak and if there was concern about criminal activity they would become involved ""more formally"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said it was ""deeply worrying"" diplomatic cables had ended up in the public domain.

NHS to have legal duty to prevent knife crime,"NHS trusts, local councils and police forces are to have a legal duty to help prevent and tackle serious violence, including knife crime. Under plans being announced by the home secretary, public bodies in England and Wales will have to share data, intelligence and knowledge. The public health approach will aim to promote early, targeted intervention. The duty will apply to organisations - not individual workers - followingconcerns by teachers' unionsin April. The government insists the new rules will not mean ""burdening"" organisations. The new duty will mean certain organisations will have to plan and collaborate to prevent and tackle serious crime. The faces of the first 100 knife crime victims of 2019 The violent terms people are searching for online Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Similar public health approaches have been used in Scotland and Wales. New guidance will be published to help explain how different organisations and sectors, such as youth offending services, can partner with each other. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""It's crucial that we all work together to understand what causes violent crime in the first place, so we can intervene early and prevent this senseless bloodshed. ""I'm confident that a public health approach and a new legal requirement that make public agencies work together will create real, lasting long-term change."" According to official figures released last month, the number of criminals caught with knives or dangerous weapons is at its highest level since 2010. The government says it will ensure that organisations comply with the new duty through inspections or other existing mechanisms. Potential penalties will be detailed when the legislation is introduced later. How did my sleepy hometown become a violent crime hotspot? How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We all have a role to play to tackle serious violence and stop the needless loss of young lives. ""Alongside tough law enforcement we also have to stop children being drawn into crime in the first place."" Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing director for England, said the new plan ""sounds like a sensible approach"" and added she was glad Mr Javid ""listened"" to their worries about the consequences of individual nurses being held legally responsible. The new plan is not without controversy. When the idea was first floated in April, teachers and nurses responded with both dismay and scepticism. They worried they don't have the expertise of the police to know what to do - and it's just another layer of legal bureaucracy when they spend a great deal of their professional lives worrying about how to keep people safe. The final proposals to be unveiled this week have been amended so that institutions such as schools - rather than individual professionals - will be monitored instead. It's not yet clear how a system of inspections of institutions likes schools would work - and what the legal sanction would be if they were found to be coming up short. And, perhaps more importantly, with the latest Brexit deadline looming in the autumn - and a new prime minister to be appointed before then - we don't even know for sure that these plans can even become reality.

'Federer must step up to beat Djokovic',"Wimbledon men's final on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:14 JulyTime:14:00 BST Coverage:Live on BBC One from 12:45 and Radio 5 Live Sports Extra from 13:00 plus live text on the BBC Sport website and mobile app.Full details Roger Federer must ""take it up a level"" to beat Novak Djokovic and claim a record-equalling ninth Wimbledon singles title, says three-time champion John McEnroe. Swiss Federer, 37, produced a stellar performance to beat long-time rival Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals. Serbia's defending champion and world number one Djokovic, 32, is seen as the favourite by many to win a fifth title. ""Djokovic is a human backboard,"" American great McEnroe said. ""It is going to be a tough task."" Top seed Djokovic, 32, has won three of the past four Grand Slams, while Federer's most recent major triumph came at the 2018 Australian Open. Federer, the second seed, has won Wimbledon more times than any other man and will equal Martina Navratilova's all-time record with a ninth triumph. It is the first Wimbledon final between the top two men's seeds since Djokovic and Federer met in 2015. The pair are meeting for the 48th time in their illustrious careers - only Djokovic and Nadal have played more often. Djokovic and Federer have looked on top of their grass-court games on their way to the final. Djokovic has dropped only two sets, although he has not faced an opponent seeded in the top 20. Up until his three-hour battle against Nadal, Federer had only dropped sets against Japan's eighth seed Kei Nishikori and, more surprisingly, South African debutant Lloyd Harris in the opening round. Djokovic on Federer: ""We all know how good he is anywhere, but especially here. This surface complements his game very much. ""He loves to play very fast. He takes away the time from his opponent. ""He just rushes you to everything. So for players maybe like Nadal or myself that like to have a little more time, it's a constant pressure that you have to deal with. ""I've played with Roger in some epic finals here a couple years in a row, so I know what to expect."" Djokovic beat Federer when they met in the 2015 Wimbledon final Federer on Djokovic: ""If I think of Novak, one thing that jumps out at me is his jump back and to the left. ""It's how he's able to defend on that side, which I think has won him numerous matches and trophies. ""He does that better than anybody. Nobody else really has it as consistent and good as he has."" Djokovic's semi-final win over Roberto Bautista Agut ensured it would be a Wimbledon final between two of the 'big three' in the men's game for the first time since 2015. Federer has won 20 Grand Slam titles - a record for a male player, Djokovic 15 and Nadal 18. A fifth Wimbledon triumph for Djokovic, who won the 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2018 titles, would take him closer than he has ever been to Federer's tally. Almost six years younger than Federer, Djokovic could add plenty more barring a loss of form or fitness. His pursuit of Federer and Nadal is made more remarkable by the fact he won his first major in 2008 - when Federer had claimed 13 and Nadal five - and only added a second three years later. Federer, widely considered the greatest grass-court player to have graced Wimbledon, had the backing of the majority of the 15,000 crowd in his semi-final win over Nadal. Djokovic has struggled to earn the same level of popularity as Federer and Nadal throughout his career and appeared to get tetchy when Centre Court supported Bautista Agut. He threw his hands into the air when they cheered Bautista Agut winning the second set, then put his fingers to his lips and cupped his ear after winning a 45-shot rally on a break point. ""Regardless of who's across the net or what is happening around, I'll definitely give it my all,"" Djokovic said. ""It won't be the first time playing against Nadal nor Federer on the Centre Court. I've had that experience more than once. I know what to expect. ""I had enough support here over the years, so I don't complain."" John McEnroe, seven-time Grand Slam champion What I really respect about Novak Djokovic is that he inspires himself [by geeing up the crowd] and plays better. That's what really matters. He is one of the all-time great movers on a tennis court. He gets to a lot more balls than people expect. He makes you hit so many extra shots and it drives you nuts. As for Roger, can you imagine five or six years ago that he would be trading forehands with Rafa Nadal at his age? It's unthinkable. Can Federer do it? Of course he can. But I see Novak winning in four sets. Tim Henman, former British number one and four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Federer has got to play even better but the crowd will have a big part to play. The crowd will be massively on his side. Federer has to get off to a good start but Djokovic is the favourite. Djokovic will stay as world number one regardless of Sunday's outcome, while Federer will rise to second in the rankings if he wins. It will be the 48th meeting between the number one and two seeds in a Grand Slam men's singles final in the Open era, with the top seed prevailing 24 times. It will be the 15th meeting between the number one and two seeds at Wimbledon, wit the top seed prevailing eight times. Federer is bidding to become the second player to beat Djokovic and Nadal in the same Grand Slam, following in the footsteps of Swiss Stan Wawrinka at the 2014 Australian Open At 37 years 340 days, Federer is bidding to become the oldest player in the Open era to win a Grand Slam men's singles title Wimbledon ATP WTA LTA Is Potter the right fit for West Ham?

Electricity restored after New York power cut,"This video can not be played Some of New York's subway stations were plunged into darkness Power has now been restored to all customers after a power failure in New York halted subway trains and trapped people in lifts on Saturday evening. Energy company Con Edison said more than 70,000 homes and businesses lost power in Manhattan, the most densely populated of the city's five boroughs. The outage lasted for about five hours. It came on the anniversary of a massive power failure in 1977 that plunged the New York skyline into darkness and triggered widespread looting and arson. Shortly before midnight (04:00 GMT Sunday)  Con Edison head John MacAvoy said all six networks which had been affected were now up and running. He said the problem appeared to have originated at a substation, but the cause was being investigated. The widespread power cut extended from Fifth Avenue west to the Hudson River, and from West 42nd north to 72nd Street, the fire department said. The blackout brought traffic to a standstill in parts of New York It put street lights and traffic lights out of action and forced the evacuation of buildings across the borough. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the New York Police Department had confirmed there was no foul play.""This was a mechanical issue,"",externalhe wrote on Twitter. Alex Hammerli, 26, was on his way to a bar when the blackout began. ""No subway for 45 blocks and half the trains not running. It's kind of annoying. I'm also surprised that people aren't unleashing their crazy [side] yet. The cops are just trying to shut down the roads,"" he told the BBC. Allow Twitter content?

Brexit campaigner threatens no deal court battleGina Miller says she will take legal action if the next prime minister tries to shut down Parliament.UK PoliticsStep into the shoes of a migrant to America,"Businesswoman Gina Miller brought the Brexit legal case Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller says she will take the government to court if the next PM tries to shut down Parliament to push through no deal. Ms Miller,who won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50,said the step would be ""an abuse"" of powers. She told Sky News she wanted to ""defend Parliamentary sovereignty"", not stop Brexit. Brexiteer MP Priti Patel said it was ""not acceptable"" to use the courts to try to tie the hands of MPs. Most MPs are against leaving the EU without a deal and could try to stop it from happening. Shutting down - or proroguing - Parliament could potentially provide a way for a prime minister to force through a no-deal Brexit against MPs' wishes. With Parliament not sitting, MPs would not be able to block it - for example, by holding a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. What is proroguing? No deal - what you need to know Who is Gina Miller? Boris Johnson, Conservative leadership candidate and favourite to win the race to be prime minister, has vowed to leave the EU by the current deadline of 31 October with or without a deal. He has refused to rule out proroguing Parliament in order to achieve that - his rival, Jeremy Hunt, has insisted he would not take that step. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, immediately exiting the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to facilitate trade. Opponents of no deal say it would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but politicians in favour of no deal insist disruption could be quickly overcome. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major told the BBCthis week he would seek a judicial review in the courts if the new prime minister tried to suspend Parliament, describing such a move as ""utterly and totally unacceptable"". Now Ms Miller and her legal team have sent a letter to Mr Johnson warning him about their plans for legal action too. How ready is the UK for no deal? Tory leadership - compare the candidates She told Sky: ""I have never been a fan of Brexitâ¦ but that is completely separate, completely different, from defending the central pillar of our constitution."" She said it would be an abuse of power for a PM ""through desperation"" to ""try to limit the voice of the MPs we all elect"". ""We think that it's beyond the prime minister's powers because parliamentary sovereignty is actually the jewel in the constitutional crown."" Ms Patel, a supporter of Mr Johnson, told Sky: ""I'm not surprised [at Ms Miller's remarks] because there seems to be a relentless movement to delay Brexit, to stop Brexit happeningâ¦ to question the integrity of a future government in its renewed determination to exit the European Union"". She said the process of leaving must be ""down to Parliament, not third parties going through the courts"". Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has previously warned strongly against no deal, but told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday she accepted ""we now need to allow no deal to be part of the leverage to make sure that people compromise more"". ""I would hope that the EU will compromise and that [Tory Brexiteer group] the ERG will compromise too,"" she said. Ms Rudd - who backs Mr Hunt for the leadership - said she was still concerned about the economic impact of no deal, but added: ""I am no longer saying that I will lie down in front of the bulldozers if it arrives."" By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The process of judicial review is a tried and trusted legal procedure which helps hold policy-makers to account, but it can last a long time - usually months. In judicial review cases, it's not the court's job to rule on whether the decision made by the public organisation is correct or not. Instead, it is concerned about the way in which the decision or action has been taken: have the right procedures been followed? Has the public body exceeded its powers? And is that decision or action ""irrational"" - in other words, so unreasonable that no sensible person could have arrived at it? Only the Queen can decide to suspend Parliament, but it's highly unlikely there would be a legal challenge against any decision Her Majesty made. Instead, any judicial review would probably revolve around the legality of the advice to suspend Parliament offered to the Queen by the new prime minister. Read more. Meanwhile,Chancellor Philip Hammond has warnedthe UK will not be able to control key elements of a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Panorama the EU would control many of the ""levers"" - including what happens to the flow of goods through the port of Calais in France. ""The French can dial that up or dial it down, just the same as the Spanish for years have dialled up or dialled down the length of the queues at the border going into Gibraltar,"" he said. The Treasury has spent Â£4.2bn on Brexit preparations, but Mr Hammond has warned that, even with careful planning, a no-deal exit could cost the country up to Â£90bn. French officials have previouslyrejected suggestions they could resort to a ""go-slow"" policyat Calais if there is no Brexit deal - insisting that closing the port would be ""economic suicide"".

Electricity restored after New York power cutPower has now been restored to all customers affected by a power outage in Manhattan.,"This video can not be played Some of New York's subway stations were plunged into darkness Power has now been restored to all customers after a power failure in New York halted subway trains and trapped people in lifts on Saturday evening. Energy company Con Edison said more than 70,000 homes and businesses lost power in Manhattan, the most densely populated of the city's five boroughs. The outage lasted for about five hours. It came on the anniversary of a massive power failure in 1977 that plunged the New York skyline into darkness and triggered widespread looting and arson. Shortly before midnight (04:00 GMT Sunday)  Con Edison head John MacAvoy said all six networks which had been affected were now up and running. He said the problem appeared to have originated at a substation, but the cause was being investigated. The widespread power cut extended from Fifth Avenue west to the Hudson River, and from West 42nd north to 72nd Street, the fire department said. The blackout brought traffic to a standstill in parts of New York It put street lights and traffic lights out of action and forced the evacuation of buildings across the borough. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the New York Police Department had confirmed there was no foul play.""This was a mechanical issue,"",externalhe wrote on Twitter. Alex Hammerli, 26, was on his way to a bar when the blackout began. ""No subway for 45 blocks and half the trains not running. It's kind of annoying. I'm also surprised that people aren't unleashing their crazy [side] yet. The cops are just trying to shut down the roads,"" he told the BBC. Allow Twitter content?

Storm Barry brings flood fears in Louisiana,"This video can not be played Thousands have been evacuated from at-risk areas Storm Barry has made landfall in Louisiana, where officials have warned of potentially life-threatening floods. The storm reached hurricane strength as it neared land, but has now weakened to a storm packing sustained wind speeds of 60mph (96km/h). The system is crawling north-west at a speed of just 8mph, dumping heavy rainfall as it tracks inland. The worst of the storm is expected to hit an area west of New Orleans, and affect the wider region. Thousands have been evacuated from areas most at risk of flooding and other residents have been told to shelter in place. More than 100,000 households in Louisiana are already without power, according to tracking tool poweroutage.us. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones explained All flights in and out of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Saturday were cancelled. President Donald Trump declared a federal state of emergency in Louisiana before the storm hit. A woman in Mandeville, Louisiana watches the rising waters In its latest update at 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT), the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) confirmed Storm Barry's winds had weakened. But it said ""life-threatening storm surge inundation"" continued as it moved inland. Before it made landfall near Intracoastal City, it was confirmed as the first hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic season. As the storm's rain bands closed in, local journalists shared images of flooding in some residential areas. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least one levee, in Plaquemines Parish in the state's tip, was already overtopped by water by midday on Saturday. Officials have told residents there to immediately evacuate, if it is safe to do so, or risk being cut off for several days. Louisiana's most populous city, New Orleans, looks set to avoid a direct hit from the hurricane - with the worst expected further west near the city of Lafayette instead. Heavy rain is expected throughout the state. Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, has urged residents not to become complacent. ""I want to caution everybody. This is just the beginning,"" he said at a Saturday news conference. This video can not be played New Orleans has already been hit by flooding With recent flash-flooding and heavy rainfall, there was particular concern about the flooding risk to low-lying New Orleans. Most of the city's flood defences, improved after more than 1,800 died in Hurricane Katrina in 2005, are built between 20-25ft (6-7.6m) high. The National Weather Service (NWS) earlier warned the Mississippi River could crest at 19ft or 20ft during the storm, but on Friday revised their estimate down to 17ft. No city-wide mandatory evacuation is in place, but locals were told to hunker down and stock-up on essentials. New Orleans is particularly vulnerable to floods The city's emergency preparedness campaign has urged residents to remain vigilant and stay patient. The NHC warned that ""life-threatening, significant flash flooding and river flooding"" would become increasingly likely across areas of south and south-east Louisiana as the storm moved further inland. ""The slow movement of Barry will result in a long duration heavy rainfall and flood threat from Sunday into next week"", it said. While there is no definitive link between climate change and Storm Barry, rising temperatures are increasingly a factor in making the impact of events like this more intense. As the air has warmed over recent decades it is now able to hold much more moisture, meaning tropical storms are pre-loaded with large amounts of rain. The warming world is also making these storms more sluggish. Over the past seven decades tropical events like Barry have slowed down, going 20-30% less quickly over land in North America. This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when it weakened to a tropical storm and then stalled for days over the Houston area dumping enormous quantities of rainwater which cost lives and did huge damage. Sea levels have also increased as a result of global heating, so if winds are blowing towards shore, this makes flooding much more likely during high tides. How do hurricanes form?

Iran nuclear deal in 300 words,"President Hassan Rouhani (R) says Iran is retaliating against US sanctions The crisis over Iran's nuclear activities has escalated since the US under Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons - something it says it does not seek. One of the key points of dispute concerns uranium enrichment carried out by Iran as part of its nuclear programme. Here's why. Uranium is an element which occurs naturally. It can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched. This is achieved by increasing the content of its most fissile isotopes, U-235, through the use of centrifuges - machines which spin at supersonic speeds. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Highly enriched uranium has a purity of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile was limited to 300kg for 15 years under the nuclear deal Under its 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers - China, France, Germany, Russia, the US and the UK - Iran was only permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity. It also agreed to hold no more than 300kg (660lbs) of low-enriched uranium; to operate no more than 5,060 of its oldest and least efficient IR-1 centrifuges; and to cease enrichment at the underground Fordo facility. Under the deal, Iran capped its nuclear activities in return for a lifting of sanctions. Donald Trump reimposed US sanctions in November 2018, and since July 2019 Iran has increasingly breached the pact's restrictions. It has, among other things: Exceeded the limit on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium Resumed enrichment activity at Fordo Begun using more centrifuges, and of a more advanced type, than it is allowed Resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity and then started to produce smaller quantities of 60%-enriched uranium as well - a significantly higher level of refinement than it had reached before Iran has continued to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor its nuclear programme and says the steps are easily reversible. The country insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. However, experts have warned that the breaches have theoretically reduced the time it would take Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one bomb. Even before Iran began enriching to 60% purity this April,they said the so-called ""breakout time"" had been shortened from about one year to three months,external. This video can not be played Iran's nuclear programme: What's been happening at its key nuclear sites? The IR-6 centrifuges being installed at Natanz are seven to eight times more efficient than the IR-1 machines Iran is allowed under the nuclear deal. Enriching uranium to 20% purity and beyond also increases the potential for it being used for military purposes because the effort required to refine it to this point from its natural state is 90% of the total effort needed to get it to weapons grade. The nuclear fuel cycle,external Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know The US-based Arms Control Association (ACA) said that once Iran had accumulated 170kg of 20%-enriched uranium, it would be able produce one bomb's worth, or 25kg, of uranium enriched to weapons-grade in less than two months. Iran had about 17kg of uranium enriched to 20% purity as of mid-February and it has said it plans to produce 120kg in total during 2021. It is also currently producing nine grams per hour of 60%-enriched uranium. The ACA said that while the break-out time could be extended if Iran reversed its actions, the knowledge Iran had gained by operating advanced centrifuges could not be undone. It has said it is retaliating for the crippling US economic sanctions and other penalties that were reinstated in 2018. Mr Trump called the agreement ""defective at its core"" and pursued a ""maximum pressure"" campaign to compel Iran to negotiate a replacement. Iran's oil exports - the government's principal source of revenue - were hit by the reinstated US sanctions Iran's leaders refused to do so and argued that the deal allowed one party to ""cease performing its commitments... in whole or in part"" in the event of ""significant non-performance"" by others. But France, Germany and the UK did not accept Iran's assertion. How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians US-Iran relations: A brief history Their hopes to save the deal from collapse were raised significantly when Mr Trump was succeeded as president by Joe Biden, who wants the US to rejoin it. But just before he took office this January, Iran ramped up its uranium enrichment in response to the killing in November of its top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, which it blamed on Israel. Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed in an ambush near Tehran Iran again stepped up its enrichment - to 60% - this month in retaliation for a suspected Israeli sabotage attack at Natanz. Israel, which sees Iran's nuclear programme as a potential existential threat and opposes international efforts to revive the nuclear deal, has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in either incident. Iran insists it has never sought to develop such a weapon. The international community does not believe that, pointing to evidence collected by the IAEA suggesting that until 2003 Iran conducted ""a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"". Some of those activities continued until 2009, according to the IAEA. In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said thatsecret Iranian documents obtained by his country showed Iran had surreptitiously continued nuclear weapons work beyond 2015,external. Iran has dismissed this as a fabrication. Mr Netanyahu also said Israel had identified a ""secret atomic warehouse"" in a district of Tehran, believed to be where IAEA inspectors subsequently detected the presence of uranium particles of man-made origin. The IAEA has saidIran has not provided a credible explanation,external. Iran has said it has nothing to hide. Despite such evidence, US intelligence agencies say Iran""is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that we judge would be necessary to produce a nuclear device"",external.

Iran deal breaches 'extortion' - US,"This video can not be played Iran's representative to the UN: Europeans ""are not honouring their commitments"" on nuclear deal The US has accused Iran of a ""crude and transparent attempt to extort payments from the international community"" by violating the 2015 nuclear deal. The US ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency said there was no credible reason for Iran to breach two key commitments on uranium enrichment. Iran has said the steps were a response to the sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal last year. It has vowed to reverse them if it is given compensation for economic losses. European powers still party to the deal have set up a mechanism for facilitating legitimate trade without direct financial transactions that they hope will circumvent the US sanctions. However, Iran has said it does not meet its needs. Iran's representative to the UN in New York told the BBC that the Europeans could do more, and that if they did not Iran would take further steps. Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead? Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words ""If nothing happens in the next 60 days we will have to go to the third phase. The elements of the third phase are not known yet, but when it comes to that we will announce what we are going to do,"" Majid Takht-Ravanchi warned. Iran's president told a French envoy ""the path of diplomacy and talks"" was ""completely open"" At Wednesday's special meeting of the IAEA board of governors in Vienna, diplomats were reportedly told that the global watchdog's inspectors had verified Iran was enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration - above the 3.67% limit set by the nuclear deal. The country announced the step three days ago, saying it wanted to be able to produce fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The IAEA was also said to have verified that Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium had grown since the 300kg (660lb) limit was exceeded on 1 July. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Experts have said the breach of the stockpile limit does not pose a near-term proliferation risk, but that enriching uranium to a higher concentration would begin to shorten Iran's so-called ""break-out time"" - the time required for it to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. Iran insists it has never sought to develop a nuclear weapon. But the international community does not believe Iran, and negotiated a nuclear deal to prevent it from doing so. US President Donald Trump said the deal did not go far enough to restrict Iran's nuclear programme and unilaterally withdrew from the accord in May 2018. He wants to replace it with one that would also curb Iran's ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. But Iran has so far refused. US ambassador Jackie Wolcott said it was imperative that Iran's ""misbehaviour"" not be rewarded At the IAEA meeting,US ambassador Jackie Wolcott said Iran's recent actions and statements were deeply concerning,external, and affected security and stability. ""Iran's current nuclear posture is clearly aimed at escalating tensions rather than defusing them, and underscores the serious challenges Iran continues to pose to international peace and security,"" she said. ""Such brinkmanship and extortion tactics will neither resolve the current impasse nor bring Iran sanctions relief.

Iran deal breaches are extortion - US,"This video can not be played Iran's representative to the UN: Europeans ""are not honouring their commitments"" on nuclear deal The US has accused Iran of a ""crude and transparent attempt to extort payments from the international community"" by violating the 2015 nuclear deal. The US ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency said there was no credible reason for Iran to breach two key commitments on uranium enrichment. Iran has said the steps were a response to the sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal last year. It has vowed to reverse them if it is given compensation for economic losses. European powers still party to the deal have set up a mechanism for facilitating legitimate trade without direct financial transactions that they hope will circumvent the US sanctions. However, Iran has said it does not meet its needs. Iran's representative to the UN in New York told the BBC that the Europeans could do more, and that if they did not Iran would take further steps. Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead? Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words ""If nothing happens in the next 60 days we will have to go to the third phase.

Iran's president told a French envoy ""the path of diplomacy and talks"" was ""completely open"" At Wednesday's special meeting of the IAEA board of governors in Vienna, diplomats were reportedly told that the global watchdog's inspectors had verified Iran was enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration - above the 3.67% limit set by the nuclear deal. The country announced the step three days ago, saying it wanted to be able to produce fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power plant.

Key details of nuclear deal,"In 2015, Iran agreed a long-term deal on its nuclear programme with a group of world powers known as the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. It came after years of tension over Iran's alleged efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran insisted that its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, but the international community did not believe that. Underthe accord,external, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. Here is what was meant to happen according to the plan, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300kg for 15 years Uranium can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched. This is achieved by increasing the content of its most fissile isotopes, U-235, through the use of centrifuges - machines which spin at supersonic speeds. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Highly enriched uranium has a purity of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. In July 2015, Iran had two uranium enrichment plants - Natanz and Fordo - and was operating almost 20,000 centrifuges. Under the JCPOA, the country was limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges at Natanz until 2026 - 10 years after the deal's ""implementation day"" in January 2016. Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was also reduced by 98% to 300kg (660lbs), a figure that must not be exceeded until 2031. It must also keep the stockpile's level of enrichment at 3.67%. In addition, research and development must take place only at Natanz and be limited until 2024. No enrichment is permitted at Fordo until 2031, and the underground facility must be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology centre. The 1,044 centrifuges left at the site are allowed to produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, industry and science. Iran is redesigning the Arak reactor so it cannot produce any weapons-grade plutonium Iran had been building a heavy-water nuclear facility near the town of Arak. Spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a nuclear bomb. World powers had originally wanted Arak dismantled because of the potential military use. Under an interim nuclear deal in 2013, Iran agreed not to commission or fuel the reactor. Under the JCPOA, Iran said it would redesign the reactor so it could not produce any weapons-grade plutonium, and that all spent fuel would be sent out of the country as long as the modified reactor existed. Iran must also not build additional heavy-water reactors or accumulate any excess heavy water until 2031. Iran is required to allow IAEA inspectors to access any site they deem suspicious At the time of the agreement, then-US President Barack Obama's administration expressed confidence that the JCPOA would prevent Iran from building a nuclear programme in secret. Iran, it said, had committed to ""extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification, and inspection"". Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the global nuclear watchdog, were tasked with continuously monitoring Iran's declared nuclear sites and verifying that no fissile material is moved covertly to a secret location to build a bomb. Iran also agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to their IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which allows inspectors to access any site anywhere in the country they deem suspicious. Until 2031, Iran will have 24 days to comply with any IAEA access request. If it refuses, an eight-member Joint Commission - including Iran - will rule on the issue. It can decide on punitive steps, including the reimposition of sanctions. A majority vote by the commission suffices. A UN ban on the import of ballistic missile technology will remain in place for up to eight years Before July 2015, Iran had enough enriched uranium and centrifuges to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the then Obama administration. US experts estimated at the time that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""break-out time"". The Obama administration said the JCPOA would remove the key elements Iran would need to create a bomb and increase its break-out time to one year or more. Iran also agreed not to engage in activities, including research and development, which could contribute to the development of a nuclear bomb. In December 2015, the IAEA's board of governors voted to end its decade-long investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear programme. The agency's then-director-general, Yukiya Amano, said the report concluded that until 2003 Iran had conducted ""a co-ordinated effort"" on ""a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"". Iran continued with some activities until 2009, but after that there were ""no credible indications"" of weapons development, he added. Iran also agreed to the continuation of a UN ban on its imports and exports of conventional arms until 2020. Restrictions on its import of ballistic missile technology will remain in place until 2023. The nuclear deal allowed Iran to sell crude oil again on the international market Sanctions previously imposed by the UN, US and EU in an attempt to force Iran to halt uranium enrichment crippled its economy, costing the country more than $160bn (Â£119bn) in oil revenue from 2012 to 2016 alone. Under the deal, all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran were lifted and the country was able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. It also gained access to more than $100bn in assets frozen overseas. However, in May 2018, then-US President Donald Trump abandoned the JCPOA, calling it ""defective at its core"". He reinstated all US sanctions on Iran that November as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign to compel the country to negotiate a replacement that would also curb its ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. But Iran refused and saw its economy plunge into recession and the value of its currency fall to record lows, which in turn caused inflation to soar to the highest level in decades. When the sanctions were tightened in 2019, Iran began breaching the deal's restrictions, arguing that the JCPOA allowed one party to ""cease performing its commitments... in whole or in part"" in the event of ""significant non-performance"" by others. By November 2021, Iran had amassed a stockpile of enriched uranium that was many times larger than permitted, including at least 17.7kg (39lb) of material enriched to 60% purity - just below the level needed for a bomb. It had also resumed enrichment activity at Fordo; installed more centrifuges, and of a more advanced type, than allowed; and taken steps in the production of enriched uranium metal, which is a key material in nuclear weapons. Iran had also significantly curtailed access for international inspectors by ceasing implementation of the Additional Protocol of its IAEA Safeguards Agreement. Talks to save the JCPOA and bring Iran back into compliance began in May 2021, after Joe Biden succeeded Mr Trump as US president. He says the US will rejoin and lift the sanctions if Iran reverses its breaches. His Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, says the US must make the first move. If the negotiations were to fail and Iran was confirmed to have violated the deal, all UN sanctions would  automatically ""snap back"" in place for 10 years, with the possibility of a five-year extension.

Iran announces new breach,"Iranian officials announced they would breach the enrichment limit within a matter of hours Iran has announced it will break a limit set on uranium enrichment, in breach of the landmark 2015 deal designed to curb its nuclear ambitions. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. The US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018. It has since reimposed tight sanctions affecting the Iranian economy. Responding to the latest announcement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would only lead to ""further isolation and sanctions"" for the nation. Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead? Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? In May, Iran announced it would step up its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to make fuel for reactors but also for nuclear weapons. The country has already stockpiled more enriched uranium than permitted under the terms of the deal. Iran has strongly denied that it has any intention of building nuclear weapons. On the anniversary of the US withdrawal, Iran gave a 60-day deadline to the remaining parties to the deal - China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK - to protect it from US sanctions. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday at the end of that deadline, Mr Araqchi said Iran would start enriching uranium above a concentration of 3.67% within a few hours. Iran says the enriched uranium will be used to fuel its power plant at Bushehr Officials previously said this would mean a concentration of about 5%. Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr requires ""low-enriched"" fuel at about this level. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. The ramped-up enrichment programme may be designed to exert pressure on the diplomatic negotiations, as Mr Araqchi said Iran would keep reducing its commitment to the 2015 deal every 60 days. Another reactor in Tehran used for research purposes requires fuel enriched to 20% - the highest level Iran had been producing prior to the nuclear deal. But a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said it already had a sufficient stockpile for that purpose. ""We will enrich uranium based on our needs,"" he said. ""Right now, we don't need to enrich uranium for the Tehran reactor."" Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The nuclear fuel cycle,external Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed that the steps were ""reversible"" if European countries delivered on their commitments. A spokesman for the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said its inspectors would report back to headquarters ""as soon as they verify the announced development"". The demise of the 2015 nuclear accord to contain Iran's nuclear programme seems to be coming ever closer. Iran's policy of progressive breaches of the agreement's terms is seen in Tehran as a way to pressure the Europeans to relieve the impact of US economic sanctions. But there is little they can do in practical terms to mitigate Iran's dire economic situation. The Europeans want the deal to survive but are caught between Tehran and Washington. This has been a slow-motion diplomatic car crash - ever since the US walked out of the agreement a year ago. French President Emmanuel Macron's telephone conversation with his Iranian counterpart on Saturday bought a little more time for consultations. The Europeans are struggling to postpone the moment when they have to declare the nuclear deal dead. But at some point, if Iran continues to chip away at its limits and restrictions, they may have little choice. Mr Pompeo reacted on Twitter, reiterating US objections to the nuclear developments.

European powers said they had been conferring with each other to discuss next steps. Germany said it was ""extremely concerned"" and urged Iran not to make any further moves to endanger the agreement. A spokesman for the UK's Foreign Office said that while Iran had now broken the terms of the nuclear deal, the UK remained ""fully committed"" to it. The UK also called on Iran to stop its activities, and said it was co-ordinating with the other parties on what to do. The announcement comes a day after French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and expressed his ""strong concern"" about what would happen if the agreement was abandoned. A French statement said the two leaders had agreed ""to explore by 15 July the conditions for the resumption of dialogue between all parties"",external. Mr Rouhani called on European countries to act now to save the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the announcement was a ""very, very dangerous step"" for Iran, and repeated his calls for France, Germany and the UK to impose sanctions. Israel's Energy Minister, Yuval Steinitz, had already criticised the move, saying that while the increase was ""moderate"", Iran had ""begun its march... toward nuclear weaponry"".

Official threatens to seize tanker,"This video can not be played The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria An Iranian official has said a British oil tanker should be seized, if a detained Iranian ship is not released. British Royal Marines helped officials in Gibraltar to seize the super-tanker Grace 1 on Thursday, after it was suspected of carrying oil from Iran to Syria, in breach of EU sanctions. A court in Gibraltar has ruled the ship can be detained for a further 14 days. Iran latersummoned the British ambassador in Tehranto complain about what it said was a ""form of piracy"". Mohsen Rezaei said Iran would respond to bullies ""without hesitation"". Mr Rezaei - a member of a council that advises the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei -  said, in a tweet: ""If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities' duty to seize a British oil tanker."" The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help detain Grace 1 and its cargo. Gibraltar said there was reason to believe the ship was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous. The territory was initially able to detain the ship for 72-hours, but Gibraltar's Supreme Court granted a 14-day extension on Friday. Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the initial seizure of the vessel as illegal and accused the UK of acting at the behest of the United States. The UK Foreign Office dismissed claims of piracy as ""nonsense"". Royal Marines disembarking Grace 1 on Thursday Spain's Acting Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said, on Thursday, Spain - which disputes British ownership of Gibraltar - was studying the circumstances of the action, but said it followed ""a demand from the US to the UK"". BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said, while Britain has been keen to suggest it was an operation led by the Gibraltar government, it appears the intelligence came from the US. US to hit Iran with 'major' sanctions How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard By Kasra Naji, BBC Persian special correspondent Iran's threat to retaliate against the impounding of its super-tanker is an indication of how hurt Tehran is by the UK's action. In the eight years of war in Syria this appears to be the first time Iran's supply of oil to its ally has been interrupted, even though EU sanctions have existed for almost the whole duration. The episode also reflects worsening relations between Iran and the UK over a range of issues - particularly the continued imprisonment of British-Iranian motherNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The tanker and its cargo are probably worth more than $200m (Â£160m). Iran is looking for ways to respond to what it sees as illegal and an act of piracy. It has the capability to take over a British ship in the Gulf and would see such a move as proportionate. On Friday, a senior Iranian lawmaker said the seizure of tanker was proof the UK ""lacks honour"" and takes orders from the US. Mostafa Kavakebian, who leads the Iran-UK parliamentary friendship group, tweeted that the seizure was ""a form of piracy and illegal hostility towards Iran"". Tensions between the UK and Iran have been exacerbated by the detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe White House national security advisor John Bolton said the seizure was ""excellent news"". He added that the US and its allies would continue to prevent regimes in Tehran and Damascus from ""profiting off this illicit trade"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the swift action would deny valuable resources to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ""murderous regime"". The Baniyas Refinery, where the Iranian tanker was believed to be taking the oil, is a subsidiary of the General Corporation for Refining and Distribution of Petroleum Products - a section of the Syrian ministry of petroleum. The EU says,externalthe facility therefore provides financial support to the Syrian government, which is subject tosanctions,externalbecause of its repression of civilians since the start of the uprising against President Assad in 2011. The refinery has been subject toEU sanctions since 2014.,external Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? US-Iran relations: A brief history This latest row comes at a time of escalating tensions between the US and Iran. The Trump administration - which has pulled out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme - has reinforcedpunishing sanctions against Iran. Its European allies, including the UK, have not followed suit. Nonetheless, there have been growing tensions between the UK and Iran too, after Britain said the Iranian regime was""almost certainly"" responsible for the attacks on two oil tankersin June. The UK has also been pressing Iran to release British-Iranian motherNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffewho was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted for spying, which she denies.

Tanker bound for Syria detained,"The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria Royal Marines have boarded an oil tanker on its way to Syria thought to be breaching EU sanctions, the government of Gibraltar has said. Authorities said there was reason to believe the ship - Grace 1 - was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria. The refinery is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria. Britain's ambassador in Tehran, Robert Macaire, has been summoned over the incident. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying the ambassador had been summoned over the ""illegal seizure"" of the tanker. Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, praised the marines who detained the ship. ""Be assured that Gibraltar remains safe, secure and committed to the international, rules-based, legal order,"" he said, thanking the police, customs and port authorities for their involvement in detaining the ship. The British overseas territory of Gibraltar stands at the gateway to the Mediterranean Gibraltar port and law enforcement agencies detained the super tanker and its cargo on Thursday morning with the help of the marines. The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help seize the tanker, at the request of the Gibraltar government. A defence source described it as a ""relatively benign operation"" without major incident. Mr Picardo said he had written to the presidents of the European Commission and European Council to give details of the sanctions that have been enforced. The Baniyas refinery, in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous, is a subsidiary of the General Corporation for Refining and Distribution of Petroleum Products, a section of the Syrian ministry of petroleum. The EU says,externalthe facility therefore provides financial support to the Syrian government, which is subject tosanctions,externalbecause of its repression of civilians since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. The refinery has beensubject to EU sanctions since 2014,external. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she welcomed the ""firm action"" by the Gibraltarian authorities.
