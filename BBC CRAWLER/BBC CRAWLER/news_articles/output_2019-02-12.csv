Trump condemns attacks on media,"This video can not be played A Trump supporter shoves a BBC cameraman at the El Paso rally Donald Trump has condemned attacks on the media after an incident involving a BBC cameraman at the US president's rally in Texas on Monday. A White House statement did not refer to the specific incident. It said the president ""condemns all acts of violence against any individual or group of people - including members of the press"". The BBC's Ron Skeans was shoved and sworn at by a man in a Make America Great Again cap in El Paso. The BBC later asked the White House to review security for media attending President Trump's rallies. In a letter, the BBC said the press area was unsupervised, and no security had tried to intervene during the incident. The White House statement, from Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, added: ""We ask that anyone attending an event do so in a peaceful and respectful manner."" Mr Trump has been critical of media, which he has called the enemy of the people. After Monday's incident, Mr Trump's campaign team thanked law enforcement for ejecting the unidentified man. ""An individual involved in a physical altercation with a news cameraman was removed from last night's rally,"" said Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer for Trump for President Inc. ""We appreciate the swift action from venue security and law enforcement officers."" Why the attack on our cameraman was no surprise The man, who a Trump campaign official said appeared to be drunk, gave Mr Skeans a ""very hard shove"", according to the cameraman. This video can not be played President Trump told supporters in El Paso, ""we're building the wall anyway"" Mr Skeans said the man almost knocked him and his camera over twice before he was wrestled away by a blogger. President Trump saw the attack, checked they were well with a thumbs up and continued his speech after Mr Skeans returned the gesture. BBC Washington producer Eleanor Montague and Washington correspondent Gary O'Donoghue were sitting in front of the camera. Ms Montague said the protester had attacked other news crews but Mr Skeans ""got the brunt of it"". In the letter to Ms Sanders, the BBC's Americas Bureaux Editor Paul Danahar asked for a review of security arrangements for members of the press attending the president's rallies. Mr Danahar pointed out ""that access into the media area last night was unsupervised and that no member of law enforcement or security stopped the attacker entering, intervened when he began his attack or followed up on the incident with our colleagues afterwards"". The president went to El Paso, on the US border with Mexico, to campaign for a border wall, a divisive issue which caused the longest government shutdown in US history. Ms Montague said the president had spoken of ""fake news"" and how the media misrepresented him in the run up to the assault. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr O'Donoghue said it was ""an incredibly violent attack"". Why Trump attacks the media Are journalists increasingly under attack? Last August UN experts warned Mr Trump's attacks ""increase the risk of journalists being targeted with violence"", calling his rhetoric ""strategic"".

Brexit doubts leave firms 'hung out to dry',"UK firms have accused the government of leaving them ""hung out to dry"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. With less than 50 days until 29 March when the UK is due to leave the EU, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says 20 key questions remain unresolved. How to move skilled staff between the UK and EU, which rules to follow, and what trade deals will be in place are all still unknown, the BCC says. The government said it was focused on getting approval for its Brexit deal. ""I absolutely recognise that for many businesses it is a period of uncertainty and concern,"" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""That's why we are so committed to securing a deal."" He said he had already met BCC representatives to discussthe list of key questions,external. On the matter of trade tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he said he expected to be able to give more information ""in the coming days"". Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Theresa May is currently seeking changes to her Brexit deal with the EU after it was emphatically rejected last month, inthe largest defeat ever for a sitting government. The prime minister needs to get a deal approved by Parliament by 29 March to avoid a no-deal Brexit. In that case, in the countries where the UK had no formal trade agreement, both would have to trade under the rules overseen by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under this system, every WTO member is free to negotiate its own tariffs - or taxes - on different goods. But under the rules, members have to offer the same tariff to every other WTO country. The UK has signed ""continuity agreements"", which mean there will be no disruption to trade, with Switzerland, Chile, The Faroe Islands and Eastern and Southern Africa. As a result free trade agreements currently in place between the EU and those countries will apply to the UK after Brexit. Mutual recognition agreements - where a product lawfully sold in one country can be sold in another - have also been signed with Australia and New Zealand. Labour has accused Mrs Mayof ""cynically"" running down the clock. It claims the prime minister is planning to delay the final, binding vote on the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU until the last possible moment, so that MPs will be faced with a stark choice between her deal and no deal. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""a growing frustration"" around Mrs May's handling of the Brexit process. ""She's coming to Parliament every other week, pretending there's progress, and trying to buy another two weeks,"" he told BBC Radio Four. ""Parliament needs to say 'that's not on'"". The BCC - which represents thousands of firms - says its members are ""hugely concerned"" that the UK is not prepared for all eventualities. Please upgrade your browser The business lobby group also warned that the lack of clarity over what will happen had already ""stifled investment and growth"". ""There is a very real risk that a lack of clear, actionable information from government will leave firms, their people and their communities hung out to dry,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall. Mr Marshall said firms remained ""in the dark"" over crucial issues including contracts and customs tariffs. ""Businesses need answers they can base decisions on, no matter the outcome,"" he added. The Bank of England governor has urged MPs to solve the current Brexit impasse The BCC has published the list of 20 questions firms want answered. They include whether firms will be able to fly people and goods between the UK and EU after the end of March and whether there will be any import tariffs. The business group's warning comes afterBank of England governor Mark Carney earlier urged MPsto solve the current Brexit impasse. Mr Carney warned a no-deal Brexit would create an ""economic shock"" at a time when China's economy is slowing and trade tensions are rising. ""It is in the interests of everyone, arguably everywhere"" that a Brexit solution is found, he said.

Tongue-splitting body artist admits GBH,"This video can not be played Brendan âDr Evilâ McCarthy admits GBH for performing tongue splitting and nipple removal A body modification artist has admitted three counts of grievous bodily harm, by carrying out tongue splitting and ear and nipple removal procedures. Brendan McCarthy, also known as Dr Evil, carried out consensual procedures without using anaesthetic. In his defence, the 50-year-old argued that consent was given but the judge ruled the procedures could not be compared to tattoos and piercings. He will be sentenced on 21 March at Wolverhampton Crown Court. McCarthy, of Bushbury, Wolverhampton, ran a modification emporium in Princess Alley before he was charged with six counts of wounding in 2017. Warning: This article contains graphic imagery. Brendan McCarthy ran Dr Evil's Body Modification Emporium He was arrested in December 2015 following a complaint to City of Wolverhampton Council's environmental health team. A petition in support of McCarthy amassed more than 13,400 signatures and his lawyer challenged the charges on the basis that his customers consented. His supporters argued ""for the right to express ourselves in whatever modified manner we wish in a safe environment"". The council said its issue was with McCarthy's lack of licence to carry out the modification procedures and the need for more regulation in the industry which delivers results ""akin to cosmetic surgery"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Dr Samantha Pegg, a law lecturer at Nottingham Trent University and expert on the legality of body modification procedures, said: ""Practitioners have assumed that extreme body modifications, as forms of body adornment, were lawful when consent was given. ""Although the law has long accepted that tattooing and piercing are lawful activities there has not - until this case - been any consideration of other forms of body modification such as tongue splitting."" McCarthy no longer runs Dr Evil's Body Modification Emporium in Princess Alley Passing verdict, Judge Amjad Nawaz ruled that written consent from his customers was not sufficient defence. The tattooist has spent two years arguing his case, contending at the Court of Appeal that the procedures should be regarded as lawful to protect the ""personal autonomy"" of his customers. Judge Nawaz drew the distinction between body modification and tattoos and piercings, saying there is ""no proper analogy"". ""What the defendant undertook for reward in this case was a series of medical procedures for no medical reason,"" he said. McCarthy removed a client's ear in 2015 at his studio in Wolverhampton Dr Pegg said the case has ""partially clarified what was previously a grey area of the law"". Although consensual, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said these were ""significant surgical procedures"" but McCarthy has no medical qualifications, nor is he registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). ""Surgical procedures must be carried out by properly trained, qualified and regulated surgeons or healthcare professionals,"" senior prosecutor Rhiannon Jones said. GMC guidance says doctors must be appropriately trained and experienced before practising cosmetic procedures. It adds doctors must consider their patients' psychological needs and follow protocols for safe interventions. Speaking before Tuesday's hearing, McCarthy told the BBC the situation was ""crushing"". ""It's crushed me completely, I'm a shadow of my former self,"" he said. ""I don't feel I've done anything wrong."" Nick Pinch went to McCarthy to have his nipple removed after previous piercings caused a build-up of scar tissue. Nick Pinch went to McCarthy to have his nipple removed The procedures carried out on Mr Pinch formed part of the prosecution's case. Mr Pinch said: ""[McCarthy] wanted to know why I wanted this procedure, he wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing, he took complete duty of care. I'm really happy with what I've had done."" Out-of-date medical materials were found in McCarthy's studio West Midlands Police said McCarthy conducted the procedures without knowing his clients' medical histories or psychiatric backgrounds. He also did not have any life-saving equipment if the surgeries went wrong. Officers discovered out-of-date pre-injection swabs, anaesthetic gel, stitching thread and needles, the force added.

The teenager had remained on the platform after the boy fell, police said. Visitors were initially locked inside the gallery at Bankside on the South Bank.

Ms Barnfield said she turned around and saw a woman screaming: ""Where's my son, where's my son?"" Members of the public quickly gathered around a man who was nearby, she said.

Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused',"Robert MacPhail said he had sold cannabis to the accused Jurors in the Alesha MacPhail murder trial have heard that her father sold cannabis to the teenager accused of killing her. Robert MacPhail, 26, admitted doing deals with the 16-year-old boy who lived on the Isle of Bute. The teenager - who cannot be named because of his age - denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha last July. He has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by a woman called Toni Louise McLachlan. Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year. Giving evidence at the High Court in Glasgow, Mr MacPhail said he last sold the drug to the 16-year-old accused a few months before Alesha was killed. The court heard he stopped supplying cannabis to the accused after the teenager's mother made a request via her friend. The jury was told the friend was an aunt of Mr MacPhail's partner, Toni McLachlan. The body of Alesha MacPhail was discovered in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year Mr MacPhail, who is unemployed, said he sold cannabis to fund his own use of the drug and used to arrange transactions via Facebook Messenger and other means. The jury were later shown Facebook messages between Mr MacPhail and the accused which indicated the pair had fallen out in February last year over a Â£10 drug debt. The messages indicated the source of the dispute was the quality of cannabis the accused had been sold. Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, later asked Mr MacPhail: ""Did it ever cross your mind that your drug dealing might have some relevance to Alesha being taken?"" The witness replied: ""It did not"". Mr MacPhail told the court that the night before she died, Alesha came into the room he shared with Ms McLachlan and had some of his dinner. She then went to her room to watch a Peppa Pig DVD. Mr MacPhail last saw his daughter when she got up between 22:30 and 23:00 on 1 July. He said he went to bed with Ms McLachlan around 23:30 and only became aware Alesha was missing when his parents woke him up around 06:30 the following day. A frantic search followed and locals joined in when Mr MacPhail's mother posted an appeal on Facebook. He was later taken to the police station to be informed his missing daughter's body had been found. The jury heard Alesha was only a few days into a three-and-a-half week summer break on the Isle of Bute when she was murdered. She had been staying with Mr MacPhail, his parents and Ms McLachlan in a three-bedroom converted attic flat on Ardbeg Road. Mr MacPhail, 26, told the court he split up with Alesha's mother around three months after his daughter was born. He later started dating Ms McLachlan, 18, and they had been together for two years. He also told the jury his girlfriend was involved in his drug dealing and both handed over cannabis and collected money from his customers. Asked by Mr McSporran how Ms McLachlan got on with his daughter, the witness replied: ""Great. They both loved each other to bits. Ever since Toni met her, from day one."" Alesha MacPhail was tucked up in bed by her father the night before she died Jurors were earlier shown pictures of the crime scene. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC issued a warning to the jury before the images of the six-year-old with a pile of clothing next to her were shown on public screens in the court. The images also showed the wooded area and the disused hotel on the Isle of Bute where she was found. A number of people, including relatives of Alesha, left the court before the pictures were shown. Jurors were previously told Alesha's naked body was found by a man at 08:54 on 2 July in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. Alesha's grandfather Calum MacPhail, 49, last saw Alesha when she came in and jumped on his bed the night before she was discovered. The girl said to him: ""Goodnight, grandpa."" Alesha's grandparents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King, both gave evidence on Tuesday The next morning Mr MacPhail got up for work around 06:00 - but could not find Alesha in bed. He alerted his family adding: ""We searched under beds, in wardrobes, but there was no sign of her anywhere."" Mr MacPhail drove around Bute to look for Alesha. He eventually spotted police tape at an area cordoned off and begged for information before being told to go the local police station. Fighting back tears, the creamery worker recalled: ""We were put into a room. Five minutes later, a police officer said: 'We have found her but she has passed.'"" 'Beautiful, happy girl' Earlier, Mr MacPhail said his partner, Angela King, often left the key in their front door. He added: ""It was one of the things about Rothesay that a lot of people leave their door unlocked."" Ms King, 47, later described her granddaughter as a ""beautiful, beautiful, happy girl"". A recording of the 999 call she made at 06:23 on 2 July was also played to the court. Ms King was later asked by the boy's QC Mr McConnachie of being aware of her son Robert's drug dealing. Angela replied: ""He never admitted it, but I had my suspicions."" Following Alesha McPhail's death, floral tributes were laid Prosecutors allege the accused boy was armed with a knife when he took Alesha from her bed at a house in Ardbeg Road. It is claimed he carried the schoolgirl to the site of the former hotel, removed her clothes and suffocated her before raping and murdering her. The teenager faces a separate charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of clothes he had been wearing. The trial continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence which will result in them being acquitted if it is accepted by the court. These defences include self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination - meaning he has claimed that someone else (a woman called Toni McLachlan) was responsible for Alesha's death. It will be for the jury to decide whether or not they accept this special defence after hearing the evidence in the case.

Rare tiger dies in fight at safari park,"The keepers of thirteen-year-old female tiger Shouri were said to be ""extremely distraught"" A rare Amur tiger has died in a fight with two other tigers at Longleat Safari and Adventure Park. Thirteen-year-old female Shouri, who died on Monday, had lived at the park since 2006. Longleat said she gained access to a paddock where two other tigers, Red and Yana, were being held and a fight ensued between the three animals. The Warminster site was not open to the public at the time and both Red and Yana were uninjured. The park said a full investigation was ongoing to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the ""terribly sad event"". Last week, an endangered Sumatran tigerwas killed by another tiger at London Zoo. Longleat said: ""During the process of moving the tigers between the various outdoor paddocks, a door connecting two areas was opened which meant Shouri was able to gain access to the same outdoor area as Red and Yana. ""The dedicated team of keepers who care for our big cats are, understandably, extremely distraught by the events and we are doing everything we can to help and support them."" Red and Yana arrived at Longleat last year as a breeding pair. According to WWF, Amur tigers, also known as the Siberian tiger, were once found throughout the Russian Far East, northern China, and the Korean peninsula. By the 1940s, hunting had driven them to the brink of extinction. The population is now endangered, with around 540 believed to be remaining.

May asks MPs for more time on Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she would need ""some time"" to hold further talks with the EU Theresa May has promised MPs a final, decisive vote on her Brexit deal with the EU - but not until she has secured changes to the Irish backstop clause. The PM said she needed ""some time"" to get the changes she believes MPs want. She promised to update MPs again on 26 February and, if she had not got a new deal by then, to give them a say on the next steps in non-binding votes. Jeremy Corbyn accused her of ""running down the clock"" in an effort to ""blackmail"" MPs into backing her deal. Britain is currently leaving the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. Carney warns of no-deal 'economic shock' No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel Kuenssberg: Will May delay Brexit vote to last minute? Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Labour claims Mrs May is planning to delay the final, binding vote on the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU until the last possible moment, so that MPs will be faced with a stark choice between her deal and no deal. Labour and some Conservative MPs had been planning to have a fresh go at putting alternatives to Mrs May's deal to the vote on Thursday, in an effort to take control of the Brexit process. But BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May's announcement of returning to update MPs on 26 February and then more votes on 27 February - if she has still not got a final deal - meant Thursday's expected ""high noon"" for the prime minister had probably been postponed. MPs are still expected to debate and vote on amendments to the Brexit deal on Thursday, however, although it will not be known until later what those amendments are likely to be.

Mrs May promised to give MPs a ""stronger and clearer role"" in the next steps on Brexit and said she would return to the Commons for a meaningful vote on her deal ""when we achieve the progress we need"". The PM said she was discussing a number of options with the EU to secure legally-binding changes to the backstop: Replacing it with ""alternative arrangements"", putting a time limit on how long it can stay in place or a unilateral exit clause so the UK can leave it at a time of its choosing. The backstop arrangement is the ""insurance"" policy in Mrs May's deal to avoid a return to border checks on the island of Ireland. The EU has reiterated it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Mrs May said talks were at a ""crucial stage"", but she still believed it was possible to get a deal MPs could support. ""We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on time,"" Mrs May told the Commons. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said MPs were being ""blackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal"", calling it ""an irresponsible act"". By Daniel Kraemer, BBC Westminster The prime minister's critics say she is just pretending to try to get changes to the deal she signed with the EU so she can push the final vote on it right down to the wire. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says what she actually intends to do is return to Parliament after the 21-22 March European Council summit, the week before Brexit, and offer MPs a ""binary choice"" - her deal or no deal. Holding such a vote a few days before Britain leaves the EU might scare enough Labour MPs worried about a no-deal Brexit into backing the prime minister to get it through. The government insists this is not its strategy and it will hold a ""meaningful vote"" as soon as it gets the changes to the deal it is seeking from Brussels. Read more from Daniel Mr Corbyn said Mrs May was ""merely engaged in the pretence of working across Parliament to find solutions"", but she has ""not indicated she will move one iota"" on her red lines. He told MPs: ""We were promised a meaningful vote on a deal in December, it didn't happen. We were told to prepare for a further meaningful vote this week after the prime minister again promised to secure significant and legally binding changes to the backstop and that hasn't happened. ""Now the prime minister comes before the House with more excuses and more delays."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn accuses the PM of ""recklessly running down the clock"" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, was reprimanded by Commons Speaker John Bercow for shouting ""liar"" at the prime minister as she was making her statement. Mr Blackford agreed to withdraw his remark ""in deference"" to the Speaker, but did not apologise to Mrs May. MPs are banned by Commons rules from calling other MPs liars in the chamber. He said Mrs May was ""lost in a Brexit fantasy"", saying: ""We're 45 days from Scotland being dragged out of the European Union against our will - 45 days from economic catastrophe."" Conservative MP Phillip Lee, who campaigns for another EU referendum, told the BBC he expected to see more ministerial resignations at the end of the month, when some of his colleagues ""are going to have to make a stand and say: 'I'm sorry this is not acceptable'"". He said the promise of a further Commons vote on 27 February had taken the ""fizz"" out of Thursday's vote, which meant that the end of the month would ""see some action from Conservatives in government"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. New ideas for the Brexit border backstop UK signs trade deal with Switzerland Mrs May also set out plans to lift a requirement for a 21-day delay before any vote to approve an international treaty, in order to get a Brexit deal ratified in time for 29 March. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned that time was running short for the ratification of a deal under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act. Mrs May said:  ""In most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement."" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has, meanwhile, told senior European Parliament members that the UK requires legally-binding changes to the Irish backstop, but kept open the idea that these could be achieved without rewriting the text of the withdrawal agreement. On a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Barclay said he would continue working with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and he will call him after Thursday's Commons votes. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau earlier, in Paris. Following the meetings, a French Foreign ministry statement said France ""supports the planned withdrawal agreement"" and added that it was ""up to the British authorities to clarify their intentions"".

No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel,"The Channel Tunnel - or Eurotunnel - connects Calais in France with Folkestone in the UK Trains will be permitted to use the Channel Tunnel for three months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, under a proposed European Commission law. The planned legislation, published on Tuesday, will give the UK and France time to renegotiate the terms under which the railway service operates. The law must be agreed by the European Parliament and EU member states. Britain leaving the EU with no deal is the default position on 29 March unless a withdrawal agreement can be approved. Tuesday's proposal is aimed at mitigating the ""significant impact"" that a no-deal Brexit,external- the UK leaving the EU without any formal Withdrawal Agreement and no transition period - would have on rail transport and connectivity between the EU and the UK, the commission said. UK government sued over no-deal ferry contracts Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Brexit: Are we running out of time? The proposals ""are intended to ensure the continuity limited to cross-border operations and services,"" it said, warning that ""an interruption in these activities would cause significant social and economic problems."" The legislation states that, given the ""exceptional"" urgency of the situation, the proposal will not be subject to the normal eight-week consultation period. The commission also emphasised that the period for renegotiation was ""strictly limited"" and that the UK must maintain safety standards ""identical to EU requirements"". It will now work to ensure that the legislative measure is agreed and adopted by the European Parliament so that it is ready to come into force by 30 March 2019 if necessary. In October, the UK said it was seeking bilateral arrangements with France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland to ""facilitate the continued smooth functioning of cross-border rail services"".

Who is 'El Chapo' GuzmÃÂ¡n?,"""Even as a little child,"" GuzmÃ¡n's mother said, ""he had ambitions"" Caked in filth, the world's most powerful drug baron hauled himself from a manhole. For JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n, whose feats of escapology were matched only by his drug-smuggling acumen, it was a trademark yet ultimately futile manoeuvre. The 17 Mexican marines raiding his ranch nearby would catch him soon enough. Six months earlier, he had humiliated Mexican authorities by fleeing Mexico's most secure prison, his second jailbreak in two decades. This time he would not slip through their fingers, although those who caught him were left in no doubt how angry he was to have been arrested. ""You are all going to die,"" he warned police in the hours after his capture in Los Mochis, north-west Mexico, on 8 January 2016. Three years on,GuzmÃ¡n has been handed a life sentence, plus 30 years,after being found guilty of international drug smuggling in a lurid three-month trial that exposed his criminal empire. At his sentencing in New York, GuzmÃ¡n said he had received an unfair trial and his treatment in solitary confinement was tantamount to torture. ""We're never going to see his like again,"" Douglas Century, the author of the book Hunting El Chapo, told the BBC. GuzmÃ¡n was the oldest of seven children born into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico. His parents - Emilio GuzmÃ¡n Bustillos and MarÃ­a Consuelo Loera PÃ©rez - earned their living from farming. His father was officially a cattle rancher but is believed to have been an opium poppy farmer, Malcolm Beith writes in his book, The Last Narco. GuzmÃ¡n's enterprising spirit was apparent from a young age. He would support his family by selling oranges to peasant farmers for a few pesos. His penchant for the spoils of wealth didn't go unnoticed, either. In a Vice News podcast, GuzmÃ¡n's younger sister Bernarda said he would wear fake gold jewellery when visiting family members. ""Even as a little child, he had ambitions,"" his mother told filmmakers in 2014. She recalled he had ""a lot of paper money"" which he would count and recount. His first foray into organised crime came at the age of 15, when he cultivated his own marijuana plantation with his cousins. Then, he adopted the nickname ""El Chapo"" - Mexican slang for ""Shorty"". But his ambitions belied his diminutive stature (he is only 5ft 6ins, or 1.64m). In his late teens, GuzmÃ¡n left La Tuna to seek his fortune in drug smuggling. ""He always fought for a better life,"" his mother said. GuzmÃ¡n's mother arrives at the US Embassy in Mexico City in June 2019 That better life would come at a cost, paid for by illegal drugs and years of bloodshed. From his beginnings as a hitman, GuzmÃ¡n's rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld was swift. Former cartel kingpin HÃ©ctor ""El GÃ¼ero"" Palma gave GuzmÃ¡n his first break in Guadalajara in the late 1970s, when he oversaw a shipment of drugs from the Sierra Madre mountains. GuzmÃ¡n was ambitious and eager to increase the quantities of drugs being transported, according to Mr Beith's book, The Last Narco. He was also ""no-nonsense"" and would execute employees himself if deliveries were late, Mr Beith said. A guide to Mexico's drug cartels GuzmÃ¡n's trial: From shocking to bizarre GuzmÃ¡n's reputation for ruthless efficiency was duly noted. In the 1980s he was introduced to Miguel Ãngel FÃ©lix Gallardo - known as the Godfather of the Guadalajara cartel - who put him in charge of handling logistics. When FÃ©lix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, his cartel's drug trafficking territories were divided among different factions, later known as The Federation. GuzmÃ¡n was a beneficiary, setting up his own Sinaloa cartel with other traffickers in north-west Mexico. In the 1990s, he honed his operation, pioneering the use of sophisticated underground tunnels to move drugs across the border. ""He was the go-to guy,"" David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, told the BBC. ""When the United States started shutting down ports of entry in the Atlantic and Pacific in the 1990s, drugs had to go through Mexico. And if it had to go through Mexico, it had to go through El Chapo."" This video can not be played A former DEA agent describes the moment he brought down El Chapo He invested his proceeds wisely, not only expanding his enterprise, but building infrastructure that benefited locals in Sinaloa too. This cemented his popularity. ""You are Santa Claus. And everybody likes Santa Claus,"" Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico's former ambassador in Washington, told the New Yorker in 2014. Over time, GuzmÃ¡n's cartel became one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US and in 2009, he entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (Â£709m). As his wealth and empire grew, so too did scrutiny from law enforcement. ""The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been after him for decades,"" Mr Weinstein said. In 1993, a Roman Catholic cardinal was shot dead in a turf war with rival drug smugglers. GuzmÃ¡n was among those blamed and a bounty was placed on his head by the Mexican government. His moustachioed face, previously unknown to the public, started appearing in newspapers and on TV screens. Within weeks, he was arrested in Guatemala and he was later sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, drug trafficking and bribery. A prison psychological profile described him as ""egocentric, narcissistic, shrewd, persistent, tenacious, meticulous, discriminating, and secretive"", according to the New Yorker. In prison, he enjoyed a life of luxury, smuggling in lovers, prostitutes and Viagra, according to reports in Mexico. Mexican Navy soldiers escort El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n in February 2014 Eight years behind bars was enough for GuzmÃ¡n. In January 2001, he broke out of a top-security jail, Puente Grande. He did so, as the myth goes, in a laundry cart. What's more likely, multiple journalists and authors argue, is that he simply walked out of the door with the help of corrupt guards. GuzmÃ¡n controlled the prison to such an extent he escaped in police uniform, Mexican journalist Anabel HernÃ¡ndez wrote in her book, Narcoland. GuzmÃ¡n would spend the next decade evading authorities and consolidating his power as Mexico's pre-eminent drug smuggler. In that period, he always seemed to be one step ahead of would-be captors and rival cartels. ""He's a micro-manager,"" said Mr Century, who co-authored his book with Andrew Hogan, the undercover DEA agent who caught GuzmÃ¡n in 2014. ""In the text messages we have, he's in the weeds of every single minor facet of his drug operation."" Sex was his other preoccupation, Mr Century said. ""He had more mistresses than you can probably fathom. This was his existence: having sex with strange women and micro-managing every detail of his operation."" After 13 years on the run, GuzmÃ¡n was captured by Mexican marines called in by Mr Hogan in February 2014. GuzmÃ¡n's second prison break, in July 2015, was arguably even more fantastical than the first. This time, his accomplices used GPS to burrow a 1.5km (one mile) tunnel that led directly underneath his cell in Altiplano prison in central Mexico. This video can not be played Guzman escaped through a tunnel which opened under the shower in his cell The escape was elaborate and carefully planned. The tunnel had ventilation, lighting and stairs and the exit was hidden by a construction site. Mexican TV stations later aired footage that showed that guards failed to act when loud hammering was heard from inside GuzmÃ¡n's cell. GuzmÃ¡n had embarrassed Mexico's government for the second time, leaving then-President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto ""deeply troubled"" and ""outraged"". His freedom, however, was short-lived. In January 2016, GuzmÃ¡n was tracked down to a house in an affluent part of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Five of GuzmÃ¡n's guards were killed in the raid by Mexican marines and he managed to flee out of a manhole, but was caught in a car while leaving town. One year later, he was extradited to the US. This motorcycle, adapted to run along a track, was used by GuzmÃ¡n to move through the tunnel His Achilles' heel, Mr Century told the BBC, was his narcissism. He was reaching out to actors and directors to commission screenplays about his life, Mr Century said. His communication with actors and producers gifted Mexico's attorney general a new line of investigation. ""When he escaped from prison in 2015, he probably could have run away to the mountains and just lived,"" Mr Century said. Instead, GuzmÃ¡n made the unprecedented move of granting an exclusive interview to Hollywood actor Sean Penn in October 2015. It was a decision that may have cost him his freedom. ""I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats,"" he said in the interview published in Rolling Stone magazine. After his capture it was speculated - though never formally confirmed - that Mexican authorities found GuzmÃ¡n by tracking Penn. ""He contacted actresses and producers, which was part of one line of investigation,"" said Mexico's attorney general, Arely GÃ³mez. Did this meeting with Sean Penn bring about El Chapo's downfall? Facing a life sentence at a ""supermax"" prison in the US, GuzmÃ¡n's fleet is of no use to him now. Over his 30-year criminal career, he is believed to have earned more than $14bn (Â£11bn) in cash proceeds from narcotics sales, the US Department of Justice said. So far, the value of GuzmÃ¡n's assets has proven difficult to verify. Forbes even removed him from its billionaire rankings over verification concerns. The $14bn figure is too high, Bruce Bagley, a Mexican drug cartel expert, argued. He told Forbes that most Mexican drug lords plough their revenues into ""operations and protection"", estimating that ""El Chapo probably makes well below a billion per year"". Mr Weinstein said the $14bn figure was not unrealistic, but doubted the full amount would be recovered. El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n arrived in New York under heavy escort in 2017 Some of his assets were mentioned during his 11-week trial in New York. A former cartel member told the court GuzmÃ¡n bought homes in every state in Mexico. Miguel Angel Martinez said GuzmÃ¡n was so wealthy, he had a private zoo, a $10m beach house and yacht he named after himself (""Chapito""), the court heard. The most jaw-dropping revelations, however, were not about his wealth. BBC reporter Tara McKelvey covered the trial, which started in November 2018. She said the courtroom ""looked like a real-life movie"", the jurors watching intently as they would a Netflix show. The wife of El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, Emma Coronel Aispuro, arrives at court in New York in January 2019 His beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, she said, ""looked bored most of the time"" - even when GuzmÃ¡n's former mistress testified. While Coronel remained placid, the trial's astonishing moments shocked others. One witness, for example, told the court GuzmÃ¡n buried a man alive. Another told of a rival narco chief who refused to shake GuzmÃ¡n's hand - and paid for it with his life. Court papers also accused him of drugging and raping girls as young as 13, calling them his ""vitamins"". The scale of his drug trafficking operation was laid bare, too. El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n and his defence attorneys are seen in court in New York in January 2017 Assistant US Attorney Adam Fels alleged that GuzmÃ¡n had sent the equivalent of more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the US in just four shipments. And to protect his businesses, a bribe of $100m (Â£77m) was paid to former President PeÃ±a Nieto when he took office in 2012, it was alleged in court. Mr PeÃ±a Nieto strenuously denies the allegation. When GuzmÃ¡n's guilty verdict was read aloud, his mouth was ""agape"" and he looked ""vaguely stunned"", the New York Times reported. In a trial that attracted podcasters, screenwriters and true-crime obsessives, some observers said the media attention trivialised the proceedings. The intention was quite the contrary, our correspondent said. The trial was meant to be a public spectacle to show what El Chapo and his henchmen had done and to send a warning to others, she said. The title of Mr Beith's book, The Last Narco, suggests GuzmÃ¡n is one of a dying breed of ultra-violent drug barons as bloodthirsty as they are shrewd. Yet, while GuzmÃ¡n is likely to die behind bars, Mexico's drug-smuggling problem is likely to outlive him. In his Rolling Stone interview, GuzmÃ¡n said it was false to assume drug trafficking would cease ""the day I don't exist"". For all his supposed vanity and self-confidence, not even GuzmÃ¡n can claim to be the last narco.

BBC asks White House for security review,"This video can not be played A Trump supporter shoves a BBC cameraman at the El Paso rally Donald Trump has condemned attacks on the media after an incident involving a BBC cameraman at the US president's rally in Texas on Monday. A White House statement did not refer to the specific incident. It said the president ""condemns all acts of violence against any individual or group of people - including members of the press"". The BBC's Ron Skeans was shoved and sworn at by a man in a Make America Great Again cap in El Paso. The BBC later asked the White House to review security for media attending President Trump's rallies. In a letter, the BBC said the press area was unsupervised, and no security had tried to intervene during the incident. The White House statement, from Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, added: ""We ask that anyone attending an event do so in a peaceful and respectful manner."" Mr Trump has been critical of media, which he has called the enemy of the people. After Monday's incident, Mr Trump's campaign team thanked law enforcement for ejecting the unidentified man. ""An individual involved in a physical altercation with a news cameraman was removed from last night's rally,"" said Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer for Trump for President Inc. ""We appreciate the swift action from venue security and law enforcement officers."" Why the attack on our cameraman was no surprise The man, who a Trump campaign official said appeared to be drunk, gave Mr Skeans a ""very hard shove"", according to the cameraman. This video can not be played President Trump told supporters in El Paso, ""we're building the wall anyway"" Mr Skeans said the man almost knocked him and his camera over twice before he was wrestled away by a blogger. President Trump saw the attack, checked they were well with a thumbs up and continued his speech after Mr Skeans returned the gesture. BBC Washington producer Eleanor Montague and Washington correspondent Gary O'Donoghue were sitting in front of the camera. Ms Montague said the protester had attacked other news crews but Mr Skeans ""got the brunt of it"". In the letter to Ms Sanders, the BBC's Americas Bureaux Editor Paul Danahar asked for a review of security arrangements for members of the press attending the president's rallies. Mr Danahar pointed out ""that access into the media area last night was unsupervised and that no member of law enforcement or security stopped the attacker entering, intervened when he began his attack or followed up on the incident with our colleagues afterwards"". The president went to El Paso, on the US border with Mexico, to campaign for a border wall, a divisive issue which caused the longest government shutdown in US history. Ms Montague said the president had spoken of ""fake news"" and how the media misrepresented him in the run up to the assault. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr O'Donoghue said it was ""an incredibly violent attack"". Why Trump attacks the media Are journalists increasingly under attack? Last August UN experts warned Mr Trump's attacks ""increase the risk of journalists being targeted with violence"", calling his rhetoric ""strategic"".

Terror attack insurance loophole shut,"Borough Market: Famous food traders were hit hard by the London Bridge attack in 2017 Firms hit by financial losses after a terror attack are to benefit from a legal loophole being shut. Businesses will now be able to get insurance even if they have not been damaged by a bomb. That means shops and businesses forcibly closed after an attack will be able to reclaim potentially big losses. John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the changes would now mean that businesses have ""peace of mind"". The cover comes from a government-guaranteed scheme that pays out to insurers - and therefore their customers - in the event of terrorism. The scheme, known as Pool Re, was created during the Northern Ireland Troubles to protect insurers from the risk of a catastrophic scale of terrorism-related claims that they ultimately could not meet. One month on from the London Bridge attack Bustling Borough Market remembers Manchester survivors still seeking psychological help Manchester attack: What have we learned? Pool Re's huge fund,externalis financed by insurance firms but it is also underpinned by the Treasury. That means member insurance companies can offer all businesses cover against terrorism. Since its birth, Pool Re has paid out more than Â£1.3bn in today's prices for losses suffered in 16 major terrorism incidents. But pay-outs have never covered losses suffered by shops and businesses that are indirectly caught up in an incident because they have been forced to close. Businesses surrounding the scene of the London Bridge attack in June 2017, including the iconic Borough Market, were closed for 11 days because they were inside a major police cordon. More than 100 merchants lost Â£1.5m as artisan traders were locked out of their premises. Food rotted and the popular restaurants surrounding the market had their shutters down at one of the busiest times of the year. Reopened: Borough has worked hard to promote itself after the loss of custom London's defiant market: How Borough Market got back to business Neil Coyle MP, whose constituency includes Borough Market, led the parliamentary campaign to extend Pool Re - and said the legal change would benefit businesses everywhere. ""It wasn't just the market that was affected - these are businesses that were also wholesalers supplying customers and restaurants. The losses were huge because they could not get into their own buildings. ""Only two and a half per cent of businesses have terrorism cover - so there needs to be a big campaign now to get them to take this seriously."" Similarly, traders in Salisbury were shut for weeks last year as police and scientists investigated the nerve agent attack. Police closed off part of Salisbury town centre after the Novichok attack in 2018 Business leaders lobbied ministers to change the law governing Pool Re to ensure the scheme could be extended to cover terrorism-related financial losses, whether or not a premises has been physically damaged. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Victims of the London Bridge attack That change became law on Tuesday when it received Royal Assent. John Glen said on Twitter that the government had responded to concerns raised by business. And Julian Enoizi, Pool Re's chief executive, urged businesses throughout the country to think hard about getting themselves covered. He said: ""We are already collaborating with business federations, local authorities, brokers and our member insurers, all of whom need to have open conversations with their customers about just how much may depend on having this cover if the worst should happen.""

French mayor issues ban on dog barking,"Dog owners in FeuquiÃ¨res face a â¬68 (Â£60) fine for any barking which ""disturbs the rest or relaxation of people."" The mayor of a town in northern France has issued a ban on excessive dog barking in a bid to curb canine noise pollution. From Monday, dog owners in FeuquiÃ¨res face a â¬68 (Â£60; $77) fine for ""prolonged or repeated barking"". Mayor Jean-Pierre Estienne says the ban is in response to dogs ""barking day and night"" and creating ""an unbearable situation"" in the village. The decree has been criticised by animal rights activists. ""The aim is not to ban dogs and we won't be fining people for the slightest hint of a yap,"" Mr Estiennetold French newspaper Le Parisien (in French),external. ""The town has nothing against dogs but when you decide to have them, you educate them."" Passed by the local council earlier this month, the decree forbids dogs from being left in enclosed areas without owners being nearby to stop ""prolonged or repeated barking"". Yappy dogs must also be kept inside if their behaviour ""disturbs the rest or relaxation"" of FeuquiÃ¨res' 1,400 residents. Offenders (or more specifically, their owners) will receive a fine for each complaint made against them. Barking is a common form of communication which dogs use to express their feelings and gain the attention of those nearby. The decree follows a petition by villagers against one particular resident. ""She has several dogs, some large,"" said Mr Estienne. ""We have made several attempts to establish a dialogue with her, to no avail."" ""If I took this decision, it is because we found no other way out. I couldn't sit idly by,"" he said. The move has been condemned as ""completely barking"" by StÃ©phane Lamart, president of the Association for the Defence of Animal Rights. ""You may as well stop church bells ringing on Sunday morning,"" Mr Lamarttold Le Monde newspaper (in French),external. ""If dogs have mouths, it's so they can bark."" Mr Lamart said he intended to launch an appeal with the local court. ""I've never seen a dog bark from morning to evening,"" he said. This is not the first time French authorities have tried to dampen doggy decibels. In 2012, Sainte-Foy-la-Grande in southwest France passed a ban on any excessive dog barking that disturbed ""public order"". Barking is a regular form of communication for most dog breeds, but loud and regular yapping is a common complaint by owners and their neighbours. Whilst noise levels vary, some barks can bite 100 dB - louder than factory machinery. An Australian golden retriever named Charlie holds the world record for the loudest bark, measuring 113.1 dB. Canine companions bark for many reasons: to get attention, to fend off perceived danger or express anxiety, to name a few. Jenna Kiddie, Canine Behaviour Manager at charity Dogs Trust, warns against using anti-bark collars and other aversive training methods. ""It is vital to investigate why and address the underlying motivation rather than just address the behaviour itself,"" says Ms Kiddie. ""Although it can be very frustrating, especially if you have neighbours to consider, telling your dog off might make them more anxious or confused, and could make the situation worse.""

World Cup winner Banks dies aged 81,"This video can not be played Watch: Banks makes wonder save to deny Pele at 1970 World Cup England's 1966 World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks has died aged 81. Regarded as one of the game's greatest in his position, Banks was named Fifa goalkeeper of the year six times and earned 73 caps for England. He is perhaps best known for his wonder save from Pele during the1970 World Cupagainst Brazil. Born in Sheffield, he won the League Cup with Stoke and Leicester, before retiring in 1973. ""It is with great sadness that we announce that Gordon passed away peacefully overnight,"" his family said. ""We are devastated to lose him but we have so many happy memories and could not have been more proud of him."" Obituary: '66 legend who denied Pele with wonder save four years later Reaction and tributes to Gordon Banks BBC Sounds replay: Gordon Banks' save From hauling coal to World Cup winner - Banks in his own words Sir Bobby Charlton, who was part of the team alongside Banks that won the World Cup in 1966, said: ""Gordon was a fantastic goalkeeper, without doubt one of the best England has ever had. ""I was proud to call him a team-mate. Obviously we shared that great day in 1966 but it was more than that. ""Even though I was on the pitch and have seen it many times since, I still don't know how he saved that header from Pele."" Banks is the fourth player of the England team that started the 1966 World Cup final to have died, after Bobby Moore, Ray Wilson and Alan Ball. Another of that XI, Sir Geoff Hurst, tweeted: ""One of the very greatest. Thinking especially of Ursula, Julia, Wendy and Robert. Sad for football, Stoke City and for England fans."" Stoke chairman Peter Coates said Banks, who made almost 200 appearances for the club, had been ""poorly for a number of weeks"". He told Radio 5 live: ""He made his home in Stoke, and was very much part of the fabric of the club. You don't get too many like him, and he was immensely modest for all his talent. ""He was England's greatest goalkeeper when they had their finest hour."" England and Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling was among the first to pay tribute, tweeting: ""Of course there was that save, but it's so much more we are mourning today. RIP Gordon Banks. England legend, your legacy will live on.""

""Jairzinho was flying down the wing, and he clips the ball to the far post, and Pele - who climbed to such a height better than anybody else - headed the ball and Gordon went from one post to another and he flicks the ball with his fingertips and it just goes over the crossbar,"" he said. ""I patted him on his head, and I said 'why didn't you catch it?' and the abuse that came back was unbelievable. ""He was the best at that time. We had some great goalkeepers in those days, and the only person I can think came near was Pat Jennings. ""He was an absolutely marvellous goalkeeper.

""Gordon spoke to the room about that incredible save from Pele and moments like that from his remarkable World Cup-winning career will continue to linger long in the memory.

He played in every game of the 1966 World Cup campaign, culminating in the 4-2 victory over West Germany in the final at Wembley. In eight years at Leicester, he was runner-up in two FA Cup finals and won the League Cup in 1964, before joining Stoke in 1967.

An end to months of indecision?,"Look away now if you are of a nervous disposition. This week's Brexit votes may not come to much. The prime minister is essentially asking for more time to get something to show for her promise of changes to the controversial backstop. That might mean that she's back before the end of this month with something concrete to vote on. Or it may well not. I know that sounds nebulous, a word you might choose to use. But there's a building impression in Westminster, and in Brussels, that there simply won't be a resolution to these months of indecision until weeks before, maybe even days before we are due to leave (that's why some cabinet ministers believe that, even though it's not desirable, the government may end up asking to extend the whole process as we discussed here before). May to give Brexit update on Tuesday May to EU: Back changes to Brexit deal EU's Verhofstadt welcomes Corbyn's letter What's behind Corbyn's letter to May? It was hard to find anyone in Brussels last week who believed that they would offer any crumbs to the prime minister until the final, final moment when what was described to me as a ""facesaver"", will indeed be found. And at the start of this Westminster week, it's hard to find anyone in Westminster who is confident that there will be any ending to the drama much before the end of March. There is a summit with EU leaders where the prime minister will gather with her counterparts seven days before the departure date of 29 March. And while it seems like the kind of kamikaze politics the UK doesn't tend to do, traditionally at least, there is growing expectation, horrific to some, exciting to others, that the prime minister may well not come back with her final deal that she wants them to vote on until after that. As one senior MP suggested today, ""imagine the mood in the house"" that night. Cynics would suggest that has for months now been Theresa May's dastardly plan - run the clock as low as she can - and allow the pressure of time to build and build, until it's unbearable. MPs will almost vote, so the theory goes, for anything then, because they can't stand the prospect of the turmoil of leaving without a formal deal done. And shortly before, the government will have eked out some new legal verbiage from the EU that gives an impression of a time limit, that the DUP and the Eurosceptics will be challenged to dispute. Having watched every twist of this story, I'm not so sure this is a real plan that's long in the making. It seems the accident of where things are now, rather than the design of where Number 10 might have hoped to be. If Number 10 had been able to conclude all of this already, it seems to me they would have done so, eagerly. Some MPs also report a growing mood among their constituents just to get on with it, even if that means leaving without a deal. But the politics, or as their many critics would have it, Number 10's mishandling of the politics, have made getting things sorted at a much earlier date just impossible. And now there is building expectation that the power of the clock is the strongest muscle that Number 10 has to flex. That's why what happens in the Commons in the next couple of weeks, that could change that timetable matters so much. We are still on the same merry-go-round, we may be going faster and faster, but it's not completely possible to tell when the music will actually stop.

Disturbing allegations in 'El Chapo' trial,"The trial of accused druglord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is nearing its end after eight weeks of evidence from the prosecution The trial of JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n has provided shocking revelations about the Mexican drug lord's life. Below are some of the most disturbing testimonies by witnesses in the high-profile trial in New York as well as some allegations which are plain bizarre. A trusted hitman for El Chapo kept a ""murder room"" in his mansion on the US border, which featured a drain on the floor to more easily clean up after slayings. Edgar Galvan testified in January that Antonio ""Jaguar"" Marrufo had a room with white tiles that was sound-proofed ""so no noise comes out"". ""In that house, no-one comes out,"" Galvan told jurors. Galvan said his role in the organisation was to smuggle weapons into the US, so that Marrufo could use them to ""clear"" the region of rivals. At the time, he was living in El Paso, Texas, while Marrufo was living in Ciudad Juarez, just across the US-Mexico border. But both men are now in jail on firearms and gun charges. Documents unsealed just two days before jury deliberations offered disturbing new accusations against El Chapo from Alex Cifuentes, a Colombian drug lord who has described himself as El Chapo's ""right-hand man"". Cifuentes, who prosecutors say spent two years hiding from authorities with El Chapo in the Mexican mountains, claims that El Chapo would drug and rape girls as young as 13 years old,according to the New York Times,external. A woman named Comadre Maria would routinely send El Chapo photographs of young girls that he and his associates could pick from. This same woman was involved as an intermediary for El Chapo's dealings with Mexico's president, Cifuentes alleged during the trial. For $5,000 (Â£3,800), Cifuentes claims Comadre Maria would send the selected girls up to Mr Guzman's mountain camps, where they would be drugged with ""a powdery substance"" and raped. The documents allege that El Chapo called the youngest girls ""his vitamins"" and said raping them gave him ""life"". Mr Guzman's lawyer said his client denies these allegations and added that the claims had been ""too prejudicial and unreliable to be admitted at trial"". El Chapo's wife, Emma Coronel, sat quietly through a session where the FBI shared her husband's texts to his lovers A bombshell allegation came during Cifunetes' in-court testimony. Cifuentes claims former Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, who served from 2012-18, accepted a $100m (Â£77m) bribe from El Chapo. He alleges Mr Pena Nieto contacted El Chapo after taking office in 2012, asking for $250m in return for ending a manhunt for the drug cartel kingpin. El Chapo instead offered him $100m, which the new president allegedly accepted. Mr Pena Nieto has not publicly commented on the allegations. ""El Chapo"" used his slew of mistresses to help further his narcotics operation - and his text history proves it, the FBI alleges. Thanks to the Flexi-spy software GuzmÃ¡n used to spy on his wife, Emma Coronel, and the women with whom he had affairs, the FBI was able to present his texts in court. GuzmÃ¡n and Ms Coronel fawned over their daughters in many texts, as parents do, but some had a distinctly ""El Chapo"" sensibility. In one sent on the twins' six-month birthday,the New York Daily News reported,external, he said: ""Our [daughter] is fearless, I'm going to give her an AK-47 so she can hang with me."" Another damaging series of texts relayed how El Chapo fled a villa during a raid by US and Mexican officials. ""I had to run out at three in the afternoon,"" GuzmÃ¡n told his wife. ""I saw them pounding on the door next door, but I was able to jump out."" The life of 'El Chapo' Who is 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n? He then reportedly asked her to bring him new clothes, shoes and black moustache dye. GuzmÃ¡n tracked around 50 people through phones and computers, according to the drug lord's ex-techie, Cristian Rodriguez. Mr Rodriguez told the court ""El Chapo"" frequently turned on his lovers' microphones after ending calls with them ""to see what they would say about him"", the Daily News reported. One of those lovers was Agustina Cabanillas Acosta, who allegedly helped ""El Chapo"" make deals across the region. In between sweet nothings, they discussed drug shipments and ""non-stop"" sales. The alleged kingpin also reportedly paid for Ms Acosta's liposuction. Ms Acosta, meanwhile, was well aware of her lover's snooping -""I'm way smarter than him,"" she reportedly texted her friends,external. Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez Lopez, girlfriend (2nd left) of accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman (2nd right), testifies as his wife Emma Coronel (right) looks on In the most gruesome testimony to date, witness Isaias Valdez Rios described seeing ""El Chapo"" brutally beat at least three men before shooting them. In one incident, Mr Valdez Rios said two people originally from Sinaloa who had joined the rival Los Zetas cartel were deemed traitors and rounded up by GuzmÃ¡n's hitmen. For more than three hours the drug lord brutally beat them, GuzmÃ¡n's former bodyguard said. ""They were completely like rag dolls - their bones were totally broken. They could not move. And Joaquin was still hitting them with the branch and his weapon too,"" Mr Valdez Rios said. The two men were later driven to an area where they could see a large bonfire. There, the jury was told, ""El Chapo"" cursed each one before shooting them in the head with his rifle. The leader of the Sinaloa cartel ordered that they be thrown in the bonfire, telling his men that he did not want any bones to remain, Mr Valdez Rios said. He said the third man murdered by ""El Chapo"" was a member of the rival Arellano Felix cartel. ""He had burns made with an iron on his back, his shirt was stuck to his skin. He had burns made with a car lighter all over his body. His feet were burned,"" Mr Valdez Rios told the court. The man was then locked in a wooden structure for days. Then he was brought blindfolded to a graveyard, his hands and legs bound. ""El Chapo"" started to interrogate him, and while he was responding, shot him with his handgun. The man was still gasping for air - but he was dumped in a hole and buried alive, Mr Valdez Rios said. The secrets of the drug lord's daring escape from a Mexican maximum security prison in 2015 were revealed by a former cartel associate. Testifying in court, Damaso Lopez said his boss' wife and sons had been involved from the start to get El Chapo out of Altiplano prison. He mentioned secret meetings in 2014, where Emma Coronel delivered detailed instructions from her husband to the plotters. ""A tunnel had to be built and they [plotters] should start to work,"" Ms Coronel said. ""El Chapo"" used a specially adapted motorcycle to ride through the tunnel The kingpin's sons later bought a property near the prison, and the digging started. A GPS watch was smuggled into the prison, giving the plotters exact co-ordinates where the drug lord's prison cell was. The one-mile (1.6km) tunnel took months to complete, and ""El Chapo"" had complained that digging was too loud and he could hear the ""noise"" from his cell, Mr Lopez said. He added that the concrete below his boss' cell ""had been very difficult to break through"". Despite all the problems, ""El Chapo"" escaped in July 2015, riding on a specially adapted small motorcycle through the tunnel. Yet another mistress, Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez Lopez, revealed to the court details of the drug lord's 2014 escape from Mexican marines. When the marines burst into his safehouse, Ms Lopez said the alleged drug lord took off running - stark naked. They used an escape tunnel under a bathtub to flee, trudging through mud for an hour before surfacing,according to the New York Post,external. As the mistress began to cry while testifying, the drug lord's wife, Ms Coronel, reportedly cackled in the gallery. Just days after his affair with Ms Lopez, ""El Chapo"" would be captured by authorities - once again naked - in bed with Ms Coronel. She and her husband were both in matching burgundy-coloured jackets during Ms Lopez's testimony, in an attempt to show their solidarity, reports the BBC's Tara McKelvey from court. The drug lord's reputed extravagance extended even to his extensive collection of weaponry, the trial has heard. Among his prized possessions were a diamond-encrusted, monogrammed pistol and a gold-plated AK-47. A diamond-encrusted pistol that allegedly belonged to Mr GuzmÃ¡n Much of the evidence against the suspected narco chief has come from the prosecution's star witness, JesÃºs Zambada. Mr Zambada testified that the alleged drug kingpin had the brother of another cartel leader killed because he did not shake GuzmÃ¡n's hand. Rodolfo Fuentes had met GuzmÃ¡n to make peace in a cartel and gang war, the court heard. ""When [Rodolfo] left, Chapo gave him his hand and said, 'See you later, friend,' and Rodolfo just left him standing there with his hand extended,"" Mr Zambada said. Mr Fuentes and his wife were shot and killed outside a cinema soon afterwards. Mexico president rejects 'El Chapo' claims 'El Chapo' fan rejected from his jury Former Sinaloa lieutenant Miguel Angel Martinez also testified for the government, telling the jury he once asked ""El Chapo"" why he killed people. ""And he answered me: 'Either your mom's going to cry or their mom's going to cry.'"" A former cartel leader told the court how ""El Chapo"" oncehad his own cousin killed,externalafter the man lied about being out of town. Juan Guzman had told the drug boss he would be travelling, only to be spotted at a park in the city. ""My compadre became angry, because he had lied to him,"" ex-cartel capo Damaso Lopez Nunez said. To make an example out of Juan, ""El Chapo"" allegedly ordered him to be interrogated and assassinated. Juan's secretary, who was with him at the time, was also killed. The drug boss' mistress Ms Lopez later told the court she remembered being with him when the news of Juan's death arrived. ""He said from that point on, whoever betrayed him, they would die,"" Ms Lopez said.  ""Whether they were family or women, they were going to die."" Assistant US Attorney Adam Fels said in his opening argument that ""El Chapo"" had sent ""more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the United States"" - in just four of his shipments. That amounts to over 328 million lines of cocaine, said the prosecutor. Mr Zambada said that once, in 1994, GuzmÃ¡n gave the order to sink a boat carrying 20 tonnes of cocaine to evade authorities. Drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n is escorted into a helicopter at Mexico City""s airport following his recapture during an intense military operation in Los Mochis, in Sinaloa State The court also heard that GuzmÃ¡n once used a bazooka for target practice - to relax on a family holiday. Mr Zambada said ""El Chapo"" took the anti-tank rocket launcher with him on a trip with relatives in 2005. Hedecided to ""test out"" the weapon,externalafter the group had finished target practice with assault rifles, according to the witness. Some of the biggest news from testimony was how the Sinaloa cartel allegedly paid off a host of top Mexican officials to ensure their drug business ran smoothly. Mr Zambada said the traffickers had $50m (Â£39m) in protection money for former Mexican Secretary of Public Security GarcÃ­a Luna, so that corrupt officers would be appointed to head police operations. Mr Zambada said he gave the money to Mr Luna in briefcases full of cash. Mr Luna has denied the allegations. When former Mexico City Mayor Gabriel Regino was in line to become the next secretary of security, Mr Zambada says the cartel bribed him, too. Mr Regino, who is now a professor, has also denied the claims. ""El Chapo"" (right) is the highest-ranking alleged drug lord to face trial in the US so far A 6in (15cm) figurine of a folk hero dubbed the narco-saint has been spotted on a shelf in a conference room used by the defendant's lawyers at the court,the New York Post reported,external. The statue of JesÃºs Malverde,external, which has him seated on a purple throne with bags of cash, appeared on Wednesday, one of GuzmÃ¡n's lawyers told the newspaper. JesÃºs Malverde has been celebrated as a Robin Hood-type hero who, legend says, stole from the rich and gave to the poor in the early 1900s. Mr Martinez told the court GuzmÃ¡n was so wealthy, he had a private zoo on top of his numerous properties - including a $10m (Â£8) beach house as well as a yacht he named after himself (""Chapito""). Built in the early '90s, El Chapo's zoo reportedly had lions, tigers, and crocodiles, as well as a little train to ferry guests through it. The property also had a house, pool and tennis courts nearby, Mr Martinez said.

A guide to Mexico's cartels,"Mexico's brutal drug war claims thousands of lives every year, as powerful trafficking groups battle it out for territory and influence. These cartels control vast areas of the country and are also responsible for political corruption, assassinations and kidnappings. But which groups are the most powerful? Territory:Much of the north-west. The US government has described the Sinaloa Cartel as one of the largest drug-trafficking organisations in the world. Founded in the late 1980s, it was for many years headed by the notorious drug lord JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n. ""El Chapo"" - or ""Shorty"" - was once ranked as one of the world's richest men. His life and vast drug-trafficking empire have been the subject of numerous books and TV series. Under his leadership, the cartel garnered a fierce reputation for violence and outfought several rival groups. Mexican cartels often clash with one another, but it's also worth noting that they can form strategic alliances as well. The Sinaloa became the biggest supplier of illegal drugs to the US during GuzmÃ¡n's long reign as leader, officials say. ""El Chapo"" was arrested in 2014 and is now serving a life sentence in prison The cartel kidnapped, tortured and slaughtered members of rival criminal gangs. It also had access to a huge arsenal of weapons, including a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and GuzmÃ¡n's own gold plated AK-47. But in July 2019, the drug lord was sentenced to life in prison following one of the most high-profile trials in recent US history. Prosecutors said GuzmÃ¡n had trafficked cocaine, heroin and marijuana, and kept a network of dealers, kidnappers and assassins on his payroll. His jailing led to an increase of violence in the region as other groups sought to take advantage. Despite this, the Sinaloa Cartel remains hugely powerful. It still dominates north-west Mexico and is reported to have a presence in cities ranging from Buenos Aires to New York. It also continues to make billions of dollars from trafficking illicit narcotics to the US, Europe and Asia, experts say. With its long-time leader now behind bars, the cartel is said to be partially controlled by Mr GuzmÃ¡n's son, Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n Lopez. This video can not be played Watch clashes between Mexico's security forces and drug cartel members When the younger GuzmÃ¡n was arrested by the security forces in October 2019, Sinaloa Cartel gunmen were quick to demonstrate the group's serious military might. They fought street battles with the army in broad daylight, set fire to vehicles, and even staged a prison break before their leader was eventually freed. It was a sign the group remains an immensely powerful force. Territory:The west, mainly the Tierra Caliente region. Formed in about 2010, the Jalisco cartel is the strongest and most aggressive competitor to the Sinaloa. The group has expanded rapidly across Mexico and is now one of the country's most dominant organised crime groups. Its assets are thought to be worth more than $20bn (Â£15.5bn). The cartel is led by Ruben Oseguera, known as ""El Mencho"", a former police officer who is Mexico's most wanted man. The bounty for his capture? A cool $10m. The US government is offering a $10m reward for the capture of the Jalisco cartel's leader The Jalisco cartel is one of the main distributors of synthetic drugs on the continent, according to the US government. It is a key player in the illegal amphetamine market in the US and Europe and is also thought to have links to the drug market in Asia. It has grown much more powerful in recent years and its rise has been fuelled by its use of extreme violence. ""It remains the most aggressive cartel in Mexico,"" according to the US-based geopolitical analysis firm Stratfor. ""Its efforts to expand its area of control are largely responsible for the persistent wave of violence racking Tijuana, Juarez, Guanajuato and Mexico City."" Indeed, the cartel has gained notoriety for a series of attacks on security forces and public officials. It has downed an army helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade, killed dozens of state officials, and has even been known to hang the bodies of its victims from bridges to intimidate its rivals. And, according to experts in the region, it is set to expand further. Territory:The north-east, centred around the border state of Tamaulipas. This is one of Mexico's oldest criminal groups and its roots can be traced back to the 1980s. It became known around this time for trafficking cocaine and marijuana into the US. It is also thought to have smuggled heroin and amphetamines, and it worked closely with cartels in Colombia. By the 1990s, the Gulf Cartel's drug trafficking operation was reportedly bringing in billions of dollars every year. It maintained this network by engaging in political corruption and bribery as a means to keep officials on side. This video can not be played Mexico's drug war: Has it turned the tide? The cartel was initially led by Juan GarcÃ­a Abrego, the first Mexican drug lord to be included in the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured in 1996 and jailed for life in the US. His heir, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, built up the cartel's military wing. He recruited a number of corrupt special forces soldiers and pushed an even more violent approach. Those soldiers would eventually go rogue and form a rival cartel of their own (more on this later). Cardenas was arrested in 2003 and is currently serving 25 years in jail in the US. His brother and top leader of the cartel, Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, was killed in a shootout with Mexican troops in 2010. The cartel then split into multiple factions with different leaders. It has been weakened as a result, and is engaged in a vicious turf war with the... Territory:Also the north-east. This group was founded by corrupt members of an elite unit of Mexico's special forces. More than 30 ex-soldiers were hired by the leader of the Gulf Cartel in the 1990s but, as mentioned above, they broke away and formed their own operation in 2010. The two cartels then clashed violently, particularly in Mexico's north-east. The Zetas became particularly well-known for their brutality, often torturing and decapitating their victims. By 2012, the Zetas had reached the peak of their powers. The were named as the country's biggest drug gang, overtaking their bitter rivals the Sinaloa, and were thought to operate in more than half of the Mexican states. Zetas leader Omar Trevino Morales was captured in 2015 They moved beyond drugs and turned their hand to any crime that brought them money, from cigarette smuggling to human trafficking. But, later in 2012, one of their leaders was killed in a shootout with the Mexican Navy. His replacement, Miguel Ãngel TreviÃ±o Morales, was captured. His younger brother, Omar TreviÃ±o Morales, took over but was also caught in 2015. This marked the beginning of the cartel's decline. A lack of leadership caused the Zetas to splinter and allowed rival groups to assert dominance, according to analysis from Insight Crime, which monitors organised crime in the Americas. The Zetas lost ground as others, notably the Jalisco cartel, expanded to take their east coast territory. Internal divisions have also served to weaken the group, but it remains a dangerous force.

Who is 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n?,"""Even as a little child,"" GuzmÃ¡n's mother said, ""he had ambitions"" Caked in filth, the world's most powerful drug baron hauled himself from a manhole. For JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n, whose feats of escapology were matched only by his drug-smuggling acumen, it was a trademark yet ultimately futile manoeuvre. The 17 Mexican marines raiding his ranch nearby would catch him soon enough. Six months earlier, he had humiliated Mexican authorities by fleeing Mexico's most secure prison, his second jailbreak in two decades. This time he would not slip through their fingers, although those who caught him were left in no doubt how angry he was to have been arrested. ""You are all going to die,"" he warned police in the hours after his capture in Los Mochis, north-west Mexico, on 8 January 2016. Three years on,GuzmÃ¡n has been handed a life sentence, plus 30 years,after being found guilty of international drug smuggling in a lurid three-month trial that exposed his criminal empire. At his sentencing in New York, GuzmÃ¡n said he had received an unfair trial and his treatment in solitary confinement was tantamount to torture. ""We're never going to see his like again,"" Douglas Century, the author of the book Hunting El Chapo, told the BBC. GuzmÃ¡n was the oldest of seven children born into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico. His parents - Emilio GuzmÃ¡n Bustillos and MarÃ­a Consuelo Loera PÃ©rez - earned their living from farming. His father was officially a cattle rancher but is believed to have been an opium poppy farmer, Malcolm Beith writes in his book, The Last Narco. GuzmÃ¡n's enterprising spirit was apparent from a young age. He would support his family by selling oranges to peasant farmers for a few pesos. His penchant for the spoils of wealth didn't go unnoticed, either. In a Vice News podcast, GuzmÃ¡n's younger sister Bernarda said he would wear fake gold jewellery when visiting family members. ""Even as a little child, he had ambitions,"" his mother told filmmakers in 2014. She recalled he had ""a lot of paper money"" which he would count and recount. His first foray into organised crime came at the age of 15, when he cultivated his own marijuana plantation with his cousins. Then, he adopted the nickname ""El Chapo"" - Mexican slang for ""Shorty"". But his ambitions belied his diminutive stature (he is only 5ft 6ins, or 1.64m). In his late teens, GuzmÃ¡n left La Tuna to seek his fortune in drug smuggling. ""He always fought for a better life,"" his mother said. GuzmÃ¡n's mother arrives at the US Embassy in Mexico City in June 2019 That better life would come at a cost, paid for by illegal drugs and years of bloodshed. From his beginnings as a hitman, GuzmÃ¡n's rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld was swift. Former cartel kingpin HÃ©ctor ""El GÃ¼ero"" Palma gave GuzmÃ¡n his first break in Guadalajara in the late 1970s, when he oversaw a shipment of drugs from the Sierra Madre mountains. GuzmÃ¡n was ambitious and eager to increase the quantities of drugs being transported, according to Mr Beith's book, The Last Narco. He was also ""no-nonsense"" and would execute employees himself if deliveries were late, Mr Beith said. A guide to Mexico's drug cartels GuzmÃ¡n's trial: From shocking to bizarre GuzmÃ¡n's reputation for ruthless efficiency was duly noted. In the 1980s he was introduced to Miguel Ãngel FÃ©lix Gallardo - known as the Godfather of the Guadalajara cartel - who put him in charge of handling logistics. When FÃ©lix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, his cartel's drug trafficking territories were divided among different factions, later known as The Federation. GuzmÃ¡n was a beneficiary, setting up his own Sinaloa cartel with other traffickers in north-west Mexico. In the 1990s, he honed his operation, pioneering the use of sophisticated underground tunnels to move drugs across the border. ""He was the go-to guy,"" David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, told the BBC. ""When the United States started shutting down ports of entry in the Atlantic and Pacific in the 1990s, drugs had to go through Mexico. And if it had to go through Mexico, it had to go through El Chapo."" This video can not be played A former DEA agent describes the moment he brought down El Chapo He invested his proceeds wisely, not only expanding his enterprise, but building infrastructure that benefited locals in Sinaloa too. This cemented his popularity. ""You are Santa Claus. And everybody likes Santa Claus,"" Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico's former ambassador in Washington, told the New Yorker in 2014. Over time, GuzmÃ¡n's cartel became one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US and in 2009, he entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (Â£709m). As his wealth and empire grew, so too did scrutiny from law enforcement. ""The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been after him for decades,"" Mr Weinstein said. In 1993, a Roman Catholic cardinal was shot dead in a turf war with rival drug smugglers. GuzmÃ¡n was among those blamed and a bounty was placed on his head by the Mexican government. His moustachioed face, previously unknown to the public, started appearing in newspapers and on TV screens. Within weeks, he was arrested in Guatemala and he was later sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, drug trafficking and bribery. A prison psychological profile described him as ""egocentric, narcissistic, shrewd, persistent, tenacious, meticulous, discriminating, and secretive"", according to the New Yorker. In prison, he enjoyed a life of luxury, smuggling in lovers, prostitutes and Viagra, according to reports in Mexico. Mexican Navy soldiers escort El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n in February 2014 Eight years behind bars was enough for GuzmÃ¡n. In January 2001, he broke out of a top-security jail, Puente Grande. He did so, as the myth goes, in a laundry cart. What's more likely, multiple journalists and authors argue, is that he simply walked out of the door with the help of corrupt guards. GuzmÃ¡n controlled the prison to such an extent he escaped in police uniform, Mexican journalist Anabel HernÃ¡ndez wrote in her book, Narcoland. GuzmÃ¡n would spend the next decade evading authorities and consolidating his power as Mexico's pre-eminent drug smuggler. In that period, he always seemed to be one step ahead of would-be captors and rival cartels. ""He's a micro-manager,"" said Mr Century, who co-authored his book with Andrew Hogan, the undercover DEA agent who caught GuzmÃ¡n in 2014. ""In the text messages we have, he's in the weeds of every single minor facet of his drug operation."" Sex was his other preoccupation, Mr Century said. ""He had more mistresses than you can probably fathom. This was his existence: having sex with strange women and micro-managing every detail of his operation."" After 13 years on the run, GuzmÃ¡n was captured by Mexican marines called in by Mr Hogan in February 2014. GuzmÃ¡n's second prison break, in July 2015, was arguably even more fantastical than the first. This time, his accomplices used GPS to burrow a 1.5km (one mile) tunnel that led directly underneath his cell in Altiplano prison in central Mexico. This video can not be played Guzman escaped through a tunnel which opened under the shower in his cell The escape was elaborate and carefully planned. The tunnel had ventilation, lighting and stairs and the exit was hidden by a construction site. Mexican TV stations later aired footage that showed that guards failed to act when loud hammering was heard from inside GuzmÃ¡n's cell. GuzmÃ¡n had embarrassed Mexico's government for the second time, leaving then-President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto ""deeply troubled"" and ""outraged"". His freedom, however, was short-lived. In January 2016, GuzmÃ¡n was tracked down to a house in an affluent part of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Five of GuzmÃ¡n's guards were killed in the raid by Mexican marines and he managed to flee out of a manhole, but was caught in a car while leaving town. One year later, he was extradited to the US. This motorcycle, adapted to run along a track, was used by GuzmÃ¡n to move through the tunnel His Achilles' heel, Mr Century told the BBC, was his narcissism. He was reaching out to actors and directors to commission screenplays about his life, Mr Century said. His communication with actors and producers gifted Mexico's attorney general a new line of investigation. ""When he escaped from prison in 2015, he probably could have run away to the mountains and just lived,"" Mr Century said. Instead, GuzmÃ¡n made the unprecedented move of granting an exclusive interview to Hollywood actor Sean Penn in October 2015. It was a decision that may have cost him his freedom. ""I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats,"" he said in the interview published in Rolling Stone magazine. After his capture it was speculated - though never formally confirmed - that Mexican authorities found GuzmÃ¡n by tracking Penn. ""He contacted actresses and producers, which was part of one line of investigation,"" said Mexico's attorney general, Arely GÃ³mez. Did this meeting with Sean Penn bring about El Chapo's downfall? Facing a life sentence at a ""supermax"" prison in the US, GuzmÃ¡n's fleet is of no use to him now. Over his 30-year criminal career, he is believed to have earned more than $14bn (Â£11bn) in cash proceeds from narcotics sales, the US Department of Justice said. So far, the value of GuzmÃ¡n's assets has proven difficult to verify. Forbes even removed him from its billionaire rankings over verification concerns. The $14bn figure is too high, Bruce Bagley, a Mexican drug cartel expert, argued. He told Forbes that most Mexican drug lords plough their revenues into ""operations and protection"", estimating that ""El Chapo probably makes well below a billion per year"". Mr Weinstein said the $14bn figure was not unrealistic, but doubted the full amount would be recovered. El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n arrived in New York under heavy escort in 2017 Some of his assets were mentioned during his 11-week trial in New York. A former cartel member told the court GuzmÃ¡n bought homes in every state in Mexico. Miguel Angel Martinez said GuzmÃ¡n was so wealthy, he had a private zoo, a $10m beach house and yacht he named after himself (""Chapito""), the court heard. The most jaw-dropping revelations, however, were not about his wealth. BBC reporter Tara McKelvey covered the trial, which started in November 2018. She said the courtroom ""looked like a real-life movie"", the jurors watching intently as they would a Netflix show. The wife of El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, Emma Coronel Aispuro, arrives at court in New York in January 2019 His beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, she said, ""looked bored most of the time"" - even when GuzmÃ¡n's former mistress testified. While Coronel remained placid, the trial's astonishing moments shocked others. One witness, for example, told the court GuzmÃ¡n buried a man alive. Another told of a rival narco chief who refused to shake GuzmÃ¡n's hand - and paid for it with his life. Court papers also accused him of drugging and raping girls as young as 13, calling them his ""vitamins"". The scale of his drug trafficking operation was laid bare, too. El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n and his defence attorneys are seen in court in New York in January 2017 Assistant US Attorney Adam Fels alleged that GuzmÃ¡n had sent the equivalent of more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the US in just four shipments. And to protect his businesses, a bribe of $100m (Â£77m) was paid to former President PeÃ±a Nieto when he took office in 2012, it was alleged in court. Mr PeÃ±a Nieto strenuously denies the allegation. When GuzmÃ¡n's guilty verdict was read aloud, his mouth was ""agape"" and he looked ""vaguely stunned"", the New York Times reported. In a trial that attracted podcasters, screenwriters and true-crime obsessives, some observers said the media attention trivialised the proceedings. The intention was quite the contrary, our correspondent said. The trial was meant to be a public spectacle to show what El Chapo and his henchmen had done and to send a warning to others, she said. The title of Mr Beith's book, The Last Narco, suggests GuzmÃ¡n is one of a dying breed of ultra-violent drug barons as bloodthirsty as they are shrewd. Yet, while GuzmÃ¡n is likely to die behind bars, Mexico's drug-smuggling problem is likely to outlive him. In his Rolling Stone interview, GuzmÃ¡n said it was false to assume drug trafficking would cease ""the day I don't exist"". For all his supposed vanity and self-confidence, not even GuzmÃ¡n can claim to be the last narco.

Carney warns of no-deal 'economic shock',"This video can not be played Mark Carney says no-deal Brexit would be economic shock Bank of England governor Mark Carney has urged MPs to solve the Brexit impasse in a speech warning of growing threats to the global economy. He said a no-deal Brexit would create an ""economic shock"" at a time when China's economy is slowing and trade tensions are rising. ""It is in the interests of everyone, arguably everywhere"" that a Brexit solution is found, he said. The Bank has already cut its UK growth forecasts, partly due to Brexit issues. In a speech at the Barbican, in London, Mr Carney said trade tensions and Brexit are ""manifestations of fundamental pressures to reorder globalisation"", and that quitting the bloc could undermine global expansion. ""It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy. ""At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all."" Brexit 'deal dividend' not credible, MPs say UK economic growth slowest since 2012 Brexit has created a ""high level of uncertainty"", he said, and ""companies are holding back on making big decisions"". As such, he said it was vital for the UK economy to secure a good withdrawal deal and a smooth transition. ""A no-deal would be an economic shock for this country, and this would send a signal globally about re-founding globalisation. That would be unfortunate,"" he said. At a global level, Mr Carney said that growth had been slowing in ""all regions"" since 2016 after peaking at 4%. He said that growth was likely to stabilise, but warned that a further slowdown in China, rising trade tensions and complacency could get in the way. ""The Bank of England estimates that a 3% drop in Chinese GDP would knock 1% off global activity, including half a per cent off each of UK, US and euro area GDP,"" he said. He added that a ""larger increase in tariffs of 10 percentage points between the US and all of its trading partners could take 2.5% per cent off US output and 1% off global output."" The governor urged policymakers everywhere to address economic risks rather than ignore them. ""Although the economic and financial imbalances in the global economy do not yet appear to contain the seeds of their own demise, global momentum is softening,"" he said.

Trump supporter attacks BBC cameraman,"This video can not be played A Trump supporter shoves a BBC cameraman at the El Paso rally A supporter of US President Donald Trump has attacked a BBC cameraman at a campaign rally in El Paso, Texas. Sporting a Make America Great Again cap, the man shoved and swore at the BBC's Ron Skeans and other news crews before being pulled away. Mr Skeans said the ""very hard shove"" came from his blindside. ""I didn't know what was going on."" Mr Trump saw the attack and confirmed Mr Skeans was well with a thumbs up after it happened. The BBC has written to White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders asking for a review of security arrangements for the media attending the president's rallies following the attack. Why Trump attacks the media Are journalists increasingly under attack? The president has had a fractious relationship with the media from the start of his time in office. He has claimed journalists are ""the enemy of the people"" and slammed the ""fake news"" for reports he deems unfavourable. Mr Skeans said the man almost knocked him and his camera over twice before he was wrestled away by a blogger. President Trump checked they were well with a thumbs up, and continued his speech after Mr Skeans returned the gesture. BBC Washington producer Eleanor Montague and Washington correspondent Gary O'Donoghue were sitting in front of the camera. Ms Montague said the protester had attacked other news crews but Mr Skeans ""got the brunt of it"". A campaign official for Mr Trump afterwards suggested the attacker was drunk.

The president went to El Paso, on the US border with Mexico,to campaign for a border wall, a divisive issue which caused the longest government shutdown in US history. Ms Montague said the president had spoken of ""fake news"" and how the media misrepresented him in the run up to the assault. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr O'Donoghue said it was ""an incredibly violent attack"". ""This is a constant feature of these rallies - a goading of the crowds against the media,"" Mr O'Donoghue said, who added that he had been ""spat at before"". Last AugustUN experts warned Mr Trump's attacks ""increase the risk of journalists being targeted with violence"", calling his rhetoric ""strategic"".

Maduro condemns 'extremist' Trump,"This video can not be played Maduro: US 'warmongering' in order to take over Venezuela Venezuela's embattled President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has called Donald Trump's government a ""gang of extremists"" and blamed the US for his country's crisis. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Maduro said he would not allow humanitarian aid into Venezuela as it was a way for the US to justify an intervention. ""They are warmongering in order to take over Venezuela,"" he said. The US and most Western governments have recognised opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Full transcript of Maduro interview Venezuela crisis in nine charts Mr Maduro is under growing internal and international pressure to call early presidential elections amid a worsening economic crisis and accusations of widespread corruption and human rights violations. Meanwhile, Mr GuaidÃ³ has called for new anti-government protests later on Tuesday. Relations between the US and Venezuela were already fraught before President Trump's administration became one of the first to back Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations in response while Mr Trump said the use of military force remained ""an option"". In a rare interview, Mr Maduro said he hoped ""this extremist group in the White House is defeated by powerful world-wide public opinion"". Speaking in the capital, Caracas, he told the BBC's Orla Guerin: ""It's a political war, of the United States empire, of the interests of the extreme right that today is governing, of the Ku Klux Klan, that rules the White House, to take over Venezuela."" This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa The US, which accuses Mr Maduro's government of human rights violations and corruption, has led the international pressure on the Venezuelan president to step down. It has imposed a raft of economic measures on the country, including against the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, aiming to hit Venezuela's main source of revenue. In recent years the US has frozen Mr Maduro's US assets, restricted Venezuela's access to US markets and blocked dealings with those involved in the country's gold trade. Why US sanctions will hurt Why the military backs Maduro It has also criticised Mr Maduro's increased use of the courts and security forces to suppress political opposition. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the government a ""disastrous dictatorship"" while National Security Advisor John Bolton said Mr Maduro was holding an ""illegitimate claim to power"". When asked, in response to his Ku Klux Klan comment, if he believed Mr Trump was a ""white supremacist"", Mr Maduro said: ""He is, publicly and openly... They hate us, they belittle us, because they only believe in their own interests, and in the interests of the United States."" The president has rejected allowing foreign humanitarian aid into the country, a move that is being organised by the opposition. He said Venezuela had ""the capacity to satisfy all the needs of its people"" and did not have to ""beg from anyone"". This video can not be played Venezuela's President Maduro to BBC: US aid trucks are a charade But for years Venezuelans have faced severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. Last year, the inflation rate saw prices doubling every 19 days on average. Three million people, or 10% of the population, have left the country since the economy started to worsen in 2014, according to the UN. And Mr GuaidÃ³ says more than 300,000 Venezuelans are at ""risk of dying"". The men willing to die for Maduro's cause Mr Maduro, who has blamed US sanctions for Venezuela's economic woes, said the US intended to ""create a humanitarian crisis in order to justify a military intervention"". ""This is part of that charade. That's why, with all dignity, we tell them we don't want their crumbs, their toxic food, their left-overs."" Mr Maduro, in power since 2013, was re-elected to a second term last year but the elections were controversial with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed, and claims of vote-rigging. Head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself president on 23 January, saying the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate. This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border Mr Maduro - who still has the support of Turkey, Russia and China and, crucially, of the Venezuelan army - said he did not see the need for early presidential elections. ""What's the logic, reasoning, to repeat an election?"" he asked. He also said only ""about 10"" governments supported Mr GuaidÃ³ - in fact,more than 30 have announced their support for the opposition leader- and that they were trying to ""impose a government that nobody has elected"".

UK superheroes on Forbes under-30 list,"Marvel stars Letitia Wright and Tom Holland are among the UK celebrities named on Forbes magazine's 30 Under 30 Europe list for 2019. It's a list that recognises young talent and is released every year by the US publication. The Favourite actor Joe Alwyn is also on the list, alongside Lily James and Killing Eve star Jodie Comer. Music artists Ella Mai, Octavian and Jess Glynne are also recognised in the annual round-up. Other UK celebrities which make the list include Daniel Radcliffe, Jorja Smith and George Ezra. Octavian, Ella Mai and Jorja Smith are three of the rising stars from the world of music on the list Tom Holland earned his spot for his appearance as Spider-Man, say Forbes, a role he began before turning 20. Letitia Wright is honoured for her part in Oscar-nominated Black Panther -which earned more than $1bn(Â£794m) at the box office. Octavian is named due to himtopping the BBC's Sound of 2019 list- after surviving homelessness and poverty, says Forbes. But it's not just celebrities who have been recognised on the list of 300 names. Anisah says she will celebrate her inclusion on the Forbes list by ""working - like every other day"" Coder Anisah Osman Britton is named for the coding school 23 Code Street, which she launched for women and non-binary individuals to help balance a male-dominated industry. ""Apple released a health app that had no period checker a few years ago, that for me was a big catalyst into why we needed more women in the industry,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. 23 Code Street not only teaches coding in London, but for every paying student in the UK, the school also educates women in the slums of Mumbai. ""The world is changing so fast and the people left behind tend to be the most disenfranchised,"" she says. ""In India right now, that's women from the most disadvantaged communities."" Sophie (right) runs Birdsong with co-founder Sarah Neville and designer Susanna Wen The three co-founders of Birdsong, a feminist clothing brand, also make the list with their ethical fashion store. They don't use Photoshop on images of their models and pay the women who make the clothes they sell up to 80% of the proceeds. Sophie Slater, one of Birdsong's three founders, says they will celebrate their inclusion when they find the time. ""We've just booked some drinks in for 10 days' time because we're so busy until then,"" she  tells Newsbeat. ""It's really hard work running the business so we've got to make sure we keep stock of these little wins and soak it up as much as we can. ""There's always another challenge round the corner, so it's quite easy to forget when we've got something to be really proud of and celebrate."" She says she hopes some of the major online retailers will try to become more ethical in 2019. Martin Larsson, Adam Lindgren and Pierre Silfver are three of the eSports players on Forbes' 2019 list Under 30s from finance, technology, gaming and media are also honoured in this year's list. Forbes describes the 300 people named as ""young disruptors"" who are ""bringing new ideas to the old world"" and states that the people named have positive opinions about Europe following Brexit. It claims that 92% of its 30 Under 30 are ""optimistic"" about the future of start-ups on the continent. Forbes first launched its 30 Under 30 list in 2011 in America, and introduced the Europe list in 2016.

Family gangs 'exploit pension savers',"Fraudster families are spearheading attempts to steal pension savings totalling millions of pounds, investigators have said. Married couples and their adult children have been identified as leading crime groups involved in the fraud by those tackling the scams. They try to steal life savings or persuade people to invest in high-risk schemes. Rogue financial experts have been signed up to work with the fraudsters. Project Bloom, which was set up in 2012 to tackle pension fraud, said criminal investigations involving regulators, government agencies and police forces were continuing into several gangs. Pension cold-calling ban takes effect Pension scam victims 'lost Â£91,000 each' Pension scams start with an unexpected call, text, social media approach or email - offering a free pension review or a way to make attractive returns on pension savings. But the money may be simply stolen or transferred into a high-risk scheme completely inappropriate for retirement savings. Nicola Parish, from the Pensions Regulator, said that the legitimate pensions industry was helping to identify suspect transfer requests. ""Working together, we can target those trying to plunder people's pension pots and bring them to justice,"" she said. A ban on nuisance calls about pensions came into force in January. Citizens Advice said 10.9 million unsolicited pension calls and messages were made a year. Any firm found flouting the rules faces a fine of up to Â£500,000, but experts suggest fraudsters may ignore the ban.

Young people told - become a care worker,"Bradley McKenzie used to work as a fitness instructor, but now provides care to people with mental health and alcohol problems Young people in England are being targeted by the government in a bid to recruit thousands of more care workers. The Every Day is Different campaign will be promoted on social media and online platforms to get the under-40s to take up jobs such as care workers, therapists and activity co-ordinators. There are currently more than 100,000 vacancies in the sector - a figure which some warn may rise after Brexit. It comes as a report says a lack of community staff may damage the NHS. The report by the Health Foundation charity said the number of GPs had fallen slightly in the past year and there continued to be shortages in key posts such as community nurses, learning disability staff and health visitors. Many of these work side-by-side with care staff. Anita Charlesworth, from the Health Foundation, said there needed to be a ""coherent strategy"" to address the workforce problems. The recruitment drive will be running in February and March and will focus on the rewarding and diverse nature of care work. It will include the personal stories of young people who have built careers in the sector. One of the faces of the campaign is Bradley McKenzie, 34, who works for Society of St James as a support worker in a residential care home in Southampton. He cares for residents with long-term alcohol and mental health problems. Before becoming a support worker, he was a fitness trainer. ""If you have a good heart and you want to be helpful, you could feel really rewarded working in this sector,"" he said. Greg worked part-time while studying for his degree Greg Mather, 22, from London is a final year degree student who in the past year has been working part-time as a domicile care worker. ""It has been hugely advantageous to me in the long term as it has provided me with amazing experience in working with vulnerable adults. But he says it not enough to say that 'you'll feel so rewarded after each shift' if you are paid so little. ""For such an emotionally and sometimes physically demanding job it is shocking that the majority of care workers are paid minimum wage."" Naomi Baker uses a carer Naomi Baker is a 20-year-old university student who uses care workers. She says it is useful having someone closer to her age caring for her. ""It's easier for them to understand what I want."" The campaign will be asking people of all ages to come forward. But research shows that young people are the most likely to work in the sector. There is also an acknowledgement that the care sector needs to plan for the long term. There are more than 1.4 million people working in social care - a figure that needs to rise by 650,000 by 2035 to cope with an ageing population. While care home work is synonymous with the sector, the campaign will highlight the variety of roles available, including hospital-based therapists, activity co-ordinators and personal assistants. Sharon Allen, of Skills for Care, which supports the training of care workers, said: ""I have spent my whole career in adult social care so I know first hand the tremendous professional and personal satisfaction that is on offer to anyone who joins us through this campaign.""

Baby's spine 'repaired' in the womb,"Bethan Simpson's unborn baby had foetal repair surgery at 24 weeks' gestation An unborn baby has had surgery on her spine while she was still in her mother's womb. Bethan Simpson, 26, from Maldon, Essex, was told her unborn daughter Elouise had spina bifida at her 20-week scan. Mrs Simpson has become one of the first mothers in the UK to undergo the pioneering ""foetal repair"" surgery. During a four-hour operation her womb was opened and her baby's bottom exposed, allowing surgeons to ""sew up"" a tiny gap in her lower spine. Mrs Simpson said she ""couldn't justify terminating a child I could feel kicking"". The procedure has been deemed successful and the baby is now due in April. Mrs Simpson said she and husband Kieron were advised to terminate her pregnancy after the condition was diagnosed, but the decision to opt for foetal repair was a ""no brainer"". ""I'm being told she's paralysed, but she very much wasn't,"" Mrs Simpson said. Mrs Simpson underwent surgery at 24 weeks to treat her unborn daughter's spina bifida She was approved for surgery at University College Hospital in London in December after a series of tests and scans, and described the ensuing weeks as a ""rollercoaster"". The operation at 24 weeks involved opening her womb and lifting her baby into position to repair the hole, as well as repositioning the baby's spinal cord. ""I came out of surgery at one o'clock and could feel her moving that evening,"" Mrs Simpson said. ""It was reassuring to feel that first kick after the anaesthetic wore off. She's bigger now, of course, and her kicks are stronger."" Mrs Simpson said she remembered the surgeon telling her on the ward later: ""I've held your baby."" Bethan and Keiron Simpson's daughter Elouise is due in April Mrs Simpson is thought to be the fourth patient to undergo the surgery in the UK, with the procedure mostly carried out in Belgium and the United States. From April, the procedurewill be available on the NHS in England. Two-hundred babies are born with spina bifida in the UK every year. Lead neurosurgeon, Dominic Thompson, described the operation on Mrs Simpson's baby as ""an incredible journey"". The baby who was 'repaired' in the womb Two unborn babies' operated on weeks before birth Spinal surgery for unborn babies on NHS ""Until now, when people got this devastating news there were two options - continue with the pregnancy or termination. This now offers a third option,"" he said. ""It is not a cure. But there is quite clear evidence through critical trials that the outlook can be a lot better with surgery early on."" Mrs Simpson is the fourth patient to undergo the pioneering surgery Gill Yaz, of thespina bifida charity Shine,external, said foetal medicine consultants recognised there were options available ""rather than just termination"". ""People need to be aware that this is not a cure, it may in some cases make no difference at all,"" she said. ""They need to go into this with their eyes wide open."" Mrs Simpson urged parents in her position to consider surgery and ""give every option a go"". ""There are unknowns - it's major surgery, and the biggest decision you'll make in your life,"" she said. ""But remember most children born with spina bifida today are walking and reaching normal milestones."" Spina bifida occurs in about four in 10,000 pregnancies Spina bifida literally means 'split spine', and occurs when the spinal column and cord are not properly formed in pregnancy (before the sixth week) - leaving nerves exposed. It occurs in around four in 10,000 pregnancies. The cause is unknown, however mothers are encouraged to take folic acid supplements to reduce the risk of developing spina bifida in early pregnancy. Babies born with the condition can become paralysed, suffer bladder and bowel problems - and it can affect brain development. It is estimated that about 80% of mothers choose termination when spina bifida is diagnosed, although the condition varies in severity. The delicate surgical procedure involves opening the uterus and closing the gap in the baby's back while they are still in the womb.

Two women lose ÃÂ£105k in 'romance scams',"Two women from Northern Ireland caught up in romance scams have lost a total of nearly Â£105,000 in the last fortnight, police have said. They had been befriended by men online who duped them into sending money. In the first 10 months of last year, police received 39 reports of dating scams in Northern Ireland, when more than Â£218,000 was taken. This was ""alarming"", they said, but they believe romance scams are significantly under-reported. ""We think many people are simply too embarrassed to tell us they have been scammed in a romance fraud,"" said a spokesperson. In one of the two recent cases, a man claimed he was in the US Army. He was in touch with a woman in Northern Ireland for about a month before their relationship became romantic. From May 2018, he told her he was being held by authorities in Africa and needed money to get out. ""She truly believed this man was genuine as she had found a profile online that matched his details,"" said police. She was conned into sending him Â£65,000. Police believe too many people are too embarrassed to admit being scammed The second report involved a woman who was talking online to a man who claimed he was an engineer living in the USA. They had been in touch since November and the man eventually asked the woman for money. She believed his story and sent him Â£40,000. PSNI Ch Super Simon Walls said: ""Sadly, for these two women they will not get their money back as they gave it to the fraudsters voluntarily. ""These reports illustrate how scammers don't care about their victims; that they're happy to take advantage of people's vulnerability and good faith. ""Unfortunately, there is no end to the methods fraudsters will use to dupe people into giving them money."" In the run-up to Valentine's Day, police are warning that romance scammers do not prey on a specific gender, sexuality, race or age. They urged people who use the internet for romance to protect themselves. Their advice is: Start off with a reputable website Look out for someone asking lots of questions, but not giving any detail about themselves Do not ever hand over any money or send goods such as iPhones or iPads Never let anyone you do not know or trust transfer money into your bank account The BBC has highlighted a number of cases in recent years including one woman who lost more than Â£300,000 andsaid she felt emotionally ""brutalised"". She thought she was paying money to her new love interest for food, rent and medical bills. In another case, a lonely 86-year-old man said he was left suicidal after a woman he messaged through online dating, but had never met,conned him out of Â£6,000.

Debenhams secures cash lifeline,"Debenhams has secured a cash injection of Â£40m to buy it extra time as it battles to secure a longer-term deal with lenders. The struggling department store chaincalled it a ""first step"",externaltowards a sustainable future. The firm - which issued three profit warnings last year - is in talks with lenders over renegotiating its debts. It is alsotrying to accelerate plans to close storesand is expected to close around 20 outlets this year. The extra money will extend the retailer's current Â£520m borrowing facilities with banks for 12 months and enable it to continue talks over a longer-term refinancing. News of the funding sent the retailer's shares surging almost 40% in early trade. Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher said: ""Today's announcement represents the first step in our refinancing process.

High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Debenhams - which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people - reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year and said more recently that sales had fallen sharply over Christmas. It also announced last year that it would close up to 50 storeswithin three to five years, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The chain has not yet named which stores it plans to close. However, it is nowtrying to secure an insolvency dealthat would enable it to bring forward the closure of around 20 department store chains to this year. The deal - known as a company voluntary arrangement - would also allow the chain to renegotiate its rents with landlords. The chain has not yet named which stores it plans to close. Debenhams has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people. Mr Khalaf said: ""Debenhams' longer term prospects are still in the balance, and recent data showing a deterioration in the UK economy isn't exactly going to help matters. ""For now, Debenhams has kicked the can down the road, but will have to come back for some tough negotiations with quite a lot of internal dissent amongst its stakeholders."" Last year, rival department store chain House of Fraser fell into administration before Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, bought the department store's assets for Â£90m. Mr Ashley is also a major shareholder in Debenhams, with a 29% stake, and he recently joined together with investor Landmark Groupto vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board. Mr Bucher is continuing as chief executive of Debenhams but no longer sits on the board, while Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down immediately as chairman.

Secret journalist group targeted women,"The group targeted people with rape jokes and photoshopped pornography. Several senior French journalists have been suspended or fired for allegedly co-ordinating online harassment through a private Facebook group. The largely-male Ligue du LOL (League of LOL) mocked women, including other journalists, with rape jokes and photoshopped pornographic images. Dozens of women have spoken out since the group was uncovered by the major French daily LibÃ©ration. LibÃ©ration's online editor Alexandre Hervaud is among those suspended. People in the League of LOL set up anonymous Twitter accounts in order to harass prominent journalists, writers and activists - predominantly targeting women. Vincent Glad, a well-known freelancer who also worked for LibÃ©ration, admitted founding the group in 2009. He has also been suspended from the paper. He apologised on Twitter (in French), saying that he now realised that ""such practices were unacceptable and 'LOL' was not funny at all when it is done in a pack"". Allow Twitter content?

'Dr Evil' tattooist pleads guilty to GBH,"This video can not be played Brendan âDr Evilâ McCarthy admits GBH for performing tongue splitting and nipple removal A body modification artist has admitted three counts of grievous bodily harm, by carrying out tongue splitting and ear and nipple removal procedures. Brendan McCarthy, also known as Dr Evil, carried out consensual procedures without using anaesthetic. In his defence, the 50-year-old argued that consent was given but the judge ruled the procedures could not be compared to tattoos and piercings. He will be sentenced on 21 March at Wolverhampton Crown Court. McCarthy, of Bushbury, Wolverhampton, ran a modification emporium in Princess Alley before he was charged with six counts of wounding in 2017. Warning: This article contains graphic imagery. Brendan McCarthy ran Dr Evil's Body Modification Emporium He was arrested in December 2015 following a complaint to City of Wolverhampton Council's environmental health team. A petition in support of McCarthy amassed more than 13,400 signatures and his lawyer challenged the charges on the basis that his customers consented. His supporters argued ""for the right to express ourselves in whatever modified manner we wish in a safe environment"". The council said its issue was with McCarthy's lack of licence to carry out the modification procedures and the need for more regulation in the industry which delivers results ""akin to cosmetic surgery"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Dr Samantha Pegg, a law lecturer at Nottingham Trent University and expert on the legality of body modification procedures, said: ""Practitioners have assumed that extreme body modifications, as forms of body adornment, were lawful when consent was given. ""Although the law has long accepted that tattooing and piercing are lawful activities there has not - until this case - been any consideration of other forms of body modification such as tongue splitting."" McCarthy no longer runs Dr Evil's Body Modification Emporium in Princess Alley Passing verdict, Judge Amjad Nawaz ruled that written consent from his customers was not sufficient defence. The tattooist has spent two years arguing his case, contending at the Court of Appeal that the procedures should be regarded as lawful to protect the ""personal autonomy"" of his customers. Judge Nawaz drew the distinction between body modification and tattoos and piercings, saying there is ""no proper analogy"". ""What the defendant undertook for reward in this case was a series of medical procedures for no medical reason,"" he said. McCarthy removed a client's ear in 2015 at his studio in Wolverhampton Dr Pegg said the case has ""partially clarified what was previously a grey area of the law"". Although consensual, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said these were ""significant surgical procedures"" but McCarthy has no medical qualifications, nor is he registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). ""Surgical procedures must be carried out by properly trained, qualified and regulated surgeons or healthcare professionals,"" senior prosecutor Rhiannon Jones said. GMC guidance says doctors must be appropriately trained and experienced before practising cosmetic procedures. It adds doctors must consider their patients' psychological needs and follow protocols for safe interventions. Speaking before Tuesday's hearing, McCarthy told the BBC the situation was ""crushing"". ""It's crushed me completely, I'm a shadow of my former self,"" he said. ""I don't feel I've done anything wrong."" Nick Pinch went to McCarthy to have his nipple removed after previous piercings caused a build-up of scar tissue. Nick Pinch went to McCarthy to have his nipple removed The procedures carried out on Mr Pinch formed part of the prosecution's case. Mr Pinch said: ""[McCarthy] wanted to know why I wanted this procedure, he wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing, he took complete duty of care. I'm really happy with what I've had done."" Out-of-date medical materials were found in McCarthy's studio West Midlands Police said McCarthy conducted the procedures without knowing his clients' medical histories or psychiatric backgrounds. He also did not have any life-saving equipment if the surgeries went wrong. Officers discovered out-of-date pre-injection swabs, anaesthetic gel, stitching thread and needles, the force added.

Environment in multiple crises - report,"The ""human footprint"" is creating multiple challenges Politicians and policymakers have failed to grasp the gravity of the environmental crisis facing the Earth, a report claims. The think-tank IPPR says human impacts have reached a critical stage and threaten to destabilise society and the global economy. Scientists warn of a potentially deadly combination of factors. These include climate change, mass loss of species, topsoil erosion, forest felling and acidifying oceans. The report from the centre-leftInstitute for Public Policy Research,externalsays these factors are ""driving a complex, dynamic process of environmental destabilisation that has reached critical levels. ""This destabilisation is occurring at speeds unprecedented in human history and, in some cases, over billions of years."" America colonisation âcooled climateâ Welcome to the Meghalayan Age A manifesto to save Planet Earth (and ourselves) The IPPR warns that the window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic outcomes is rapidly closing. The authors urge three shifts in political understanding: on the scale and pace of environmental breakdown; the implications for societies; and the subsequent need for transformative change. At least climate change features in policy discussions, they say â but other vitally important impacts barely figure. Topsoil is being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes â Since the mid-20th Century, 30% of the world's arable land has become unproductive due to erosion 95% of theEarth's land areas could become degraded,externalby 2050 These matters are close to home for British politicians, the authors argue, with the average population sizes of the most threatened species in the UK havingdecreased by two-thirds since 1970,external. The UK is described asone of the most nature-depleted countries,externalin the world. Some 2.2 million tonnes ofUK topsoil is eroded annually,external, and over 17% of arable land shows signs of erosion. Nearly 85% of fertile peat topsoil in East Anglia has been lost since 1850, with the remainder at risk of being lost over next 30â60 years. The IPPR says many scientists believe we have entered a new era of rapid environmental change. The report warns: ""We define this as the 'age of environmental breakdown' to better highlight the severity of the scale, pace and implications of environmental destabilisation resulting from aggregate human activity."" Simon Lewis, Professor of Global Change Science at University College London, told BBC News: ""IPPR are right to say that environmental change is happening ever-faster and threatens to destabilise society. ""Future problems with food supplies could cause price spikes that drive civil unrest, while increases in levels of migration can strain societies. ""Both together could overload political institutions and global networks of trade. ""This century will be marked by rapid social and environmental change - that is certain. What is less clear is if societies can make wise political choices to avoid disaster in the future."" Harriet Bulkeley, a geography professor at Durham University, told BBC News that the IPPR paper was a good interpretation of the current evidence, but she said it raised the question of how firm evidence of environmental threats had to be to prompt government action. ""We know lots of good things to do,"" she said, ""but often the argument is made that we need to have 'evidence-based policy'. ""This can, of course, be used as an excuse for delay. So, I guess the question is how much more evidence is needed for action?"" A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to leaving our environment in a better state than we found it through our 25 Year Environment Plan and the forthcoming Environment Bill. ""Over 25 years we will replenish depleted soils, rid our seas and rivers of the rubbish trashing our planet, cut greenhouse gas emissions, cleanse our air of toxic pollutants, and develop cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. ""The Environment Bill will also create a new environmental body, the Office for Environmental Protection, to hold us to account on this commitment.""

"UK superheroes on Forbes under-30 listUK stars from entertainment, media, finance and fashion are on the magazine's annual Europe list.Newsbeat","Marvel stars Letitia Wright and Tom Holland are among the UK celebrities named on Forbes magazine's 30 Under 30 Europe list for 2019. It's a list that recognises young talent and is released every year by the US publication. The Favourite actor Joe Alwyn is also on the list, alongside Lily James and Killing Eve star Jodie Comer. Music artists Ella Mai, Octavian and Jess Glynne are also recognised in the annual round-up. Other UK celebrities which make the list include Daniel Radcliffe, Jorja Smith and George Ezra. Octavian, Ella Mai and Jorja Smith are three of the rising stars from the world of music on the list Tom Holland earned his spot for his appearance as Spider-Man, say Forbes, a role he began before turning 20. Letitia Wright is honoured for her part in Oscar-nominated Black Panther -which earned more than $1bn(Â£794m) at the box office. Octavian is named due to himtopping the BBC's Sound of 2019 list- after surviving homelessness and poverty, says Forbes. But it's not just celebrities who have been recognised on the list of 300 names. Anisah says she will celebrate her inclusion on the Forbes list by ""working - like every other day"" Coder Anisah Osman Britton is named for the coding school 23 Code Street, which she launched for women and non-binary individuals to help balance a male-dominated industry. ""Apple released a health app that had no period checker a few years ago, that for me was a big catalyst into why we needed more women in the industry,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. 23 Code Street not only teaches coding in London, but for every paying student in the UK, the school also educates women in the slums of Mumbai. ""The world is changing so fast and the people left behind tend to be the most disenfranchised,"" she says. ""In India right now, that's women from the most disadvantaged communities."" Sophie (right) runs Birdsong with co-founder Sarah Neville and designer Susanna Wen The three co-founders of Birdsong, a feminist clothing brand, also make the list with their ethical fashion store. They don't use Photoshop on images of their models and pay the women who make the clothes they sell up to 80% of the proceeds. Sophie Slater, one of Birdsong's three founders, says they will celebrate their inclusion when they find the time. ""We've just booked some drinks in for 10 days' time because we're so busy until then,"" she  tells Newsbeat. ""It's really hard work running the business so we've got to make sure we keep stock of these little wins and soak it up as much as we can. ""There's always another challenge round the corner, so it's quite easy to forget when we've got something to be really proud of and celebrate."" She says she hopes some of the major online retailers will try to become more ethical in 2019. Martin Larsson, Adam Lindgren and Pierre Silfver are three of the eSports players on Forbes' 2019 list Under 30s from finance, technology, gaming and media are also honoured in this year's list.

"Over 1.8m complaints about unemptied binsOn average, 4,500 complaints were made to local authorities in the UK every day last year.England","Councils make over 800 million waste collections every year according to the Local Government Association Councils in the UK received more than 1.8 million complaints last year about waste not being collected from homes, figures obtained by the BBC have shown. A survey of councils found the number of complaints about missed collections has increased by a third since 2014. On average, 4,500 complaints were made to UK councils every day last year. The number of complaints may not correspond to the level of missed collections as some householders whose bins are not emptied may not report it. Residents in England made 1.5m of the complaints, with 149,000 in Scotland, 92,000 in Wales and 33,000 in Northern Ireland. Analysing figures from theMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government,external(MHCLG), BBC News found real terms spending on waste collection by local authorities has fallen to Â£888m in 2017-18, from Â£1bn in 2010-11, after accounting for inflation. Residents in some parts of the Hyde Park area of Leeds said their bins hadn't been emptied for a month BBC News sent a Freedom of Information request to 391 local authorities responsible for waste collection in the UK. 336 authorities provided responses, which showed that 1.8 million complaints were received in 2018 about non-recyclable, and recyclable waste not being collected. Comparable data from 213 councils show the number of complaints in the UK has increased from 950,000 in 2014, to 1.3m in 2018, a rise of a third. In real terms, spending on waste collection in England has fallen by 17% since 2010-11, figures show. But the Local Government Association said 99.8% of bin collections went ahead without complaint. In Wales,a 41% rise in complaints was higher than the average rise of 32% across the UK. Councillor Michael Michael, from Cardiff City Council, said cuts to the authority's budget had stretched local services. ""I've got to clean more streets with fewer men,"" Mr Michael told Good Morning Wales. ""We've had to reduce our overall budget by over Â£250m in recent years, and at some stage that is going to impact on services."" In Hyde Park, Leeds, residents said the council had not collected household rubbish for nearly a month. ""We see rats everywhere and it's just not a nice place to live in,"" said Miriam Muse, who made a complaint to Leeds City Council. ""The bins are overflowing and we've had this issue for a while and it's just really disgusting."" However, Councillor Mohammed Rafique said the authority's missed bin collection rate stood at 0.08% a year. ""We encourage people to get in contact with us if we miss bins, and we've made it easy for people to alert us through the use of social media and the council's mobile phone app,"" said Mr Rafique. Hyde Park resident Miriam Muse said overflowing bins had meant rats are often seen in the street Bin workers in Birmingham were on strike for almost three monthsin a dispute over job losses in 2017, which led to thousands of tonnes of rubbish piling up on the city's streets. The amount of rubbish left in some streets led to residents taking action to clear up the waste themselves and business owners claiming the uncollected waste had affected trade. The industrial action came to an end but residents in parts of the city reportedproblems with uncollected waste piling up again last yearafter new shift patterns for refuse collectors were rolled out. From Monday bins in Birminghamwill be collected fortnightly as workers prepare for further walk-outs. Thousands of tonnes of waste were left on Birmingham's streets during a three-month strike in 2017 Speaking on behalf of councils in England, Councillor Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said: ""Councils carry out around 821 million waste collections from households per year - not including recycling collections - these figures actually show that 99.8% of bin collections were completed without complaint. ""Between 2010 and 2020, councils will have lost almost 60p out of every Â£1 the government had provided for services and councils in England face an overall funding gap of Â£8bn by 2025."" A spokeswoman for MHCLG said: ""Authorities are receiving Â£1bn extra in funding this coming year to help deliver local services. ""We want councils to respond to the wishes of local people, many of whom want to see bin collections as frequently as possible.""

Alesha trial shown pictures of crime scene,"Robert MacPhail said he had sold cannabis to the accused Jurors in the Alesha MacPhail murder trial have heard that her father sold cannabis to the teenager accused of killing her. Robert MacPhail, 26, admitted doing deals with the 16-year-old boy who lived on the Isle of Bute. The teenager - who cannot be named because of his age - denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha last July. He has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by a woman called Toni Louise McLachlan. Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year. Giving evidence at the High Court in Glasgow, Mr MacPhail said he last sold the drug to the 16-year-old accused a few months before Alesha was killed. The court heard he stopped supplying cannabis to the accused after the teenager's mother made a request via her friend. The jury was told the friend was an aunt of Mr MacPhail's partner, Toni McLachlan. The body of Alesha MacPhail was discovered in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year Mr MacPhail, who is unemployed, said he sold cannabis to fund his own use of the drug and used to arrange transactions via Facebook Messenger and other means. The jury were later shown Facebook messages between Mr MacPhail and the accused which indicated the pair had fallen out in February last year over a Â£10 drug debt. The messages indicated the source of the dispute was the quality of cannabis the accused had been sold. Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, later asked Mr MacPhail: ""Did it ever cross your mind that your drug dealing might have some relevance to Alesha being taken?"" The witness replied: ""It did not"". Mr MacPhail told the court that the night before she died, Alesha came into the room he shared with Ms McLachlan and had some of his dinner. She then went to her room to watch a Peppa Pig DVD. Mr MacPhail last saw his daughter when she got up between 22:30 and 23:00 on 1 July. He said he went to bed with Ms McLachlan around 23:30 and only became aware Alesha was missing when his parents woke him up around 06:30 the following day. A frantic search followed and locals joined in when Mr MacPhail's mother posted an appeal on Facebook. He was later taken to the police station to be informed his missing daughter's body had been found. The jury heard Alesha was only a few days into a three-and-a-half week summer break on the Isle of Bute when she was murdered. She had been staying with Mr MacPhail, his parents and Ms McLachlan in a three-bedroom converted attic flat on Ardbeg Road. Mr MacPhail, 26, told the court he split up with Alesha's mother around three months after his daughter was born. He later started dating Ms McLachlan, 18, and they had been together for two years. He also told the jury his girlfriend was involved in his drug dealing and both handed over cannabis and collected money from his customers. Asked by Mr McSporran how Ms McLachlan got on with his daughter, the witness replied: ""Great. They both loved each other to bits. Ever since Toni met her, from day one."" Alesha MacPhail was tucked up in bed by her father the night before she died Jurors were earlier shown pictures of the crime scene. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC issued a warning to the jury before the images of the six-year-old with a pile of clothing next to her were shown on public screens in the court. The images also showed the wooded area and the disused hotel on the Isle of Bute where she was found. A number of people, including relatives of Alesha, left the court before the pictures were shown. Jurors were previously told Alesha's naked body was found by a man at 08:54 on 2 July in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. Alesha's grandfather Calum MacPhail, 49, last saw Alesha when she came in and jumped on his bed the night before she was discovered. The girl said to him: ""Goodnight, grandpa."" Alesha's grandparents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King, both gave evidence on Tuesday The next morning Mr MacPhail got up for work around 06:00 - but could not find Alesha in bed. He alerted his family adding: ""We searched under beds, in wardrobes, but there was no sign of her anywhere."" Mr MacPhail drove around Bute to look for Alesha. He eventually spotted police tape at an area cordoned off and begged for information before being told to go the local police station. Fighting back tears, the creamery worker recalled: ""We were put into a room. Five minutes later, a police officer said: 'We have found her but she has passed.'"" 'Beautiful, happy girl' Earlier, Mr MacPhail said his partner, Angela King, often left the key in their front door. He added: ""It was one of the things about Rothesay that a lot of people leave their door unlocked."" Ms King, 47, later described her granddaughter as a ""beautiful, beautiful, happy girl"". A recording of the 999 call she made at 06:23 on 2 July was also played to the court. Ms King was later asked by the boy's QC Mr McConnachie of being aware of her son Robert's drug dealing. Angela replied: ""He never admitted it, but I had my suspicions."" Following Alesha McPhail's death, floral tributes were laid Prosecutors allege the accused boy was armed with a knife when he took Alesha from her bed at a house in Ardbeg Road. It is claimed he carried the schoolgirl to the site of the former hotel, removed her clothes and suffocated her before raping and murdering her. The teenager faces a separate charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of clothes he had been wearing. The trial continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence which will result in them being acquitted if it is accepted by the court. These defences include self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination - meaning he has claimed that someone else (a woman called Toni McLachlan) was responsible for Alesha's death. It will be for the jury to decide whether or not they accept this special defence after hearing the evidence in the case.

Deal aims to avert new US shutdown,"This video can not be played President Trump told supporters in El Paso, ""we're building the wall anyway"" Democrats and Republicans have reached an agreement in principle over border security to fund the US government and avert another partial shutdown. The agreement contains only a fraction of the money President Donald Trump wants for his promised border wall and does not mention a concrete barrier. The deal still needs to be approved by Congress and signed by the president. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Trump said of the deal: ""I can't say I'm happy, I can't say I'm thrilled."" He told reporters he would have a meeting about the agreement later on Tuesday. The Democrats - who now control the House of Representatives - have refused to approve the $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) for Mr Trump's wall on the border with Mexico, one of his key campaign pledges. What is a government shutdown? How the last US shutdown hurt Lawmakers expressed optimism that a bill would be approved by Friday when funding runs out for some federal agencies. The previous shutdown - the longest in US history - lasted 35 days andcost the country's economy an estimated $11bn (Â£8.5bn).,external Details have yet to be released but aides familiar with the negotiations say it includes $1.375bn in funding for 55 miles (88km) of new fencing at the border, a small part of the more than 2,000 miles promised by the president. The barrier would be built in the Rio Grande Valley, in Texas, using existing designs, such as metal slats, instead of the concrete wall that Mr Trump had demanded. There was also an agreement to reduce the number of beds in detention centres to 40,250 from the current 49,057, reports say. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? The talks had reached an impasse earlier with Republicans strongly rejecting Democrats' demands for a limit to the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who could be detained by immigration authorities. The deal was struck in a closed-door meeting in Washington on Monday evening after several hours of talks. ""We got an agreement on all of it,"" Republican Senator Richard Shelby said. ""Our staffs are going to be working feverishly to put all the particulars together. We believe that if this becomes law, it'll keep open the government."" Trump's border wall in seven charts Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? But, by Monday night, some of the president's conservative allies had already denounced the deal, with Fox News commentator Sean Hannity calling it a ""garbage compromise"". House Freedom Caucus leader Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina said the agreement failed ""to address the critical priorities outlined by Border Patrol Chiefs"". Allow Twitter content?

Speakingon CNN,externalon Tuesday, Democratic Representative Nita Lowey, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a key negotiator of the deal, said: ""This is a compromise. No one got everything they wanted."" She said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" the deal would pass. If there was one thing Democratic and Republican congressional negotiators could agree on, it's that another government shutdown would be very bad news. Republicans feared the public would again blame them for the impasse. Democrats were concerned that federal workers, a key constituency, would face further financial strain. All that was left was to reach a compromise that allowed both sides to claim a bit of victory. They finally did - and the contours of the agreement look a lot like what was on the table last December, before the president, at the behest of his conservative base, instigated the current crisis. According to reports, there's some new wall money, but no more than had been agreed to last summer. There's also funding for ""border security"", including better technology and increased screening at ports of entry, which is the real source of most drug smuggling. Donald Trump may grouse, but since he's already claiming his wall is being built - ""finish the wall"" is his new slogan - he probably will find a way to tout the deal as a success. Democrats bent during negotiations, but didn't break. Both sides will lick their wounds and prepare for the next fight. In a crowded stadium with banners saying ""Finish the Wall"" in El Paso, in Texas on Monday night, Mr Trump told supporters: ""Walls work... Walls save lives."" He repeated that a border fence in the city, opposite Ciudad JuÃ¡rez in Mexico, ""made a big difference"", even though critics reject his claim as exaggerated and based on misleading data. This video can not be played A Trump supporter shoves a BBC cameraman at the El Paso rally ""We need the wall, and it has to be built,"" said Mr Trump, who has previously threatened to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without Congress. The idea, however, is disliked even by some fellow Republicans, and Democrats are likely to challenge it in the courts. The president has backed away from calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall, a point he repeatedly made during his presidential campaign, and has already acknowledged that the barrier to be built may not be made of concrete. Trump's wall: How tech fills the gaps How much of the wall is built already? As the president spoke, Beto O'Rourke, a former Democratic congressman and potential presidential candidate in 2020, held a counter-rally, accusing Mr Trump of stoking false fear about immigrants with ""lies"". On 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement. The shutdown was triggered after Democrats denied the president funding for his promised wall on the border with Mexico, and Mr Trump refused to budge. This video can not be played Just why did the US government partially shut down? During the last shutdown, hundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed (put on unpaid leave) in December and January while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay.

Over 1.8m complaints about unemptied bins,"Councils make over 800 million waste collections every year according to the Local Government Association Councils in the UK received more than 1.8 million complaints last year about waste not being collected from homes, figures obtained by the BBC have shown. A survey of councils found the number of complaints about missed collections has increased by a third since 2014. On average, 4,500 complaints were made to UK councils every day last year. The number of complaints may not correspond to the level of missed collections as some householders whose bins are not emptied may not report it. Residents in England made 1.5m of the complaints, with 149,000 in Scotland, 92,000 in Wales and 33,000 in Northern Ireland. Analysing figures from theMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government,external(MHCLG), BBC News found real terms spending on waste collection by local authorities has fallen to Â£888m in 2017-18, from Â£1bn in 2010-11, after accounting for inflation. Residents in some parts of the Hyde Park area of Leeds said their bins hadn't been emptied for a month BBC News sent a Freedom of Information request to 391 local authorities responsible for waste collection in the UK. 336 authorities provided responses, which showed that 1.8 million complaints were received in 2018 about non-recyclable, and recyclable waste not being collected. Comparable data from 213 councils show the number of complaints in the UK has increased from 950,000 in 2014, to 1.3m in 2018, a rise of a third. In real terms, spending on waste collection in England has fallen by 17% since 2010-11, figures show. But the Local Government Association said 99.8% of bin collections went ahead without complaint. In Wales,a 41% rise in complaints was higher than the average rise of 32% across the UK. Councillor Michael Michael, from Cardiff City Council, said cuts to the authority's budget had stretched local services. ""I've got to clean more streets with fewer men,"" Mr Michael told Good Morning Wales. ""We've had to reduce our overall budget by over Â£250m in recent years, and at some stage that is going to impact on services."" In Hyde Park, Leeds, residents said the council had not collected household rubbish for nearly a month. ""We see rats everywhere and it's just not a nice place to live in,"" said Miriam Muse, who made a complaint to Leeds City Council. ""The bins are overflowing and we've had this issue for a while and it's just really disgusting."" However, Councillor Mohammed Rafique said the authority's missed bin collection rate stood at 0.08% a year. ""We encourage people to get in contact with us if we miss bins, and we've made it easy for people to alert us through the use of social media and the council's mobile phone app,"" said Mr Rafique. Hyde Park resident Miriam Muse said overflowing bins had meant rats are often seen in the street Bin workers in Birmingham were on strike for almost three monthsin a dispute over job losses in 2017, which led to thousands of tonnes of rubbish piling up on the city's streets. The amount of rubbish left in some streets led to residents taking action to clear up the waste themselves and business owners claiming the uncollected waste had affected trade. The industrial action came to an end but residents in parts of the city reportedproblems with uncollected waste piling up again last yearafter new shift patterns for refuse collectors were rolled out. From Monday bins in Birminghamwill be collected fortnightly as workers prepare for further walk-outs. Thousands of tonnes of waste were left on Birmingham's streets during a three-month strike in 2017 Speaking on behalf of councils in England, Councillor Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said: ""Councils carry out around 821 million waste collections from households per year - not including recycling collections - these figures actually show that 99.8% of bin collections were completed without complaint. ""Between 2010 and 2020, councils will have lost almost 60p out of every Â£1 the government had provided for services and councils in England face an overall funding gap of Â£8bn by 2025."" A spokeswoman for MHCLG said: ""Authorities are receiving Â£1bn extra in funding this coming year to help deliver local services. ""We want councils to respond to the wishes of local people, many of whom want to see bin collections as frequently as possible.""

Trump supporter attacks BBC cameramanMr Trump saw the attack and confirmed the cameraman was well with a thumbs up after it happened.US & Canada,"This video can not be played A Trump supporter shoves a BBC cameraman at the El Paso rally A supporter of US President Donald Trump has attacked a BBC cameraman at a campaign rally in El Paso, Texas. Sporting a Make America Great Again cap, the man shoved and swore at the BBC's Ron Skeans and other news crews before being pulled away. Mr Skeans said the ""very hard shove"" came from his blindside. ""I didn't know what was going on."" Mr Trump saw the attack and confirmed Mr Skeans was well with a thumbs up after it happened. The BBC has written to White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders asking for a review of security arrangements for the media attending the president's rallies following the attack. Why Trump attacks the media Are journalists increasingly under attack? The president has had a fractious relationship with the media from the start of his time in office. He has claimed journalists are ""the enemy of the people"" and slammed the ""fake news"" for reports he deems unfavourable. Mr Skeans said the man almost knocked him and his camera over twice before he was wrestled away by a blogger. President Trump checked they were well with a thumbs up, and continued his speech after Mr Skeans returned the gesture. BBC Washington producer Eleanor Montague and Washington correspondent Gary O'Donoghue were sitting in front of the camera. Ms Montague said the protester had attacked other news crews but Mr Skeans ""got the brunt of it"". A campaign official for Mr Trump afterwards suggested the attacker was drunk.

Hundreds welcome refugee footballer homeBahraini Hakeem al-Araibi has returned to Australia after two months in a Bangkok prison.Australia,"This video can not be played Hakeem al-Araibi thanked Australians for their support on arrival in Melbourne Refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi has returned home to Australia after two months of detention in Thailand. The Bahraini citizen was detained in Bangkok in November while on honeymoon, at the request of Bahrain authorities. Following an international outcry and diplomatic pressure, the Arab kingdom ended its extradition attempt on Monday. Hundreds of supporters cheered the arrival of the 25-year-old footballer at Melbourne Airport on Tuesday. Wearing his team's football jersey, al-Araibi told the crowd: ""I would like to say thanks to Australia. It's amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people who supported me."" Hakeem al-Araibi was detained for over two months in Thailand The professional footballer and vocal critic of Bahrain authorities had fled to Australia in 2014 where he was granted political asylum. Bahrain had sentenced him in absentia to 10 years for vandalising a police station, charges which he has denied. The Arab kingdom had sought his extradition, but human rights groups warned that he risked torture if he was sent back. Bahraini footballer case 'an emergency' Fifa contacts Thailand over Al-Araibi Bahrain country profile Hours before his return, his wife told the BBC she was deeply thankful for the lobbying efforts of the Australian government and public, and the international football community. ""I have had a smile all the time on my face and I can't stop crying - I am just so happy,"" said the 24-year-old, who does not wish to be named. ""I prayed and prayed that he would come back to me, and finally our nightmare is ending."" Hakeem al-Araibi attended court in shackles when Bahrain requested extradition Denied contact with her husband during his 10-week detention, she said she  planned to ""buy flowers and cake"" to celebrate their reunion. Footballer's wife: 'We have a life here in Australia' She also thanked Craig Foster, a TV host and former Australian national football captain who rallied the international football community, and sports bodies including Fifa and the International Olympic Committee to help secure a release. Mr Foster, who escorted al-Araibi on his arrival, said the human rights victory marked ""the beginning of a broader fight for the values of sport"". ""We fought for one soul because Hakeem represented everyone who suffers under tyranny,"" he said in a statement. The footballer plays for Melbourne team Pascoe Vale FC. Many of the team's members were at the airport on Tuesday. al-Araibi's case had garnered significant public support in Australia Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Melbourne As he walked out of the airport arrival gates, Hakeem al-Araibi seemed astounded by the welcoming party that had gathered to greet him. Some supporters had banners and posters bearing his picture, others wore T-shirts with the campaign slogan #SaveHakeem. They cheered as if greeting a cup-winning captain and sang one of football's most poignant anthems, You'll Never Walk Alone. His case has shown the solidarity that exists across the game, as players and fans lobbied for his return. But the apparent delay by Fifa in becoming involved has left the game's governing body open to accusations of neglect and failing to stand by its own policy on human rights. On Monday, Thai officials told the BBC they had released al-Araibibecause Bahrain was no longer seeking his extradition. Bahrain's foreign ministry said that despite the end of court extradition proceedings, the footballer's conviction still stood. ""The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr al-Araibi,"" it added.

Alesha trial shown pictures of crime sceneJurors in the Alesha MacPhail murder trial are shown images of the wooded area where the six-year-old's body was found.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Robert MacPhail said he had sold cannabis to the accused Jurors in the Alesha MacPhail murder trial have heard that her father sold cannabis to the teenager accused of killing her. Robert MacPhail, 26, admitted doing deals with the 16-year-old boy who lived on the Isle of Bute. The teenager - who cannot be named because of his age - denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha last July. He has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by a woman called Toni Louise McLachlan. Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year. Giving evidence at the High Court in Glasgow, Mr MacPhail said he last sold the drug to the 16-year-old accused a few months before Alesha was killed. The court heard he stopped supplying cannabis to the accused after the teenager's mother made a request via her friend. The jury was told the friend was an aunt of Mr MacPhail's partner, Toni McLachlan. The body of Alesha MacPhail was discovered in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year Mr MacPhail, who is unemployed, said he sold cannabis to fund his own use of the drug and used to arrange transactions via Facebook Messenger and other means. The jury were later shown Facebook messages between Mr MacPhail and the accused which indicated the pair had fallen out in February last year over a Â£10 drug debt. The messages indicated the source of the dispute was the quality of cannabis the accused had been sold. Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, later asked Mr MacPhail: ""Did it ever cross your mind that your drug dealing might have some relevance to Alesha being taken?"" The witness replied: ""It did not"". Mr MacPhail told the court that the night before she died, Alesha came into the room he shared with Ms McLachlan and had some of his dinner. She then went to her room to watch a Peppa Pig DVD. Mr MacPhail last saw his daughter when she got up between 22:30 and 23:00 on 1 July. He said he went to bed with Ms McLachlan around 23:30 and only became aware Alesha was missing when his parents woke him up around 06:30 the following day. A frantic search followed and locals joined in when Mr MacPhail's mother posted an appeal on Facebook. He was later taken to the police station to be informed his missing daughter's body had been found. The jury heard Alesha was only a few days into a three-and-a-half week summer break on the Isle of Bute when she was murdered. She had been staying with Mr MacPhail, his parents and Ms McLachlan in a three-bedroom converted attic flat on Ardbeg Road. Mr MacPhail, 26, told the court he split up with Alesha's mother around three months after his daughter was born. He later started dating Ms McLachlan, 18, and they had been together for two years. He also told the jury his girlfriend was involved in his drug dealing and both handed over cannabis and collected money from his customers. Asked by Mr McSporran how Ms McLachlan got on with his daughter, the witness replied: ""Great. They both loved each other to bits. Ever since Toni met her, from day one."" Alesha MacPhail was tucked up in bed by her father the night before she died Jurors were earlier shown pictures of the crime scene. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC issued a warning to the jury before the images of the six-year-old with a pile of clothing next to her were shown on public screens in the court. The images also showed the wooded area and the disused hotel on the Isle of Bute where she was found. A number of people, including relatives of Alesha, left the court before the pictures were shown. Jurors were previously told Alesha's naked body was found by a man at 08:54 on 2 July in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. Alesha's grandfather Calum MacPhail, 49, last saw Alesha when she came in and jumped on his bed the night before she was discovered. The girl said to him: ""Goodnight, grandpa."" Alesha's grandparents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King, both gave evidence on Tuesday The next morning Mr MacPhail got up for work around 06:00 - but could not find Alesha in bed. He alerted his family adding: ""We searched under beds, in wardrobes, but there was no sign of her anywhere."" Mr MacPhail drove around Bute to look for Alesha. He eventually spotted police tape at an area cordoned off and begged for information before being told to go the local police station. Fighting back tears, the creamery worker recalled: ""We were put into a room. Five minutes later, a police officer said: 'We have found her but she has passed.'"" 'Beautiful, happy girl' Earlier, Mr MacPhail said his partner, Angela King, often left the key in their front door. He added: ""It was one of the things about Rothesay that a lot of people leave their door unlocked."" Ms King, 47, later described her granddaughter as a ""beautiful, beautiful, happy girl"". A recording of the 999 call she made at 06:23 on 2 July was also played to the court. Ms King was later asked by the boy's QC Mr McConnachie of being aware of her son Robert's drug dealing. Angela replied: ""He never admitted it, but I had my suspicions."" Following Alesha McPhail's death, floral tributes were laid Prosecutors allege the accused boy was armed with a knife when he took Alesha from her bed at a house in Ardbeg Road. It is claimed he carried the schoolgirl to the site of the former hotel, removed her clothes and suffocated her before raping and murdering her. The teenager faces a separate charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of clothes he had been wearing. The trial continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence which will result in them being acquitted if it is accepted by the court. These defences include self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination - meaning he has claimed that someone else (a woman called Toni McLachlan) was responsible for Alesha's death. It will be for the jury to decide whether or not they accept this special defence after hearing the evidence in the case.

Google and Facebook 'need fake news regulator'The landmark review also recommended the BBC should do more to share its technical and digital expertise.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Dame Frances Cairncross explains the findings of her review into the future of the UK news industry A regulator should oversee tech giants like Google and Facebook to ensure their news content is trustworthy, a government-backed report has suggested. The Cairncross Review into the future of UK news said such sites should help users identify fake news and ""nudge people towards news of high quality"". The review also said Ofcom should assess the BBC's impact on online news on other providers. In addition, the report called for a new Institute for Public Interest News. Such a body, it said, could work in a similar way to the Arts Council, channelling public and private funding to ""those parts of the industry it deemed most worthy of support"". Last local paper closes, so ring MP for news Amol Rajan's media predictions for 2019 Governments v social media The report said Facebook and Google need to give more prominence to public interest news The independent review, undertaken by former journalist Dame Frances Cairncross, was tasked with investigating the sustainability of high-quality journalism. Its recommendations include measures to tackle ""the uneven balance of power"" between news publishers and online platforms that distribute their content. Services such as Facebook, Google and Apple should continue their attempts to help readers understand how reliable a story is, and the process that decides which stories are shown should be more transparent, it says. ""Their efforts should be placed under regulatory scrutiny - this task is too important to leave entirely to the judgment of commercial entities,"" according to the report. Could a digital regulator stop the spread of so-called 'fake news'? A regulator would initially only assess how well these sites are performing - but if this doesn't work, the report warns ""it may be necessary to impose stricter provisions"". Yet the report falls short of requiring Facebook, Google and other tech giants to pay for the news they distribute via their platforms. Dame Frances told the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan that ""draconian and risky"" measures could result in firms such as Google withdrawing their news services altogether. ""There are a number of ways we have suggested technology companies could behave differently and could be made to behave differently,"" she said. ""But they are mostly ways that don't immediately involve legislation."" The review was not asked to comment specifically on the BBC but concluded that curtailing the corporation's news offering would be counter-productive after hearing arguments from other publishers that the BBC reporting on so-called ""soft content"" online was crowding out other news providers. The review noted that the BBC Charter states the corporation should endeavour to reach all demographics, and that stories of this type are essential to appeal to an increasingly elusive younger audience. The BBC also argues that ""soft content"" stories may attract users who might then click onwards to a public-interest news story. The review said the BBC was delivering high quality journalism but suggested it ""could do more and think more carefully about how its news provision can act as a complement, rather than a substitute, for private news provision"". Dame Frances also recommended an exploration of the market impact of BBC News, conducted by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, to find whether it is 'striking the right balance' and driving traffic to other, commercial providers. The BBC should do more to share its technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, the report concluded. The review suggests it would 'make little sense to curtail the BBC' Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson urged the government to tackle Google and Facebook's ""duopoly"" in the digital advertising market, and said Dame Frances was ""barking up the wrong tree"" in recommending an inquiry into the BBC's online news output. Meanwhile, former director general of the BBC Greg Dyke defended the role of the corporation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It seems to me that at a time when large American media companies - the likes of Netflix and the rest of it - are going to come to dominate in the world, for the BBC to be cutting back on anything will be a mistake. ""The importance of the BBC is going to grow in the next 10 years, not decline."" Frances Cairncross earned widespread respect as a journalist for her hard-headed and pragmatic approach to economics. That pragmatism is the very reason the government commissioned her to look at the future of high-quality news - and also the reason many in local and regional media will be disappointed by her recommendations. What is most notable about her review is what it doesn't do. It doesn't suggest all social media should be regulated in the UK It doesn't suggest social media companies pay for the privilege of using news content It doesn't suggest social media companies be treated as publishers, with legal liability for all that appears on their platform This is because the practicalities of doing these things are difficult, and experience shows that the likes of Google will simply pull out of markets that don't suit them. There are concrete measures that could boost local news, from tax relief to an extension of the Local Democracy Reporting Service. And Dame Frances certainly seemed cognisant of the argument that BBC News has over-reached, to the extent that it is harming the commercial sector. But this is a matter for Ofcom. Ultimately, as this report acknowledges, when it comes to news, convenience is king. The speed, versatility and zero cost of so much news now means that, even if it is of poor quality, a generation of consumers has fallen out of the habit of paying for news. But quality costs. If quality news has a future, consumers will have to pay. That's the main lesson of this report. The report recommends ""new codes of conduct"" whose implementation would be supervised by a regulator ""with powers to insist on compliance"". Other recommendations included: Tax relief to encourage the provision of local journalism Expanding financial support for local news by extending the BBC'sLocal Democracy Reporting Service An investigation of the online advertising market, conducted by the Competition and Markets Authority, to ensure fair competition The Barnsley Chronicle goes to press in September 2017 One local newspaper editor welcomed the report's recommendations but said it ""comes too late for so many once proud and important community newspapers"". The Yorkshire Post's James Mitchinson said: ""The various fiscal reviews and recommendations... must come quickly... if we are to turn the Cairncross Review into something which we look back upon as being instrumental in preserving what we do for generations to come."" Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said some of its suggestions could be acted upon ""immediately"", while others would need ""further careful consideration"".

Hundreds welcome refugee footballer home,"This video can not be played Hakeem al-Araibi thanked Australians for their support on arrival in Melbourne Refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi has returned home to Australia after two months of detention in Thailand. The Bahraini citizen was detained in Bangkok in November while on honeymoon, at the request of Bahrain authorities. Following an international outcry and diplomatic pressure, the Arab kingdom ended its extradition attempt on Monday. Hundreds of supporters cheered the arrival of the 25-year-old footballer at Melbourne Airport on Tuesday. Wearing his team's football jersey, al-Araibi told the crowd: ""I would like to say thanks to Australia. It's amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people who supported me."" Hakeem al-Araibi was detained for over two months in Thailand The professional footballer and vocal critic of Bahrain authorities had fled to Australia in 2014 where he was granted political asylum. Bahrain had sentenced him in absentia to 10 years for vandalising a police station, charges which he has denied. The Arab kingdom had sought his extradition, but human rights groups warned that he risked torture if he was sent back. Bahraini footballer case 'an emergency' Fifa contacts Thailand over Al-Araibi Bahrain country profile Hours before his return, his wife told the BBC she was deeply thankful for the lobbying efforts of the Australian government and public, and the international football community. ""I have had a smile all the time on my face and I can't stop crying - I am just so happy,"" said the 24-year-old, who does not wish to be named. ""I prayed and prayed that he would come back to me, and finally our nightmare is ending."" Hakeem al-Araibi attended court in shackles when Bahrain requested extradition Denied contact with her husband during his 10-week detention, she said she  planned to ""buy flowers and cake"" to celebrate their reunion. Footballer's wife: 'We have a life here in Australia' She also thanked Craig Foster, a TV host and former Australian national football captain who rallied the international football community, and sports bodies including Fifa and the International Olympic Committee to help secure a release. Mr Foster, who escorted al-Araibi on his arrival, said the human rights victory marked ""the beginning of a broader fight for the values of sport"". ""We fought for one soul because Hakeem represented everyone who suffers under tyranny,"" he said in a statement. The footballer plays for Melbourne team Pascoe Vale FC. Many of the team's members were at the airport on Tuesday. al-Araibi's case had garnered significant public support in Australia Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Melbourne As he walked out of the airport arrival gates, Hakeem al-Araibi seemed astounded by the welcoming party that had gathered to greet him. Some supporters had banners and posters bearing his picture, others wore T-shirts with the campaign slogan #SaveHakeem. They cheered as if greeting a cup-winning captain and sang one of football's most poignant anthems, You'll Never Walk Alone. His case has shown the solidarity that exists across the game, as players and fans lobbied for his return. But the apparent delay by Fifa in becoming involved has left the game's governing body open to accusations of neglect and failing to stand by its own policy on human rights. On Monday, Thai officials told the BBC they had released al-Araibibecause Bahrain was no longer seeking his extradition. Bahrain's foreign ministry said that despite the end of court extradition proceedings, the footballer's conviction still stood. ""The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr al-Araibi,"" it added.

Desert Island Discs 'greatest radio show',"Poet Wendy Cope (right) was host Lauren Laverne's desert island castaway last month Desert Island Discs has been named the greatest radio programme of all time by a panel of industry experts. The BBC Radio 4 show, which since 1942 has been inviting famous guests to share their favourite musical choices, beat drama The Archers to the top spot. Other choices in the Radio Times poll included Wake Up To Wogan, John Peel and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Many of the 30 programmes on the list are no longer broadcast, with almost a third being comedies or panel shows. Desert Island Discs is currently presented by Lauren Laverne, who is filling in while Kirsty Young is being treated for fibromyalgia. The programme invites high-profile guests to choose eight discs, a book and a luxury item to take with them as they are castaway on a mythical desert island. Desert Island Discs The Archers - the UK's longest running radio drama. Radio comedy Round The Horne (1965-8) Hancock's Half Hour (1954-9) In The Psychiatrist's Chair (1982-2001) Source: Radio Times poll Prime ministers and industry leaders have all been castaways, with notable recent guests having included Sir David Attenborough, JK Rowling, Yoko Ono and David Beckham. Desert Island Discs producer Cathy Drysdale said the accolade was ""wonderful"", attributing it to an ""absolute genius format"". Yoko Ono appeared on the programme in 2007. She chose records both by her late husband John Lennon and son Sean Radio Times editor Mark Frith said the ""poll illustrates how memorable and timeless great radio can be"". The list was compiled by 46 industry experts, of which 42 had a professional connection to the BBC. Terry Wogan's BBC Radio 2 breakfast show, which ran for more than 25 years until 2009, was in 12th position, just ahead of John Peel's late-night BBC Radio 1 programme, on air between 1967 and 2004.

Government sued over no-deal ferry contracts,"The government is being sued for its decision to charter firms to run extra ferries, including one with no ships, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel, said the contracts, revealed after Christmas, were decided in a ""secretive and flawed procurement process"". The move comes days after Seaborne, one of the firms chosen,had its contract axedafter its funding fell through. The government said it had carried out a ""competitive procurement process"". ""The Department for Transport acted transparently and competitively throughout the process of securing extra freight. ""This was done by approaching ferry operators and encouraging bids that could be fairly assessed against each other,"" a spokeswoman said. Pope says priests kept nuns as sex slaves Fox host 'hasn't washed hands in 10 years' My disabled son - âthe nobleman, the philanderer, the detectiveâ At a High Court hearing in London, Eurotunnel claimed the government contracts,announced on 29 December, were awarded without any public notice. Eurotunnel's barrister Daniel Beard QC said Eurotunnel only found out ""when contract notices were published three days after Christmas"". He said it was ""quite remarkable"" his client had not been informed given its recent history in running cross-Channel services. Ewan West, representing Transport Secretary Chris Grayling in court, said the government's procurement process was only for ""maritime freight"" services and that Eurotunnel ""could never have provided that capacity"" and ""could not have complied"" with the terms of the contracts. Judge Peter Fraser ruled a four-day trial will begin on 1 March given the ""obvious"" urgency of the case and the ""very important public interest matters"" involved. The government announced on Saturday it had decided to terminate its agreement with Seaborne When the Department for Transport announced the contractsin December, in documents outlining the agreements it stated that an ""unforeseeable"" situation of ""extreme urgency"" meant there was no time for the contracts to be put out to tender - the standard practice for public procurements. No-deal Brexit ferry contract scrapped Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried UK to spend Â£103m on no-deal ferries However, the BBC understands that a number of firms were considered and there was a private negotiation process. Three suppliers were awarded a total of Â£102.9m in late December, aimed at easing ""severe congestion"" at Dover, in the case of a no-deal Brexit: Â£46.6m to the French company Brittany Ferries Â£42.5m (â¬47.3m) to Danish shipping firm DFDS Â£13.8m to British firm Seaborne Freight The decision to award a contract to Seaborne, a firm with no shipswhich the BBC found had never run a ferry service before, has been heavily criticised. After Seaborne's contract collapsed Mr Grayling faced calls for his resignation, with Labour accusing him of ""rewriting the textbook on incompetence."". But Prime Minister Theresa May has said she continues to have full confidence in him. No-deal Brexit ferry contract scrapped Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal?

Secret journalist group âtargeted womenâ,"The group targeted people with rape jokes and photoshopped pornography. Several senior French journalists have been suspended or fired for allegedly co-ordinating online harassment through a private Facebook group. The largely-male Ligue du LOL (League of LOL) mocked women, including other journalists, with rape jokes and photoshopped pornographic images. Dozens of women have spoken out since the group was uncovered by the major French daily LibÃ©ration. LibÃ©ration's online editor Alexandre Hervaud is among those suspended. People in the League of LOL set up anonymous Twitter accounts in order to harass prominent journalists, writers and activists - predominantly targeting women. Vincent Glad, a well-known freelancer who also worked for LibÃ©ration, admitted founding the group in 2009. He has also been suspended from the paper. He apologised on Twitter (in French), saying that he now realised that ""such practices were unacceptable and 'LOL' was not funny at all when it is done in a pack"". Allow Twitter content?

Taxi drivers to face extra criminal checks,"Taxi and private hire drivers could have to pass enhanced criminal record checks before being granted a licence. Under theproposals,external, every council in England would be told to carry out checks on all applicants. Current guidelines allow councils to set their own driver standards, including whether to make the checks. The plans also include introducing national minimum standards and a database to stop applicants applying to councils after being refused elsewhere. Pope says priests kept nuns as sex slaves Fox host 'hasn't washed hands in 10 years' What's your area like for young people? Currently, councils in England and Wales are ""encouraged"" to check criminal records and take a ""strong stance"" on offences such as sexual assault or rape. The new proposals go further, saying the enhanced criminal checks ""should"" be carried out on drivers applying for licences. Those with specific previous convictions would face minimum bans ""in all but truly exceptional circumstances"". The Department for Transport is also considering whether cabs and private hire vehicles should have to be fitted with CCTV. The cameras would be fitted with an encrypted system so footage could only be accessed if a crime was reported. It might also bring in rules to stop taxi drivers from operating hundreds of miles away from where they are licensed. In Scotland, private hire vehicles can already only pick up fares within the local authority area which gave them their taxi-operating licence. Powers to regulate taxi drivers are devolved to the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Irish Assembly. The proposed guidelines would therefore apply only to England, but they are also expected to be applied in Wales until the devolved Welsh Government sets its own statutory guidelines. In Northern Ireland, applicants must provide an enhanced criminal record check. For those with previous convictions, the decision to grant or refuse a licence is made using the country's ownrehabilitation legislation,externalas a guide. Why is my taxi from another city? Taxi driver loses licence after guide dog refusal Taxis minister Nusrat Ghani said: ""While the vast majority of drivers are safe and act responsibly, we have seen too many cases where taxi and minicab drivers have used their job to prey on vulnerable people, women and children. ""These rules would make sure that drivers are fit to carry passengers, keeping people safe while stopping those with bad intentions from getting behind the wheel of a taxi or minicab."" Saskia Garner, of the anti-violence charity the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, told Radio 5 Live she was ""encouraged"" by plans to update safety checks guidelines but said new laws - not just guidelines - were needed to protect passengers. In 2017, according to the Department of Transport, 85% of local authorities in England required potential taxi or private-hire drivers to undergo a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check for a criminal record as well as a check on whether they were on lists prohibiting them from working with children or vulnerable adults.

MPs must hold their nerve on Brexit - May,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she would need ""some time"" to hold further talks with the EU Theresa May has promised MPs a final, decisive vote on her Brexit deal with the EU - but not until she has secured changes to the Irish backstop clause. The PM said she needed ""some time"" to get the changes she believes MPs want. She promised to update MPs again on 26 February and, if she had not got a new deal by then, to give them a say on the next steps in non-binding votes. Jeremy Corbyn accused her of ""running down the clock"" in an effort to ""blackmail"" MPs into backing her deal. Britain is currently leaving the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. Carney warns of no-deal 'economic shock' No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel Kuenssberg: Will May delay Brexit vote to last minute? Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Labour claims Mrs May is planning to delay the final, binding vote on the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU until the last possible moment, so that MPs will be faced with a stark choice between her deal and no deal. Labour and some Conservative MPs had been planning to have a fresh go at putting alternatives to Mrs May's deal to the vote on Thursday, in an effort to take control of the Brexit process. But BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May's announcement of returning to update MPs on 26 February and then more votes on 27 February - if she has still not got a final deal - meant Thursday's expected ""high noon"" for the prime minister had probably been postponed. MPs are still expected to debate and vote on amendments to the Brexit deal on Thursday, however, although it will not be known until later what those amendments are likely to be.

Mrs May promised to give MPs a ""stronger and clearer role"" in the next steps on Brexit and said she would return to the Commons for a meaningful vote on her deal ""when we achieve the progress we need"". The PM said she was discussing a number of options with the EU to secure legally-binding changes to the backstop: Replacing it with ""alternative arrangements"", putting a time limit on how long it can stay in place or a unilateral exit clause so the UK can leave it at a time of its choosing. The backstop arrangement is the ""insurance"" policy in Mrs May's deal to avoid a return to border checks on the island of Ireland. The EU has reiterated it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Mrs May said talks were at a ""crucial stage"", but she still believed it was possible to get a deal MPs could support. ""We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on time,"" Mrs May told the Commons. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said MPs were being ""blackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal"", calling it ""an irresponsible act"". By Daniel Kraemer, BBC Westminster The prime minister's critics say she is just pretending to try to get changes to the deal she signed with the EU so she can push the final vote on it right down to the wire. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says what she actually intends to do is return to Parliament after the 21-22 March European Council summit, the week before Brexit, and offer MPs a ""binary choice"" - her deal or no deal. Holding such a vote a few days before Britain leaves the EU might scare enough Labour MPs worried about a no-deal Brexit into backing the prime minister to get it through. The government insists this is not its strategy and it will hold a ""meaningful vote"" as soon as it gets the changes to the deal it is seeking from Brussels. Read more from Daniel Mr Corbyn said Mrs May was ""merely engaged in the pretence of working across Parliament to find solutions"", but she has ""not indicated she will move one iota"" on her red lines. He told MPs: ""We were promised a meaningful vote on a deal in December, it didn't happen. We were told to prepare for a further meaningful vote this week after the prime minister again promised to secure significant and legally binding changes to the backstop and that hasn't happened. ""Now the prime minister comes before the House with more excuses and more delays."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn accuses the PM of ""recklessly running down the clock"" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, was reprimanded by Commons Speaker John Bercow for shouting ""liar"" at the prime minister as she was making her statement. Mr Blackford agreed to withdraw his remark ""in deference"" to the Speaker, but did not apologise to Mrs May. MPs are banned by Commons rules from calling other MPs liars in the chamber. He said Mrs May was ""lost in a Brexit fantasy"", saying: ""We're 45 days from Scotland being dragged out of the European Union against our will - 45 days from economic catastrophe."" Conservative MP Phillip Lee, who campaigns for another EU referendum, told the BBC he expected to see more ministerial resignations at the end of the month, when some of his colleagues ""are going to have to make a stand and say: 'I'm sorry this is not acceptable'"". He said the promise of a further Commons vote on 27 February had taken the ""fizz"" out of Thursday's vote, which meant that the end of the month would ""see some action from Conservatives in government"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. New ideas for the Brexit border backstop UK signs trade deal with Switzerland Mrs May also set out plans to lift a requirement for a 21-day delay before any vote to approve an international treaty, in order to get a Brexit deal ratified in time for 29 March. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned that time was running short for the ratification of a deal under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act. Mrs May said:  ""In most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement."" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has, meanwhile, told senior European Parliament members that the UK requires legally-binding changes to the Irish backstop, but kept open the idea that these could be achieved without rewriting the text of the withdrawal agreement. On a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Barclay said he would continue working with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and he will call him after Thursday's Commons votes. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau earlier, in Paris. Following the meetings, a French Foreign ministry statement said France ""supports the planned withdrawal agreement"" and added that it was ""up to the British authorities to clarify their intentions"".

Taxi drivers to face extra criminal checksVehicles could also be fitted with CCTV as part of plans to better protect vulnerable passengers.UK,"Taxi and private hire drivers could have to pass enhanced criminal record checks before being granted a licence. Under theproposals,external, every council in England would be told to carry out checks on all applicants. Current guidelines allow councils to set their own driver standards, including whether to make the checks. The plans also include introducing national minimum standards and a database to stop applicants applying to councils after being refused elsewhere. Pope says priests kept nuns as sex slaves Fox host 'hasn't washed hands in 10 years' What's your area like for young people? Currently, councils in England and Wales are ""encouraged"" to check criminal records and take a ""strong stance"" on offences such as sexual assault or rape. The new proposals go further, saying the enhanced criminal checks ""should"" be carried out on drivers applying for licences. Those with specific previous convictions would face minimum bans ""in all but truly exceptional circumstances"". The Department for Transport is also considering whether cabs and private hire vehicles should have to be fitted with CCTV. The cameras would be fitted with an encrypted system so footage could only be accessed if a crime was reported. It might also bring in rules to stop taxi drivers from operating hundreds of miles away from where they are licensed. In Scotland, private hire vehicles can already only pick up fares within the local authority area which gave them their taxi-operating licence. Powers to regulate taxi drivers are devolved to the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Irish Assembly. The proposed guidelines would therefore apply only to England, but they are also expected to be applied in Wales until the devolved Welsh Government sets its own statutory guidelines. In Northern Ireland, applicants must provide an enhanced criminal record check. For those with previous convictions, the decision to grant or refuse a licence is made using the country's ownrehabilitation legislation,externalas a guide. Why is my taxi from another city? Taxi driver loses licence after guide dog refusal Taxis minister Nusrat Ghani said: ""While the vast majority of drivers are safe and act responsibly, we have seen too many cases where taxi and minicab drivers have used their job to prey on vulnerable people, women and children. ""These rules would make sure that drivers are fit to carry passengers, keeping people safe while stopping those with bad intentions from getting behind the wheel of a taxi or minicab."" Saskia Garner, of the anti-violence charity the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, told Radio 5 Live she was ""encouraged"" by plans to update safety checks guidelines but said new laws - not just guidelines - were needed to protect passengers. In 2017, according to the Department of Transport, 85% of local authorities in England required potential taxi or private-hire drivers to undergo a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check for a criminal record as well as a check on whether they were on lists prohibiting them from working with children or vulnerable adults. The remaining 15% of local authorities required a criminal record check, but not a check on whether they were able to  work with vulnerable people.

"Environment in multiple crises - reportPolicymakers are not grasping the seriousness of what weâre doing to the planet, a think-tank warns.Science & Environment","The ""human footprint"" is creating multiple challenges Politicians and policymakers have failed to grasp the gravity of the environmental crisis facing the Earth, a report claims. The think-tank IPPR says human impacts have reached a critical stage and threaten to destabilise society and the global economy. Scientists warn of a potentially deadly combination of factors. These include climate change, mass loss of species, topsoil erosion, forest felling and acidifying oceans. The report from the centre-leftInstitute for Public Policy Research,externalsays these factors are ""driving a complex, dynamic process of environmental destabilisation that has reached critical levels. ""This destabilisation is occurring at speeds unprecedented in human history and, in some cases, over billions of years."" America colonisation âcooled climateâ Welcome to the Meghalayan Age A manifesto to save Planet Earth (and ourselves) The IPPR warns that the window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic outcomes is rapidly closing. The authors urge three shifts in political understanding: on the scale and pace of environmental breakdown; the implications for societies; and the subsequent need for transformative change. At least climate change features in policy discussions, they say â but other vitally important impacts barely figure. Topsoil is being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes â Since the mid-20th Century, 30% of the world's arable land has become unproductive due to erosion 95% of theEarth's land areas could become degraded,externalby 2050 These matters are close to home for British politicians, the authors argue, with the average population sizes of the most threatened species in the UK havingdecreased by two-thirds since 1970,external. The UK is described asone of the most nature-depleted countries,externalin the world. Some 2.2 million tonnes ofUK topsoil is eroded annually,external, and over 17% of arable land shows signs of erosion. Nearly 85% of fertile peat topsoil in East Anglia has been lost since 1850, with the remainder at risk of being lost over next 30â60 years. The IPPR says many scientists believe we have entered a new era of rapid environmental change. The report warns: ""We define this as the 'age of environmental breakdown' to better highlight the severity of the scale, pace and implications of environmental destabilisation resulting from aggregate human activity."" Simon Lewis, Professor of Global Change Science at University College London, told BBC News: ""IPPR are right to say that environmental change is happening ever-faster and threatens to destabilise society. ""Future problems with food supplies could cause price spikes that drive civil unrest, while increases in levels of migration can strain societies. ""Both together could overload political institutions and global networks of trade. ""This century will be marked by rapid social and environmental change - that is certain. What is less clear is if societies can make wise political choices to avoid disaster in the future."" Harriet Bulkeley, a geography professor at Durham University, told BBC News that the IPPR paper was a good interpretation of the current evidence, but she said it raised the question of how firm evidence of environmental threats had to be to prompt government action. ""We know lots of good things to do,"" she said, ""but often the argument is made that we need to have 'evidence-based policy'. ""This can, of course, be used as an excuse for delay. So, I guess the question is how much more evidence is needed for action?"" A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to leaving our environment in a better state than we found it through our 25 Year Environment Plan and the forthcoming Environment Bill. ""Over 25 years we will replenish depleted soils, rid our seas and rivers of the rubbish trashing our planet, cut greenhouse gas emissions, cleanse our air of toxic pollutants, and develop cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. ""The Environment Bill will also create a new environmental body, the Office for Environmental Protection, to hold us to account on this commitment.""

'Most congested' roads in UK revealed,"Congestion is estimated to have cost the UK an estimated Â£8bn in 2018 Motorists on the UK's most congested road spend an average of two and a half days a year sitting in traffic. Taxi drivers try to avoid the worst offender - London's A406 North Circular Road from Chiswick Roundabout to Hanger Lane - ""at all costs"", says one firm. Traffic data firm Inrix said drivers lost the equivalent of a week each to jams in 2018. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was investing in public transport to ease congestion. Road users lost an average of 178 hours each to congestion in 2018 in total across all roads, Inrix said. It estimated the value of the time lost at about Â£7.9bn or Â£1,317 per driver. London's drivers lost about 227 hours each on average, compared with 190 hours in Belfast, 165 in Edinburgh and 143 in Cardiff. Traffic building up on the North Circular Road at Hanger Lane at about 08:30 GMT on Monday Traffic on the North Circular road between Chiswick Roundabout and Hanger Lane can start building as early as 04:30, according to taxi firm owner Manoj Teji. Mr Teji, 51, who has lived and worked near the road all his life, said:  ""I can't see any solution to it."" He said the ""bottleneck"" road had had to cope with an increasing number of cars coming off the M4 and A40 in recent years, adding that drivers sometimes had no choice but to use the route, but where possible they avoid it ""at all costs"". Benjamin Menyhart said he was ""surprised"" the road had been named the most congested in the UK But Benjamin Menyhart, 27, who manages a hotel just off the A406 in Ealing, said although the road was quite busy, ""I wouldn't have thought [it was] worse than some of the bigger routes in London."" Derek Kliger said the stretch was ""congested and slow"" but better than other parts of the North Circular Minicab driver Derek Kliger, 64, from Richmond said the road had not got any worse over the past three decades. ""It's a major circular route, and if people want to avoid the congestion charge it's the way you get from east to west London."" Chinese New Year: Pigs and pandas on England's streets Human faeces found on train seats New York taxi crash amputee gets payout Rod Dennis, from the RAC, said although congestion was seen by some as ""a marker of a successful city"" there was an ""enormous cost"" attached to it for drivers and for air pollution levels. ""Those cities that are best placed to grow will be those that are developing public transport systems that suit the needs of their citizens, and successfully decide the role the private car should play alongside these,"" he said. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said Manchester needed powers and funding to tackle congestion. ""I've called on government to give us these powers now and let us get a grip of the congestion that plagues our city-region."" he said. A spokeswoman for the DfT said the government was investing Â£23bn into the UK's roads, with Â£2.5bn to support ""innovative public transport schemes"" to help ease congestion in urban areas. Transport for London said it was taking ""bold"" measures to reduce congestion, including extending the congestion charge to private hire vehicles. A spokesman said it was also looking to make sure companies doing road an utilities work around the capital were ""better coordinated"", and delivery companies ""more efficient"".

Regarded as one of the game's greatest in his position, Banks was named Fifa goalkeeper of the year six times and earned 73 caps for England. He is perhaps best known for his wonder save from Pele during the1970 World Cupagainst Brazil. Born in Sheffield, he won the League Cup with Stoke and Leicester, before retiring in 1973.

""I was proud to call him a team-mate. Obviously we shared that great day in 1966 but it was more than that.

""I patted him on his head, and I said 'why didn't you catch it?' and the abuse that came back was unbelievable. ""He was the best at that time.

Arrest over mental health centre blaze,"All patients and staff have been transferred to other centres, police say A man has been arrested on suspicion of arson after a blaze broke out at a mental health centre in Staffordshire. The 43-year-old, from Tamworth, was detained over the fire at the George Bryan Centre near the Sir Robert Peel Community Hospital in the town. There were no reports of casualties in the fire, which broke out at about 20:50 GMT on Monday. Staffordshire Police said all occupants and staff were evacuated from the centre. Eighteen patients were on the west wing unit, which cares for adults who are acutely mentally ill, at the time of the blaze and have been moved to alternative locations. A spokesman from Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (MPFT), which runs the centre, said the east wing remained occupied but this was subject to an ""ongoing review"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Chief executive Neil Carr said it was ""a traumatic and distressing event"" and the trust would ""ensure that all those affected receive whatever help and care they need"". The fire broke out at about 20:50 GMT on Monday A voluntary female patient absconded during the commotion but was found soon afterwards, a police spokesman told the BBC. The fire service said about 20 people were evacuated from the centre, in Plantation Lane, Mile Oak. A Staffordshire fire service spokesman said ""quite a lot of the building"" had been involved in the blaze and an investigation was under way to determine the cause. Ten crews from Staffordshire, West Midlands and Warwickshire fire services were deployed. There were no reports of casualties in the fire Firefighters are expected to remain at the scene for ""some time"" damping down and checking for hot spots. Witness Bradley Stokes said the blaze could be seen from Tamworth town centre and he had ""never seen anything like this before"". Christopher Pincher, the Conservative MP for Tamworth, tweeted that he was ""very concerned"" by the fire. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Deal reached to avert new US shutdown,"This video can not be played President Trump told supporters in El Paso, ""we're building the wall anyway"" Democrats and Republicans have reached an agreement in principle over border security to fund the US government and avert another partial shutdown. The agreement contains only a fraction of the money President Donald Trump wants for his promised border wall and does not mention a concrete barrier. The deal still needs to be approved by Congress and signed by the president. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Trump said of the deal: ""I can't say I'm happy, I can't say I'm thrilled."" He told reporters he would have a meeting about the agreement later on Tuesday. The Democrats - who now control the House of Representatives - have refused to approve the $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) for Mr Trump's wall on the border with Mexico, one of his key campaign pledges. What is a government shutdown? How the last US shutdown hurt Lawmakers expressed optimism that a bill would be approved by Friday when funding runs out for some federal agencies. The previous shutdown - the longest in US history - lasted 35 days andcost the country's economy an estimated $11bn (Â£8.5bn).,external Details have yet to be released but aides familiar with the negotiations say it includes $1.375bn in funding for 55 miles (88km) of new fencing at the border, a small part of the more than 2,000 miles promised by the president. The barrier would be built in the Rio Grande Valley, in Texas, using existing designs, such as metal slats, instead of the concrete wall that Mr Trump had demanded. There was also an agreement to reduce the number of beds in detention centres to 40,250 from the current 49,057, reports say. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? The talks had reached an impasse earlier with Republicans strongly rejecting Democrats' demands for a limit to the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who could be detained by immigration authorities. The deal was struck in a closed-door meeting in Washington on Monday evening after several hours of talks. ""We got an agreement on all of it,"" Republican Senator Richard Shelby said. ""Our staffs are going to be working feverishly to put all the particulars together. We believe that if this becomes law, it'll keep open the government."" Trump's border wall in seven charts Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? But, by Monday night, some of the president's conservative allies had already denounced the deal, with Fox News commentator Sean Hannity calling it a ""garbage compromise"". House Freedom Caucus leader Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina said the agreement failed ""to address the critical priorities outlined by Border Patrol Chiefs"". Allow Twitter content?

Speakingon CNN,externalon Tuesday, Democratic Representative Nita Lowey, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a key negotiator of the deal, said: ""This is a compromise. No one got everything they wanted."" She said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" the deal would pass. If there was one thing Democratic and Republican congressional negotiators could agree on, it's that another government shutdown would be very bad news. Republicans feared the public would again blame them for the impasse. Democrats were concerned that federal workers, a key constituency, would face further financial strain. All that was left was to reach a compromise that allowed both sides to claim a bit of victory. They finally did - and the contours of the agreement look a lot like what was on the table last December, before the president, at the behest of his conservative base, instigated the current crisis. According to reports, there's some new wall money, but no more than had been agreed to last summer. There's also funding for ""border security"", including better technology and increased screening at ports of entry, which is the real source of most drug smuggling. Donald Trump may grouse, but since he's already claiming his wall is being built - ""finish the wall"" is his new slogan - he probably will find a way to tout the deal as a success. Democrats bent during negotiations, but didn't break. Both sides will lick their wounds and prepare for the next fight. In a crowded stadium with banners saying ""Finish the Wall"" in El Paso, in Texas on Monday night, Mr Trump told supporters: ""Walls work... Walls save lives."" He repeated that a border fence in the city, opposite Ciudad JuÃ¡rez in Mexico, ""made a big difference"", even though critics reject his claim as exaggerated and based on misleading data. This video can not be played A Trump supporter shoves a BBC cameraman at the El Paso rally ""We need the wall, and it has to be built,"" said Mr Trump, who has previously threatened to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without Congress. The idea, however, is disliked even by some fellow Republicans, and Democrats are likely to challenge it in the courts. The president has backed away from calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall, a point he repeatedly made during his presidential campaign, and has already acknowledged that the barrier to be built may not be made of concrete. Trump's wall: How tech fills the gaps How much of the wall is built already? As the president spoke, Beto O'Rourke, a former Democratic congressman and potential presidential candidate in 2020, held a counter-rally, accusing Mr Trump of stoking false fear about immigrants with ""lies"". On 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement. The shutdown was triggered after Democrats denied the president funding for his promised wall on the border with Mexico, and Mr Trump refused to budge. This video can not be played Just why did the US government partially shut down? During the last shutdown, hundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed (put on unpaid leave) in December and January while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay.

"Online news sites 'should be regulated'Google and Facebook should be overseen to ensure their news content is trustworthy, a report recommends.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Dame Frances Cairncross explains the findings of her review into the future of the UK news industry A regulator should oversee tech giants like Google and Facebook to ensure their news content is trustworthy, a government-backed report has suggested. The Cairncross Review into the future of UK news said such sites should help users identify fake news and ""nudge people towards news of high quality"". The review also said Ofcom should assess the BBC's impact on online news on other providers. In addition, the report called for a new Institute for Public Interest News. Such a body, it said, could work in a similar way to the Arts Council, channelling public and private funding to ""those parts of the industry it deemed most worthy of support"". Last local paper closes, so ring MP for news Amol Rajan's media predictions for 2019 Governments v social media The report said Facebook and Google need to give more prominence to public interest news The independent review, undertaken by former journalist Dame Frances Cairncross, was tasked with investigating the sustainability of high-quality journalism. Its recommendations include measures to tackle ""the uneven balance of power"" between news publishers and online platforms that distribute their content. Services such as Facebook, Google and Apple should continue their attempts to help readers understand how reliable a story is, and the process that decides which stories are shown should be more transparent, it says. ""Their efforts should be placed under regulatory scrutiny - this task is too important to leave entirely to the judgment of commercial entities,"" according to the report. Could a digital regulator stop the spread of so-called 'fake news'? A regulator would initially only assess how well these sites are performing - but if this doesn't work, the report warns ""it may be necessary to impose stricter provisions"". Yet the report falls short of requiring Facebook, Google and other tech giants to pay for the news they distribute via their platforms. Dame Frances told the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan that ""draconian and risky"" measures could result in firms such as Google withdrawing their news services altogether. ""There are a number of ways we have suggested technology companies could behave differently and could be made to behave differently,"" she said. ""But they are mostly ways that don't immediately involve legislation."" The review was not asked to comment specifically on the BBC but concluded that curtailing the corporation's news offering would be counter-productive after hearing arguments from other publishers that the BBC reporting on so-called ""soft content"" online was crowding out other news providers. The review noted that the BBC Charter states the corporation should endeavour to reach all demographics, and that stories of this type are essential to appeal to an increasingly elusive younger audience. The BBC also argues that ""soft content"" stories may attract users who might then click onwards to a public-interest news story. The review said the BBC was delivering high quality journalism but suggested it ""could do more and think more carefully about how its news provision can act as a complement, rather than a substitute, for private news provision"". Dame Frances also recommended an exploration of the market impact of BBC News, conducted by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, to find whether it is 'striking the right balance' and driving traffic to other, commercial providers. The BBC should do more to share its technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, the report concluded. The review suggests it would 'make little sense to curtail the BBC' Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson urged the government to tackle Google and Facebook's ""duopoly"" in the digital advertising market, and said Dame Frances was ""barking up the wrong tree"" in recommending an inquiry into the BBC's online news output. Meanwhile, former director general of the BBC Greg Dyke defended the role of the corporation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It seems to me that at a time when large American media companies - the likes of Netflix and the rest of it - are going to come to dominate in the world, for the BBC to be cutting back on anything will be a mistake. ""The importance of the BBC is going to grow in the next 10 years, not decline."" Frances Cairncross earned widespread respect as a journalist for her hard-headed and pragmatic approach to economics. That pragmatism is the very reason the government commissioned her to look at the future of high-quality news - and also the reason many in local and regional media will be disappointed by her recommendations. What is most notable about her review is what it doesn't do. It doesn't suggest all social media should be regulated in the UK It doesn't suggest social media companies pay for the privilege of using news content It doesn't suggest social media companies be treated as publishers, with legal liability for all that appears on their platform This is because the practicalities of doing these things are difficult, and experience shows that the likes of Google will simply pull out of markets that don't suit them. There are concrete measures that could boost local news, from tax relief to an extension of the Local Democracy Reporting Service. And Dame Frances certainly seemed cognisant of the argument that BBC News has over-reached, to the extent that it is harming the commercial sector. But this is a matter for Ofcom. Ultimately, as this report acknowledges, when it comes to news, convenience is king. The speed, versatility and zero cost of so much news now means that, even if it is of poor quality, a generation of consumers has fallen out of the habit of paying for news. But quality costs. If quality news has a future, consumers will have to pay. That's the main lesson of this report. The report recommends ""new codes of conduct"" whose implementation would be supervised by a regulator ""with powers to insist on compliance"". Other recommendations included: Tax relief to encourage the provision of local journalism Expanding financial support for local news by extending the BBC'sLocal Democracy Reporting Service An investigation of the online advertising market, conducted by the Competition and Markets Authority, to ensure fair competition The Barnsley Chronicle goes to press in September 2017 One local newspaper editor welcomed the report's recommendations but said it ""comes too late for so many once proud and important community newspapers"". The Yorkshire Post's James Mitchinson said: ""The various fiscal reviews and recommendations... must come quickly... if we are to turn the Cairncross Review into something which we look back upon as being instrumental in preserving what we do for generations to come."" Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said some of its suggestions could be acted upon ""immediately"", while others would need ""further careful consideration"".

New talks aim to avert US shutdownNegotiators hope to reach a border security deal to head off another government closure on Friday.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Nick Kwek toured the border dividing the US state of Arizona and Mexico's Sonora Democratic and Republican negotiators are working into the night to try to reach a deal on border security and avoid another government shutdown. They remain divided on the detention of undocumented immigrants and on funding for President Donald Trump's promised border wall with Mexico. Mr Trump said on Monday ""it is up Democrats"" to make a deal or take the blame for a renewed shutdown. The previous shutdown lasted 35 days and was the longest in US history. Congress has until Friday to pass legislation before the current federal funding agreement runs out. The previous shutdown ended on 25 January as lawmakers agreed to negotiate. If a new agreement is not reached by both the House of Representatives and the Senate - and signed by the president - a partial government shutdown will begin again on Saturday. What is a government shutdown? How the last US shutdown hurt Trump's wall: How tech fills the gaps During the last shutdown, hundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed (put on unpaid leave) in December and January while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay. Mr Trump approved a congressional measure to pay back federal workers last month, but many say they have yet to receive their paycheques, according to US media. It remains unclear whether contracted workers will get any such payments. The shutdown's cost to the US economy wasestimated at $11bn (Â£8.5bn).,external The talks are taking place in Washington, just as President Trump is about to hold a rally in the border city of El Paso, in Texas, aimed at gathering support for the border wall. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy and Republican Senator Richard Shelby said they hoped to strike a deal on Monday. Sen Leahy said the goal was to ""wrap this up tonight, do it tonight and not tomorrow"". Some 17 Republican and Democratic negotiators from the Senate and the House have been holding talks to try to reach a border security agreement that can be accepted by Congress. The latest impasse seems to be centred on a Democratic demand to limit the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Democrats want to cap the number of beds at detention centres reserved for those cases at 16,500. By doing that, they hope to force ICE to focus on detaining irregular migrants with criminal records instead of those who have overstayed their visas and, Democrats say, are productive and offer no threat. This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? ICE Deputy Director Matt Albence said on Monday that the proposal would be ""damaging to public safety"". ""This is a crucial public safety issueâ¦ There really shouldn't be a debate about us taking dangerous criminals and immigration violators off the street and out of our communities,"" he said during a White House conference call with reporters. On Monday, Mr Trump tweeted that the ""Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!."" During a later White House event before his departure for Texas Mr Trump continued the attack: ""Not only don't they want to give us the money for the wall, they don't want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers."" The Democrats are also looking at between $1.3bn and $2bn in funding for Mr Trump's proposed border wall, a long way off the $5.7bn the president has been demanding.

As wall discussions labour on, Mr Trump plans on sending more than 3,700 active troops to the US-Mexico border to help agents with security efforts this month. With more than 2,000 troops already at the border, the new deployment would top November's mid-term election-time numbers of 5,900. Meanwhile, pushing back against the Trump administration's call for border states to help with security, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has recalled hundreds of the state's national guard from the border. Gov Newsom's move follows that of his Democratic colleague, Gov Michelle Grisham of New Mexico, who pulled her state's troops from the border last week. Both governors have cited the withdrawal as retaliation against Mr Trump's ""fear-mongering"". On 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement. That funding ends at midnight on Friday.Another short-term deal could prevent a new shutdown,external, according to the New York Times.

Rudd links food bank rise to benefit problems,"Amber Rudd took over the Department for Work and Pensions in November 2018 Amber Rudd says the increased use of food banks is partly down to problems in rolling out universal credit. The work and pensions secretary said she was ""absolutely clear there were challenges with the initial roll-out"" of the benefit and that the difficulty in accessing money was ""one of the causes"" of the rise. But she said the government had made changes to help tackle food insecurity. Food bank operator Trussell Trust said it was a ""promising"" acknowledgement. Universal credit has been plagued with problems since its inception in 2010. The monthly payment merges six different benefits for working age people into one and has been subject to a gradual roll-out across the UK. The system was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, but it has faced numerous delays and is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. Research released by the Trussell Trust charity this month showedthe use of food banks had increased by 52% in areas where universal credit had been in place for a year or more,external- compared with 13% in areas where it had not been. What is universal credit? Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Vote on big universal credit rollout delayed Speaking in the Commons, Ms Rudd said the government was ""committed to a strong safety net where people need it"". ""It is absolutely clear that there were challenges with the initial roll-out of universal credit,"" she added. ""The main issue which led to an increase in food bank use could have been the fact that people had difficulty accessing their money early enough. ""We have made changes to accessing universal credit so that people can have advances, so that there is a legacy run-on after two weeks of housing benefit, and we believe that will help with food and security."" This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? Pushed again on the cause of the issue by Labour's Stephen Timms, Ms Rudd added: ""I have acknowledged that people having difficulty accessing the money on time as one of the causes of the growth in food banks, but we have tried to address that."" The Department for Work and Pensions has said that, under universal credit, people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer. According to the Resolution Foundation think tank, 2.2 million families are expected to gain under the system, with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week. However, 3.2 million families are also expected to be worse off, with an average loss of Â£48 a week. Labour has called for ministers to halt the roll-out ""as a matter of urgency"". Natalie Williams, from King's Church food bank in Hastings, East Sussex, which is in Ms Rudd's constituency, told BBC Radio 5 Live she was ""really pleased"" to hear the secretary of state's comments, but it was ""long overdue"". She said her food bank had seen a 106% increase in referrals in the last two years. ""People are struggling with the wait from when they claim to when they get money,"" she said. ""People don't want to take the advance because they don't want to get into debt. ""There is a lot that needs to be fixed about Universal Credit."" Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: ""It's promising to see the secretary of state is listening to the evidence of food banks across the UK. ""We're a country that prides itself on making sure proper support is in place for each other when help is most needed - our benefits system was created to do exactly this. But Universal Credit isn't the poverty-fighting reform that was promised."" Ms Revie called for action to address why the new welfare system has forced some people to food banks.

Jeremy Corbyn accused her of ""running down the clock"" in an effort to ""blackmail"" MPs into backing her deal. Britain is currently leaving the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. Carney warns of no-deal 'economic shock' No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel Kuenssberg: Will May delay Brexit vote to last minute? Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Labour claims Mrs May is planning to delay the final, binding vote on the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU until the last possible moment, so that MPs will be faced with a stark choice between her deal and no deal. Labour and some Conservative MPs had been planning to have a fresh go at putting alternatives to Mrs May's deal to the vote on Thursday, in an effort to take control of the Brexit process. But BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May's announcement of returning to update MPs on 26 February and then more votes on 27 February - if she has still not got a final deal - meant Thursday's expected ""high noon"" for the prime minister had probably been postponed. MPs are still expected to debate and vote on amendments to the Brexit deal on Thursday, however, although it will not be known until later what those amendments are likely to be.

Mrs May promised to give MPs a ""stronger and clearer role"" in the next steps on Brexit and said she would return to the Commons for a meaningful vote on her deal ""when we achieve the progress we need"". The PM said she was discussing a number of options with the EU to secure legally-binding changes to the backstop: Replacing it with ""alternative arrangements"", putting a time limit on how long it can stay in place or a unilateral exit clause so the UK can leave it at a time of its choosing. The backstop arrangement is the ""insurance"" policy in Mrs May's deal to avoid a return to border checks on the island of Ireland. The EU has reiterated it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Mrs May said talks were at a ""crucial stage"", but she still believed it was possible to get a deal MPs could support. ""We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on time,"" Mrs May told the Commons. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said MPs were being ""blackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal"", calling it ""an irresponsible act"". By Daniel Kraemer, BBC Westminster The prime minister's critics say she is just pretending to try to get changes to the deal she signed with the EU so she can push the final vote on it right down to the wire. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says what she actually intends to do is return to Parliament after the 21-22 March European Council summit, the week before Brexit, and offer MPs a ""binary choice"" - her deal or no deal. Holding such a vote a few days before Britain leaves the EU might scare enough Labour MPs worried about a no-deal Brexit into backing the prime minister to get it through. The government insists this is not its strategy and it will hold a ""meaningful vote"" as soon as it gets the changes to the deal it is seeking from Brussels. Read more from Daniel Mr Corbyn said Mrs May was ""merely engaged in the pretence of working across Parliament to find solutions"", but she has ""not indicated she will move one iota"" on her red lines. He told MPs: ""We were promised a meaningful vote on a deal in December, it didn't happen. We were told to prepare for a further meaningful vote this week after the prime minister again promised to secure significant and legally binding changes to the backstop and that hasn't happened. ""Now the prime minister comes before the House with more excuses and more delays."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn accuses the PM of ""recklessly running down the clock"" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, was reprimanded by Commons Speaker John Bercow for shouting ""liar"" at the prime minister as she was making her statement. Mr Blackford agreed to withdraw his remark ""in deference"" to the Speaker, but did not apologise to Mrs May. MPs are banned by Commons rules from calling other MPs liars in the chamber. He said Mrs May was ""lost in a Brexit fantasy"", saying: ""We're 45 days from Scotland being dragged out of the European Union against our will - 45 days from economic catastrophe."" Conservative MP Phillip Lee, who campaigns for another EU referendum, told the BBC he expected to see more ministerial resignations at the end of the month, when some of his colleagues ""are going to have to make a stand and say: 'I'm sorry this is not acceptable'"". He said the promise of a further Commons vote on 27 February had taken the ""fizz"" out of Thursday's vote, which meant that the end of the month would ""see some action from Conservatives in government"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. New ideas for the Brexit border backstop UK signs trade deal with Switzerland Mrs May also set out plans to lift a requirement for a 21-day delay before any vote to approve an international treaty, in order to get a Brexit deal ratified in time for 29 March. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned that time was running short for the ratification of a deal under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act. Mrs May said:  ""In most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement."" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has, meanwhile, told senior European Parliament members that the UK requires legally-binding changes to the Irish backstop, but kept open the idea that these could be achieved without rewriting the text of the withdrawal agreement. On a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Barclay said he would continue working with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and he will call him after Thursday's Commons votes. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau earlier, in Paris. Following the meetings, a French Foreign ministry statement said France ""supports the planned withdrawal agreement"" and added that it was ""up to the British authorities to clarify their intentions"".

A resolution to months of Brexit indecision?,"Look away now if you are of a nervous disposition. This week's Brexit votes may not come to much. The prime minister is essentially asking for more time to get something to show for her promise of changes to the controversial backstop. That might mean that she's back before the end of this month with something concrete to vote on. Or it may well not. I know that sounds nebulous, a word you might choose to use. But there's a building impression in Westminster, and in Brussels, that there simply won't be a resolution to these months of indecision until weeks before, maybe even days before we are due to leave (that's why some cabinet ministers believe that, even though it's not desirable, the government may end up asking to extend the whole process as we discussed here before). May to give Brexit update on Tuesday May to EU: Back changes to Brexit deal EU's Verhofstadt welcomes Corbyn's letter What's behind Corbyn's letter to May? It was hard to find anyone in Brussels last week who believed that they would offer any crumbs to the prime minister until the final, final moment when what was described to me as a ""facesaver"", will indeed be found. And at the start of this Westminster week, it's hard to find anyone in Westminster who is confident that there will be any ending to the drama much before the end of March. There is a summit with EU leaders where the prime minister will gather with her counterparts seven days before the departure date of 29 March. And while it seems like the kind of kamikaze politics the UK doesn't tend to do, traditionally at least, there is growing expectation, horrific to some, exciting to others, that the prime minister may well not come back with her final deal that she wants them to vote on until after that. As one senior MP suggested today, ""imagine the mood in the house"" that night. Cynics would suggest that has for months now been Theresa May's dastardly plan - run the clock as low as she can - and allow the pressure of time to build and build, until it's unbearable. MPs will almost vote, so the theory goes, for anything then, because they can't stand the prospect of the turmoil of leaving without a formal deal done. And shortly before, the government will have eked out some new legal verbiage from the EU that gives an impression of a time limit, that the DUP and the Eurosceptics will be challenged to dispute. Having watched every twist of this story, I'm not so sure this is a real plan that's long in the making. It seems the accident of where things are now, rather than the design of where Number 10 might have hoped to be. If Number 10 had been able to conclude all of this already, it seems to me they would have done so, eagerly. Some MPs also report a growing mood among their constituents just to get on with it, even if that means leaving without a deal. But the politics, or as their many critics would have it, Number 10's mishandling of the politics, have made getting things sorted at a much earlier date just impossible. And now there is building expectation that the power of the clock is the strongest muscle that Number 10 has to flex. That's why what happens in the Commons in the next couple of weeks, that could change that timetable matters so much. We are still on the same merry-go-round, we may be going faster and faster, but it's not completely possible to tell when the music will actually stop.

'I struggle to get by on universal credit',"Adele Shelmerdine has struggled since moving to universal credit last year. The 49-year-old Wirral resident had debts, and says the switch to the new benefits system left her suicidal. Now a debt charity has called on the government to take account of affordability when assessing claims. The Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We understand the burden that debt can place on people and safeguards are in place to ensure repayments are affordable and sustainable."" Universal credit has proved controversial almost from the beginning, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends and administrative problems. Last week the government performedanother U-turn over the systemafter the work and pensions secretary ditched plans to extend a benefits cap on families of more than two children. Adele has been on benefits for two decades because of a number of disabilities. She has asthma and back problems, as well as mental health issues. ""There are certain jobs I can't do - I can't sit down for ages or stand up for ages because of my back. I also can't walk far."" She used to be on employment and support allowance (ESA) but moved a year ago to the Wirral from Stockport to escape a flat with no heating and unpleasant neighbours. ""I thought it would be a fresh start for me, but the first thing I had to do was an assessment for universal credit after which my money was cut by around Â£350 a month. Reality Check: What's the problem with universal credit? Single mums win universal credit challenge Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? ""I was struggling and didn't know what to do. I used to have a lifestyle, I don't anymore. ""It was just loads of worry. I ended up thinking, what's the point of living?"" She's had to start all over again and try to get by on what she calls ""basic money"". ""I've got priorities in my life - pay the rent and bills and have food in the cupboards. Anything else is a bonus. ""But I'm stuck in a flat with nowhere to go."" She's now taking steps to tackle her money woes with the help of a debt charity. ""I really want to sort things out, but it's a struggle,"" she said. Many people on universal credit are acutely suffering, according to debt charity Christians Against Poverty. It warns that the new welfare system is not taking into account of people's full financial picture. Chief executive Matt Barlow said: ""We are seeing more and more unworkable budgets - people left with Â£10 a month for food or people who went through insolvency with us but are getting back in touch because they in debt again, due to universal credit. ""The truth is most people find themselves in debt as soon as they start to claim."" Problems stem from the multiple deductions made at source which leave people confused, powerless and in constant hardship. Deductions are routinely made at source for unpaid utility bills, council tax, court fines as well as the repayment of any advance made to help someone through the five-week wait without income during the universal credit application process. Payment advances given to cover the five weeks without income have to be paid back over 12 months, and from October 2021, that will change to 16 months. These are allowed to total up to 40% of someone's standard allowance, a figure that will reduce to 30% from October this year. Previously, on legacy benefits, DWP deductions were taken at a maximum of 25%, although other government agencies could also make deductions. Mr Barlow said: ""The changes were announced in the autumn Budget so government realises these deductions are unworkable for people. However, none of this framework takes into the account someone's whole financial picture and that is the key issue."" CAP has called for repayments to be calculated by looking at someone's affordability rather than setting a rigid timeframe. A DWP spokesperson said: ""Our jobcentres can offer budgeting help, signpost people to debt support and set up alternative payment arrangements. ""We have also announced a new partnership with Citizens Advice to deliver universal support, which includes help managing finances."" How are universal credit rules changing?
