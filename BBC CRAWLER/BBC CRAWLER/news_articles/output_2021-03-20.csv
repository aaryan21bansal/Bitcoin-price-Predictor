Musk denies Teslas are used for spying in China,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk questioned the wisdom of companies spying on foreign governments Elon Musk, the chief executive of the US electric carmaker Tesla, says his firm would be ""shut down"" if its vehicles were used for spying on China. His comments came in response to reports that China's military had banned Tesla cars from its facilities. The military had raised security concerns about the data collected by cameras installed in the cars. China is Tesla's largest market after the US, accounting for about a quarter of the firm's global sales in 2020. On Saturday, Mr Musk said if a business did engage in spying on a foreign government, ""the negative effects for that company would be extremely bad"". ""There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,"" Mr Musk told an influential Chinese business forum via video link. ""If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk played down Chinese and American concerns over commercial espionage There has long been unease about the presence of big American companies operating in China and vice versa. Relations between China and the US - the world's biggest two economies - are at their most strained for years. Earlier this week, officials from both countries traded angry words inthe first high-level talks between the Chinese government and the administration of US President Joe Biden. Mr Musk urged greater mutual trust between China and the US, where Tesla is based in California. He sought to downplay concerns over companies sharing sensitive data with their home governments, referencing the case of the Chinese-owned video platform TikTok. Last year,former President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the USover concerns that users' data could be handed over to the Chinese government. ""Even if there was spying, what would the other country learn and would it actually matter?,"" Mr Musk said. Elon Musk's car firm won approval for its Shanghai factory in 2018, becoming the first foreign automaker to operate a wholly owned plant in China. China is the world's largest car market and its government has been heavily promoting the adoption of electric vehicles. This demand helped Tesla make a profit of $721m (Â£519m) in 2020.

'No light at end of tunnel' for wedding businesses,"Claire Vessey and David McQueen said they were keen to marry after a difficult year Wedding businesses say there is ""no light at the end of the tunnel"" and are relying on personal savings to survive. Couples who have planned, cancelled, then re-planned their special day say they are hoping to say ""I do"" instead of ""what can I do?"" as lockdown eases. But with no date set for wedding receptions, there remains confusion over whether plans for 2021 will fall foul of future guidelines. The Welsh government said the law had changed to expand the range of venues. A week ago First Minister Mark Drakeford set out how various sectors in society would be reopened - like non-essential shops, hairdressers and outdoor sports - but weddings were not mentioned in his plans. On Friday the Welsh government said as long as case rates remained low and vaccination numbers continued, weddings would be ""considered"" from 22 April. At present receptions are banned andthe number of ceremony guests depends on how many people from different households a venue can safely keep 2m apart. Kris Agland, managing director of venue St Peter's Hall in Cardiff, said the guidance around weddings was ""being handled appallingly"" and called for more dialogue between the hospitality industry and those in power. ""There's no clear guidance. It's been a kind of one-size-fits-all approach,"" he said. ""Come and see what we're doing - do you feel safe? Why can't someone from the trade be part of their conversations?"" Photographer Mary Watler-Thomas said her hours had been cut for weddings because receptions could not be held He said he spent about Â£10,000 making Covid-compliant additions to the venue, which usually hosts 50 to 60 wedding receptions each year. ""No-one will book anything until they know what the guidance is,"" he said. ""Everything is based on what-ifs. Financially as a business it's crippled it. Personally, it's just got me further and further into debt just like everybody else who owns hospitality businesses. ""When things do come back they're going to come back with such a boom that you've got to see yourselves through to that position. But at what stage do people say, 'well I can't see it through'?"" Wedding photographer Mary Watler-Thomas, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said some ceremonies had been ""surreal"", including couples being told to wear masks during the ceremony. ""Last year I was set to cover 20 [weddings] but I had quite a few postponed so ended up doing 10. But this year I'm set to do 27, fingers crossed,"" she said. ""When people want to postpone they're worried they won't be able to have all their guests there, they want to postpone but I'm not available for their new date. ""Because they haven't given a date for hospitality [couples are] reducing the day to just the ceremony. I've had to reduce the time to two hours where I used to cover 12 hours so it's had a massive impact on income because you're reducing the day by 10 hours. ""There's been so much confusion... a lot of questions in the minds of those planning what it'll look like in Wales, so it would be very helpful to have a roadmap in Wales."" Claire Vessey's mother Maureen died at the start of the first lockdown Claire Vessey, 46, from Treboeth, Swansea, and her fiancÃ©e David McQueen, 54, from Morriston, have been together for nine years and put off getting married while caring for Claire's elderly mum, Maureen. When Maureen, 86, died at the start of the first lockdown, the couple - who had previously had a blessing at the Sacred Heart church in Swansea - decided to make her dream come true. Will weddings be back this summer? What are the key dates for lifting lockdown? ""The wedding would be one thing she would want us to do,"" said Ms Vessey, an administration manager for fire protection services. ""Us being happy together, that's what she would have loved. ""We incorporated what she would want too, so we can feel like she's there. She loved butterflies so that's part of our theme. She's a massive part of the day."" But Covid restrictions meant the couple had to plan for various outcomes. They still have not confirmed their guest list. ""We booked it for 15 May. It has been so hard with all the restrictions and so many obstacles put in our way,"" said Ms Vessey. ""It's like we have been planning two weddings. One for original plans - church wedding with a late reception - and also back-up plans if restrictions do not lift, which is looking like what we will have to go with. ""But these plans are all still not confirmed. Everything is up in the air and the weeks are flying by - we never thought it would be so stressful."" Despite the stress, the couple said there were benefits to keeping the wedding simple. Ms Vessey said: ""When people planned weddings in the past, they planned this big wedding with all these people, but when you break it down it's about two people that really love each other. He's my first real boyfriend and my first love. ""It's about David and I now. We've concentrated on what's important for us two, which is what it's really about."" Bridal boutique owner Helen Pembridge said brides were ""desperate"" to buy dresses in case there was another lockdown In Scotland,wedding receptions - but without alcohol - can take placewith up to 50 people from 26 April. Wedding ceremonies in Northern Ireland are currently limited to 25 people and receptions are banned. Butdates for lockdown easing reviewsare set for 15 April, 13 May and 10 June. From 29 March in England, weddings can be attended by a maximum of six people. This will rise to 15 after 12 April if Covid rates remain low, increasing to a limit of 30 after 17 May.Receptions are included in the plans,but only in certain venues. Helen Pembridge, who runs a bridal boutique in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, said many brides who had already had to cancel appointments three or four times were ""desperate"" to get dresses in case there was another lockdown. ""Brides I'm getting calls from are not even getting married until October 2022, but they want to get their dresses now because they're afraid they won't be able to if we have to shut again for a couple of months,"" she said. The Welsh government has alreadyset out different rules for weddings at different alert levels,external. At alert level four, for instance, receptions are banned but at alert level two a maximum of 30 people can attend an indoors reception and 50 outdoors, and venues are still subject to any additional rules set at that time on hospitality. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We know many couples have made the difficult decision to postpone their wedding because of the ongoing pandemic. ""The current restrictions allow for the legal marriage ceremony to take place and we have changed the law to expand the range of venues where ceremonies can be performed. ""These are challenging times for everyone, especially those working in the events and hospitality sector, but with everyone's help, better times are ahead of us.""

'Nine-hour delay' in Caribbean missing reports,"Sarm Heslop has not been seen since 8 March Friends of a British woman missing in the Caribbean have questioned an apparent nine-hour delay in reporting her disappearance to the coastguard. Sarm Heslop, 41, was last seen on board boyfriend Ryan Bane's boat off the coast of St John in the US Virgin Islands on 8 March. Police said US citizen Mr Bane reported her missing at 02:30 local time. Friends said they could not fathom why the coastguard was only informed at about noon the same day. Ms Heslop's best friend Andrew Baldwin said the timeline ""doesn't make sense"". ""She would not just disappear, leaving no trace. She is savvy and sensible, it's not like her at all, it just doesn't add up,"" he said. Ms Heslop, originally from Southampton, went for dinner with Mr Bane on Sunday 7 March, before returning to catamaran Siren Song and going to bed. Her bank cards and mobile phone were still on board when she vanished. Searches around the coast of St John in the US Virgin Islands have been taking place since she vanished Virgin Islands Police Department (VIPD) spokesman Toby Derima said officers had performed an ""initial land search"" after speaking with Mr Bane and had instructed him to contact the US coastguard. ""Soon after reporting Ms Heslop missing, Mr Bane acquired the services of an attorney,"" he said. ""Upon his attorney's advice, Mr Bane exercised his constitutional right to remain silent and denied officers' requests to search the vessel."" Mr Baldwin, one among several of Ms Heslop's friends who has urged police to carry out an""urgent"" search of the catamaran, said they couldn't understand why Mr Bane's lawyer had denied officers' requests to search the boat. Friends said she had been staying aboard Siren Song for a couple of weeks Ms Heslop's family has said they will ""never give up looking for Sarm and still have hope of finding her safe"". Friends in the UK have set up aMissing Sarm Heslop Facebook page,externalto share information about her disappearance. Virgin Islands Police Department said officers remained ""committed to locating Ms Heslop"", and investigations continue. Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

Impressive Ireland thump dismal England,"This video can not be played Six Nations 2021: Ireland 32-18 England highlights Guinness Six Nations: Ireland v England Ireland (20) 32 Tries:Earls, ConanCons:Sexton 2Pens:Sexton 6 England (6) 18 Tries:Youngs, MayCons:DalyPens:Farrell 2 Ireland produced by far their best performance of the Andy Farrell era to beat a sorry England 32-18 in the Six Nations in Dublin. Keith Earls and Jack Conan scored superb first-half tries while Johnny Sexton kicked 22 points with Lions coach Warren Gatland watching on. Late touchdowns from Ben Youngs and Jonny May after Bundee Aki's red card did not mask a dismal English display. Eddie Jones' side are now set for a fifth-place finish. We need to reset England team - Jones Win vindicates squad belief, says Sexton Reaction as Ireland cruise to victory over England Ireland's win moves them up to second in the table but their final standing will not be decided until France and Scotland meet next week in their re-arranged fixture that will end this season's competition. Regardless of their final position, the manner of the win over England, a first in five attempts, will live long in Irish memories in addition to vindicating Farrell's constant insistence that this is a team travelling in the right direction. As for England, their lifeless and ill-disciplined display after such an engrossing win over France a week ago is arguably a new low for a side who only a year-and-a-half ago reached the World Cup final. This video can not be played Six Nations 2021: England finished the tournament better than we started - Jones Since taking over from Joe Schmidt, Ireland head coach Farrell has made no secret of his desire to replace a system built on minute detail and structure with a more free-flowing approach. The ambition has been at odds with some of Ireland's performances in this tournament, during which they have seemed stuck for ideas and imagination when in possession. Against England on Saturday they clicked, and in the first 40 minutes produced a display that was by some distance the closest thing we have seen to the swashbuckling style Farrell has envisioned. It started ominously with all the trademarks of England's recent thumping wins over Ireland which have seen them dominate the fixture since 2018, namely a Maro Itoje turnover and an effortless drive into the corner that saw England held up over the line. From the scrum Kyle Sinckler went early, as England's machine suddenly faltered, allowing Ireland an out. Keith Earls' sensational try turned the match in Ireland's favour Owen Farrell and Sexton traded penalties before a high-risk, high-reward set-piece paid off for Ireland, as Rob Herring's deliberately overthrown line-out was patted down by Jack Conan straight into the hands of Earls, who showed a stunning turn of pace to step around May and score. An energetic Ireland, led by the relentless Robbie Henshaw, had their tails up while England's forwards continued to cough up cheap penalties with Mako Vunipola twice penalised at the scrum, offering Sexton the chance to extend his side's lead. With three minutes to go in the first half, Hugo Keenan won an aerial dual with Elliot Daly, restored to full-back after Max Malins withdrew from the squad with an injury, to bring Ireland deep inside the 22. From there they found quick ball and did not allow England's defence to set, switching the ball left before a Conan pick-and-go extended their advantage to 20-6 at the break. For all their side impressed, there would have been few Irish fans resting on their laurels at half-time against an England side who have been their chief tormentors in the past two years. Despite their worst fears, they need not have worried, because England barely threw a single punch. Two minutes into the second half Daly produced a brilliant chase to win a penalty and again send England into the corner, only for the visitors to give away a penalty off their own throw. Their spells in Irish territory were brief and they never found the relentless forward momentum that has typified their most unplayable performances under Jones. Instead they were disjointed and ill-disciplined, turning over the ball and allow Ireland to release any pressure. Earls nearly had a glorious second, acrobatically grounding Sexton's cross-field kick only for the play to be pulled back for an earlier Cian Healy knock-on. Ireland's breakdown work, highlighted as one of their biggest improvements this year, lived up to its billing with Tadhg Beirne once again front and centre. England scored two late tries after Bundee Aki's sending off which gave the scoreboard a look which flattered the visitors They were given a jolt in the 64th minute when Aki's red card, for making contact with the head of Billy Vunipola, was followed immediately by Youngs darting down the short side and clawing back five points. But at no point did England look likely to claw back the deficit as Sexton responded with two more penalties. May's try in the corner with two minutes remaining was the final act, as both sets of players now return to their clubs to conclude their seasons and make a final push for a place on the Lions tour. France beat Wales in the day's final game and face Scotland in a rearranged match on Friday where the winners of the Six Nations will be decided Ireland:Keenan; Earls, Henshaw, Aki, Stockdale; Sexton (capt), Murray; Kilcoyne, Herring, Furlong, Henderson, Beirne, Stander, Van Der Flier, Conan Replacements:Healy for Kilcoyne 20, Kelleher for Herring 71, Porter for Furlong 64, O'Mahony for Van der Flier 64, Baird for Henderson 64, Larmour for Stockdale 78 Not used: Gibson-Park, Byrne England:Daly; Watson, Lawrence, Farrell (capt), May; Ford, Youngs; M Vunipola, Cowan-Dickie, Sinckler, Itoje, Ewels, Wilson, Curry, B Vunipola Replacements:George for Cowan-Dickie half-time, Genge for M Vunipola half-time, Stuart for Sinckler 66, Hill for Ewels 56, Earl for Wilson 53, Robson for Farrell 56, Martin for B Vunipola 64, Marchant for Ford 53 Referee:Mathieu Raynal (France) Touch judges:Mike Adamson (Scotland) & Craig Evans (Wales) TMO:Romain Poite (France) Your Film Night:A talented young drummer is pushed to his limits in this psychological drama MOTDx:Football, music and culture from the Premier League with Jermaine Jenas How to get into rugby union Rugby Union on iPlayer Six Nations Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Football latest: Moyes in talks to become Everton manager & FA Cup news conferences Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Alexander-Arnold not to blame for goals conceded - Slot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

No international fans at Tokyo Olympics,"The Olympics are due to begin on 23 July and the Paralympics on 24 August No international fans will be permitted at the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics this summer because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Japanese authorities told the Olympic and Paralympic committees it was ""highly unlikely"" that entry to the country could be guaranteed. Organisers said the move now gives ""clarity"" to ticket holders and helps ensure ""a safe and secure Games for all participants and the Japanese public"". The Games are due to begin on 23 July. The Paralympics follow the Olympics a month later, from 24 August. Organisers said the ""challenging"" Covid-19 situation in Japan and many other countries, global travel restrictions and emergence of variant strains of the virus had led to the decision and that ticket holders would be refunded. The Olympics were postponed by a year in March last year because of the growing spread of coronavirus across the world. It is the first time in the event's history it has been postponed, with more than 11,000 athletes from about 200 countries scheduled to take part in 2020. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, said the move is a ""great sacrifice for everybody"". ""We share the disappointment of all enthusiastic Olympic fans from around the world, and of course the families and friends of the athletes, who were planning to come to the Games,"" he said. ""For this I am truly sorry. ""Every decision has to respect the principle of safety first. I know that our Japanese partners and friends did not reach this conclusion lightly. ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the side of our Japanese partners and friends, without any kind of reservation, to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 a great success."" International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said ""difficult decisions"" had to be made with safety the ""top priority"". ""It goes without saying that in an ideal world we would prefer to have international spectators at the Games,"" he said. ""But at the moment we must acknowledge that due to the global pandemic we are not living in an ideal world."" The British Olympic Association said that while it is ""a very disappointing situation"", it highlights the ""determination to stage"" a safe event during the pandemic. ""This is very sad news, not only for British fans but particularly for the family and friends of athletes,"" a BOA statement continued. The exclusion of international fans comes as another major financial blow to the Tokyo Games. Costs for the Games have increased by $2.8bn (Â£2.1bn)because of measures needed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 but organisers have consistently ruled out a delay. Earlier this year, Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga said the Games would be ""safe and secure"" and could serve as a ""symbol of global solidarity"". However, a poll at that time by national broadcaster NHK showed the majority of the Japanese general public oppose holding the Games in 2021, favouring a further delay or outright cancellation of the event. Japan has also encountered problems unrelated to the pandemic, with the head of the Tokyo Olympics organising committeeYoshiro Mori resigningafter he was criticised for making ""inappropriate"" remarks about women. The Tokyo Games' creative chiefthen also resignedafter suggesting a female comedian could appear as an ""Olympig"" at the opening ceremony. Alex Blaneysaid it is ""a sad day"", and he is ""devastated"" not to be able to help his 74-year-old father fulfil a long-held ambition. ""When I was seven in 1984, we were watching Daley Thompson's high jump and my dad turned to me and said he would 'love to go to an overseas Olympics',"" Blaney said. ""I've remembered that dream of his for nearly 40 years. We've got 30 tickets for all of us to make the dream come true. This was probably the last chance we had, as he now has dementia. Maybe we might make Paris [2024 Olympics], but it won't be the same."" Kevin Grantsaid attending the Paralympics was something for his autistic son - a wheelchair basketballer who is ""fascinated with Japan"" - to ""look forward to and plan for"" after a difficult year. ""He will be devastated, I am sure, but as he struggles to express feelings it will be hard to know the true impact,"" Grant said. Gill Ludlowsaid her husband and son - who got the tickets as a birthday gift - had been set to go on ""a trip of a lifetime"", but they ""totally understand"" the decision. Philip Davisorganised his tickets in 2019, ""before the word Covid was even known"", and said the announcement ""isn't a surprise"", although he has ""tried to stay positive"" and hopeful. ""I personally have been a bit on the fence about it but would've been happy to go nonetheless,"" he said. ""I'll definitely still watch from home though."" Hannah Chambers, who was set to attend with her boyfriend and hoping to watch a friend who is in contention to compete in Tokyo, said: ""It's disappointing but understandable given that the world is in turmoil."" John Riggssaid ""planning starts for Paris"" after the announcement, adding: ""We appreciate that there are more important things going on in the world at the moment, as there probably always are, but it still leaves you disappointed."" ForDej Mahoneyit will be the first Games since 1992 that he has missed. After watching Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt win eight gold medals over the years, he said he will ""revel in those memories and not feel too hard done by"".

This video can not be played Six Nations 2021: England finished the tournament better than we started - Jones Since taking over from Joe Schmidt, Ireland head coach Farrell has made no secret of his desire to replace a system built on minute detail and structure with a more free-flowing approach. The ambition has been at odds with some of Ireland's performances in this tournament, during which they have seemed stuck for ideas and imagination when in possession. Against England on Saturday they clicked, and in the first 40 minutes produced a display that was by some distance the closest thing we have seen to the swashbuckling style Farrell has envisioned. It started ominously with all the trademarks of England's recent thumping wins over Ireland which have seen them dominate the fixture since 2018, namely a Maro Itoje turnover and an effortless drive into the corner that saw England held up over the line. From the scrum Kyle Sinckler went early, as England's machine suddenly faltered, allowing Ireland an out. Keith Earls' sensational try turned the match in Ireland's favour Owen Farrell and Sexton traded penalties before a high-risk, high-reward set-piece paid off for Ireland, as Rob Herring's deliberately overthrown line-out was patted down by Jack Conan straight into the hands of Earls, who showed a stunning turn of pace to step around May and score. An energetic Ireland, led by the relentless Robbie Henshaw, had their tails up while England's forwards continued to cough up cheap penalties with Mako Vunipola twice penalised at the scrum, offering Sexton the chance to extend his side's lead. With three minutes to go in the first half, Hugo Keenan won an aerial dual with Elliot Daly, restored to full-back after Max Malins withdrew from the squad with an injury, to bring Ireland deep inside the 22. From there they found quick ball and did not allow England's defence to set, switching the ball left before a Conan pick-and-go extended their advantage to 20-6 at the break. For all their side impressed, there would have been few Irish fans resting on their laurels at half-time against an England side who have been their chief tormentors in the past two years. Despite their worst fears, they need not have worried, because England barely threw a single punch. Two minutes into the second half Daly produced a brilliant chase to win a penalty and again send England into the corner, only for the visitors to give away a penalty off their own throw. Their spells in Irish territory were brief and they never found the relentless forward momentum that has typified their most unplayable performances under Jones. Instead they were disjointed and ill-disciplined, turning over the ball and allow Ireland to release any pressure. Earls nearly had a glorious second, acrobatically grounding Sexton's cross-field kick only for the play to be pulled back for an earlier Cian Healy knock-on. Ireland's breakdown work, highlighted as one of their biggest improvements this year, lived up to its billing with Tadhg Beirne once again front and centre. England scored two late tries after Bundee Aki's sending off which gave the scoreboard a look which flattered the visitors They were given a jolt in the 64th minute when Aki's red card, for making contact with the head of Billy Vunipola, was followed immediately by Youngs darting down the short side and clawing back five points. But at no point did England look likely to claw back the deficit as Sexton responded with two more penalties. May's try in the corner with two minutes remaining was the final act, as both sets of players now return to their clubs to conclude their seasons and make a final push for a place on the Lions tour.

Summer holidays abroad 'extremely unlikely',"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""The 17th of May is the very earliest for international travel"" Summer holidays overseas are ""extremely unlikely"" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, a scientist on a government advisory body has said. The UK faces a ""real risk"" if people travel abroad, Dr Mike Tildesley said. Foreign holidays are currently not allowed and returning travellers have to quarantine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""too early to tell"" when holidays abroad would be allowed. Under the current road map for easing restrictions, the earliest date people in Englandcould holiday abroad would be 17 May. People can currently travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work, with anyone who does having to fill in a ""Declaration to Travel"" form stating a valid reason for leaving the country. A government taskforce will report to the prime minister on 12 April detailing when and how international travel can resume. In Scotland, national clinical director Jason Leitch also said foreign summer holidays in Europe were looking ""less likely""as Covid numbers in some countries were a ""cause for concern"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Saturday morninghalf of all adults in the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine. Friday was also a record-breaking day for jabs, Mr Hancock added. Will I need a vaccine passport to go out or travel? When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed? Dr Tildesley, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into Sage, said there was a danger holidaymakers could bring back variants,like the one that emerged in South Africa- which were less susceptible to vaccines. Dr Tildesley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think that international travel this summer is, for the average holidaymaker, sadly I think, extremely unlikely. ""I think we are running a real risk if we do start to have lots of people going overseas in July, for instance, and August because of the potential for bringing more of these new variants back into the country. ""What is really dangerous is if we jeopardise our vaccination campaign by having these variants, where the vaccines don't work as effectively, spreading more rapidly."" Future vaccination campaigns might need to be considered to tackle future variants, but ""the longer that we can push that down the road... the better"", Dr Tildesley added. The earliest date holidays abroad could be allowed under the current roadmap out of lockdown is 17 May Prof Andrew Hayward, from Sage, said it was ""unlikely"" the government would want to encourage travel toEuropean countries currently experiencing high levels of coronavirus infections. ""I suppose one of the more worrying things about this resurgence is that in some parts of Europe the South African variant is beginning to creep up to higher levels,"" he told Times Radio. He said this variant was of ""particular concern"" because vaccine effectiveness against it was ""quite low"". Airlines UK, which represents UK-registered carriers, said it was ""too early to say"" what the state of Covid will be in Europe and the rest of the world in 10 weeks' time. ""We have always said any reopening must be risk-based, but also led by the overriding assumption that as the vaccine rollout accelerates both here and abroad, a phased easing of restrictions is achievable,"" Airlines UK said. ""We know that universal, restriction-free travel is unlikely from 17 May but under a tiered system, based on risk, international travel can meaningfully restart and build up, with minimal restrictions in time."" February's announcement of the roadmap for easing restrictions in England was followed by a flurry of reports from airlines and holiday companies that future bookings had surged - particularly from July onwards. Although domestic operators reported strong demand for UK-based getaways, many people are clearly desperate to go abroad when it is allowed. Stricken travel and tourism firms desperately need their business. They see this summer as crucial. But although 17 May is in the calendar as the earliest possible date for international leisure trips to resume, this has never been guaranteed. Nor do passengers yet know exactly what rules or systems might be in place to enable travel to re-start. All eyes will be on what the global travel taskforce reports on 12 April. There are thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid circulating but there has been particular focus on those first found in three countries: A Brazil variant (also known as P.1) A South Africa variant (B.1.351) A UK or Kent variant (B.1.1.7) These variants could be much more contagious or easy to catch but there is no evidence any of them cause much more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. Current vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus but scientists believe they should still work, although perhaps not quite as well. Vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in the future to be a better match. Read more. Meanwhile, Kate Bingham, the former head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, said some European leaders were being ""completely irresponsible"" over their approach to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. ""If I was sitting in those countries I would not be happy to have leaders that are undermining a vaccine that could actually protect,"" Ms Binghamtold the Daily Telegraph,external. Several countries decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following reports some people suffered blood clots after receiving the jab. Data supplied by AstraZeneca showed there had been fewer than 40 reports of blood clots among the 17 million people across Europe who had been given the vaccine. UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the Covid vaccine caused blood clots and Boris Johnson has said the vaccine is safe -receiving it himself on Friday. Dr Catherine Smallwood, from the World Health Organization, said: ""We can't talk about the interest of one country or one city or one part of the world, this is so interconnected and we've really got to come out of this together."" SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? Prof Sir John Bell, a member of the government's vaccine taskforce, criticised France for changing its vaccine advice, calling it ""crackers"". France is refusing to give the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-55s having previously said it was unsuitable for older people - a move Prof Bell said undermined confidence in the vaccination rollout. ""It doesn't make any sense. The whole thing looks completely crackers. They are changing the rules almost every week,"" he told Today. ""They are really damaging people's confidence in vaccines generally - not just the AstraZeneca vaccine. ""They are sitting on a massive stockpile of vaccines that they haven't deployed yet and at the same time they have got a massive wave of the new variants coming across the country."" More than 26 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures. PATIENT ZERO:Where do disease outbreaks begin and why do they happen?

No international fans at Tokyo Olympics & Paralympics,"The Olympics are due to begin on 23 July and the Paralympics on 24 August No international fans will be permitted at the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics this summer because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Japanese authorities told the Olympic and Paralympic committees it was ""highly unlikely"" that entry to the country could be guaranteed. Organisers said the move now gives ""clarity"" to ticket holders and helps ensure ""a safe and secure Games for all participants and the Japanese public"". The Games are due to begin on 23 July. The Paralympics follow the Olympics a month later, from 24 August. Organisers said the ""challenging"" Covid-19 situation in Japan and many other countries, global travel restrictions and emergence of variant strains of the virus had led to the decision and that ticket holders would be refunded. The Olympics were postponed by a year in March last year because of the growing spread of coronavirus across the world. It is the first time in the event's history it has been postponed, with more than 11,000 athletes from about 200 countries scheduled to take part in 2020. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, said the move is a ""great sacrifice for everybody"". ""We share the disappointment of all enthusiastic Olympic fans from around the world, and of course the families and friends of the athletes, who were planning to come to the Games,"" he said. ""For this I am truly sorry. ""Every decision has to respect the principle of safety first. I know that our Japanese partners and friends did not reach this conclusion lightly. ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the side of our Japanese partners and friends, without any kind of reservation, to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 a great success."" International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said ""difficult decisions"" had to be made with safety the ""top priority"". ""It goes without saying that in an ideal world we would prefer to have international spectators at the Games,"" he said. ""But at the moment we must acknowledge that due to the global pandemic we are not living in an ideal world."" The British Olympic Association said that while it is ""a very disappointing situation"", it highlights the ""determination to stage"" a safe event during the pandemic. ""This is very sad news, not only for British fans but particularly for the family and friends of athletes,"" a BOA statement continued. The exclusion of international fans comes as another major financial blow to the Tokyo Games. Costs for the Games have increased by $2.8bn (Â£2.1bn)because of measures needed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 but organisers have consistently ruled out a delay. Earlier this year, Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga said the Games would be ""safe and secure"" and could serve as a ""symbol of global solidarity"". However, a poll at that time by national broadcaster NHK showed the majority of the Japanese general public oppose holding the Games in 2021, favouring a further delay or outright cancellation of the event. Japan has also encountered problems unrelated to the pandemic, with the head of the Tokyo Olympics organising committeeYoshiro Mori resigningafter he was criticised for making ""inappropriate"" remarks about women. The Tokyo Games' creative chiefthen also resignedafter suggesting a female comedian could appear as an ""Olympig"" at the opening ceremony. Alex Blaneysaid it is ""a sad day"", and he is ""devastated"" not to be able to help his 74-year-old father fulfil a long-held ambition. ""When I was seven in 1984, we were watching Daley Thompson's high jump and my dad turned to me and said he would 'love to go to an overseas Olympics',"" Blaney said. ""I've remembered that dream of his for nearly 40 years. We've got 30 tickets for all of us to make the dream come true. This was probably the last chance we had, as he now has dementia. Maybe we might make Paris [2024 Olympics], but it won't be the same."" Kevin Grantsaid attending the Paralympics was something for his autistic son - a wheelchair basketballer who is ""fascinated with Japan"" - to ""look forward to and plan for"" after a difficult year. ""He will be devastated, I am sure, but as he struggles to express feelings it will be hard to know the true impact,"" Grant said. Gill Ludlowsaid her husband and son - who got the tickets as a birthday gift - had been set to go on ""a trip of a lifetime"", but they ""totally understand"" the decision. Philip Davisorganised his tickets in 2019, ""before the word Covid was even known"", and said the announcement ""isn't a surprise"", although he has ""tried to stay positive"" and hopeful. ""I personally have been a bit on the fence about it but would've been happy to go nonetheless,"" he said. ""I'll definitely still watch from home though."" Hannah Chambers, who was set to attend with her boyfriend and hoping to watch a friend who is in contention to compete in Tokyo, said: ""It's disappointing but understandable given that the world is in turmoil."" John Riggssaid ""planning starts for Paris"" after the announcement, adding: ""We appreciate that there are more important things going on in the world at the moment, as there probably always are, but it still leaves you disappointed."" ForDej Mahoneyit will be the first Games since 1992 that he has missed. After watching Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt win eight gold medals over the years, he said he will ""revel in those memories and not feel too hard done by"".

Biden nominates former astronaut as Nasa chief,"Bill Nelson on the campaign trail in Florida during the 2018 mid-term elections Bill Nelson, a US senator and one-time astronaut, has been nominated to be the next head of Nasa. The 78-year-old is seen as a moderate Democrat, and his nomination by President Joe Biden on Friday drew bipartisan praise. He will need to be confirmed in the Senate before he can take up the role. Mr Nelson said he was ""honoured"" to be picked to lead the US space agency, adding that he would ""help lead Nasa into an exciting future"". In a statement,external, the White House said he was ""known as the go-to senator for our nation's space programme"" for many years.

The SLS rocket's core stage successfully completed a crucial test on Thursday Mr Nelson was a driving force behindNasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which was conceived in the wake of an Obama-era overhaul of the US space programme. He will succeed Jim Bridenstine, who led the agency for almost three years under the Trump administration. Mr Bridenstine earned widespread praise for his efforts to promote Nasa programmes - in particular, its Artemis venture, which will see astronauts return to the Moon in the 2020s before mounting a mission to Mars.

After he won election to the Senate in Florida in 2000, Mr Nelson continued to be closely involved in formulating space policy. In 2010, he said he believed President Barack Obama had ""made a mistake"" by cancelling the Constellation programme. That programme was former President George W Bush's effort to return astronauts to the Moon. The decision to axe Constellation - which, at the time, was over budget and behind schedule - sparked a backlash in Congress, not least because it jeopardised thousands of space jobs in southern states.

The city's local government said people would be tested randomly, in an order issued on Saturday. A refusal to be tested would ""amount to an offence"" under an 1897 epidemic law, the order said. The move came as India recorded 40,953 new cases on Saturday, the biggest daily jump for nearly four months. So far there have been 159,000 deaths related to the disease in India since the pandemic - the fourth-highest number of deaths of any country in the world. Infections have been steadily climbing in recent weeks, as the country scrambles to vaccinate its huge population. The commissioner of the local authoritytold India Today,externalthat, from 22 March, people should ""be ready for the swab test"" whenever they enter a busy area in Mumbai. Read more.

By Jon Donnison, at the scene in central London Thousands of tightly packed anti-lockdown protesters marched up Whitehall, some chanting âfreedomâ to the beat of a drum. One man carried a placard bearing the words: âNo more NHS and government lies."" Iâve seen very few demonstrators wearing masks and thereâs no attempt at social distancing. So far the police, who are here in large numbers,  have been taking a mostly hands-off approach and Iâve witnessed only one arrest. Amongst the crowd there are undoubtedly some conspiracy theorists - with some accusing mainstream media of pushing fake news . But thatâs by no means everyone here. One woman told me she knew Covid was bad, âI had it myself last March,"" she said. ""But this lockdown is too much,"" she added. The UK has recorded 5,587 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, a rise of 785 cases on the previous day, according to government figures. Nonetheless the number of cases continues to fall across the UK, based on a rolling seven-day average. Data showed a further 96 people have died within 28 days of a positive test - Friday's figure was 101. At least 26,853,407 have now received their first vaccinations, with more than two million people - 2,132,551 - having been given both jabs.    Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris A third of the French population - about 21 million people - have started their third lockdown after a surge in cases of Covid. Paris and its surrounding region plus a large part of northern France and the area around Nice are all affected by the new measure which is set to last at least four weeks. It is a lighter lockdown than the two previous ones - the main difference being that during the day people can go outside for exercise for as long as they like. Schools also are staying open. But leaving the city for the countryside is not allowed, and yesterday there was heavy congestion on the roads and the trains as some Parisians got out while they could to non-lockdown zones. Many in France find the bureaucratic approach of the government annoying if predictable. While clothes and DIY shops are shut, hairdressers, bookshops, cobblers and florists are open. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The march disrupted traffic on Park Lane, near London's Hyde Park The Met Police say numbers attending Saturday's anti-lockdown protest in London are greater than expected. Thousands are believed to be taking part in the demonstrations, far more than the 1,000 predicted to attend during planning - although the Metropolitan Police does not give formal estimates of numbers. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor says gathering outside the home is illegal under coronavirus regulations, and no protest of this size could be regarded as safe to go ahead. But he stressed the intention is always to balance the right to protest with public health requirements. There have been some arrests, but the police are currently standing back and watching how events develop. Mass arrests are not possible because it takes at least three officers to make one arrest.   Another tactic, containment (or kettling) cannot be deployed, because it would raise the risk of Covid transmission.  Labour has called the surge in coronavirus infections in parts of Europe ""really worrying"" and has called for the introduction of a ""comprehensive hotel quarantine system without further delay"" for people arriving in the UK. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""The UK's first priority has to be to protect the progress made by the vaccine."" ""Of course we all want international travel to resume, but safety has to come first."" He said it was ""too early"" to say how travel advice might change on 17 May, adding: ""We have to be led by the science, not arbitrary dates.""  This video can not be played Hundreds of people have been marching from Hyde Park to Westminster in London as part of a day of anti-lockdown protests. The Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend demonstrations under the current coronavirus rules. The Metropolitan Police said several arrests had been made. Gareth GriffithsBBC Sport Wales Wales claimed a 22nd Triple Crown against England on their way to Paris Wales rugby fans are all set for another potential Grand Slam Saturday - but it will be a day unlike any others. Scotland host Italy and England travel to Dublin as the Six Nations appetisers before the main course in Paris with only France and unbeaten Wales still able to win the tournament. A win would clinch Wales' fifth Grand Slam of the Six Nations era. But because of Covid-19 this would be the first without fans at the game or in pubs and rugby clubs across Wales. Whether events will be resolved on ""Super Saturday"" remains to be seen with Scotland still to travel to Paris on 26 March, six days after the anticipated end of the tournament. The original game in February was called off because of Covid-19 cases in the France camp which has potentially spoiled the concept of everything being finalised on the last day. Read more here. On Saturday, there were protests against the government""s coronavirus restrictions in Kassel, Germany Dr Guenther Schoenrich, deputy director of the Institute of Virology at the Charite Hospital in Berlin, has told the BBC another lockdown in Germany is inevitable. ""It looks like that we have no choice because the virus is spreading and, as already pointed out, we have a new variant, the variant that has been first detected in the UK, also now here in German,"" he said. Dr Schoenrich said it was harder to prevent the the British variant from spreading as it is ""more transmissible"", adding the situation was exacerbated because ""at the same time we have not enough people vaccinated so far"". Partial lockdowns were reintroduced in France and Poland on Saturday, as many European countries face the prospect of a third wave. Germany is seeing an exponential rise in cases, with infections on the Czech border more than 15 times the government's target. Experts have warned against British people travelling to Europe this summer, because of the risk of bring back new variants - and the slow pace of vaccination in many EU countries. So what are the rules around travel at the moment - and when and where can we get away? At the moment, the key date to watch - at least in England and Scotland - is 17 May. Both nations have stated that is the earliest possible date for foreign travel although Scotland's first minister  warned only last week that it ""may well not be possible for a further period after that"". However, family groups or bubbles can book self-catering holiday accommodation in the UK from 12 April, if the government roadmap goes according to plan. So what are your rights if you go ahead and book a holiday this summer? The BBC's Eleanor Lawrie shares the lowdown. Airlines UK, the trade body for UK-based airlines, said it was ""too early"" to predict what the Covid situation in Europe, or globally, would look like in 10 weeks' time. The trade body said its focus between now and then was working with the government ""on a framework for travel that is robust and workable, and can stand the test of time"". ""We have always said any reopening must be risk-based, but also led by the overriding assumption that as the vaccine rollout accelerates both here and abroad, a phased easing of restrictions is achievable. ""We know that universal, restriction-free travel is unlikely from 17 May but under a tiered system, based on risk, international travel can meaningfully restart and build up, with minimal restrictions, in time."" It is vital that plans to restart international travel from the UK take on board the interests of passengers, the editor of consumer organisation Which? Travel has said. Rory Boland said it was important that the rules and requirements remain consistent, ""as changing them will leave travellers footing the bill again and further risk undermining consumers' confidence in booking travel"". He said ministers must make safety, affordable tests, vaccine passports and reassurance about refunds when travel is disrupted a ""top priority"". He was commenting after awarning from health expertsthat summer holidays overseas are ""extremely unlikely"" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, Boland said: ""The government has made it clear it will make decisions on reopening travel based on the health situation abroad, meaning travel will continue to be restricted and rules will change in line with scientific guidance... ""There remains a financial risk to booking travel currently."" Some protesters have been detained by police in Hyde Park in London during an anti-lockdown demonstration. Under England's current lockdown regulations, protests are not listed as a ""reasonable excuse"" for leaving home. A small number of protesters opposed to the lockdown gathered ahead of a planned march to Westminster. Scotland Yard said London remains in a health crisis and urged people to stay at home. The demonstration came after more than 60 MPs and peers wrote to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid-19 legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown. Theletter, organised by campaign groupsLiberty and Big Brother Watch, says there is a human right to protest. A care worker has been struck off after being jailed for assaulting three police officers who were called to a party during a coronavirus lockdown. Nerys Williams, 32, of Carneddi, Bethesda, Gwynedd, admitted three charges of assaulting an emergency worker in June last year. Llandudno magistrates jailed her for a year and she was sacked by her employer Cartrefi Cymru. Social Care Wales' fitness to practise committee has now struck her off. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, has said banning international fans from the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympics is a ""great sacrifice for everybody"". We reported earlier that the Games - due to start in July - wouldnot be open to foreign spectators. Bach said: ""We share the disappointment of all enthusiastic Olympic fans from around the world, and of course the families and friends of the athletes, who were planning to come to the Games. For this I am truly sorry. ""Every decision has to respect the principle of safety first. I know that our Japanese partners and friends did not reach this conclusion lightly. ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the side of our Japanese partners and friends, without any kind of reservation, to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 a great success."" International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said ""difficult decisions"" had to be made with safety the ""top priority"". ""It goes without saying that in an ideal world we would prefer to have international spectators at the Games,"" he said. ""But at the moment we must acknowledge that due to the global pandemic we are not living in an ideal world."" After Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that half of UK adults had received their first vaccine dose, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tweeted his gratitude to ""everyone involved""...

Earlier this month Italy blocked the export of 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has threatened to halt exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine if the bloc does not receive its promised deliveries first. ""We have the option of banning a planned export.

The European Commission president said AstraZeneca had delivered only 30% of the 90 million vaccine doses it had promised for the first quarter of the year. The EU is struggling to accelerate its vaccination programme, with athird wave of cases bearing down on many parts of the continent. Ms von der Leyen said the EU's contract with AstraZeneca states that vaccines destined for the bloc would be produced in both EU and UK plants, ""but we haven't received anything from the Brits"".

Fund to 'spruce up' coastal towns and high streets,"All coastal towns in England will be eligible for government funding to help them reopen as restrictions are eased, under new plans set out by ministers. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the Â£56m fund would also ""spruce up"" high streets and help councils welcome visitors back safely. Pubs can put up marquees in their gardens for longer and there will be a crackdown on ""cowboy parking firms"". Labour said it was a ""drop in the ocean"" in terms of what areas needed. England's current""stay at home"" regulations are expected to be lifted on 29 March,with most restrictions eased in various steps by the 21 June, based on certain conditions being met at each stage. Announcing the latest tranche of funding, Mr Jenrick acknowledged it had been ""an incredibly difficult period for retail and hospitality"". He said the government would do everything it could to help businesses reopen safely. Resort prepares for post-lockdown visitor surge Top seaside town winners 'concerned about Covid' 'Nothing's open - it's heartbreaking' There has been concern about how coastal areas in particular will cope with an expected influx of visitors. When the first lockdown was eased last June, seaside resorts were gridlocked, with Bournemouth declaring a""major incident"" as people flocked to the beach. People travelled to Bournemouth from as far away as Birmingham Mr Jenrick said that this time, Â£6m of the Â£56m Welcome Back fund would be specifically allocated to support coastal areas. The remaining Â£50m will be distributed by central government to councils for things such as improving green spaces and providing more outdoor seating areas, markets and food pop-ups. He also announced the government would be ""cutting red tape"" to allow pubs to erect marquees in their gardens for ""the whole of the spring and summer"", rather than the 28 days currently permitted, so people can meet up with their family and friends ""whatever the weather"". And in a bid to attract more shoppers to the high street, ministers have announced a crackdown on cowboy parking firms. There will be a new appeals process to try to curb unfair tickets and caps will be introduced on private parking fines. The struggles of the hospitality sector amid multiple lockdowns have been well documented. And the independent retailers' trade body Bira says the past 12 months have been the worst of its members' lives -  with crucial in-person Easter and pre-Christmas trade lost. Once non-essential shops can open again, from 12 April in England, any help to attract people back will no doubt be welcome. Businesses will want to make the most of pent-up demand in a safe way. The same goes for hospitality. While social distancing will still be in place at least to start with, maximising outdoor space will be crucial for venues which have it - especially during the first phase of their reopening when only outdoor service will be permitted. Packages like these for high streets and towns won't fix the long-term challenges facing town centres: shoppers going online, leaving big high street stores increasingly empty. Some customers have grown so used to internet shopping during a year of lockdowns that the habit will stick. The hope will be, however, to make this a summer to remember after a winter to forget. Government officials say this will ""give drivers more confidence in heading into town knowing they won't be unfairly penalised by rogue operators"". Mr Jenrick said: ""As we move to the next stage on the road map out of lockdown, we are all looking forward to being reunited with friends and family outdoors and making a safe and happy return to our favourite shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants. ""Our Welcome Back Fund gives every city, town and high street support to prepare for a great summer. This funding will help councils and businesses to welcome shoppers, diners and tourists back safely. ""As soon as the road map allows, we need to get behind our local businesses and enjoy all that this country has to offer and that we've been missing so much."" But Labour has accused the Conservatives of presiding over ""decades of decline"". The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said: ""This is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much the Conservatives took away over a decade when they pushed our high streets and seaside towns into deep decline - and it's not clear which areas will benefit. ""The Conservatives have done nothing to level the playing field between high street shops and online retailers.  Now they want to hollow high streets out by selling off temporarily closed shops to wealthy developers so they can never reopen as shops again.

Wales face France in Paris for Grand Slam,"Wales claimed a 22nd Triple Crown against England in February 2021 2021 Guinness Six Nations final weekend How to follow on Saturday:Watch live coverage & highlights on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, Connected TV's and online; listen on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds; text coverage on the BBC Sport website and mobile app. Wales rugby fans are all set for another potential Grand Slam Saturday - but it will be a day unlike any others. Scotland host Italy and England travel to Dublin as the Six Nations appetisers before the main course in Paris with only France and unbeaten Wales still able to win the tournament. A win would clinch Wales' fifth Grand Slam of the Six Nations era. But because of Covid-19 this would be the first without fans at the game or in pubs and rugby clubs across Wales.

What Wales need to do to win the Six Nations - permutations & standings 'He is like Superman' - Jones sets for Grand Slam history bid Boom and bust Wales chase more Grand Slam glory in France 21st century Wales Grand Slam Quiz Wales draw and they are crowned champions while there is a scenario where they could lose but still claim the title, if they pick up a bonus point and France do not. After that it could get complicated and go to the final fixture. What is not in doubt is Wayne Pivac's men can take away all the uncertainty by triumphing in Paris and winning a 13th Grand Slam to equal England's tally. Times listed for Scotland v Italy and France v Wales are for the start of BBC One's coverage. Radio coverage starts just before kick-off (14:15 and 20:00 respectively). Preview: Scotland v Italy - 14:15 kick-off Preview: Ireland v England - 16:45 kick-off Preview: France v Wales - 20:00 kick-off There has been something special about Six Nations finales in Wales. After all, Cardiff has had a lot of practice in hosting this defining day in recent years, with Wales winning more Six Nations Grand Slams than anybody else. The pubs would normally be full and streets thronging with supporters celebrating the achievements of their rugby heroes. Few will forget the sun-soaked magical March day in 2005 when hundreds of thousands of people crammed into Cardiff. There were supporters clambering up trees outside City Hall to get a glimpse of the game on a large screen as the nation went crazy to mark the end of a 27-year wait for a Grand Slam. Not on this occasion. No congregating in the Principality Stadium, on the city streets or rugby clubs across Wales. This video can not be played Six Nations 2021: 'A nation possessed by rugby' - Look ahead to Wales v France No hugging random strangers decked in red, no singing the plethora of Welsh rugby anthems, no shoes sticking to the floor of packed pubs. Instead, witnessing the prospect of a fifth Grand Slam victory in 16 years, fans will be confined to their living rooms across the country for this sofa-bound rather than stadium-bound Six Nations spectacular. It is 50 years since Wales last completed a clean sweep away from Cardiff when all-time greats Barry John, Gareth Edwards and JPR Williams helped the class of 1971 defeat France in Paris. Since those heady times, the Grand Slam carnival days have all been at home, with six successes in the Welsh capital from 1976 to 2019. Four of those wins came against France, with two victories in 2005 and 2019 against Ireland, and they made legends of favourites such as Edwards, Phil Bennett, Gethin Jenkins, Gavin Henson, Shane Williams, Martyn Williams and Alun Wyn Jones. Today the streets in cities, towns and villages in Wales will be largely quiet with Pivac's team having to travel to Paris achieve the Grand Slam goal. They will have to complete the feat in the intimidating Stade de France stadium, although minus the 81,000 French crowd. The arena will be only populated by players, backroom teams, stewards and a handful of media. This video can not be played Wales' last six Grand Slam victories have been completed at home as Alun Wyn Jones looks to achieve his fourth Six Nations clean sweep Wales captain Jones says the players will be thinking about the country when singing the anthems. ""It's not lost on you, there is a slight difference with it being away,"" said Jones. ""I, as an individual, and the team have not needed reminding of what everyone is facing and what we are representing."" It is also a Grand Slam day few had expected after a disappointing 2020 where Wales finished fifth in the Six Nations and Autumn Nations Cup, and only won three out of 10 games. Pivac found it tough replacing fellow New Zealander Warren Gatland, who had overseen three Grand Slam successes and two World Cup semi-finals. Difficult calls have been made. Pivac parted ways with his defence coach and long-time ally Byron Hayward last November with Gethin Jenkins taking over. He dropped George North in the autumn campaign and then brought him back into the fold and switched him from wing to centre. This video can not be played Six Nations: We're lucky that 14 of team have won a Grand Slam - Wales boss Pivac In this tournament North has surpassed 100 Wales caps and today is part of the nation's most experienced side in history led by world record cap holder Alun Wyn Jones. The coach also blooded young players such as Kieran Hardy, Louis Rees-Zammit, Callum Sheedy and James Botham who have featured in this Six Nations campaign. Pivac will also admit Wales have had their share of luck with some labelling it the ""Jam Slam"" and questioning the quality of their campaign so far. The opening two victories against Ireland and Scotland were achieved against 14 men with Peter O'Mahony and Zander Fagerson sent off, while there were two controversial tries awarded against England. The fortune argument fails to recognise the 17 tries scored in four games or a record 40 points amassed against Eddie Jones' 2020 champions. Wales' 2021 Six Nations success so far is due to firmer foundations with a solid set-piece, clinical finishing and outstanding discipline. And they have a remarkable record in recent Grand Slam showdowns. The stars continued to align for Wales when England managed to do them a favour by defeating France, leaving Pivac's side as the only team that could complete the clean sweep. So despite all the doubters and detractors, if events unfold in Wales' favour in Paris, a Six Nations Grand Slam will still be wildly celebrated. Just perhaps not in the same traditional fashion as years gone by. England have most Grand Slams in the history of the tournament with 13, one more than Wales, but Wales have won the most since the start of the Six Nations in 2000 with the most recent of their four coming in 2019 BBC Wales News & Sport BBC Sport Welsh Rugby Union Welsh Rugby Union Pro14 European Professional Club Rugby Football latest: Moyes in talks to become Everton manager & FA Cup news conferences Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Alexander-Arnold not to blame for goals conceded - Slot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

MPs urge Covid law change to allow protests,"More than 60 MPs and peers have written to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid-19 legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown. The letter, organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch, says there is a human right to protest. Under England's current lockdown regulations, protests are not listed as a ""reasonable excuse"" for leaving home. It comes as further protests are planned for Saturday by anti-lockdown campaigners. The Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend protests at a time when regulations that are in place to prevent wide transmission of Covid require people to stay at home at all times,except for a limited number of exceptions.,external Last weekend, police were criticised for arresting women attendinga vigil following the killing of Sarah Everard. Home Secretary Priti Patel has instructed the police watchdog,Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to ""conduct a lessons-learned review into the policing of the event"". A day earlier, campaigners attempted, without success, to persuade the High Court that the vigil should be exempt from the coronavirus regulations. The judge hearing the case decided not to intervene but did suggest that the human rights of expression and gathering might be considered reasonable excuses in some circumstances. PM 'concerned' by Sarah Everard vigil footage Hundreds at new Everard vigil despite Patel's plea Why police could get the power to limit noisy protests The letter to Ms Patel was signed by several Conservative MPs - including Steve Baker, and Sir Christopher Chope - as well as Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and a number of Labour MPs and peers. This video can not be played Organisers said they cancelled a vigil originally planned at Clapham Common because police did not ""constructively engage"" with logistics It demands that the home secretary issue guidance to police forces on ""facilitating"" protests to clear up the legal confusion surrounding the issue. It calls on Ms Patel to act in order to avoid a situation where organisers and the police have to ""decipher precisely what is required"". ""The absence of clear guidance on these issues has created an entirely unsatisfactory situation, which has persisted to varying degrees for almost a year now,"" the letter says. ""The police have no legal certainty as to their duties and powers, protestors have no legal certainty as to their rights, and there is inconsistent application of the Regulations across the country. This cannot continue,"" the letter adds. In response, the Home Office maintained its position that it would be illegal to to leave home without a reasonable excuse until coronavirus rules change on 29 March. It added: ""While we are still in a pandemic we continue to urge people to avoid mass gatherings, in line with wider coronavirus restrictions."" Reacting to reports of more protests planned this weekend, the Metropolitan Police said a ""significant policing operation"" would be in place throughout the day to ""engage"" with people who are in breach of the regulations. It added: ""Those gathering will be encouraged to return home.  If they do not they face necessary and proportionate enforcement action.  This could be a fixed penalty notice or arrest."" What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching In Pictures: Sarah Everard vigils held across UK The legal confusion grew following last week's Court of Appeal case - during which the force appeared to accept that it did not have a policy of blanket bans on protests, because that would breach human rights.

Rich states 'block' vaccine plans for poor nations,"Many experts say equitable access to vaccines is essential for global population immunity Wealthy countries - including the UK - are blocking proposals to help developing nations increase their vaccine manufacturing capabilities, documents leaked to BBC Newsnight show. Several poorer countries have asked the World Health Organization to help them. But richer nations are pushing back on provisions in international law that would enable them to achieve this. This is according to a leaked copy of the negotiating text of a WHO resolution on the issue. Among those richer nations are the UK, the US, as well as the European Union. UK fighting patent-free Covid vaccine proposals World on brink of catastrophic moral failure - WHO India begins world's biggest Covid vaccine drive ""Where we could have language in there that would make it easier for countries to produce more vaccines and more medicines within their country, it would include initiatives that would finance and facilitate that. The UK is on the opposite side of the argument of trying to remove those kinds of progressive proposals from the text,"" says Diarmaid McDonald, from Just Treatment, a patient group for fair access to medicines. A spokesperson for the UK government says ""a global pandemic requires a global solution and the UK is leading from the front, driving forward efforts to ensure equitable access around the world to Covid vaccines and treatments"". The spokesperson says the UK is one of the largest donors to international efforts to ensure over one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines get to developing countries this year. If and when governments should intervene to ensure affordable supplies of medicines is a long-standing issue. But the ability of different countries to source vaccines and drugs has been highlighted by the pandemic. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? Many experts say equitable access to vaccines is essential to prevent cases and deaths and to contribute to global population immunity. But the global capacity for producing vaccines is about a third of what is needed, says Ellen t'Hoen, an expert in medicines policy and intellectual property law. ""These are vaccines that are produced in wealthy countries and are in general kept by those wealthy countries. ""Developing nations are saying we need to have a share of the pie, not only the share of the vaccines, but also the share of the right to produce these vaccines,"" she adds. To make a vaccine you not only need to have the right to produce the actual substance they are composed of (which is protected by patents), you also need to have the knowledge about how to make them because the technology can be complex. The WHO does not have the authority to sidestep patents - but it is trying to bring countries together to find a way to bolster vaccine supplies. The discussions include using provisions in international law to get around patents and helping countries to have the technical ability to make them. But the drug industry argues that eroding patents would hinder its ability to invest in future treatments for Covid and other illnesses. Earlier this month, representatives of the US drug industry wrote to US President Joe Biden to share their concerns. ""Eliminating those protections would undermine the global response to the pandemic,"" they wrote, including ongoing efforts to tackle new variants. It would also create confusion that could potentially undermine public confidence in vaccine safety, and create a barrier to information sharing, the representatives said. ""Most importantly, eliminating protections would not speed up production,"" they added. Others agree. Anne Moore, an expert in vaccine immunology, worries about what impact undermining patents will have on future research. ""Over time we see fewer and fewer organisations and commercial companies being in the vaccine field because there's so little return on it,"" she says. Drug companies point out they have also donated financially and given medicines to help tackle the pandemic. But campaigners argue that about Â£90bn ($125bn) of public money has gone into developing Covid treatments and vaccines so the public should have a stake. Once the pandemic ends, there is a lot of money to be made, they say. ""It's obvious that there are longer-term plans to increase the price of these vaccines once the most urgent phase of the pandemic is over. So that is another reason why developing countries are saying we need to gain the ability to produce these vaccines ourselves now,"" Ms t'Hoen says.

Election watchdog quizzes Tories on PM flat revamp,"The elections watchdog has contacted the Conservative party with questions over the funding of renovations to Boris Johnson's official flat. The Electoral Commission said it was trying to establish whether any of the spending needed to be examined within its own remit on political donations. The Daily Mail has reported thatÂ£60,000 of party funds were used to help cover the work's Â£200,000 cost,external. No 10 said all appropriate codes of conduct were followed. The PM's press secretary Allegra Stratton has previously insisted that no party funds were being used to pay for any refurbishments to the Downing Street estate. There have been ongoing reports about the cost of the refurbishments to the Downing Street flat where the prime minister lives with his fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds. Like several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, the chancellor of the exchequer's official residence. Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds moved into the four-bedroom flat back in July 2019, and welcomed their son Wilfred in April 2020. The flat, which is much larger than the one above No 10, was extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011 at a cost of Â£30,000. Plan to fund Downing Street makeover 'speculation'' Call for inquiry into Symonds' influence in No 10 No 10 discussions over cost of PM's flat revamp The Daily Mail reported on Saturday thatthe Electoral Commission had contacted the Tory party,externalto check whether any funds linked to the refurbishment should have been declared in adherence with the laws on political donations. An spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said in a statement: ""We are in contact with the party to establish whether any sums relating to the renovation works fall within the regime regulated by the commission."" ""If so, they would need to be reported according to the rules specified in law, and would then be published by the commission as part of our commitment to the transparency of political finance."" A Conservative party spokesperson said: ""All reportable donations to the Conservative party are correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law. ""Gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity are, and will continue to be, declared in government transparency returns. Designer Lulu Lytle (L), pictured here with Prince Charles on a visit to her firm's workshop, is involved in the upgrade Sources previously told the BBC thatinterior designer Lulu Lytle had been involved in the upgrade of the PM's flat. Interior designer Ms Lytle is a co-founder of Soane Britain, an upmarket London-based interior design firm which specialises in traditional craft methods. According to the company's website, its furniture can be found in hotels, restaurants, private members' clubs, yachts and private houses. London's Connaught and Claridges hotels, the Somerset Georgian manor Babington House and Shoreditch House private members' club are listed as clients.

One woman told me she knew Covid was bad, âI had it myself last March,"" she said. ""But this lockdown is too much,"" she added. The UK has recorded 5,587 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, a rise of 785 cases on the previous day, according to government figures. Nonetheless the number of cases continues to fall across the UK, based on a rolling seven-day average. Data showed a further 96 people have died within 28 days of a positive test - Friday's figure was 101. At least 26,853,407 have now received their first vaccinations, with more than two million people - 2,132,551 - having been given both jabs.    Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris A third of the French population - about 21 million people - have started their third lockdown after a surge in cases of Covid. Paris and its surrounding region plus a large part of northern France and the area around Nice are all affected by the new measure which is set to last at least four weeks. It is a lighter lockdown than the two previous ones - the main difference being that during the day people can go outside for exercise for as long as they like. Schools also are staying open. But leaving the city for the countryside is not allowed, and yesterday there was heavy congestion on the roads and the trains as some Parisians got out while they could to non-lockdown zones. Many in France find the bureaucratic approach of the government annoying if predictable. While clothes and DIY shops are shut, hairdressers, bookshops, cobblers and florists are open. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The march disrupted traffic on Park Lane, near London's Hyde Park The Met Police say numbers attending Saturday's anti-lockdown protest in London are greater than expected. Thousands are believed to be taking part in the demonstrations, far more than the 1,000 predicted to attend during planning - although the Metropolitan Police does not give formal estimates of numbers. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor says gathering outside the home is illegal under coronavirus regulations, and no protest of this size could be regarded as safe to go ahead. But he stressed the intention is always to balance the right to protest with public health requirements. There have been some arrests, but the police are currently standing back and watching how events develop. Mass arrests are not possible because it takes at least three officers to make one arrest.   Another tactic, containment (or kettling) cannot be deployed, because it would raise the risk of Covid transmission.  Labour has called the surge in coronavirus infections in parts of Europe ""really worrying"" and has called for the introduction of a ""comprehensive hotel quarantine system without further delay"" for people arriving in the UK. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""The UK's first priority has to be to protect the progress made by the vaccine."" ""Of course we all want international travel to resume, but safety has to come first."" He said it was ""too early"" to say how travel advice might change on 17 May, adding: ""We have to be led by the science, not arbitrary dates.""  This video can not be played Hundreds of people have been marching from Hyde Park to Westminster in London as part of a day of anti-lockdown protests. The Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend demonstrations under the current coronavirus rules. The Metropolitan Police said several arrests had been made. Gareth GriffithsBBC Sport Wales Wales claimed a 22nd Triple Crown against England on their way to Paris Wales rugby fans are all set for another potential Grand Slam Saturday - but it will be a day unlike any others. Scotland host Italy and England travel to Dublin as the Six Nations appetisers before the main course in Paris with only France and unbeaten Wales still able to win the tournament. A win would clinch Wales' fifth Grand Slam of the Six Nations era. But because of Covid-19 this would be the first without fans at the game or in pubs and rugby clubs across Wales. Whether events will be resolved on ""Super Saturday"" remains to be seen with Scotland still to travel to Paris on 26 March, six days after the anticipated end of the tournament. The original game in February was called off because of Covid-19 cases in the France camp which has potentially spoiled the concept of everything being finalised on the last day. Read more here. On Saturday, there were protests against the government""s coronavirus restrictions in Kassel, Germany Dr Guenther Schoenrich, deputy director of the Institute of Virology at the Charite Hospital in Berlin, has told the BBC another lockdown in Germany is inevitable. ""It looks like that we have no choice because the virus is spreading and, as already pointed out, we have a new variant, the variant that has been first detected in the UK, also now here in German,"" he said. Dr Schoenrich said it was harder to prevent the the British variant from spreading as it is ""more transmissible"", adding the situation was exacerbated because ""at the same time we have not enough people vaccinated so far"". Partial lockdowns were reintroduced in France and Poland on Saturday, as many European countries face the prospect of a third wave. Germany is seeing an exponential rise in cases, with infections on the Czech border more than 15 times the government's target. Experts have warned against British people travelling to Europe this summer, because of the risk of bring back new variants - and the slow pace of vaccination in many EU countries. So what are the rules around travel at the moment - and when and where can we get away? At the moment, the key date to watch - at least in England and Scotland - is 17 May. Both nations have stated that is the earliest possible date for foreign travel although Scotland's first minister  warned only last week that it ""may well not be possible for a further period after that"". However, family groups or bubbles can book self-catering holiday accommodation in the UK from 12 April, if the government roadmap goes according to plan. So what are your rights if you go ahead and book a holiday this summer? The BBC's Eleanor Lawrie shares the lowdown. Airlines UK, the trade body for UK-based airlines, said it was ""too early"" to predict what the Covid situation in Europe, or globally, would look like in 10 weeks' time. The trade body said its focus between now and then was working with the government ""on a framework for travel that is robust and workable, and can stand the test of time"". ""We have always said any reopening must be risk-based, but also led by the overriding assumption that as the vaccine rollout accelerates both here and abroad, a phased easing of restrictions is achievable. ""We know that universal, restriction-free travel is unlikely from 17 May but under a tiered system, based on risk, international travel can meaningfully restart and build up, with minimal restrictions, in time."" It is vital that plans to restart international travel from the UK take on board the interests of passengers, the editor of consumer organisation Which? Travel has said. Rory Boland said it was important that the rules and requirements remain consistent, ""as changing them will leave travellers footing the bill again and further risk undermining consumers' confidence in booking travel"". He said ministers must make safety, affordable tests, vaccine passports and reassurance about refunds when travel is disrupted a ""top priority"". He was commenting after awarning from health expertsthat summer holidays overseas are ""extremely unlikely"" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, Boland said: ""The government has made it clear it will make decisions on reopening travel based on the health situation abroad, meaning travel will continue to be restricted and rules will change in line with scientific guidance... ""There remains a financial risk to booking travel currently."" Some protesters have been detained by police in Hyde Park in London during an anti-lockdown demonstration. Under England's current lockdown regulations, protests are not listed as a ""reasonable excuse"" for leaving home. A small number of protesters opposed to the lockdown gathered ahead of a planned march to Westminster. Scotland Yard said London remains in a health crisis and urged people to stay at home. The demonstration came after more than 60 MPs and peers wrote to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid-19 legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown. Theletter, organised by campaign groupsLiberty and Big Brother Watch, says there is a human right to protest. A care worker has been struck off after being jailed for assaulting three police officers who were called to a party during a coronavirus lockdown. Nerys Williams, 32, of Carneddi, Bethesda, Gwynedd, admitted three charges of assaulting an emergency worker in June last year. Llandudno magistrates jailed her for a year and she was sacked by her employer Cartrefi Cymru. Social Care Wales' fitness to practise committee has now struck her off. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, has said banning international fans from the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympics is a ""great sacrifice for everybody"". We reported earlier that the Games - due to start in July - wouldnot be open to foreign spectators. Bach said: ""We share the disappointment of all enthusiastic Olympic fans from around the world, and of course the families and friends of the athletes, who were planning to come to the Games. For this I am truly sorry. ""Every decision has to respect the principle of safety first. I know that our Japanese partners and friends did not reach this conclusion lightly. ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the side of our Japanese partners and friends, without any kind of reservation, to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 a great success."" International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said ""difficult decisions"" had to be made with safety the ""top priority"". ""It goes without saying that in an ideal world we would prefer to have international spectators at the Games,"" he said. ""But at the moment we must acknowledge that due to the global pandemic we are not living in an ideal world.""

A win would clinch Wales' fifth Grand Slam of the Six Nations era. But because of Covid-19 this would be the first without fans at the game or in pubs and rugby clubs across Wales. Whether events will be resolved on ""Super Saturday"" remains to be seen with Scotland still to travel to Paris on 26 March, six days after the anticipated end of the tournament. The original game in February was called off because of Covid-19 cases in the France camp which has potentially spoiled the concept of everything being finalised on the last day. Read more here. On Saturday, there were protests against the government""s coronavirus restrictions in Kassel, Germany Dr Guenther Schoenrich, deputy director of the Institute of Virology at the Charite Hospital in Berlin, has told the BBC another lockdown in Germany is inevitable. ""It looks like that we have no choice because the virus is spreading and, as already pointed out, we have a new variant, the variant that has been first detected in the UK, also now here in German,"" he said. Dr Schoenrich said it was harder to prevent the the British variant from spreading as it is ""more transmissible"", adding the situation was exacerbated because ""at the same time we have not enough people vaccinated so far"". Partial lockdowns were reintroduced in France and Poland on Saturday, as many European countries face the prospect of a third wave. Germany is seeing an exponential rise in cases, with infections on the Czech border more than 15 times the government's target. Experts have warned against British people travelling to Europe this summer, because of the risk of bring back new variants - and the slow pace of vaccination in many EU countries. So what are the rules around travel at the moment - and when and where can we get away? At the moment, the key date to watch - at least in England and Scotland - is 17 May. Both nations have stated that is the earliest possible date for foreign travel although Scotland's first minister  warned only last week that it ""may well not be possible for a further period after that"". However, family groups or bubbles can book self-catering holiday accommodation in the UK from 12 April, if the government roadmap goes according to plan. So what are your rights if you go ahead and book a holiday this summer? The BBC's Eleanor Lawrie shares the lowdown. Airlines UK, the trade body for UK-based airlines, said it was ""too early"" to predict what the Covid situation in Europe, or globally, would look like in 10 weeks' time. The trade body said its focus between now and then was working with the government ""on a framework for travel that is robust and workable, and can stand the test of time"". ""We have always said any reopening must be risk-based, but also led by the overriding assumption that as the vaccine rollout accelerates both here and abroad, a phased easing of restrictions is achievable. ""We know that universal, restriction-free travel is unlikely from 17 May but under a tiered system, based on risk, international travel can meaningfully restart and build up, with minimal restrictions, in time."" It is vital that plans to restart international travel from the UK take on board the interests of passengers, the editor of consumer organisation Which? Travel has said. Rory Boland said it was important that the rules and requirements remain consistent, ""as changing them will leave travellers footing the bill again and further risk undermining consumers' confidence in booking travel"". He said ministers must make safety, affordable tests, vaccine passports and reassurance about refunds when travel is disrupted a ""top priority"". He was commenting after awarning from health expertsthat summer holidays overseas are ""extremely unlikely"" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, Boland said: ""The government has made it clear it will make decisions on reopening travel based on the health situation abroad, meaning travel will continue to be restricted and rules will change in line with scientific guidance... ""There remains a financial risk to booking travel currently."" Some protesters have been detained by police in Hyde Park in London during an anti-lockdown demonstration. Under England's current lockdown regulations, protests are not listed as a ""reasonable excuse"" for leaving home. A small number of protesters opposed to the lockdown gathered ahead of a planned march to Westminster. Scotland Yard said London remains in a health crisis and urged people to stay at home. The demonstration came after more than 60 MPs and peers wrote to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid-19 legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown. Theletter, organised by campaign groupsLiberty and Big Brother Watch, says there is a human right to protest. A care worker has been struck off after being jailed for assaulting three police officers who were called to a party during a coronavirus lockdown. Nerys Williams, 32, of Carneddi, Bethesda, Gwynedd, admitted three charges of assaulting an emergency worker in June last year. Llandudno magistrates jailed her for a year and she was sacked by her employer Cartrefi Cymru. Social Care Wales' fitness to practise committee has now struck her off. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, has said banning international fans from the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympics is a ""great sacrifice for everybody"". We reported earlier that the Games - due to start in July - wouldnot be open to foreign spectators. Bach said: ""We share the disappointment of all enthusiastic Olympic fans from around the world, and of course the families and friends of the athletes, who were planning to come to the Games.

Man jailed for Mahrez bank card spending spree,"Riyad Mahrez joined Manchester City for Â£60 million in the summer of 2018 A man who used a bank card belonging to Manchester City star Riyad Mahrez to go on a Â£175,000 spending spree has been jailed for fraud. Sharif Mohamed, 32, admitted he spent the footballer's money on clothes for his children and drinks in high-end bars in Ibiza. But he claimed he was part of a wider gang of people who accessed the card and had been made ""the fall guy"". He was jailed for three years and eight months at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Mahrez' bank card was used at a casino in London, for hotels stays, at a nail salon and for meals at Nando's and Greggs, prosecutors said. The court heard the gang made ""hundreds of transactions"" of varying amounts in an ""incredibly intense"" period of spending. Mahrez only spotted that the large amounts had been drained from his card in September 2017, after the scam had been going on for a month. His bank was forced to reimburse him Â£175,830. Sentencing Mohamed, of Forest Gate, east London, Judge Laurence West-Knights QC said that ""staggering sums"" of money were stolen. He said: ""You knew jolly well that you had handed the card over to the rest of your group and they would go off and spend a great deal of money on it. ""The essence of this fraud was that it appears to have been one perpetrated on an individual with a great deal of money, somebody who in fact would not spot these vast sums disappearing from the account, at least not straight away."" Riyad Mahrez was playing for Leicester City at the time Sharif Mohamed raided his bank account In August 2017, when Mr Mahrez was playing for Leicester City, an individual called his bank requesting a replacement card, according to information provided by the Crown Prosecution Service. The card was not sent to the player's address and Mr Mahrez did not receive it, the court heard. The card's usage was cross-referenced with CCTV at cashpoints in a Stratford shopping centre and Leicester Haymarket, which showed Mohamed withdrawing money about 10 times.

Crowds marched from Hyde Park to Westminster as part of an anti-lockdown protest Here's a round-up of what has been happening around the UK and across the World on Saturday This video can not be played India launched what is the world's largest inoculation drive in January The city of Mumbai is to roll-out rapid coronavirus tests in crowded places as the country tries to get on top of a rise in infections. The city's local government said people would be tested randomly, in an order issued on Saturday. A refusal to be tested would ""amount to an offence"" under an 1897 epidemic law, the order said. The move came as India recorded 40,953 new cases on Saturday, the biggest daily jump for nearly four months. So far there have been 159,000 deaths related to the disease in India since the pandemic - the fourth-highest number of deaths of any country in the world. Infections have been steadily climbing in recent weeks, as the country scrambles to vaccinate its huge population. The commissioner of the local authoritytold India Today,externalthat, from 22 March, people should ""be ready for the swab test"" whenever they enter a busy area in Mumbai. Read more.

By Jon Donnison, at the scene in central London Thousands of tightly packed anti-lockdown protesters marched up Whitehall, some chanting âfreedomâ to the beat of a drum. One man carried a placard bearing the words: âNo more NHS and government lies."" Iâve seen very few demonstrators wearing masks and thereâs no attempt at social distancing. So far the police, who are here in large numbers,  have been taking a mostly hands-off approach and Iâve witnessed only one arrest. Amongst the crowd there are undoubtedly some conspiracy theorists - with some accusing mainstream media of pushing fake news . But thatâs by no means everyone here. One woman told me she knew Covid was bad, âI had it myself last March,"" she said. ""But this lockdown is too much,"" she added. The UK has recorded 5,587 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, a rise of 785 cases on the previous day, according to government figures. Nonetheless the number of cases continues to fall across the UK, based on a rolling seven-day average. Data showed a further 96 people have died within 28 days of a positive test - Friday's figure was 101. At least 26,853,407 have now received their first vaccinations, with more than two million people - 2,132,551 - having been given both jabs.    Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris A third of the French population - about 21 million people - have started their third lockdown after a surge in cases of Covid. Paris and its surrounding region plus a large part of northern France and the area around Nice are all affected by the new measure which is set to last at least four weeks. It is a lighter lockdown than the two previous ones - the main difference being that during the day people can go outside for exercise for as long as they like. Schools also are staying open. But leaving the city for the countryside is not allowed, and yesterday there was heavy congestion on the roads and the trains as some Parisians got out while they could to non-lockdown zones. Many in France find the bureaucratic approach of the government annoying if predictable. While clothes and DIY shops are shut, hairdressers, bookshops, cobblers and florists are open. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The march disrupted traffic on Park Lane, near London's Hyde Park The Met Police say numbers attending Saturday's anti-lockdown protest in London are greater than expected. Thousands are believed to be taking part in the demonstrations, far more than the 1,000 predicted to attend during planning - although the Metropolitan Police does not give formal estimates of numbers. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor says gathering outside the home is illegal under coronavirus regulations, and no protest of this size could be regarded as safe to go ahead. But he stressed the intention is always to balance the right to protest with public health requirements. There have been some arrests, but the police are currently standing back and watching how events develop. Mass arrests are not possible because it takes at least three officers to make one arrest.   Another tactic, containment (or kettling) cannot be deployed, because it would raise the risk of Covid transmission.  Labour has called the surge in coronavirus infections in parts of Europe ""really worrying"" and has called for the introduction of a ""comprehensive hotel quarantine system without further delay"" for people arriving in the UK. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""The UK's first priority has to be to protect the progress made by the vaccine."" ""Of course we all want international travel to resume, but safety has to come first."" He said it was ""too early"" to say how travel advice might change on 17 May, adding: ""We have to be led by the science, not arbitrary dates.""  This video can not be played Hundreds of people have been marching from Hyde Park to Westminster in London as part of a day of anti-lockdown protests. The Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend demonstrations under the current coronavirus rules. The Metropolitan Police said several arrests had been made.

Fund to 'spruce up' coastal towns and high streetsMinisters hope extra money and easing of rules will help areas reopen safely as lockdown eases.UK Politics,"All coastal towns in England will be eligible for government funding to help them reopen as restrictions are eased, under new plans set out by ministers. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the Â£56m fund would also ""spruce up"" high streets and help councils welcome visitors back safely. Pubs can put up marquees in their gardens for longer and there will be a crackdown on ""cowboy parking firms"". Labour said it was a ""drop in the ocean"" in terms of what areas needed. England's current""stay at home"" regulations are expected to be lifted on 29 March,with most restrictions eased in various steps by the 21 June, based on certain conditions being met at each stage. Announcing the latest tranche of funding, Mr Jenrick acknowledged it had been ""an incredibly difficult period for retail and hospitality"". He said the government would do everything it could to help businesses reopen safely. Resort prepares for post-lockdown visitor surge Top seaside town winners 'concerned about Covid' 'Nothing's open - it's heartbreaking' There has been concern about how coastal areas in particular will cope with an expected influx of visitors. When the first lockdown was eased last June, seaside resorts were gridlocked, with Bournemouth declaring a""major incident"" as people flocked to the beach. People travelled to Bournemouth from as far away as Birmingham Mr Jenrick said that this time, Â£6m of the Â£56m Welcome Back fund would be specifically allocated to support coastal areas. The remaining Â£50m will be distributed by central government to councils for things such as improving green spaces and providing more outdoor seating areas, markets and food pop-ups. He also announced the government would be ""cutting red tape"" to allow pubs to erect marquees in their gardens for ""the whole of the spring and summer"", rather than the 28 days currently permitted, so people can meet up with their family and friends ""whatever the weather"". And in a bid to attract more shoppers to the high street, ministers have announced a crackdown on cowboy parking firms. There will be a new appeals process to try to curb unfair tickets and caps will be introduced on private parking fines. The struggles of the hospitality sector amid multiple lockdowns have been well documented. And the independent retailers' trade body Bira says the past 12 months have been the worst of its members' lives -  with crucial in-person Easter and pre-Christmas trade lost. Once non-essential shops can open again, from 12 April in England, any help to attract people back will no doubt be welcome. Businesses will want to make the most of pent-up demand in a safe way. The same goes for hospitality. While social distancing will still be in place at least to start with, maximising outdoor space will be crucial for venues which have it - especially during the first phase of their reopening when only outdoor service will be permitted. Packages like these for high streets and towns won't fix the long-term challenges facing town centres: shoppers going online, leaving big high street stores increasingly empty. Some customers have grown so used to internet shopping during a year of lockdowns that the habit will stick. The hope will be, however, to make this a summer to remember after a winter to forget. Government officials say this will ""give drivers more confidence in heading into town knowing they won't be unfairly penalised by rogue operators"". Mr Jenrick said: ""As we move to the next stage on the road map out of lockdown, we are all looking forward to being reunited with friends and family outdoors and making a safe and happy return to our favourite shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants. ""Our Welcome Back Fund gives every city, town and high street support to prepare for a great summer. This funding will help councils and businesses to welcome shoppers, diners and tourists back safely. ""As soon as the road map allows, we need to get behind our local businesses and enjoy all that this country has to offer and that we've been missing so much."" But Labour has accused the Conservatives of presiding over ""decades of decline"". The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said: ""This is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much the Conservatives took away over a decade when they pushed our high streets and seaside towns into deep decline - and it's not clear which areas will benefit. ""The Conservatives have done nothing to level the playing field between high street shops and online retailers.  Now they want to hollow high streets out by selling off temporarily closed shops to wealthy developers so they can never reopen as shops again.

Infections have been steadily climbing in recent weeks, as the country scrambles to vaccinate its huge population. The commissioner of the local authoritytold India Today,externalthat, from 22 March, people should ""be ready for the swab test"" whenever they enter a busy area in Mumbai. Read more. Half of all UK adults have now received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - and the BT Tower in central London has been lit up to mark the occasion.

By Jon Donnison, at the scene in central London Thousands of tightly packed anti-lockdown protesters marched up Whitehall, some chanting âfreedomâ to the beat of a drum. One man carried a placard bearing the words: âNo more NHS and government lies."" Iâve seen very few demonstrators wearing masks and thereâs no attempt at social distancing. So far the police, who are here in large numbers,  have been taking a mostly hands-off approach and Iâve witnessed only one arrest. Amongst the crowd there are undoubtedly some conspiracy theorists - with some accusing mainstream media of pushing fake news . But thatâs by no means everyone here. One woman told me she knew Covid was bad, âI had it myself last March,"" she said. ""But this lockdown is too much,"" she added. The UK has recorded 5,587 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, a rise of 785 cases on the previous day, according to government figures. Nonetheless the number of cases continues to fall across the UK, based on a rolling seven-day average. Data showed a further 96 people have died within 28 days of a positive test - Friday's figure was 101. At least 26,853,407 have now received their first vaccinations, with more than two million people - 2,132,551 - having been given both jabs.    Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris A third of the French population - about 21 million people - have started their third lockdown after a surge in cases of Covid. Paris and its surrounding region plus a large part of northern France and the area around Nice are all affected by the new measure which is set to last at least four weeks. It is a lighter lockdown than the two previous ones - the main difference being that during the day people can go outside for exercise for as long as they like. Schools also are staying open. But leaving the city for the countryside is not allowed, and yesterday there was heavy congestion on the roads and the trains as some Parisians got out while they could to non-lockdown zones. Many in France find the bureaucratic approach of the government annoying if predictable. While clothes and DIY shops are shut, hairdressers, bookshops, cobblers and florists are open. Tom SymondsHome Affairs Correspondent The march disrupted traffic on Park Lane, near London's Hyde Park The Met Police say numbers attending Saturday's anti-lockdown protest in London are greater than expected. Thousands are believed to be taking part in the demonstrations, far more than the 1,000 predicted to attend during planning - although the Metropolitan Police does not give formal estimates of numbers. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor says gathering outside the home is illegal under coronavirus regulations, and no protest of this size could be regarded as safe to go ahead. But he stressed the intention is always to balance the right to protest with public health requirements. There have been some arrests, but the police are currently standing back and watching how events develop. Mass arrests are not possible because it takes at least three officers to make one arrest.   Another tactic, containment (or kettling) cannot be deployed, because it would raise the risk of Covid transmission.  Labour has called the surge in coronavirus infections in parts of Europe ""really worrying"" and has called for the introduction of a ""comprehensive hotel quarantine system without further delay"" for people arriving in the UK. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""The UK's first priority has to be to protect the progress made by the vaccine."" ""Of course we all want international travel to resume, but safety has to come first."" He said it was ""too early"" to say how travel advice might change on 17 May, adding: ""We have to be led by the science, not arbitrary dates.""  This video can not be played Hundreds of people have been marching from Hyde Park to Westminster in London as part of a day of anti-lockdown protests. The Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend demonstrations under the current coronavirus rules. The Metropolitan Police said several arrests had been made. Gareth GriffithsBBC Sport Wales Wales claimed a 22nd Triple Crown against England on their way to Paris Wales rugby fans are all set for another potential Grand Slam Saturday - but it will be a day unlike any others. Scotland host Italy and England travel to Dublin as the Six Nations appetisers before the main course in Paris with only France and unbeaten Wales still able to win the tournament. A win would clinch Wales' fifth Grand Slam of the Six Nations era. But because of Covid-19 this would be the first without fans at the game or in pubs and rugby clubs across Wales. Whether events will be resolved on ""Super Saturday"" remains to be seen with Scotland still to travel to Paris on 26 March, six days after the anticipated end of the tournament. The original game in February was called off because of Covid-19 cases in the France camp which has potentially spoiled the concept of everything being finalised on the last day. Read more here. On Saturday, there were protests against the government""s coronavirus restrictions in Kassel, Germany Dr Guenther Schoenrich, deputy director of the Institute of Virology at the Charite Hospital in Berlin, has told the BBC another lockdown in Germany is inevitable. ""It looks like that we have no choice because the virus is spreading and, as already pointed out, we have a new variant, the variant that has been first detected in the UK, also now here in German,"" he said. Dr Schoenrich said it was harder to prevent the the British variant from spreading as it is ""more transmissible"", adding the situation was exacerbated because ""at the same time we have not enough people vaccinated so far"". Partial lockdowns were reintroduced in France and Poland on Saturday, as many European countries face the prospect of a third wave. Germany is seeing an exponential rise in cases, with infections on the Czech border more than 15 times the government's target. Experts have warned against British people travelling to Europe this summer, because of the risk of bring back new variants - and the slow pace of vaccination in many EU countries. So what are the rules around travel at the moment - and when and where can we get away? At the moment, the key date to watch - at least in England and Scotland - is 17 May. Both nations have stated that is the earliest possible date for foreign travel although Scotland's first minister  warned only last week that it ""may well not be possible for a further period after that"". However, family groups or bubbles can book self-catering holiday accommodation in the UK from 12 April, if the government roadmap goes according to plan. So what are your rights if you go ahead and book a holiday this summer? The BBC's Eleanor Lawrie shares the lowdown. Airlines UK, the trade body for UK-based airlines, said it was ""too early"" to predict what the Covid situation in Europe, or globally, would look like in 10 weeks' time. The trade body said its focus between now and then was working with the government ""on a framework for travel that is robust and workable, and can stand the test of time"". ""We have always said any reopening must be risk-based, but also led by the overriding assumption that as the vaccine rollout accelerates both here and abroad, a phased easing of restrictions is achievable. ""We know that universal, restriction-free travel is unlikely from 17 May but under a tiered system, based on risk, international travel can meaningfully restart and build up, with minimal restrictions, in time."" It is vital that plans to restart international travel from the UK take on board the interests of passengers, the editor of consumer organisation Which? Travel has said. Rory Boland said it was important that the rules and requirements remain consistent, ""as changing them will leave travellers footing the bill again and further risk undermining consumers' confidence in booking travel"". He said ministers must make safety, affordable tests, vaccine passports and reassurance about refunds when travel is disrupted a ""top priority"". He was commenting after awarning from health expertsthat summer holidays overseas are ""extremely unlikely"" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, Boland said: ""The government has made it clear it will make decisions on reopening travel based on the health situation abroad, meaning travel will continue to be restricted and rules will change in line with scientific guidance... ""There remains a financial risk to booking travel currently."" Some protesters have been detained by police in Hyde Park in London during an anti-lockdown demonstration. Under England's current lockdown regulations, protests are not listed as a ""reasonable excuse"" for leaving home. A small number of protesters opposed to the lockdown gathered ahead of a planned march to Westminster. Scotland Yard said London remains in a health crisis and urged people to stay at home. The demonstration came after more than 60 MPs and peers wrote to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid-19 legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown. Theletter, organised by campaign groupsLiberty and Big Brother Watch, says there is a human right to protest. A care worker has been struck off after being jailed for assaulting three police officers who were called to a party during a coronavirus lockdown. Nerys Williams, 32, of Carneddi, Bethesda, Gwynedd, admitted three charges of assaulting an emergency worker in June last year. Llandudno magistrates jailed her for a year and she was sacked by her employer Cartrefi Cymru. Social Care Wales' fitness to practise committee has now struck her off. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, has said banning international fans from the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympics is a ""great sacrifice for everybody"". We reported earlier that the Games - due to start in July - wouldnot be open to foreign spectators. Bach said: ""We share the disappointment of all enthusiastic Olympic fans from around the world, and of course the families and friends of the athletes, who were planning to come to the Games. For this I am truly sorry. ""Every decision has to respect the principle of safety first. I know that our Japanese partners and friends did not reach this conclusion lightly. ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the side of our Japanese partners and friends, without any kind of reservation, to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 a great success."" International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons said ""difficult decisions"" had to be made with safety the ""top priority"". ""It goes without saying that in an ideal world we would prefer to have international spectators at the Games,"" he said. ""But at the moment we must acknowledge that due to the global pandemic we are not living in an ideal world."" After Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that half of UK adults had received their first vaccine dose, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tweeted his gratitude to ""everyone involved""...

Earlier this month Italy blocked the export of 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has threatened to halt exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine if the bloc does not receive its promised deliveries first. ""We have the option of banning a planned export. That's the message to AstraZeneca: you fulfil your contract with Europe first before you start delivering to other countries,"" Ms von der Leyen told Germany's Funke media group. The European Commission president said AstraZeneca had delivered only 30% of the 90 million vaccine doses it had promised for the first quarter of the year. The EU is struggling to accelerate its vaccination programme, with athird wave of cases bearing down on many parts of the continent. Ms von der Leyen said the EU's contract with AstraZeneca states that vaccines destined for the bloc would be produced in both EU and UK plants, ""but we haven't received anything from the Brits"".

"Rich states 'block' vaccine plans for poor nationsVaccine production proposals are being stalled, WHO documents leaked to BBC Newsnight show.","Many experts say equitable access to vaccines is essential for global population immunity Wealthy countries - including the UK - are blocking proposals to help developing nations increase their vaccine manufacturing capabilities, documents leaked to BBC Newsnight show. Several poorer countries have asked the World Health Organization to help them. But richer nations are pushing back on provisions in international law that would enable them to achieve this. This is according to a leaked copy of the negotiating text of a WHO resolution on the issue. Among those richer nations are the UK, the US, as well as the European Union. UK fighting patent-free Covid vaccine proposals World on brink of catastrophic moral failure - WHO India begins world's biggest Covid vaccine drive ""Where we could have language in there that would make it easier for countries to produce more vaccines and more medicines within their country, it would include initiatives that would finance and facilitate that. The UK is on the opposite side of the argument of trying to remove those kinds of progressive proposals from the text,"" says Diarmaid McDonald, from Just Treatment, a patient group for fair access to medicines. A spokesperson for the UK government says ""a global pandemic requires a global solution and the UK is leading from the front, driving forward efforts to ensure equitable access around the world to Covid vaccines and treatments"". The spokesperson says the UK is one of the largest donors to international efforts to ensure over one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines get to developing countries this year. If and when governments should intervene to ensure affordable supplies of medicines is a long-standing issue. But the ability of different countries to source vaccines and drugs has been highlighted by the pandemic. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? Many experts say equitable access to vaccines is essential to prevent cases and deaths and to contribute to global population immunity. But the global capacity for producing vaccines is about a third of what is needed, says Ellen t'Hoen, an expert in medicines policy and intellectual property law. ""These are vaccines that are produced in wealthy countries and are in general kept by those wealthy countries. ""Developing nations are saying we need to have a share of the pie, not only the share of the vaccines, but also the share of the right to produce these vaccines,"" she adds. To make a vaccine you not only need to have the right to produce the actual substance they are composed of (which is protected by patents), you also need to have the knowledge about how to make them because the technology can be complex. The WHO does not have the authority to sidestep patents - but it is trying to bring countries together to find a way to bolster vaccine supplies. The discussions include using provisions in international law to get around patents and helping countries to have the technical ability to make them. But the drug industry argues that eroding patents would hinder its ability to invest in future treatments for Covid and other illnesses. Earlier this month, representatives of the US drug industry wrote to US President Joe Biden to share their concerns. ""Eliminating those protections would undermine the global response to the pandemic,"" they wrote, including ongoing efforts to tackle new variants. It would also create confusion that could potentially undermine public confidence in vaccine safety, and create a barrier to information sharing, the representatives said. ""Most importantly, eliminating protections would not speed up production,"" they added. Others agree. Anne Moore, an expert in vaccine immunology, worries about what impact undermining patents will have on future research. ""Over time we see fewer and fewer organisations and commercial companies being in the vaccine field because there's so little return on it,"" she says. Drug companies point out they have also donated financially and given medicines to help tackle the pandemic. But campaigners argue that about Â£90bn ($125bn) of public money has gone into developing Covid treatments and vaccines so the public should have a stake. Once the pandemic ends, there is a lot of money to be made, they say. ""It's obvious that there are longer-term plans to increase the price of these vaccines once the most urgent phase of the pandemic is over. So that is another reason why developing countries are saying we need to gain the ability to produce these vaccines ourselves now,"" Ms t'Hoen says.

Viral video exposes college basketball inequality,"Fighting Ducks forward Sedona Prince is competing for the championship A video from a US college basketball player has gone viral for showing the inequalities between the equipment given to male and female players. University of Oregon forward Sedona Prince showed the fully-stocked weight room given to men's teams for the annual National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament. But women were only given one small rack of exercise weights. The contrast shown in Ms Prince's TikTok brought widespread criticism.

Man jailed for assault of former Quinn directors,"Bernard McGovern had admitted attacking Kevin Lunney and Dara O'Reilly An amateur boxer has been jailed for three years and three months for assaulting two directors of the former Quinn group of companies. Bernard McGovern, 24, from Springtown Road in Kinawley, County Fermanagh, admitted attacking Kevin Lunney and Dara O'Reilly at a service station in County Cavan on 1 February 2019. He was sentenced on Friday. Mr Lunney and Mr O'Reilly were having lunch in Ballyconnell when they were attacked. Cavan Circuit Court was told that McGovern punched Kevin Lunney up to eight times in the face, leaving the chief operating officer with a broken nose and swollen eye. He also threw a cup of hot tea in the face of Mr O'Reilly, the chief financial officer. The previous day McGovern's father had been fired from his job as a driver with the company. The court was told McGovern had no involvement in subsequent events in September 2019, when Mr Lunney was abducted and tortured by a gang. Kevin Lunney was attacked while eating lunch The judge described the attack as the two men were having lunch as ""callous and premeditated"". In his sentencing remarks, the judge said McGovern had been motivated by a desire to avenge a grievance. He said the prize-winning boxer had caused very serious injuries through ""the vicious use of his fists"" and had thrown a cup of recently-boiled water in the face of Mr O'Reilly. The judge said the offences were at the upper end of the scale when it came to assault causing harm, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He added that although the accused had pleaded guilty, that was in the context of the overwhelming case against him. The Quinn group of companies - of which Kevin Lunney and Dara O'Reilly were directors - was rebranded last year The judge said he would give McGovern some credit for his young age and no previous convictions. He said ""his first experience of prison will no doubt be hard on him"". McGovern was sentenced to three years and three months in prison for assault causing harm for the attack on Mr Lunney, and five months for assaulting Mr O'Reilly, to be served concurrently. McGovern will receive credit for six-and-a-half months already spent in custody. The judge said the offer of â¬1,000 (Â£854) compensation to Mr Lunney as a token of his remorse was not appropriate in this case, given the severe nature of the injuries. He said he had also considered suspending a portion of the sentence but had decided it was not appropriate to do so.
