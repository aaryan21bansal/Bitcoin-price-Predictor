Morrisons: Shareholders approve Â£7bn takeover,"Shareholders in the supermarket chain Morrisons have approved a multi-billion pound takeover offer from a US private equity group. Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) can now continue to take over the UK's fourth-largest supermarket group. Morrisons said 99.2% of shareholders voted in favour of the Â£7bn ($9.7bn) deal. The takeover had been the subject of fierce competition from two US-based investment groups. The CD&R private equity group won the auction early in October with an offer of 287p per Morrisons ordinary share, against a rival bid from Fortress, for 286p per share. CD&R's auction offer was slightly higher than the 285p-a-share offer that was recommended by Morrisons' board in August. In July, Morrisons turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business. Morrisons hails 'renaissance of the supermarket' US firm wins auction to take over Morrisons Morrisons to give workers Boxing Day off The takeover marks a return to the UK grocery sector for Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R. Morrisons chair Andrew Higginson said: ""We thank shareholders for the strong support received at today's meetings. ""We remain confident that CD&R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of Morrisons and we will now move forward with the remaining steps in the acquisition process."" There has been speculation that Sir Terry could be appointed as chair of Morrisons. On Tuesday, Sir Terry said: ""We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead. ""The particular heritage, culture and operating model of Morrisons are key features of the company and we will be very mindful of these during our tenure as owners. ""We very much look forward to working with the Morrisons team, not just to preserve the company's many strengths - but to build on these, with innovation, capital and new technology - helping the business realise its full potential and delivering for all of its stakeholders."" The deal is expected to complete on 27 October. Morrisons has been involved in a legal dispute over equal pay since 2019. Last month Leeds Employment Tribunal found that Morrisons' shop floor workers, who are mostly female, could compare their pay with the supermarket's mostly male warehouse workers. Shop floor staff are hoping to claim up to Â£100m in missed pay. Law firms Leigh Day and Roscoe Reid have been representing about 2,300 Morrisons workers. Emma Satyamurti, a Leigh Day partner, said the takeover deal shows that employees are the ""backbone of the company and so it makes sense that the supermarket should invest in them"". ""We hope the new owners feel the same and bring an end to the equal pay dispute by paying shop floor workers what they are worth."" Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. The son of founder William Morrison's, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years. Previously, CD&R said it recognised Morrisons' ""history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing"". The private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and its property portfolio. Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson and chief operating officer Trevor Strain both previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco.

FBI searches US homes linked to Russian oligarch,"The FBI has given no details about the searches FBI agents are sweeping properties in the US linked to Russian billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Mr Deripaska, who has close ties to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, was placed under US sanctions in 2018. The oligarch's spokesman told Reuters news agency the FBI is searching two homes owned by relatives of Mr Deripaska under court warrants related to those sanctions. Images showed agents carrying boxes out of a Washington DC home. Others stood guard outside behind yellow crime scene tape. The representative said another property in New York was also being searched. So far it is unclear exactly why the searches are taking place. A spokesperson for the FBI told NBC News the agency was conducting ""law enforcement activity"" at the Washington DC property, without giving any further details. Mr Deripaska, 53, made his fortune in the 1990s as a metals broker. In 1997 he founded the industrial group Basic Element, one of Russia's largest, which he still owns. Oleg Deripaska is a multibillionaire aluminium magnate The US Treasury placed Mr Deripaska under sanctions in 2018along with six other Russian oligarchs, as well as a number of companies they own and senior Russian government officials. Steve Mnuchin, then Treasury secretary, said the move was a response to Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, which Moscow denies. ""The Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe,""a statement released at the time,externalsaid. ""Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government's destabilizing activities."" A year laterUS President Donald Trump lifted sanctionson three firms linked to Mr Deripaska after he ceded control, a move criticised by Democrat politicians. Sanctions remained on the magnate himself, however. Mr Deripaska also has links with Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for President Trump, who was convicted of fraud beforehis pardon by Mr Trump in December 2020.

Google's Pixel 6 processor adds AI photo features,"Google has unveiled its latest smartphone, containing the tech giant's first self-designed computer chip. The Pixel 6 contains Google's ""Tensor"" processor, which it says enables new phone features powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is also the first phone in the series with a ""Pro"" model, designed to compete at the high end of the market. ""The whole goal when we started was to reach this point,"" said Rick Osterloh, Google's head of devices. ""Really, this is our original vision that we're finally able to get to after building a lot of capabilities both in technology and in product development capabilities,"" he told the BBC. Google owns and operates the Android platform, used by almost every mobile phone maker apart from Apple. But the top end of the Android market has been dominated by other smartphone brands such as Samsung, whose phones can cost more than Â£1,000. Google's Pixel line has often been priced in the middle of the market. But the new Pixel 6 will retail for Â£599/$599, while the Pro model will cost Â£849/$899.  bringing it closer to the price of competing top-end devices. That is the same launch price for the base model as the Pixel 5, which had,Google said at the time, been designed for ""an economic downturn"". ""Obviously, there's a lot of technology and these are expensive, for sure, but we're trying to offer users good value despite the fact that these are flagships,"" Mr Osterloh said. Both the Pixel 6 and Pro are standard form-factor smartphones with a striking large horizontal bar across the upper back of the phone. That bar contains all the camera lenses and sensors, instead of putting them off to one side in a camera ""bump"" popular on many modern models. Both versions have a 50-megapixel (MP) main camera and a 12MP ultrawide. The Pro model has an additional 48MP camera, giving it a 4x optical zoom. The Pro model also has more memory, a higher-resolution screen, and a faster screen refresh rate of up to 120hz - or 120 screen refreshes a second, which can make animations and fast movements appear smoother. Modern smartphones rely heavily on ""computational photography"" to take good, clear photos. It is what gives each phone maker their own distinctive ""look"" to photos. ""For a long time, Pixel has been known for awesome photography, which is truly a function of our ability to do AI-driven, machine-learning-driven improvements to the camera experience,"" Mr Osterloh said. ""With this new platform, with Tensor, we've literally designed the platform to to be able to support he most cutting-edge work we have in all aspects of AI."" One of those is what Google calls a ""magic eraser"" - a system where the Photos app will detect distractions in the photo such as someone walking in the background, and try to remove them. The company says it can also be used for things such as power poles or wires, and users can manually select things to remove as well as the automatic system. Another new feature is ""face deblur"". When taking a photo with the rear-facing camera, it will use all available cameras and take multiple versions. So if a person is constantly moving - such as Google's example of a young child - the camera will attempt to fix a blurry face by combining all the data, and attempt to figure out what the non-blurred version should look like. The new processing power in its latest chip means that technology can now be applied to videos as they are recorded, giving them the same type of style as Pixel's still cameras. Asked if the new features would make their way to other Android phones, Mr Osterloh said: ""Many of them will only be Pixel"". He said while it is possible some might eventually be available on other devices, ""a lot of it really requires this custom architecture and therefore it's likely to be on products that run Tensor for the foreseeable future only"". Google hadfirst teased the existence of the Pixel 6 and Pixel Pro in August,external- along with its Tensor processor. Until now, it has used chips designed by chip firm Qualcomm. But it says the Tensor chip is up to 80% faster than the Pixel 5 from 2020, as well as being power-efficient. One significant advantage to its new chip, Google says, is that it can do more on the phone itself, without being connected to the internet - particularly through Google's popular virtual assistant. For example, it says that voice transcription - which now uses the Google Assistant - will be faster and more accurate. Users can say ""Hey Google, type"" instead of tapping a button, and can also use voice commands to send messages. The voice system can be used at the same time as the text keyboard. Google's recorder app also leverages the snappier processor to live-transcribe audio recordings as they're made, even when the phone is not connected to the internet. It also means that Google's live translation features are snappier than before, as more of the processing is done on the machine itself. But it does not mean that Google Assistant will work perfectly offline for privacy campaigners. ""To be really useful, you need to assume that it's going to use the cloud,"" Mr Osterloh said. ""The speech recognition part of that workflow will happen on the device... [and] all the dictation"". But most people ask for weather, or sports scores or other kinds of information that has to be retrieved from the internet. ""We're moving more and more workloads from the cloud to the device, we're trying to do that... to make sure the user has the best possible performance. But certainly this indicates a direction for privacy as well.""

"Food price rises are terrifying, warns industry","Food and drink firms are seeing ""terrifying"" price rises, a sector trade body has said, warning of a knock-on effect for consumers. Food and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright told MPs inflation is between 14% and 18% for hospitality firms. The price rises for food firms' ingredients will lead to consumer price rises, he said, and described the situation as concerning. The UK's rate of inflation was 3.2% in August and is expected to rise further. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey recentlywarned it ""will have to act"", suggesting that UK interest rates may soon rise from the historic low of 0.1%. Mr Wright told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: ""Inflation is a bigger scourge than anything else because it discriminates against the poor."" What is the UK's inflation rate and why is it going up? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? The Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures for September on Wednesday. It is expected to rise further above the Bank of England's target of 2% for longer than previously thought. Make UK, the manufacturers' organisation, said that inflation was becoming ""baked in"" among its members. Stephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, told MPs that while there was a welcome rise in demand, many manufacturers are looking at 30% to 40% average increases in material costs. ""When people are able to get hold of materials they are passing those costs on which does imply to us that inflation is more or less baked in at this stage now,"" he said. ""This is not a transitory inflationary demand we are seeing really serious issues now in terms of price increases."" Des Gunewardena, chief executive of high-end restaurant group D&D London, says his business has seen half of its costs rise, including surging energy prices. He says staff shortages are his ""number one issue"" and has increased salaries by 10%. The business has 1,700 employees across the UK and is currently 150 staff short, which he said could lead to a ""nightmare situation"" in the busier December period. Table covers have been reduced from 400 on a Friday night at his Quaglino's restaurant to between 300 and 350 due to staff shortages. However, he said the restaurants have seen increased customer spending, so he is stocking up on specific champagne brands ahead of time, to pre-empt possible supply problems. ""I think we'll have a very strong Christmas so there's no need to panic yet, but I expect further inflation in January when there won't be the same spending to offset the extra costs"". Amid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas, the government is taking steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers. The shortage has been blamed on several factors, including Covid, Brexit and tax changes. The government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), told the select committee that the government's visa scheme to ease driver shortages had been ""designed to fail"". ""Reports haven't really eased at all things are not visibly getting better at this stage,"" he said. Regarding the government's measures to try to ease the crisis, Mr Buchanan said ""visually on the ground that is not having an effect"". A survey by the RHA of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. ""The consumer is really going to visualise this in terms of reduced choice. We have supply chain disruption but that doesn't mean we are going to run out of food,"" Mr Buchanan added. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"Sala flight organiser 'hired unqualified pilot'David Henderson, 67, denies the charge of endangering the safety of an aircraft.Wales","David Henderson denies the charge of endangering the safety of an aircraft A man acted ""recklessly and dangerously"" when he organised a flight carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala, a court has heard. David Henderson, 67, of Main Street, Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, enlisted a pilot who was neither qualified nor competent, said prosecutor Martin Goudie. Sala and pilot David Ibbotson died in the crash in January 2019. Mr Henderson denies endangering the safety of an aircraft. The defendant hadpreviously admitted a chargeof attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation. Emiliano Sala had just signed with Cardiff City Mr Henderson was scheduled to pilot the flights which took Sala, 28, from Cardiff to Nantes and back again, but could not, as he was on holiday in Paris with his wife, Cardiff Crown Court heard. Instead, he asked Mr Ibbotson, who he knew, to pilot the flights, despite him not having a commercial licence, Mr Goudie said. The story of Emiliano Sala Legal action in footballer Sala's crash death case Sala - timeline of Cardiff City signing The court was told that Mr Ibbotson was not competent to fly in the poor weather Mr Henderson knew had been forecast. He added Mr Henderson ""ignored certain requirements"" and that the organised flights were ""not operated and organised out of a love for Emiliano Sala or Cardiff City Football Club"", but for his business interests. The second flight in the single-engine Piper Malibu came down in the English Channel on 21 January. Sala's body was recovered, but Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowley, Lincolnshire, has never been found In the summer of 2018, more than six months before the crash, Mr Henderson was told by the aircraft's owners that Mr Ibbotson ""should not pilot the Piper-Malibu again"" after he committed two airspace infringements while flying it. Mr Goudie told the jury the defendant ""was aware that there were issues with Mr Ibbotson's flying from the start"", even before the letters from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Following the letters, Mr Ibbotson wrote to Mr Henderson suggesting he thought Mr Henderson would not be using him again. 'I'm practically dead while livingâ Cardiff and Nantes mark Sala death Fay Keely, who represented the trust which owned the aircraft, was ""not aware Mr Ibbotson was the pilot"" on either of the flights between Nantes and Cardiff, the court heard. Responding to Mr Ibbotson, Mr Henderson replied: ""I am just responding to emails from Fay who has forwarded me two letters from CAA. ""I have always said the flying we do is challenging and everyone has to be on the ball. It is a steep learning curve for someone new to the operation. ""The prerequisite is a willingness to listen and learn. We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA... As self-employed sole traders we both have debtors and creditors and surely you understand that to remain legal we can't take money in advance."" The Piper Malibu N264DB disappeared from radar near the Channel Islands on 21 January. But Mr Henderson, who managed the day-to-day operations of the aircraft, had contacted Mr Ibbotson again about flying the aircraft by 5 August. Mr Goudie said: ""Right from the get-go, Mr Henderson was aware he was dealing with someone who had a private licence, not a commercial one."" Communications between Mr Henderson and Mr Ibbotson from August and October 2018, showed Mr Henderson talking about flying at night and flying outside his qualifications. The court heard Mr Henderson tried to rearrange the time of the return flight to Cardiff, but this was to avoid incurring costs at Cardiff Airport and not because of Mr Ibbotson's lack of qualifications to fly at night. Mr Goudie told the court the pilot did have an American qualification, which he received in 2014, but he was not allowed to be paid as a private pilot. He added Mr Ibbotson never held a commercial pilot's licence in the UK and his rating to fly the type of aircraft expired on 20 November 2018. On the night the plane went missing, Mr Goudie said Mr Henderson sent a text message to an aircraft engineer saying ""don't say a word"", and asked others to keep quiet because ""questions may be asked about his flying"". Another text to a different recipient said: ""Ibbo has crashed the Malibu and killed himself and VIP pax! Bloody disaster. There will be an enquiry [sic]."" Mr Goudie said: ""It's clear on the evidence that [Mr Henderson] knew Mr Ibbotson well, frequently discussed his qualifications with him and knew he was deficient."" He said Mr Henderson responded to written questions from the CAA in June 2020, and said he ""didn't know the precise status of Mr Ibbotson's licences and ratings"". Mr Goudie said this was a ""lie"". He added Mr Henderson denied being the operator of the aircraft at the time, something he now accepts. The trial continues.

24 children wait year for first cancer appointment,"This video can not be played Children's Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma described the waiting times as ""terrifying"" Twenty-four children in Northern Ireland with confirmed or suspected cancers had to wait over a year for a first appointment, a review has found. The figure, for April, is in a review of waiting lists by the NI Commissioner for Children and Young People. More than 17,000 children were waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time. The health minster later said that by September there were no ""red flag"" paediatric patients waiting that long. The review examined official waiting list data for children's health services not published as part of the Department of Health's statistical bulletins. The commissioner said the waiting times were ""terrifying"". Koulla Yiasouma said that waiting for any health service treatment can and does have a ""profound impact on a child's health outcomes, emotional and mental well-being"". She said it was ""shocking not only for the child but their families too"". ""Each and every single one of them is a child and each and every single one of them is a child whose life has almost been put on hold, and a family whose life has been put on hold, because they are not getting the most fundamental right of healthcare that they deserve,"" she said. Dr Ray Nethercott, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was shocked by the cancer figures. ""It is outrageous and there are probably many other words that spring to the minds of parents who are worried and concerned and colleagues who are facing into this,"" he said. ""Some of the answer will be about embracing and delivering that reform, delivering innovation, delivering different ways of managing children as close to home as possible. ""To be able to do that, it's not all about the workforce, but it's actually about giving some due care and attention to child health services as a distinct entity. ""I can't say that there's any way to do it immediately - I've got lots of ideas as do many of my colleagues. ""But really children and children's voices and people that work with children have a very small voice in our health system."" The review, called More Than Just a Number, examined the number of children and young people on waiting lists, and the length of time they wait to access first or review appointments with consultants for treatment in hospitals and also for services based in the community. It found that in April 2021, one in five children and young people in Northern Ireland were waiting for a first or review appointment with a consultant. It also found 17,194 children and young people were waiting more than one year and 510 more than four years. The conditions affected included scoliosis, speech and language therapy and autism. This video can not be played NI Health: Children 'suffering' on hospital waiting lists, says mum Mandy O'Connor has two daughters waiting for reviews. Her eldest daughter had an operation in Turkey for scoliosis in 2018 that cost them Â£35,000 for the operation alone, otherwise she would have been waiting 18 months for surgery in Northern Ireland. She has not been seen in Northern Ireland since that operation and the family is travelling to Turkey on Wednesday for a follow-up appointment. Her second daughter doesn't know if she has scoliosis which means time is of the essence to find out so they can tackle it early. ""From when Tasha [her eldest daughter] was diagnosed she was in extreme pain for the 16 weeks while we were fundraising,"" Mrs O'Connor said. ""To think what she would have been like for 18 months on that waiting list and even for the referral it was 16 weeks. ""It was marked urgent at the time - Tasha wasn't seen for a referral. The referral went in on July 2018, she wasn't seen until November 2018."" She said her second daughter had to wait 12 months for a first referral. ""That was in August 2019. She wasn't seen until August 2020 and as yet she hasn't been seen since."" The review found 17,194 children and young people were waiting over one year to see a hospital consultant for the first time As well as looking at hospital waits, it also raises other issues including the ""complete absence"" of regional monitoring or reporting of waiting times for child health services in the community. The absence of such critical information according to the commissioner makes it impossible to get a clear understanding of the number of children who are waiting for these services. It found that at least 26,818 children in Northern Ireland were waiting for a community-based health service but it is thought the figure is much higher. The report makes 17 recommendations. These include: A full review of the child health system and appointing a deputy chief medical officer dedicated to children's health Establishing a single point of entry system across all health trusts for all child services Establishing a transparent budgeting process that shows clear budgeting lines for public spending on children's health services which meets the five child rights principles for public budgeting Health Minister Robin Swann said waiting lists were a top priority Health Minister Robin Swann said he was grateful to the commissioner for the ""detailed review"". ""My department and the wider HSC (Health and Social Care) system will carefully consider the report and recommendations from the commissioner as part of our ongoing work to transform and rebuild services,"" he said. ""Waiting times were clearly unacceptable prior to Covid-19 and have been exacerbated by the devastating impact of the pandemic across all aspects of service provision including, unfortunately, across children's services. ""Addressing these waiting lists is a top priority for me... it will require systemic change and long-term investment."" Ms Yiasouma said she welcomed the health minister's commitment to improve waiting lists and to address the ""underlying issues which drive them"". ""Waiting times are one of the clearest indicators of a system under immense strain and unable to meet the needs of its population,"" she added. ""We must strive to get to a point where all children and young people can get access to the right care, at the right time and the right place and no child ls left waiting months or years in a queue to access services."" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the waiting times figures for children with cancer were ""utterly appalling"". ""I think we should see somebody very senior in the Department of Health appointed as a deputy chief medical officer to oversee children's health in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""I think we need to invest more in children's health. ""I think children should have a degree of priority when it comes to such services.""

Sala flight organiser 'hired unqualified pilot',"David Henderson denies the charge of endangering the safety of an aircraft A man acted ""recklessly and dangerously"" when he organised a flight carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala, a court has heard. David Henderson, 67, of Main Street, Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, enlisted a pilot who was neither qualified nor competent, said prosecutor Martin Goudie. Sala and pilot David Ibbotson died in the crash in January 2019. Mr Henderson denies endangering the safety of an aircraft. The defendant hadpreviously admitted a chargeof attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation. Emiliano Sala had just signed with Cardiff City Mr Henderson was scheduled to pilot the flights which took Sala, 28, from Cardiff to Nantes and back again, but could not, as he was on holiday in Paris with his wife, Cardiff Crown Court heard. Instead, he asked Mr Ibbotson, who he knew, to pilot the flights, despite him not having a commercial licence, Mr Goudie said. The story of Emiliano Sala Legal action in footballer Sala's crash death case Sala - timeline of Cardiff City signing The court was told that Mr Ibbotson was not competent to fly in the poor weather Mr Henderson knew had been forecast. He added Mr Henderson ""ignored certain requirements"" and that the organised flights were ""not operated and organised out of a love for Emiliano Sala or Cardiff City Football Club"", but for his business interests. The second flight in the single-engine Piper Malibu came down in the English Channel on 21 January. Sala's body was recovered, but Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowley, Lincolnshire, has never been found In the summer of 2018, more than six months before the crash, Mr Henderson was told by the aircraft's owners that Mr Ibbotson ""should not pilot the Piper-Malibu again"" after he committed two airspace infringements while flying it. Mr Goudie told the jury the defendant ""was aware that there were issues with Mr Ibbotson's flying from the start"", even before the letters from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Following the letters, Mr Ibbotson wrote to Mr Henderson suggesting he thought Mr Henderson would not be using him again. 'I'm practically dead while livingâ Cardiff and Nantes mark Sala death Fay Keely, who represented the trust which owned the aircraft, was ""not aware Mr Ibbotson was the pilot"" on either of the flights between Nantes and Cardiff, the court heard. Responding to Mr Ibbotson, Mr Henderson replied: ""I am just responding to emails from Fay who has forwarded me two letters from CAA. ""I have always said the flying we do is challenging and everyone has to be on the ball. It is a steep learning curve for someone new to the operation. ""The prerequisite is a willingness to listen and learn. We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA... As self-employed sole traders we both have debtors and creditors and surely you understand that to remain legal we can't take money in advance."" The Piper Malibu N264DB disappeared from radar near the Channel Islands on 21 January. But Mr Henderson, who managed the day-to-day operations of the aircraft, had contacted Mr Ibbotson again about flying the aircraft by 5 August. Mr Goudie said: ""Right from the get-go, Mr Henderson was aware he was dealing with someone who had a private licence, not a commercial one."" Communications between Mr Henderson and Mr Ibbotson from August and October 2018, showed Mr Henderson talking about flying at night and flying outside his qualifications. The court heard Mr Henderson tried to rearrange the time of the return flight to Cardiff, but this was to avoid incurring costs at Cardiff Airport and not because of Mr Ibbotson's lack of qualifications to fly at night. Mr Goudie told the court the pilot did have an American qualification, which he received in 2014, but he was not allowed to be paid as a private pilot. He added Mr Ibbotson never held a commercial pilot's licence in the UK and his rating to fly the type of aircraft expired on 20 November 2018. On the night the plane went missing, Mr Goudie said Mr Henderson sent a text message to an aircraft engineer saying ""don't say a word"", and asked others to keep quiet because ""questions may be asked about his flying"". Another text to a different recipient said: ""Ibbo has crashed the Malibu and killed himself and VIP pax! Bloody disaster. There will be an enquiry [sic]."" Mr Goudie said: ""It's clear on the evidence that [Mr Henderson] knew Mr Ibbotson well, frequently discussed his qualifications with him and knew he was deficient."" He said Mr Henderson responded to written questions from the CAA in June 2020, and said he ""didn't know the precise status of Mr Ibbotson's licences and ratings"". Mr Goudie said this was a ""lie"". He added Mr Henderson denied being the operator of the aircraft at the time, something he now accepts. The trial continues.

Willy Wonka songwriter Leslie Bricusse dies at 90,"Leslie Bricusse, the prolific British songwriter behind many of cinema's biggest hits such as Candyman and Goldfinger, has died at the age of 90. His friend Dame Joan Collins described him as ""one of the giant songwriters of our time"". Petula Clark, who sang You and I from 1968's Goodbye Mr Chips, told BBC Radio 4 he was ""extraordinary"". Bricusse's career spanned 60 years with other credits including Talk to the Animals from Doctor Dolittle. He also wrote Candyman and Pure Imagination from the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Stage impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber released a statement, calling Bricusse ""the most underestimated British songwriter of all time"". John Berlinsgame from Variety told the Today programme that Bricusse was ""not only an artist but a lyrical genius"". In his six decade career, he was constantly writing and had a catalogue of more than 1,000 songs to his name. He wrote the lyrics to Shirley Bassey's classic Goldfinger, one of the most memorable Bond theme tunes, with long-time collaborator Antony Newley. Bricusse also wrote the lyrics to You Only Live Twice, sung by Nancy Sinatra. Other collaborations with Newley, Dame Joan's former husband, included Feeling Good, made famous by Nina Simone.

Bricusse's agent confirmed the songwriter's death ""with a breaking heart"", saying he died in his sleep on Tuesday morning. He had been married to actress Yvonne Romain for more than 60 years. Dame Joan said: ""One of the giant songwriters of our time, writer of Candyman, Goldfinger amongst so many other hits, and my great friend Leslie Bricusse has sadly died today. ""He and his beautiful Evie have been in my life for over 50 years. I will miss him terribly, as will his many friends."" Film expert Berlinsgame told the Today programme: ""He would be clever, very witty but also heartfelt and emotional."" Vocalist and actress Clark also told Today: ""He was a dear friend who I've known for many years. He wrote all the time, never stopped.

Stage star Elaine Paige said on Twitter: ""Shocked & saddened by the news that the brilliant & wonderful Leslie Bricusse has died. ""One of our great songwriters. My first ever professional role was in Roar of the Greasepaint musical [for which Bricusse wrote Feeling Good]. We've been friends for many years."" Born in Pinner, north west London, Bricusse and Newley's fruitful partnership saw them write 1961 musical Stop the World I Want to Get Off and the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, based on Roald Dahl's popular children's book. David Walliams paid tribute to Bricusse's songwritingsaying on Twitter,external: ""The great Gene Wilder sings Leslie Bricusse's magical Pure Imagination from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It is so beautiful it makes me weep."" Bricusse also wrote many other musicals including Scrooge and Hook, the latter with Hollywood composer John Williams. Sometimes working under the pseudonym Beverley Thorn, he co-wrote skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan's 1960 hit My Old Man's a Dustman (Ballad of a Refuse Disposal Officer). Cher, Henri Mancini, Leslie Bricusse and Placido Domingo after the Oscar success of Victor/Victoria But it was Bricusse's contribution to musicals that defined his career. This included two Oscars for his work. Talk to the Animals won best original song in 1968, while Victor/Victoria - which he wrote with Henry Mancini - won best original song score or adaptation in 1983. He won a Grammy in 1963, which he shared with Newley, for the song What Kind of Fool Am I? from Stop the World I Want to Get Off. Asked in 2015,externalhow he felt about winning his Academy Awards, he said: ""The Oscars are brilliant. If the whole world was run by the Oscar committee it would be a much better place. ""I have nothing but admiration for them. I'm playing par - I'm 10 nominations and two wins. So if you reckon you win one in five, I'm on par,"" he said. Also in 2015, he staged Pure Imagination - The Songs of Leslie Bricusse, a musical revue reflecting on his vast back catalogue. Gene Wilder sang Bricusse's Pure Imagination in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory The composer and lyricist was said to be adamant that his musical theatre scores should be sung traditionally, rather than jazzed up to suit a particular producer's whims. Presenter and former musical theatre star Philip Schofield said: ""I'm so sad to hear of the death of my friend, the brilliant Leslie Bricusse whose songs I loved singing in Dr Dolittle. My love to his family."" Bricusse described himself in his book Pure Imagination: A Sorta-biography as ""one of the luckiest people I know, second only perhaps to Ringo Starr"". ""It's not really an autobiography. It's about incidents rather than my entire life, and it's about other people as much as me. I just put down the things I remembered!"" Bricusse stated at the outset of one of his early chapters that he would be dropping names ""like fragrant rose petals"". The book was interspersed with anecdotes and quotes from some of his famous friends, including Dame Julie Andrews, Sir Elton John and Sir Michael Caine.

What does net zero mean?,"In order to help meet international climate targets, the world needs to cut carbon dioxide emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050, the UN says. This will involve major changes for governments, businesses and individuals. Net zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This main way to do this is to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the first place. But not all emissions can be eliminated completely, so those that remain need to actively removed. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill, as well as other sources. These gases increase global temperatures by trapping extra energy in the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, rapiddeforestation across the worldmeans there are fewer trees to absorb CO2. Under the2015 Paris climate agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100. To achieve this, CO2 emissions need to fall by nearly half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. But despite these international commitments, emissionsremain at record highs,external. A really simple guide to climate change Natural ways of removing CO2include planting treesandrestoring peatlands. Trees can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere There are also novel, human-designed methods - at very early stages - designed to take CO2 directly out of the air. Carbon captureis a related technology, where CO2 produced in power stations or other industrial processes is captured before it is released into the atmosphere, and stored underground. While these technologies could be important in future, they are expensive, and can currently only cancel out a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions which are still being produced. They are not a substitute for making drastic cuts to fossil fuel use, the International Energy Agency warns. To help achieve its 2050 target, UK governments have made a series of pledges, which include: achievingso-called 'clean' electricity by 2030, by rapidly increasing wind and solar generation ending the sale ofnew fully petrol and diesel cars by 2030 installing600,000 electric heat pumps a yearby 2028 investing intechnology to capture and store CO2 The UK's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 werearound 50% of 1990 levels,external. This figure only includes emissions generated within the UK, in line with UN reporting standards. Under the Paris climate agreement, the UK needs to reduce its emissionsby 68% by 2030,externalcompared with 1990 levels - a key step towards achieving net zero by 2050. In July 2024, the UK's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC),warned that only a third of emissions cuts needed to meet this goalwere backed up by credible policies. At the COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan, Prime MinisterSir Keir Starmer announced a new target to cut the UK's annual emissions by 81% versus 1990 levels by 2035. Piers Forster, interim chair of the CCC, welcomed the announcement, which he said would ""support jobs and investment"". However, he warned that UK also needed to demonstrate greater progress regarding electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting. What is COP29 and what will be discussed? About 145 countrieshave - or are considering - net zero targets, covering about 90% of global emissions,external. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline. China- currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - is aiming for""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions are not fully developed, but its electric vehicle sales and renewable energy sector have beengrowing rapidly,external. China is quickly expanding its solar and wind capacity TheUShas historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called theInflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies. TheEU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March 2023, it announced its own green investment package, called theNet Zero Industry Act.,external RussiaandIndiaare also significant emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2060 and 2070 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up. How is my country tackling climate change? There is controversy about how some countries and companies might reach net zero. For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imports energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself. But in reality, it may not have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. There are also schemes that enable countries or companies to reach net zero by paying others to reduce theirs instead - for example giving funds to plant trees. But these can be controversial, withconcerns about how effective these schemes really are. Some climate scientists also fear that a focus on net zero targets in 2050 or beyond can underplay the need for rapid emissions cuts now, withthe world far off track to meet its climate goals. While the most significant changes need to come from government,individuals can also play their part to help reach net zero.

Obstacles to UK government's net zero plans,"The government has laid out its plans to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and take the UK towards being a zero carbon economy by 2050. These including more electric cars, planting trees and moving away from gas-powered central heating. But what potential hazards are there ahead for ministers? UK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gases Households to get Â£5,000 to replace gas boilers What does net zero mean? Six ways the UK could tackle climate change Some in the prime minister's own party doubt the economic arguments in favour of moving towards what they consider an over-reliance on renewable energy sources. Conservative MP John Redwood asked in the House of Commons what would happen when the sun stopped shining and the wind stopped blowing. Another, Steve Baker, said a lot of ""assumptions"" were involved and asked that ministers carry out a ""comprehensive audit"" of their plans. Tory MP: What happens when the wind doesn't blow? Others are concerned about the cost to the general public, particularly those on lower incomes, and the impact that, in turn, may have on their chances at the next election. Craig Mackinlay said it could become ""electorally difficult"" once people realised the plans ""cost them money"" or mean ""a lifestyle that's not as convenient"". Given that the Conservatives have an 80-seat majority, this is unlikely to stop any plans becoming law, but if some of Mr Johnson's backbenchers are not persuaded, there could be some political turbulence. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband was scathing in his response to the government's announcement, saying there was nothing like ""the commitment we believe is required"", in terms of investment, to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Labour'scommitment to borrow and invest Â£28bn per yearin tackling climate change is a markedly different approach to the Conservatives. The Treasury has said borrowing heavily to cut greenhouse gases goes against the ""polluter pays"" principle and passes the costs on to future taxpayers. It's not certain how this will play out in Parliament or whether this could become an important dividing line between the parties - and how it would play with voters. The Treasury accepts there will be an overall cost to achieving net zero emissions in the short term, but sources stress the cost of inaction would also be significant. No overall figure is given but officials admit new taxes will be needed to recoup the revenue lost from the move away from petrol and diesel fuelled cars, for example. The government raised Â£37bn from fuel duty and vehicle excise duty in the 2019-20 financial year, or about 1.7% of GDP. A carbon tax could plug some of this, but the takings would dwindle as emissions fall, leaving a big shortfall. How will voters feel if their bills go up to cover the costs? In an assessment to go with the government's carbon-cutting plans, the Treasury said that ""as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values"". There is evidence of public support for stronger measures to tackle climate change, but if households end up having to spend a lot more money to go greener, there could be increased unease among voters that the government will not want ahead of a likely general election in the next couple of years. In particular, it is feared this could go down badly in some of the former industrial areas of the the Midlands and northern England where the Conservatives made large gains from Labour in 2019. ""Any policies we bring in will be designed to be fair across the board,"" the PM's spokesman said. One thing most governments agree on is that any effort to reduce emissions must be international if it is to succeed in limiting temperature rises. With the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow fast approaching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hope his plan prompts other countries to make similar commitments and boost the chances of the UK brokering a renewed global effort to cut greenhouse gases. If the world's biggest CO2 producers - including the US, China and India - reach an agreement it could ease domestic political pressures and allow him to claim more of an environmental ""legacy"". US President Jo Biden and Indian PM Narendra Modi are attending COP26, but China's Xi Jinping isnot thought likely to do the same.

Smart appliances and the energy gap,"Khalid's hot water tank automatically switches on when power is most plentiful - and cheapest Imagine your future home as an energy hub storing electricity from the grid when clean wind power is plentiful, and then selling it back - at a profit - when demand surges elsewhere. For Sussex grandmother Kate Giammatteo, that future is happening right now. She has batteries bolted to the front of her Worthing flat that do just that, and they are forecast to cut her energy bill by Â£173 a year. And what's good for Kate will be good for the country, because as the UK shifts to electric heating and electric cars to meet its climate goals, the demand for electricity is expected to double by 2050. Already the sector is under pressure to ramp up renewables, because Prime Minister Boris Johnson has mandated that all electricity must come from zero-carbon sources by 2035. Much of the extra energy will be generated by wind power, which is clean and cheap - but - of course - dependent on the wind. That leaves an intermittent hole in supplies. This can be by increasing energy storage using batteries or other technologies - but experts say part of the gap can be filled by enabling consumers to use electricity more flexibly. That's where Kate fits in. The tale of her giant battery offers a glimpse of an energy future in which appliances will use power when it's plentiful, and conserve it when it's scarce. Kate has a battery at home that can store up energy from renewable power sources So, you could allow your freezer to turn off for a short time to save power, and your washing machine to switch itself on in the afternoon to use cheap power. Khalid Abdulla, an engineer from Edinburgh, has a hot water tank from a firm called Mixergy that's automatically switched on by his energy supplier's computer when power is cheapest (it can be overruled manually). The tank's insulation ensures the water remains hot whenever Khalid's ready for a shower. In effect, he's storing energy in hot water. It will save Khalid money. And the technology has brought a bonus - the new system has allowed him to dispense with his second water tank, and free up storage for the paraphernalia that accompanies a new baby. But this energy revolution stretches beyond the home, because more and more businesses are being paid by electricity suppliers to use the grid differently. When supplies are plentiful, big refrigeration plants can utilise the power to chill their freezers even harder. Then when there's a surge in demand, they can power down as the freezer temperatures slip back to normal. They are paid in effect for storing energy through cold.Some hotels do the same with their air conditioning. Some asphalt plants are super-heating the asphalt when power is cheap - then allowing the temperature to drop as demand peaks. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? Big prices are charged by firms volunteering to turn off their power for a spell when it's needed elsewhere. The steel giant Corus has offered to switch off its supply from time to time for Â£45,000 per Megawatt. One estimate suggests the value of the flex-elecs market by 2030 will be Â£2.4bn a year. One firm involved in a UK government trial, Geo, claimed it showed a DSR system could save 49% on utility bills for homes with electrical heating and electric cars. There would be CO2 savings, too. ""They are pretty amazing figures, but they are achievable in the majority of homes as time goes on,"" its CEO, Steve Cunningham, told me. What's more, those savings were achieved using only major contributors such as home heating and hot water. Even more cash would have been saved, he said, if appliances such as freezers and washing machines were fitted with smart plugs so they could also be controlled individually from afar. He said smart thermostats costing Â£25 could save gas heating by learning how fast a house heats up and cools down, and adjusting boiler use accordingly. ""It's tragic that people who most need tech like this can't afford to access it,"" he said. So how big a role can reducing demand play in smoothing the peaks of electricity use? Sara Walker, reader in energy at Newcastle University, says it needs a big push from policy-makers. She told me: ""There's great potential but there appears little attention on the subject at government level. We really need a strong policy signal - and we're not getting it.""

"Food price rises are 'terrifying', warns industry","Food and drink firms are seeing ""terrifying"" price rises, a sector trade body has said, warning of a knock-on effect for consumers. Food and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright told MPs inflation is between 14% and 18% for hospitality firms. The price rises for food firms' ingredients will lead to consumer price rises, he said, and described the situation as concerning. The UK's rate of inflation was 3.2% in August and is expected to rise further. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey recentlywarned it ""will have to act"", suggesting that UK interest rates may soon rise from the historic low of 0.1%. Mr Wright told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: ""Inflation is a bigger scourge than anything else because it discriminates against the poor."" What is the UK's inflation rate and why is it going up? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? The Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures for September on Wednesday. It is expected to rise further above the Bank of England's target of 2% for longer than previously thought. Make UK, the manufacturers' organisation, said that inflation was becoming ""baked in"" among its members. Stephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, told MPs that while there was a welcome rise in demand, many manufacturers are looking at 30% to 40% average increases in material costs. ""When people are able to get hold of materials they are passing those costs on which does imply to us that inflation is more or less baked in at this stage now,"" he said. ""This is not a transitory inflationary demand we are seeing really serious issues now in terms of price increases."" Des Gunewardena, chief executive of high-end restaurant group D&D London, says his business has seen half of its costs rise, including surging energy prices. He says staff shortages are his ""number one issue"" and has increased salaries by 10%. The business has 1,700 employees across the UK and is currently 150 staff short, which he said could lead to a ""nightmare situation"" in the busier December period. Table covers have been reduced from 400 on a Friday night at his Quaglino's restaurant to between 300 and 350 due to staff shortages. However, he said the restaurants have seen increased customer spending, so he is stocking up on specific champagne brands ahead of time, to pre-empt possible supply problems. ""I think we'll have a very strong Christmas so there's no need to panic yet, but I expect further inflation in January when there won't be the same spending to offset the extra costs"". Amid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas, the government is taking steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers. The shortage has been blamed on several factors, including Covid, Brexit and tax changes. The government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), told the select committee that the government's visa scheme to ease driver shortages had been ""designed to fail"". ""Reports haven't really eased at all things are not visibly getting better at this stage,"" he said. Regarding the government's measures to try to ease the crisis, Mr Buchanan said ""visually on the ground that is not having an effect"". A survey by the RHA of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. ""The consumer is really going to visualise this in terms of reduced choice. We have supply chain disruption but that doesn't mean we are going to run out of food,"" Mr Buchanan added. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

Man acted 'dangerously' in organising Sala flight,"David Henderson denies the charge of endangering the safety of an aircraft A man acted ""recklessly and dangerously"" when he organised a flight carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala, a court has heard. David Henderson, 67, of Main Street, Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, enlisted a pilot who was neither qualified nor competent, said prosecutor Martin Goudie. Sala and pilot David Ibbotson died in the crash in January 2019. Mr Henderson denies endangering the safety of an aircraft. The defendant hadpreviously admitted a chargeof attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation. Emiliano Sala had just signed with Cardiff City Mr Henderson was scheduled to pilot the flights which took Sala, 28, from Cardiff to Nantes and back again, but could not, as he was on holiday in Paris with his wife, Cardiff Crown Court heard. Instead, he asked Mr Ibbotson, who he knew, to pilot the flights, despite him not having a commercial licence, Mr Goudie said. The story of Emiliano Sala Legal action in footballer Sala's crash death case Sala - timeline of Cardiff City signing The court was told that Mr Ibbotson was not competent to fly in the poor weather Mr Henderson knew had been forecast. He added Mr Henderson ""ignored certain requirements"" and that the organised flights were ""not operated and organised out of a love for Emiliano Sala or Cardiff City Football Club"", but for his business interests. The second flight in the single-engine Piper Malibu came down in the English Channel on 21 January. Sala's body was recovered, but Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowley, Lincolnshire, has never been found In the summer of 2018, more than six months before the crash, Mr Henderson was told by the aircraft's owners that Mr Ibbotson ""should not pilot the Piper-Malibu again"" after he committed two airspace infringements while flying it. Mr Goudie told the jury the defendant ""was aware that there were issues with Mr Ibbotson's flying from the start"", even before the letters from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Following the letters, Mr Ibbotson wrote to Mr Henderson suggesting he thought Mr Henderson would not be using him again. 'I'm practically dead while livingâ Cardiff and Nantes mark Sala death Fay Keely, who represented the trust which owned the aircraft, was ""not aware Mr Ibbotson was the pilot"" on either of the flights between Nantes and Cardiff, the court heard. Responding to Mr Ibbotson, Mr Henderson replied: ""I am just responding to emails from Fay who has forwarded me two letters from CAA. ""I have always said the flying we do is challenging and everyone has to be on the ball. It is a steep learning curve for someone new to the operation. ""The prerequisite is a willingness to listen and learn. We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA... As self-employed sole traders we both have debtors and creditors and surely you understand that to remain legal we can't take money in advance."" The Piper Malibu N264DB disappeared from radar near the Channel Islands on 21 January. But Mr Henderson, who managed the day-to-day operations of the aircraft, had contacted Mr Ibbotson again about flying the aircraft by 5 August. Mr Goudie said: ""Right from the get-go, Mr Henderson was aware he was dealing with someone who had a private licence, not a commercial one."" Communications between Mr Henderson and Mr Ibbotson from August and October 2018, showed Mr Henderson talking about flying at night and flying outside his qualifications. The court heard Mr Henderson tried to rearrange the time of the return flight to Cardiff, but this was to avoid incurring costs at Cardiff Airport and not because of Mr Ibbotson's lack of qualifications to fly at night. Mr Goudie told the court the pilot did have an American qualification, which he received in 2014, but he was not allowed to be paid as a private pilot. He added Mr Ibbotson never held a commercial pilot's licence in the UK and his rating to fly the type of aircraft expired on 20 November 2018. On the night the plane went missing, Mr Goudie said Mr Henderson sent a text message to an aircraft engineer saying ""don't say a word"", and asked others to keep quiet because ""questions may be asked about his flying"". Another text to a different recipient said: ""Ibbo has crashed the Malibu and killed himself and VIP pax! Bloody disaster. There will be an enquiry [sic]."" Mr Goudie said: ""It's clear on the evidence that [Mr Henderson] knew Mr Ibbotson well, frequently discussed his qualifications with him and knew he was deficient."" He said Mr Henderson responded to written questions from the CAA in June 2020, and said he ""didn't know the precise status of Mr Ibbotson's licences and ratings"". Mr Goudie said this was a ""lie"". He added Mr Henderson denied being the operator of the aircraft at the time, something he now accepts. The trial continues.

Polish PM accuses EU of blackmail in law row,"This video can not be played European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says she is ""deeply concerned"" about Poland's court ruling Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has accused the EU of blackmail in a heated debate with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen over the rule of law. The clash in the European Parliament follows a top Polish court ruling that rejected key parts of EU law. Mrs von der Leyen said she would act to prevent Poland undermining EU values. In response, Mr Morawiecki rejected ""the language of threats"" and accused the EU of overstepping its powers. Poles overwhelmingly support being part of the EU, opinion polls suggest, but Poland's right-wing nationalist government has increasingly been at odds with the union on issues ranging from LGBT rights to judicial independence. The latest row has come to a head over an unprecedented and controversial ruling by Poland's Constitutional Tribunal that in effect rejects the core principle that EU law has primacy over national legislation. The case, brought by the Polish prime minister, was the first time that an EU member state's leader had questioned EU treaties in a national constitutional court. On Tuesday, Mrs von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the European Commission - the EU's executive - was ""carefully assessing this judgement"". She said the situation had to be resolved, but she was adamant: ""This ruling calls into question the foundations of the European Union. It is a direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order."" Vowing to take action, Mrs von der Leyen set out three ways the European Commission could respond to the Polish court judgement. The options, she said, were legally challenging the court ruling, withholding EU funds and suspending some of Poland's rights as a member state. The European Commission is yet to approve â¬57bn (Â£48bn; $66bn) of Covid-19 recovery funds earmarked for Poland, and may not do so until the dispute is settled. Poland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki (R), said his country had been attacked in an ""unjust"" way In a speech that ran over his allotted time, Mr Morawiecki said Poland was ""being attacked"" by EU leaders and it was ""unacceptable to talk about financial penalties"". ""Blackmail must not be a method of policy,"" said Mr Morawiecki of Poland's ruling conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party. Seeing this fiery debate in Strasbourg, you might wonder whether this so-called Polexit is a real prospect - given that it appears there are two very different legal, political and cultural perspectives set on a collision course. But the resounding answer amongst those I've spoken to is no. On the EU side, one diplomat recently told me they believed the EU couldn't survive another exit. So there are huge political calculations to weigh up here, as well as legal ones. President von der Leyen is under mounting pressure to take action. It's a major test of her presidency. You could see on Tuesday she wished to impress upon MEPs she was ready, if needed, to take a tough line. Yet last Friday, outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to urge compromise over confrontation. There is an argument to say that, if the EU opted for strong action, it could just serve to escalate the crisis and push Poland further away. But, if it decides on a more conciliatory course, does the bloc look weak and undermine its entire legal basis? Mr Morawiecki said the Polish court ruling on 7 October had been misunderstood and only questioned one area of EU treaties. He said EU treaties must not threaten a member state's constitution, which outline laws and principles that specify how a country should be governed. The Polish court ruling and the European Commission's response to it has divided opinion among the political leaders of EU member states. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jean Asselborn, said the clash threatened the existence of the EU, while Germany's Minister for European affairs, Michael Roth, said the union must not compromise on its founding values. But Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said linking issues about the rule of law to funding risked inflicting ""unimaginable harm to European Union unity"". Mr Nauseda offered to mediate EU talks after a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda. The tribunal ruling has raised concerns that Poland - like the UK - could exit the EU in a so-called Polexit. But Mr Morawiecki has repeatedly insisted the country has no plans to leave the union. ""We should not be spreading lies about Polish Polexit,"" he told the European Parliament. ANALYSIS: Polish court ruling stokes fears of Polexit Unlike the UK before its Brexit referendum in 2016, support for membership of the EU remains high in Poland. Mass protests have been held by Poles who back remaining a member. Earlier this month, more than 100,000 people gathered in the capital, Warsaw, to show their support for Poland's EU membership. At one rally, Donald Tusk, former president of the European Council and now leader of the opposition party Civic Platform, called on people to ""defend a European Poland"".

Channel 4 subtitles not returning for weeks,"Channel 4 subtitles, signing and audio description are not likely to return on TV until mid-November, almost two months after a catastrophic fault. The outage, which has already lasted more than three weeks, has angered deaf, hard of hearing and visually impaired viewers. More than 500 people have complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom. The fault happened on 25 September when a fire suppressant system destroyed hard disks at a broadcast centre. An emergency back-up subtitling system also failed. The channel is building a new system from scratch, and said it will fix the problem more quickly than its current prediction of mid-November if it can. The incident at the broadcast centre owned by Red Bee Media also affected other broadcasters like the BBC and Channel 5, although their services have now been restored. ""Channel 4 would like to apologise to viewers for not currently being able to provide access services,"" a statement said. ""We realise how frustrating this is for our viewers."" The broadcaster will begin to offer subtitles for its biggest shows like The Great British Bake Off and Gogglebox on its online catch-up service All4 from this week. However, the channel cannot provide audio description or sign language services at all. ""These services were irretrievably lost during the incident and we won't be able to restore them until we move to the new system we are building,"" it said inan update published on Tuesday,external. It added: ""We cannot rush this and run the risk of something going wrong. Something like this needs to be installed slowly to ensure our channels don't come off air and to prevent something like this happening again. ""That means that full access services might not be available until the middle of November. Clearly, if we can do anything to speed up this process, we will."" Mark Atkinson, chief executive at hearing loss charity RNID, said: ""For more than three weeks, the 12 million people in the UK who are deaf or have hearing loss have felt excluded and increasingly angry, because the system to provide subtitles and signed content is broken. ""It's impossible to imagine a failure that affected the hearing community being allowed to go on for so long. ""The BBC and Channel 5 are now offering a near-normal service, but it is unacceptable that the system could have failed so spectacularly, and that Channel 4 have still not fixed the problem. Further, there was a failure across the board to communicate to deaf people regularly and - most importantly - accessibly. ""We're pleased that Channel 4 have started providing updates in British Sign Language to the deaf community. They must ensure deaf people and people with hearing loss are kept informed about what steps they are taking until the problem is fixed."" An Ofcom spokesperson said: ""We remain extremely concerned by the impact on people who rely on these services. Channel 4 did not have strong backup measures in place, and it should not have taken several weeks to provide a clear, public plan and timeline for fixing the problems. ""We now expect Channel 4 to meet the timings it has set for restoring these vital services."" The Last Leg host Adam Hills addressed the ongoing problems on 8 October A spokesman for Red Bee Media said: ""Things are improving every day and we are able to deliver more and more accessible programmes, but we are unfortunately still experiencing issues with receiving the media for which our access teams create pre-recorded subtitles, audio descriptions and signing. ""As soon as there are any more updates, we will share these."" The original fault temporarily took Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C off air completely, and led to transmission problems in the subsequent days, such as E4 beingforced to delay the Married At First Sight series finale. On 8 October, presenter Adam Hills addressed the problems on Channel 4's The Last Leg, holding up a hand-written sign reading ""Sorry there's still no subtitles"", followed by another saying ""Sort it out"". The Times reported,externalthat the fire suppression system at Red Bee's headquarters sucked all the oxygen out of a room, causing a ""sonic wave"" that shut down the transmission servers. A spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said: ""Firefighters were called to reports a gas suppression system had activated at a building on Wood Lane in White City on Saturday 25th September. ""The suppression system had activated in a server room and on site engineers worked to ventilate the room. Firefighters carried out a search of the building and a sweep of the room but found no fire apparent.""

"Households to get Â£5,000 to replace gas boilersThe England and Wales subsidies cover just 90,000 gas boilers out of more than 20 million households.BusinessComments","It is hoped no new gas boilers will be sold after 2035 as part of government strategy Experts have criticised plans to subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers for homeowners in England and Wales from next April. Households will be offered subsidies of Â£5,000 from next April to help them make the switch. Although up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years. The government says this will boost demand for the pumps, but critics say the plan does not go far enough. Homeowners will be encouraged to switch to a heat pump or other low-carbon technology when their current boiler needs replacing. An air-source heat pump costs between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property. Ministers say the subsidies will make heat pumps a comparable price to a new gas boiler. However, the Â£450m being allocated for the subsidies over three years has been criticised as insufficient. Experts also point to the need for costly new insulation and other home improvements to help households get the best out of the switch. ""Gas is in the news for price increases that are on the horizon,"" said Dr David Glew, head of energy efficiency and policy at the Leeds Sustainability Institute at Leeds Beckett University. ""But gas is actually relatively cheap to heat your home with,"" he added. ""Needing to insulate your house might cost you tens of thousands of pounds and you're only going to be saving several hundreds of pounds, so the economics of that doesn't really add up."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Green is good, green is right, green works"" Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said the number of heat pumps that the grants would cover ""just isn't very much"" and meant the UK would not meet its climate targets. ""These grants will only incentivise the best-off households,"" he said. Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Caroline Jones, said the government needed to provide more money to speed up the switch. ""A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035,"" she said. The government says it wants no new gas boilers to be sold after 2035, but it has not banned them outright. Writingin the Sun,external, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi."" Downing Street later declined to say whether the government would ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said ""there will be a point"" when the voluntary approach would change. Read more about the UK's climate change targets. Tips on how to save energy at home and help the planet Jonny Marshall, senior economist the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on poverty, said the UK would struggle to meet its goal of cutting emissions from homes in half by 2035. The UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. But a group of experts that advises the government says Boris Johnson's government has credible policies in place to deliver only about a fifth of this cut. Helen Selman lives with her husband and two children in Chippenham. When they moved into a 1930s semi, they knew they wanted to undertake home improvements, an upgrade to the heating system and an extension. ""It was not cheap,"" she said. ""But because we were doing everything else, and because this was going to be our forever home, it made sense."" Helen chose an air-source heat pump but alongside it, they had a specifically designed insulation upgrade, new radiators and brand new underfloor heating. ""With a heat pump, the problem is that you have to make sure that your house is as well insulated as possible,"" she explained. ""We already had double or triple-glazing, we had insulated walls, we were upgrading the lofts."" To help with the project, Helen and her family used the old Renewable Heat Initiative funding: ""The RHI money will pay back quarterly over seven years and will go quite a long way to covering the costs."" She said: ""It's been definitely worth the bother."" But she admitted that without their own plans to extend and the added bonus of government cash, it might not have happened. ""Without an incentive, there are few people who have the cashflow or the passion to do this,"" she said. Heating buildings accounts for more than a fifth of the UK's overall greenhouse gas emissions, so there is pressure on the government's Heat and Buildings Strategy to deliver effective reductions. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the grants to support the adoption of heat pumps, available from next April, would help to bring down the cost of the relatively new technology by 2030. Heat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse. They are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating. One energy firm, Octopus Energy, said it expected homeowners to pay about Â£2,500 to the cost of installing a heat pump, roughly equivalent to the cost of a new gas boiler. The government subsidy would cover the rest. But many houses will require an upgrade to their energy efficiency, including insulation, before installing one. A box of about one metre by one metre needs to be outside (close to or attached to the property) to draw in air. It should be at least one metre from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it shouldn't be much louder than your fridge. Read more: Should I get a heat pump and how much will it cost me? In total, Â£3.9bn funding is being provided, with most of that invested in decarbonising public buildings, insulating and installing new heating systems in social housing and for those on low incomes, and helping to provide clean heating networks for homes that are unsuitable for heat pumps. The plan also includes: Â£3.45bn to decarbonise buildings in England and Wales including social housing and district heating schemes Â£60m to drive technological innovation to develop clean heating systems that are smaller, easier to install and cheaper to run. This money will come from a previously announced innovation fund Independent climate think tank E3G said that setting the phase-out date for new fossil fuel boilers was ""a world-leading achievement"" and the pledge to reduce heat pump costs by 2030 was to be welcomed. However, the funding was insufficient to achieve the government's goals on reducing emissions, programme leader Pedro Guertler said. ""On energy efficiency alone, the public investment announced today falls Â£2bn short of what was pledged in the Conservative manifesto to 2025,"" he said. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, described the strategy as ""meagre, unambitious and wholly inadequate"", adding that Labour had pledged to spend Â£6bn a year on insulation and low carbon heating. The Liberal Democrats described the heating plan as ""a kick in the teeth for families across the country facing soaring energy bills this winter"". It's another piece in the Boris Johnson climate-calming jigsaw. First, he slots in a world-leading policy halting the sale of petrol cars by 2030. Now he lays down another piece - no new gas boilers after 2035. It's another trend-setting initiative that other nations will surely follow. There's a problem, though. Because by that date in the middle of the next decade, the PM has already pledged to cut emissions overall by 78% over 1990 levels. Energy experts say that simply won't happen unless he provides much wider incentives for people to insulate their homes and to buy heat pumps to replace their gas boilers. One group of researchers estimates that to meet his net zero targets he needs to invest nearly another Â£10bn over three years. They hope the chancellor will fill that piece of the jigsaw in his spending review next week. Industry sources welcomed the new strategy. The Confederation of British Industry said it would help members prepare for the changes ahead, but its chief policy director, Matthew Fell, called for ""a clear delivery plan for consumers, businesses and local authorities"". Scottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, said it would kick-start demand for electric heating, ""allowing the industry to accelerate the delivery of electrification and quickly bring down upfront costs"".

UK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gases,"Another big push towards electric vehicles is being made in the UK government's latest strategy to make the great shift to a virtually zero-carbon economy. Ministers are investing Â£620m in grants for electric vehicles and street charging points. Car makers will be mandated to sell a proportion of clean vehicles each year. An extra Â£350m is promised to help the automotive supply chain move to electric. Thenew plan set out by the government,externalis supposed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050. The announcement comes 12 days before global leaders meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change. AchievingÂ net zero means theÂ UK willÂ no longer beÂ adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Obstacles to UK government's net zero plans What is net zero and how is the UK doing? Without action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather that threaten many forms of life. The UK has already made progress in cutting emissions compared to the levels released in 1990. In 2019, the country released 40% less than in 1990. On Tuesday the government also announced a strategy to address emissions from the UK's 30 million buildings. Homeowners will be able to apply for grants of up toÂ£5,000 to install low-carbon heat pumps to replace gas boilers. The Labour party's Ed Miliband responded to the strategy, saying the ""plans falls short on delivery"" adding ""we've waited months for a heat and buildings strategy, it's a massive let-down"". Prof Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the plan will require ""strong investment and innovation"" and would generate a ""new and attractive form of growth"". But he warned that low-income households will need support. And Prof Dan Lunt, Professor of Climate Science at University of Bristol, called the strategy's approach to flying weak and unambitious. Environmental group Friends of the Earth criticised the strategy as ""riddled with holes and omissions"". ""The rapid electrification of new vehicles is certainly welcome, but many of the carbon savings this could bring will be wiped out by the government's Â£27 billion road programme,"" it said. It also offers a further Â£120m to develop SMRs - small ""modular"" nuclear reactors that can be factory-built. These might go to the Wylfa site in Wales, although that's not certain. These mini-reactors are being promoted heavily by Rolls Royce, although critics say the technology won't be mature in time to meet the UK's carbon targets. Six ways the UK could tackle climate change Is the UK on track to meet its targets? What is a heat pump and how much will it cost me? On large nuclear: there's been much speculation about a go-ahead for Sizewell C in Suffolk. But funding has been a key sticking point and it seems an announcement has been put off until the Chancellor's spending review next week. There will be an extra Â£625m for tree-planting and peat restoration, too - even though the current schedule is running way behind its targets. The government is committing Â£140m to two clusters promoting carbon capture and storage to produce hydrogen. The hubs will be the North-West of England and North Wales, with Teesside and Humberside - the government has previously promised Â£1bn to support CCS. Heavy industries in these areas will be fuelled by hydrogen split from natural gas. The resulting CO2 emissions will be pumped into undersea rocks for storage. This will be controversial because environmentalists believe hydrogen should be obtained instead through electrolysis - using surplus wind energy. It looks unlikely that there will be much hydrogen left over to heat people's homes, which is why the government is postponing any decision about hydrogen boilers until 2026. The Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary to fund the government's net zero strategy. In a review exploring the economic impact of decarbonising,external, the Treasury said: ""There will be demands on public spending, but the biggest impact comes from the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity."" It said future governments ""may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue"" rather than relying on higher borrowing. Ministers are keen to stress their intention that the so-called net zero transition will be led by business. They say it will create 440,000 jobs and draw in up to 90bn of private investment by 2030. The government says since the Prime Minister announced his 10-point plan for the climate a year ago, it has invested Â£26bn of public funds into the low-carbon revolution. Part of that portfolio will be an extra Â£500m fund for low carbon innovation. Environmentalists will be scrutinising the numbers to see if various recent policy announcements will add up to the policy portfolio needed to present a plausible plan for decarbonising the economy by 2050. So what's missing from the strategy? Well, there's no reference to eating less meat - which the government's advisers say is needed. And the aviation strategy - putting no constraint on flying - runs counter to advisers' opinions. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

Tesco opens its first checkout-free store,"Tesco has opened its first checkout-free store in central London where people can shop without having to scan a product. The UK's biggest retailer said its branch in High Holborn has been converted to allow customers to shop and pay without using a checkout. The new format, known as GetGo, follows similar stores opened by Amazon. Customers with the Tesco.com app will be able to pick up the groceries they need and walk straight out again. Tesco said ""a combination of cameras and weight sensors"" would establish what customers had picked up and charge them for products directly through the app when they left the shop. The technology is provided by Israeli tech start-up Trigo, which has similar partnerships with supermarkets in Germany and the Netherlands. Previously, some of Tesco's staff have been able to use the system in the store at its headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, but this is the first time it has been available to regular customers. The supermarket with no checkouts Tesco trials shopping without tills Kevin Tindall, managing director of Tesco Convenience, said: ""Our latest innovation offers a seamless checkout for customers on the go, helping them to save a bit more time. ""This is currently just a one-store trial, but we're looking forward to seeing how our customers respond."" However, Tesco is not the only supermarket experimenting with till-free tech in the UK. Richard Lim, chief executive of retail analyst group Retail Economics, said Tesco's move was ""reflective of the way the wider industry is heading"". Amazon Fresh now has six ""just walk out"" stores in London, having initially rolled out the technology in 2018 in the US city of Seattle,for example. ""One critical element of this for Tesco is also about gaining data and trying to elevate their proposition as much as they can for their customers,"" Mr Lim added. The firm's Clubcard programme already has 6.6 million users on its app, so the retailer is ""well ahead of the curve"" when it comes to using information on what a customer buys, or how they shop, to personalise their experience, Mr Lim says. The supermarket has also benefited from a swing to online shopping during the pandemic. According to its most recent set of results,external,Tesco's group revenues jumped by 5.9% to Â£30.4bn for the six months to August compared with the same period last year.

"Households to get Â£5,000 to replace gas boilers","It is hoped no new gas boilers will be sold after 2035 as part of government strategy Experts have criticised plans to subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers for homeowners in England and Wales from next April. Households will be offered subsidies of Â£5,000 from next April to help them make the switch. Although up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years. The government says this will boost demand for the pumps, but critics say the plan does not go far enough. Homeowners will be encouraged to switch to a heat pump or other low-carbon technology when their current boiler needs replacing. An air-source heat pump costs between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property. Ministers say the subsidies will make heat pumps a comparable price to a new gas boiler. However, the Â£450m being allocated for the subsidies over three years has been criticised as insufficient. Experts also point to the need for costly new insulation and other home improvements to help households get the best out of the switch. ""Gas is in the news for price increases that are on the horizon,"" said Dr David Glew, head of energy efficiency and policy at the Leeds Sustainability Institute at Leeds Beckett University. ""But gas is actually relatively cheap to heat your home with,"" he added. ""Needing to insulate your house might cost you tens of thousands of pounds and you're only going to be saving several hundreds of pounds, so the economics of that doesn't really add up."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Green is good, green is right, green works"" Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said the number of heat pumps that the grants would cover ""just isn't very much"" and meant the UK would not meet its climate targets. ""These grants will only incentivise the best-off households,"" he said. Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Caroline Jones, said the government needed to provide more money to speed up the switch. ""A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035,"" she said. The government says it wants no new gas boilers to be sold after 2035, but it has not banned them outright. Writingin the Sun,external, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi."" Downing Street later declined to say whether the government would ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said ""there will be a point"" when the voluntary approach would change. Read more about the UK's climate change targets. Tips on how to save energy at home and help the planet Jonny Marshall, senior economist the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on poverty, said the UK would struggle to meet its goal of cutting emissions from homes in half by 2035. The UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. But a group of experts that advises the government says Boris Johnson's government has credible policies in place to deliver only about a fifth of this cut. Helen Selman lives with her husband and two children in Chippenham. When they moved into a 1930s semi, they knew they wanted to undertake home improvements, an upgrade to the heating system and an extension. ""It was not cheap,"" she said. ""But because we were doing everything else, and because this was going to be our forever home, it made sense."" Helen chose an air-source heat pump but alongside it, they had a specifically designed insulation upgrade, new radiators and brand new underfloor heating. ""With a heat pump, the problem is that you have to make sure that your house is as well insulated as possible,"" she explained. ""We already had double or triple-glazing, we had insulated walls, we were upgrading the lofts."" To help with the project, Helen and her family used the old Renewable Heat Initiative funding: ""The RHI money will pay back quarterly over seven years and will go quite a long way to covering the costs."" She said: ""It's been definitely worth the bother."" But she admitted that without their own plans to extend and the added bonus of government cash, it might not have happened. ""Without an incentive, there are few people who have the cashflow or the passion to do this,"" she said. Heating buildings accounts for more than a fifth of the UK's overall greenhouse gas emissions, so there is pressure on the government's Heat and Buildings Strategy to deliver effective reductions. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the grants to support the adoption of heat pumps, available from next April, would help to bring down the cost of the relatively new technology by 2030. Heat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse. They are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating. One energy firm, Octopus Energy, said it expected homeowners to pay about Â£2,500 to the cost of installing a heat pump, roughly equivalent to the cost of a new gas boiler. The government subsidy would cover the rest. But many houses will require an upgrade to their energy efficiency, including insulation, before installing one. A box of about one metre by one metre needs to be outside (close to or attached to the property) to draw in air. It should be at least one metre from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it shouldn't be much louder than your fridge. Read more: Should I get a heat pump and how much will it cost me? In total, Â£3.9bn funding is being provided, with most of that invested in decarbonising public buildings, insulating and installing new heating systems in social housing and for those on low incomes, and helping to provide clean heating networks for homes that are unsuitable for heat pumps. The plan also includes: Â£3.45bn to decarbonise buildings in England and Wales including social housing and district heating schemes Â£60m to drive technological innovation to develop clean heating systems that are smaller, easier to install and cheaper to run. This money will come from a previously announced innovation fund Independent climate think tank E3G said that setting the phase-out date for new fossil fuel boilers was ""a world-leading achievement"" and the pledge to reduce heat pump costs by 2030 was to be welcomed. However, the funding was insufficient to achieve the government's goals on reducing emissions, programme leader Pedro Guertler said. ""On energy efficiency alone, the public investment announced today falls Â£2bn short of what was pledged in the Conservative manifesto to 2025,"" he said. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, described the strategy as ""meagre, unambitious and wholly inadequate"", adding that Labour had pledged to spend Â£6bn a year on insulation and low carbon heating. The Liberal Democrats described the heating plan as ""a kick in the teeth for families across the country facing soaring energy bills this winter"". It's another piece in the Boris Johnson climate-calming jigsaw. First, he slots in a world-leading policy halting the sale of petrol cars by 2030. Now he lays down another piece - no new gas boilers after 2035. It's another trend-setting initiative that other nations will surely follow. There's a problem, though. Because by that date in the middle of the next decade, the PM has already pledged to cut emissions overall by 78% over 1990 levels. Energy experts say that simply won't happen unless he provides much wider incentives for people to insulate their homes and to buy heat pumps to replace their gas boilers. One group of researchers estimates that to meet his net zero targets he needs to invest nearly another Â£10bn over three years. They hope the chancellor will fill that piece of the jigsaw in his spending review next week. Industry sources welcomed the new strategy. The Confederation of British Industry said it would help members prepare for the changes ahead, but its chief policy director, Matthew Fell, called for ""a clear delivery plan for consumers, businesses and local authorities"". Scottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, said it would kick-start demand for electric heating, ""allowing the industry to accelerate the delivery of electrification and quickly bring down upfront costs"".

UK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gasesThe government reveals its long-awaited strategy days before global leaders meet for COP26 in Glasgow.,"Another big push towards electric vehicles is being made in the UK government's latest strategy to make the great shift to a virtually zero-carbon economy. Ministers are investing Â£620m in grants for electric vehicles and street charging points. Car makers will be mandated to sell a proportion of clean vehicles each year. An extra Â£350m is promised to help the automotive supply chain move to electric. Thenew plan set out by the government,externalis supposed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050.

"Government hails 30,000 jobs from new investment","Foreign investment deals in low-carbon sectors in the UK to be announced on Tuesday will create about 30,000 jobs, the government has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce 18 new deals worth Â£9.7bn as he opens a global investment summit. They include investments in sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes and carbon capture. The prime minister said investors had recognised ""the massive potential in the UK for growth and innovation"". Investments from companies such as Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, logistics firm Prologis and grocery service Getir would power the UK's economic recovery and help to achieve the government's levelling up agenda, he added. Mr Johnson will open the Global Investment Summit in London on Tuesday, bringing together more than 200 business executives. The government has assembled a formidable guest list of the great and good of global business for an investment summit it hopes will alert other international investors to opportunities in the UK. The bosses of the world's biggest investment firm, Blackrock, the biggest bank in the US, JP Morgan, as well as the top brass from energy giants such as EDF will gather at the Science Museum in London. Announcements of nearly Â£10bn in investment in the UK have been timed to coincide with the event. By far the biggest single investment is from Spanish firm Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power. Its announcement of a further Â£6bn in offshore wind investment - on top of Â£10bn over the last five years - will cement the UK's position as a world leader in offshore wind, just two weeks before the major climate summit in Glasgow. The recent spike in gas prices has brutally exposed UK and EU reliance on fossil fuels, which may also encourage French firm EDF that their plans for a new nuclear plant at Sizewell in Suffolk will get government blessing. The chairman of EDF is due to have a breakfast meeting with the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The government will hope this summit will help reverse a declining trend in foreign investment in new projects since 2015. Later, Mr Johnson will take part in a panel discussion with Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates on the role of private companies in tackling climate change. Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, will confirm that it will invest a further Â£6bn in off-shore wind farms off the coast of Suffolk. The wind turbines in its East Anglia ""hub"" are set to create about 7,000 jobs - although they have yet to secure planning permission. Prologis will commit to invest Â£1.5bn in the UK over the next three years to develop net zero carbon warehouses across London, the South East and the Midlands, supporting about 14,000 new jobs. ""We believe private sector innovation has, and will continue to play, a major role in overcoming the environmental challenges the world faces today,"" said Prologis chief executive Hamid Moghadam. Meanwhile, Getir plans to put more money into expanding its activities across the UK. The firm uses a fleet of electric vehicles and is aiming to create about 7,000 permanent jobs in 2022. Ultimate Battery Company will also invest Â£28m in setting up a UK plant for eco-friendly batteries. On Tuesday, the UK government is expected to announce its overall strategy for radically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions generated in across all sectors including industry, agriculture, transport and homes. The government has pledged to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and to reach net zero by 2050 - meaning the country will absorb as much carbon dioxide (through actions such as tree planting) as it emits. The announcements come just two weeks before the start of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - one of the largest world meetings to date on how to tackle global warming.

These mini-reactors are being promoted heavily by Rolls Royce, although critics say the technology won't be mature in time to meet the UK's carbon targets. Six ways the UK could tackle climate change Is the UK on track to meet its targets? What is a heat pump and how much will it cost me? On large nuclear: there's been much speculation about a go-ahead for Sizewell C in Suffolk. But funding has been a key sticking point and it seems an announcement has been put off until the Chancellor's spending review next week. There will be an extra Â£625m for tree-planting and peat restoration, too - even though the current schedule is running way behind its targets. The government is committing Â£140m to two clusters promoting carbon capture and storage to produce hydrogen. The hubs will be the North-West of England and North Wales, with Teesside and Humberside - the government has previously promised Â£1bn to support CCS. Heavy industries in these areas will be fuelled by hydrogen split from natural gas. The resulting CO2 emissions will be pumped into undersea rocks for storage. This will be controversial because environmentalists believe hydrogen should be obtained instead through electrolysis - using surplus wind energy. It looks unlikely that there will be much hydrogen left over to heat people's homes, which is why the government is postponing any decision about hydrogen boilers until 2026. The Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary to fund the government's net zero strategy. In a review exploring the economic impact of decarbonising,external, the Treasury said: ""There will be demands on public spending, but the biggest impact comes from the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity."" It said future governments ""may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue"" rather than relying on higher borrowing. Ministers are keen to stress their intention that the so-called net zero transition will be led by business. They say it will create 440,000 jobs and draw in up to 90bn of private investment by 2030. The government says since the Prime Minister announced his 10-point plan for the climate a year ago, it has invested Â£26bn of public funds into the low-carbon revolution. Part of that portfolio will be an extra Â£500m fund for low carbon innovation. Environmentalists will be scrutinising the numbers to see if various recent policy announcements will add up to the policy portfolio needed to present a plausible plan for decarbonising the economy by 2050. So what's missing from the strategy? Well, there's no reference to eating less meat - which the government's advisers say is needed. And the aviation strategy - putting no constraint on flying - runs counter to advisers' opinions. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Tesco opens its first checkout-free storeThe supermarket's new GetGo format lets customers shop without scanning a product or using a till.BusinessComments,"Tesco has opened its first checkout-free store in central London where people can shop without having to scan a product. The UK's biggest retailer said its branch in High Holborn has been converted to allow customers to shop and pay without using a checkout.

"Government hails 30,000 jobs from new investmentThe prime minister will announce 18 new foreign investment deals in low-carbon sectors worth Â£9.7bn.","Foreign investment deals in low-carbon sectors in the UK to be announced on Tuesday will create about 30,000 jobs, the government has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce 18 new deals worth Â£9.7bn as he opens a global investment summit. They include investments in sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes and carbon capture. The prime minister said investors had recognised ""the massive potential in the UK for growth and innovation"". Investments from companies such as Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, logistics firm Prologis and grocery service Getir would power the UK's economic recovery and help to achieve the government's levelling up agenda, he added. Mr Johnson will open the Global Investment Summit in London on Tuesday, bringing together more than 200 business executives. The government has assembled a formidable guest list of the great and good of global business for an investment summit it hopes will alert other international investors to opportunities in the UK. The bosses of the world's biggest investment firm, Blackrock, the biggest bank in the US, JP Morgan, as well as the top brass from energy giants such as EDF will gather at the Science Museum in London. Announcements of nearly Â£10bn in investment in the UK have been timed to coincide with the event. By far the biggest single investment is from Spanish firm Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power. Its announcement of a further Â£6bn in offshore wind investment - on top of Â£10bn over the last five years - will cement the UK's position as a world leader in offshore wind, just two weeks before the major climate summit in Glasgow. The recent spike in gas prices has brutally exposed UK and EU reliance on fossil fuels, which may also encourage French firm EDF that their plans for a new nuclear plant at Sizewell in Suffolk will get government blessing. The chairman of EDF is due to have a breakfast meeting with the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The government will hope this summit will help reverse a declining trend in foreign investment in new projects since 2015. Later, Mr Johnson will take part in a panel discussion with Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates on the role of private companies in tackling climate change. Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, will confirm that it will invest a further Â£6bn in off-shore wind farms off the coast of Suffolk. The wind turbines in its East Anglia ""hub"" are set to create about 7,000 jobs - although they have yet to secure planning permission. Prologis will commit to invest Â£1.5bn in the UK over the next three years to develop net zero carbon warehouses across London, the South East and the Midlands, supporting about 14,000 new jobs. ""We believe private sector innovation has, and will continue to play, a major role in overcoming the environmental challenges the world faces today,"" said Prologis chief executive Hamid Moghadam. Meanwhile, Getir plans to put more money into expanding its activities across the UK. The firm uses a fleet of electric vehicles and is aiming to create about 7,000 permanent jobs in 2022. Ultimate Battery Company will also invest Â£28m in setting up a UK plant for eco-friendly batteries. On Tuesday, the UK government is expected to announce its overall strategy for radically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions generated in across all sectors including industry, agriculture, transport and homes. The government has pledged to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and to reach net zero by 2050 - meaning the country will absorb as much carbon dioxide (through actions such as tree planting) as it emits. The announcements come just two weeks before the start of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - one of the largest world meetings to date on how to tackle global warming.

Apple unveils new computer chips amid shortage,"The M1 Max chip Apple has unveiled its M1Pro and M1Max chips used to power new MacBook Pro laptop computers. Apple says the M1 Max chip, with 57 billion transistors is the most powerful it has ever built. The new chips were announced almost a year after the firm revealed its first Mac computers powered by silicon of its own design. It comes after reports that Apple cut its iPhone 13 production targets amid the global computer chip shortage. Industry analyst Mikako Kitagawa of Gartner said ""the performance boost is pretty impressive"". Apple claims the new chips will achieve comparable performance to the latest 8-core PC laptop chip running at top speed while using 70% of the power. Going flat-out the chip, the company claimed, would be up to 1.7 times faster than the 8-core PC chip. Such claims have not yet been independently verified. Apple's chips are sometimes referred to as being 'Arm-based' because it licenses the instruction sets from the British-based company of that name. These instruction sets determine how processors handle commands. However, the core processor circuits are of Apple's own design. For years Apple has used chips designed by Intel. The move to designing its own silicon has been positive for the firm, says Ben Wood, chief analyst of CCS Insight. ""The advent of Apple Silicon has been a shot in the arm for the MacBook line-up,"" he said. The two chips power the new 14in and 16in MacBook Pro laptops and a new operating system, macOS Monterey. In the ""Unleashed"" launch presentation Apple stressed the MacBook's power and long battery life. There has been a sense, one analyst said, that workers in creative industries are starting to drift away from the Macbook Pro. But they would find the new machines appealing, according to Ms Kitagawa. ""Apple is really defending the creative professional market which is their core market,"" she said. The MacBooks were unveiled at a time when the company has warned of the impact of the global chip shortage. Previously Apple boss Tim Cooksaid that the issue could affect products using M1 chips. Recent reports suggest that the shortage might hit iPhone 13 production. Apple designed-silicon will not, Ben Wood says, insulate the company from the shortage. ""The fact that Apple has designed its own chips does not necessarily mean it is immune from the wider chipset shortages,"" he said. ""There is little doubt it will be in a strong position to secure supply, but ultimately the overall shortage of semiconductors comes down to manufacturing capacity."" Ms Kitagawa also noted that as dedicated graphics chips (GPUs) are in short supply, the new MacBook Pros may be ""more immune to the shortage as the machine does not have discrete graphics: one less component that they need to worry about."" The new laptops reverse a much-criticised Apple design decision. In particular the abandonment of Magsafe - a magnetically secured power-supply that releases with a firm pull. Ben Wood said, ""many users will be ecstatic that the MagSafe power connector has returned. When you've invested a small fortune in a MacBook, the last thing you want is for a careless trip over a power cable to see it crashing off the desk onto the floor.""

Top US envoy to Afghanistan steps down,"Zalmay Khalilzad has worked under multiple US presidents The top US envoy to Afghanistan is stepping down from his role less than two months after American forces withdrew from the country. Zalmay Khalilzad led the US dialogue with the Taliban, but months of diplomatic talks failed to prevent the militant group from seizing power. The Taliban took control in August after capturing the capital Kabul. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr Khalilzad's deputy, Thomas West, would take over. ""I extend my gratitude for his decades of service to the American people,"" Mr Blinken said in a statement announcing Mr Khalilzad's resignation on Monday. In a letter to Mr Blinken, Mr Khalilzad acknowledged that ""the political arrangement between the Afghan government and the Taliban did not go forward as envisaged"". ""The reasons for this are too complex and I will share my thoughts in the coming days and weeks,"" he wrote, saying he was stepping aside as the US entered the ""new phase of our Afghanistan policy"". He added that he was ""saddened"" for the Afghan people given the current outcome. BACKGROUND:What has the conflict cost the US? VOICES:I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US Mr Khalilzad, 70, was born in Afghanistan and grew up in Kabul. He is a veteran US diplomat, holding previous positions under former presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W Bush. He spearheaded talks with the Taliban that led to the signing of the so-called Doha Agreement in February last year, which set a date for the US to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. In September, US defence officials said the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistancould be traced back to that deal. US President Joe Biden continued the plan for withdrawal, with an end date of 31 August, marking an end to a 20-year presence in the country. US forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001. Separately on Monday, it was announced that the US state department's inspector general would review the final days of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, including the emergency evacuation of the country's embassy in Kabul. A department spokesperson said the review would also look at the resettlement of refugees. President Biden, a Democrat, has been criticised by his Republican opponents over the Afghan withdrawal. The Taliban's rapid advance in August - when the militants seized control of the country within about two weeks - sparked a mass evacuation effort from the US and its allies, as thousands of people tried to flee. A suicide attack killed more than 180 people during the operation.

"17,194 children waited over a year for consultant","This video can not be played Children's Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma described the waiting times as ""terrifying"" Twenty-four children in Northern Ireland with confirmed or suspected cancers had to wait over a year for a first appointment, a review has found. The figure, for April, is in a review of waiting lists by the NI Commissioner for Children and Young People. More than 17,000 children were waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time. The health minster later said that by September there were no ""red flag"" paediatric patients waiting that long. The review examined official waiting list data for children's health services not published as part of the Department of Health's statistical bulletins. The commissioner said the waiting times were ""terrifying"". Koulla Yiasouma said that waiting for any health service treatment can and does have a ""profound impact on a child's health outcomes, emotional and mental well-being"". She said it was ""shocking not only for the child but their families too"". ""Each and every single one of them is a child and each and every single one of them is a child whose life has almost been put on hold, and a family whose life has been put on hold, because they are not getting the most fundamental right of healthcare that they deserve,"" she said. Dr Ray Nethercott, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was shocked by the cancer figures. ""It is outrageous and there are probably many other words that spring to the minds of parents who are worried and concerned and colleagues who are facing into this,"" he said. ""Some of the answer will be about embracing and delivering that reform, delivering innovation, delivering different ways of managing children as close to home as possible. ""To be able to do that, it's not all about the workforce, but it's actually about giving some due care and attention to child health services as a distinct entity. ""I can't say that there's any way to do it immediately - I've got lots of ideas as do many of my colleagues. ""But really children and children's voices and people that work with children have a very small voice in our health system."" The review, called More Than Just a Number, examined the number of children and young people on waiting lists, and the length of time they wait to access first or review appointments with consultants for treatment in hospitals and also for services based in the community. It found that in April 2021, one in five children and young people in Northern Ireland were waiting for a first or review appointment with a consultant. It also found 17,194 children and young people were waiting more than one year and 510 more than four years. The conditions affected included scoliosis, speech and language therapy and autism. This video can not be played NI Health: Children 'suffering' on hospital waiting lists, says mum Mandy O'Connor has two daughters waiting for reviews. Her eldest daughter had an operation in Turkey for scoliosis in 2018 that cost them Â£35,000 for the operation alone, otherwise she would have been waiting 18 months for surgery in Northern Ireland. She has not been seen in Northern Ireland since that operation and the family is travelling to Turkey on Wednesday for a follow-up appointment. Her second daughter doesn't know if she has scoliosis which means time is of the essence to find out so they can tackle it early. ""From when Tasha [her eldest daughter] was diagnosed she was in extreme pain for the 16 weeks while we were fundraising,"" Mrs O'Connor said. ""To think what she would have been like for 18 months on that waiting list and even for the referral it was 16 weeks. ""It was marked urgent at the time - Tasha wasn't seen for a referral. The referral went in on July 2018, she wasn't seen until November 2018."" She said her second daughter had to wait 12 months for a first referral. ""That was in August 2019. She wasn't seen until August 2020 and as yet she hasn't been seen since."" The review found 17,194 children and young people were waiting over one year to see a hospital consultant for the first time As well as looking at hospital waits, it also raises other issues including the ""complete absence"" of regional monitoring or reporting of waiting times for child health services in the community. The absence of such critical information according to the commissioner makes it impossible to get a clear understanding of the number of children who are waiting for these services. It found that at least 26,818 children in Northern Ireland were waiting for a community-based health service but it is thought the figure is much higher. The report makes 17 recommendations. These include: A full review of the child health system and appointing a deputy chief medical officer dedicated to children's health Establishing a single point of entry system across all health trusts for all child services Establishing a transparent budgeting process that shows clear budgeting lines for public spending on children's health services which meets the five child rights principles for public budgeting Health Minister Robin Swann said waiting lists were a top priority Health Minister Robin Swann said he was grateful to the commissioner for the ""detailed review"". ""My department and the wider HSC (Health and Social Care) system will carefully consider the report and recommendations from the commissioner as part of our ongoing work to transform and rebuild services,"" he said. ""Waiting times were clearly unacceptable prior to Covid-19 and have been exacerbated by the devastating impact of the pandemic across all aspects of service provision including, unfortunately, across children's services. ""Addressing these waiting lists is a top priority for me... it will require systemic change and long-term investment."" Ms Yiasouma said she welcomed the health minister's commitment to improve waiting lists and to address the ""underlying issues which drive them"". ""Waiting times are one of the clearest indicators of a system under immense strain and unable to meet the needs of its population,"" she added. ""We must strive to get to a point where all children and young people can get access to the right care, at the right time and the right place and no child ls left waiting months or years in a queue to access services."" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the waiting times figures for children with cancer were ""utterly appalling"". ""I think we should see somebody very senior in the Department of Health appointed as a deputy chief medical officer to oversee children's health in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""I think we need to invest more in children's health. ""I think children should have a degree of priority when it comes to such services.""

Top US envoy to Afghanistan steps downZalmay Khalilzad led talks with the Taliban that resulted in a deal to fully withdraw US troops.US & Canada,"Zalmay Khalilzad has worked under multiple US presidents The top US envoy to Afghanistan is stepping down from his role less than two months after American forces withdrew from the country. Zalmay Khalilzad led the US dialogue with the Taliban, but months of diplomatic talks failed to prevent the militant group from seizing power. The Taliban took control in August after capturing the capital Kabul. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr Khalilzad's deputy, Thomas West, would take over. ""I extend my gratitude for his decades of service to the American people,"" Mr Blinken said in a statement announcing Mr Khalilzad's resignation on Monday. In a letter to Mr Blinken, Mr Khalilzad acknowledged that ""the political arrangement between the Afghan government and the Taliban did not go forward as envisaged"". ""The reasons for this are too complex and I will share my thoughts in the coming days and weeks,"" he wrote, saying he was stepping aside as the US entered the ""new phase of our Afghanistan policy"". He added that he was ""saddened"" for the Afghan people given the current outcome. BACKGROUND:What has the conflict cost the US? VOICES:I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US Mr Khalilzad, 70, was born in Afghanistan and grew up in Kabul. He is a veteran US diplomat, holding previous positions under former presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W Bush. He spearheaded talks with the Taliban that led to the signing of the so-called Doha Agreement in February last year, which set a date for the US to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. In September, US defence officials said the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistancould be traced back to that deal. US President Joe Biden continued the plan for withdrawal, with an end date of 31 August, marking an end to a 20-year presence in the country. US forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001. Separately on Monday, it was announced that the US state department's inspector general would review the final days of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, including the emergency evacuation of the country's embassy in Kabul. A department spokesperson said the review would also look at the resettlement of refugees. President Biden, a Democrat, has been criticised by his Republican opponents over the Afghan withdrawal. The Taliban's rapid advance in August - when the militants seized control of the country within about two weeks - sparked a mass evacuation effort from the US and its allies, as thousands of people tried to flee. A suicide attack killed more than 180 people during the operation.
