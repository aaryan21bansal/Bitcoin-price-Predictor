DUP urges PM to 'be unionist we need' over BrexitThe plea comes as the UK asks the EU to extend grace periods for the Irish Sea border.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played ""Be the unionist we need you to be"" - PM is told by DUP's Ian Paisley during PMQs A DUP MP has called on the prime minister to ""be the unionist we need him to be"" in addressing concerns over the Irish Sea border. Ian Paisley told the Commons that the Brexit agreement had betrayed unionists and made them ""feel like foreigners in our own country"". Meanwhile a ""cordial"" meeting between the UK government, EU and NI's first and deputy first ministers has ended. There will be further discussions next week. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". Speaking before that meeting took place, Mr Paisley said ""tea and sympathy would not cut the mustard"" and urged Downing Street to act. Boris Johnson said the government would ""do everything we need to do"". Unionists oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, arguing it damages trade and threatens UK unity. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, hasannounced plans to stop north-south activities related to the NI Protocoluntil action is taken to address what she called a ""growing crisis"" over the Irish Sea border. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said his commitment to the union is 'unshakeable' Responding to Mr Paisley in the Commons, the prime minister insisted he was committed to Northern Ireland and the union. He said the government would act ""legislatively"" or by invoking an emergency mechanism known as Article 16 to override part ofthe protocol,external, if other solutions cannot be reached with the EU to remove GB-NI trade barriers. The UKhas already written the EU,externalasking for agreement to a long extension of grace periods for the Irish Sea border. Currently, supermarkets and other businesses are being allowed to operate with reduced requirements for paperwork and certification when moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The first of those grace periods is due to expire in April,but in a letter to the EU the UK government has asked for an extension until 2023. What are NI's grace periods for Brexit? It has also requested the creation of a common travel area for pets which would reduce the new post-Brexit processes for moving pets across the Irish Sea. UK and EU leaders held talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster spoke to Mr Johnson ahead of the UK-EU meeting, which she took part in along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ. Following the meeting, the first minister said the UK government accepted problems with trade between GB and NI following Brexit were ""more than just teething problems"", however, she added: ""I'm not so sure that's the case in the European Commission."" ""I have to say I was disappointed with some of the statements made by Maros Sefcovic in relation to teething problems [relating] to the rigorous implementation of the protocol because of course that's not going to cut it,"" she said. ""I think everybody knows now that there's fundamental reform and that needs to be dealt with very, very quickly. ""We have some cliff edges coming up on 1 April and we all know that, so therefore we need to work very quickly to deal with these issues."" But Ms O'Neill welcomed the position from the European Commission. The deputy first minister said Mr Å efÄoviÄ had ""put his hands up"" in the meeting over the attempt to introduce Article 16 last Friday. Ms O'Neill said he also asked that the Commission's ""track record"" of political and financial support for peace in Northern Ireland was taken into account. ""I think they [European Commission] came at it with a very constructive and open mind in terms of resolution to some of the outstanding issues however they were also equally very clear that the protocol must be implemented in its entirety,"" she told BBC News NI. ""The EU has been very clear in saying that the protocol is not up for renegotiation - I share that view."" Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ released a joint statement to say they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". The statement said the UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the ""proper implementation"" of the protocol Both ""condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ is also set to travel to London to continue talks. On Monday night, Stormont's Department of Agriculture decided to suspend Brexit checks on animal products at some NI ports after ""threats"" were made against inspection staff. However, a senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents. Simon Coveney said the protocol needed to be improved where possible Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he recognised there were ""serious problems"" with the protocol that needed to be resolved. But he warned it should be improved where possible, rather than scrapped as unionists have demanded. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal Amazon prepares to stop selling some products to NI Brussels might feel battered and bruised over its Article 16 blunder, but is it ready to bend? That is the hope of Michael Gove and Arlene Foster as they attempt to squeeze some concessions from MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ around the NI Protocol. Asking for a two year extension for Protocol exemptions is a big demand from London and won't sit easy with Brussels. But the DUP asking for the Protocol to be binned is a big demand which won't sit easy with London. Removing the Protocol would involve renegotiating a Withdrawal deal which took four years to put together. Boris Johnson last night made clear his ""unshakeable"" commitment to securing Northern Ireland's place in the union, but he also made clear he wants to fix the protocol, not ditch it. What we may get today is an extension of the grace period to allow businesses more time to adjust to the new rules. That will be sold by some as the first victory in a longer battle, but for others it will be as much as the EU should bend. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""highly regrettable that the first minister had chosen to approach the challenges presented by Brexit in a way that will increase instability and heighten tension at a time of immense sensitivity"". The Foyle MP again called for a moderation in language. The NI Protocol was part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreementand guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On Friday evening the EU announced it would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland. Itlater reversed this decision, but unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.

Female directors make history in Golden Globes,"This video can not be played Sarah Jessica Parker announced the nominations Three women have been nominated for best director at the Golden Globe awards - the first time more than one has been shortlisted in a single year. Regina King, Chloe Zhao and Emerald Fennell are up for the prize, which had only previously nominated five women in the Golden Globes' 77-year history. Mank leads the overall film awards race with six nominations, while The Crown leads the TV categories, also with six. Sacha Baron Cohen and Olivia Colman are among the Britons up for acting awards. The nominations belatedly fired the starting gun for this year's Hollywood awards season, which has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Aaron Sorkin's film drama The Trial of the Chicago 7 and TV comedy Schitt's Creek also performed well, with five nominations each. Golden Globes 2021: The nominations in full Sacha Baron Cohen in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and Olivia Colman in The Crown Baron Cohen, Colman and Anya Taylor-Joy all scooped two acting nominations each. Baron Cohen said he felt ""overwhelmed and humbled"" to be recognised for the films Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and The Trial of the Chicago 7. ""These two films are different, but they share a common theme,""he wrote on Twitter,external. ""Sometimes we have to protest injustice with our own farce."" He went on to joke that he had already hired Rudy Giuliani, former President Trump's lawyer, to contest the results. The star also has a third nomination, as a producer of the Borat sequel. Taylor-Joy, meanwhile, was shortlisted for Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit and for the Jane Austen film adaptation Emma. Colman, who won best actress in a TV drama for playing the Queen in Netflix's The Crown last year, could repeat that this year, and is also shortlisted for her forthcoming film The Father. Four of Colman's The Crown co-stars were also nominated - Emma Corrin (Princess Diana), Josh O'Connor (Prince Charles), Gillian Anderson (Margaret Thatcher) and Helena Bonham Carter (Princess Margaret). Bookmakers have made the show's fourth season the favourite to win best TV drama ahead of Lovecraft Country, The Mandalorian, Ozark and Ratched. That's all despitea row over how the show portrays the Royal Family. Emma Corrin and Josh O'Connor play Diana and Charles in The Crown's fourth season Series creator Peter Morgan said everyone involved in the Netflix series was ""thrilled to be recognised in this way"". ""This season really seems to have resonated with audiences of all generations all around the world,"" he said. ""We could not be more grateful or more proud."" Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman are both nominated for The Undoing British stars Riz Ahmed, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman will compete for best actor in a film drama for Sound of Metal, The Father and Mank. They are joined by the late Chadwick Boseman, recognised posthumously for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim, nominated for The Mauritanian. Vanessa Kirby and Carey Mulligan are both in the running for best actress in a film drama for Pieces of a Woman and Promising Young Woman respectively. Small Axe, the landmark series of BBC films that director Steve McQueen has billed as ""love letters to black resilience and triumph in London's West Indian community"", received a nomination for best limited series or TV movie. And John Boyega, who played a pioneering police officer in one instalment, was nominated for best supporting TV actor. John Boyega was nominated for playing PC Leroy Logan in Small Axe McQueen told Entertainment Weekly the nominations were ""incredible"", adding: ""I think what's wonderful about it is that something so modest in what we tried to do has gotten recognised in this way."" Other British stars on the shortlists include Rosamund Pike, Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, Jodie Comer, Matthew Rhys and Nicholas Hoult. Hugh Grant was nominated for best actor in a TV limited series for The Undoing, the same award he won in 2019 for A Very English Scandal. His co-star Nicole Kidman is up against Daisy Edgar-Jones, star of the BBC's Normal People, for the female equivalent. Lily Collins was nominated for Netflix hit Emily In Paris - but there was no space for Michaela Coel or her acclaimed BBC drama I May Destroy You. Emerald Fennell will be familiar to The Crown viewers for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles. The Brit wasn't nominated for her acting - but was nominated for Promising Young Woman, her first feature film as director. She was also nominated for best screenplay for writing the dark comic thriller, and was previously chief writer on the second series of Killing Eve. Left-right: Emerald Fennell, Regina King and Chloe Zhao are all up for best director Film and TV fans will also know Regina King, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for acting in 2018's If Beale Street Could Talk, and has now moved behind the camera with One Night in Miami. And Chinese director Chloe Zhao has become the first woman of Asian descent to be up for the Golden Globes' best director prize, for Nomadland. The last female director to be nominated for best director was Ava DuVernay for Selma in 2014, and the only woman ever to have won is Barbra Streisand for Yentl in 1984. Nomadland and Promising Young Woman are also nominated for best film drama alongside Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and The Father. Mank- 6 nominations The Trial of the Chicago 7- 5 The Father- 4 Nomadland- 4 Promising Young Woman- 4 The Crown- 6 nominations Schitt's Creek- 5 Ozark- 4 The Undoing- 4 The Great- 3 Ratched- 3 The Globes split most awards between dramas and musicals/comedies, and the nominees for best musical/comedy film include Music, the directorial debut of pop star Sia. But her film has attracted controversy for its casting of dancer Maddie Ziegler as a young girl on the autism spectrum. Actress Ruth Madeley, who has spina bifida, expressed solidarity with ""every #ActuallyAutistic person who is rightly devastated to see #Sia""s Music nominated"". ""Disabled people are needed in the industry now more than ever to help change the narrative we're all so sick of,""she wrote on Twitter,external. James Corden was nominated for The Prom, but Meryl Streep - who had been hotly tipped - missed out Music is up against the Borat sequel, the Disney+ recording of Broadway hit Hamilton, time loop comedy Palm Springs and Netflix film The Prom. James Corden was a surprise nominee for best actor in a musical or comedy for The Prom, after he was criticised for taking on a character who is, by his own admission, ""as a gay as a bucket of wigs"". RegÃ©-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor missed out on nominations for Bridgerton With the cinema shutdown and delays to many films, streaming has gained the upper hand over the past year. As a result, Netflix leads the Golden Globes field with 22 out of the 70 film nominations and 20 out of 54 film nominations - giving the streaming giant one third of all nominations in total. Yet there was no room for its period drama Bridgerton, despite the show becoming the service's ""biggest series ever"". Presented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the Golden Globes are the most prestigious movie awards behind the Oscars. This year's winners will be announced at the end of this month in a bi-coastal ceremony hosted by Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles. In a normal year, many of the nominees would be expected to be among the Academy Award nominations. But this is not a normal year. The Oscars will take place two months later than normal, having been put back from the date - 28 February - that the Globes ceremony now occupies. The eligibility period for this year's Oscars has been extended by two months, meaning films released in cinemas or online before the end of February could be in contention. This may not end up making much of a difference - although it could mean that the Globes' traditional role as an awards season indicator may not be as reliable as it sometimes has been.

Convicted terrorist sues MoJ over licence changes,"Omar Latif, from Cardiff, was one of nine men jailed in 2012 for plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange A convicted terrorist who was jailed for his role in an al Qaida-inspired terrorist group is suing the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). Omar Latif, from Cardiff, was one of nine menjailed in 2012 for plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange. He was released in 2016. The MoJ imposed new conditions on Latif's licence after Usman Khan'smurderous London Bridge attackwhile on licence following his early release. Latif claimed the MoJ acted unlawfully. The MoJ is defending itself against Latif's claim and argues the additional licence conditions imposed on him are lawful. The nine men jailed in 2012, which included Khan, had also tried to raise funds to build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan and recruit British people to attend. Latif, now 36, was 28 when he was jailed for 10 years and four months for attending meetings with the intention of assisting others to prepare or commit acts of terrorism. Usman Khan, who was one of those jailed alongside Latif in 2012, went on to murder two people in the London Bridge terror attack Latif was automatically released from prison halfway through his sentence in February 2016, but was recalled to prison the following September over allegations he tampered with his electronic monitoring tag. Latif, who said the damage to his tag most likely occurred when he was playing football, was again released on licence in May 2018 on terms set by the Parole Board. Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones were killed during a conference to rehabilitate offenders On 29 November 2019, Khan fatally stabbed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, during a prisoner rehabilitation event at Fishmongers' Hall, near London Bridge, in central London while out on licence. Khan had been released from jail on licence in 2018, halfway through a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences. Five days later, Latif, who maintains he had ""no contact"" with Khan since they were in the same prison in 2016, was told that ""senior officials"" at the MoJ had imposed new conditions on his licence. London Bridge: What we know about the attack Nine jailed over bomb plot and terror camp plan Boris Johnson says 74 terror prisoners released early,external Emergency terror law to end early prisoner release His lawyers say the additional conditions, which prevent him from attending ""any meetings or gatherings of more than 50 people"", or entering the City of London without prior permission, are unlawful. At a High Court hearing on Wednesday, Dan Squires QC said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland appeared to have ""personally"" requested additional licence conditions for all terrorist offenders following the London Bridge attack. Fishmongers Hall, below London Bridge, which is where Khan murdered Mr Merritt and Ms Jones Mr Squires argued the MoJ ""has no power unilaterally to add to or vary conditions on [Latif's] licence without the approval of the Parole Board,"" meaning the new conditions were unlawful. Latif ""had no involvement in, or prior knowledge of, the London Bridge attack"" and was ""horrified to hear of the attack and the role of Khan in it"", Mr Squires said. The hearing before the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Swift is expected to conclude on Thursday morning.

Starmer admits 'mistake' over PM's criticism,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he was ""wrong"" to describe Boris Johnson's claims he backed the European Medicines Agency as ""complete nonsense"". Mr Johnson accused the Labour leader of wanting to stay in the agency, at Prime Minister's Questions. This was angrily denied by Sir Keir. Reports the two men continued the row afterwards were played down by Labour. But the party has now issued a statement to say Sir Keir had ""misheard"" the prime minister. Sir Keir thought the PM had ""falsely"" accused him of wanting the UK to be part of the EU's vaccine scheme, which the party said was not the case. But it acknowledged that the Labour leader had previously expressed support for the European Medicines Agency. The EMA is an EU body which evaluates new medicines and authorises the use of vaccines. However, individual countries within the EU can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market without EMA approval. The exchange between the pair followed concerns from Sir Keir that the restrictions at the border are not strong enough to prevent new variants of Covid coming into the UK. Mr Johnson defended the policy and said it had allowed the UK to get on with the vaccination programme. ""If we had listened to [Sir Keir] we would still be at the starting blocks,"" he said suggesting that membership of the EMA would have slowed down the UK's vaccine programme. 'Not practical' to close UK borders, says PM By Reality Check In an exchange over coronavirus, Boris Johnson said that, when it came to vaccinations, Sir Keir Starmer ""wanted to stay in the European Medicines Agency [EMA] and said so four times from that dispatch box"". The EMAhas been slowerto approve Covid vaccines for the EU than UK regulators. The Labour leader denied this: ""The prime minister knows I've never said that from this dispatch box or anywhere else, but the truth escapes him."" We've found two occasions when he did speak up in favour of the EMA. They were from 2017 and made in the context of the ongoing Brexit debate back then. For example in January 2017, Sir Keirhe said in a parliamentary speech:,external""Why would we want to be outside the European Medicines Agency, which ensures that all medicines in the EU market are safe and effective?"" After Prime Minister's Questions, a Labour spokesperson said: ""On a number of occasions the prime minister has wrongly claimed that Labour wanted to join the EU's vaccine programme. That is inaccurate and the claim has been found to be untrue."" Sir Keir had ""assumed"" the prime minister was ""making the same false accusation again,"" the statement added. ""Keir accepts that, on this occasion, the prime minister was referring to old comments about the European Medicines Agency and Keir admits he was wrong and made a mistake in his response."" Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth praised his leader for acknowledging the error, saying: ""I think it's a good thing that if a politician makes a mistake he holds his hand up... I think it's refreshing, I wish more politicians would do that."" There have been reports that Sir Keir and Mr Johnson got involved in an altercation on the subject after leaving the Commons chamber but Labour MP Chris Matheson, who was with his party leader, said ""there was a brief chat... nothing more to it than that."" And a Labour source told the BBC: ""They had a perfectly reasonable conversation as they often do after PMQs."" Asked about the alleged incident, Mr Johnson's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: ""I have seen the reports but I haven't seen the prime minister since he went to the Chamber so I can't confirm or deny that.""

Tomlinson and trade unionists in Court of Appeal,"Dennis Warren, deceased, and Ricky Tomlinson: Among the 14 appellants in the case Trade unionists attempting to overturn convictions in a 47-year-long campaign have told the Court of Appeal they were victims of an establishment plot. The 14-strong group, including actor Ricky Tomlinson, say police destroyed evidence, and shadowy security chiefs prejudiced their trial. The men were convicted over allegedly illegal protests during a 1972 strike. Six of the 14 have since died, including Dennis Warren, who was jailed for three years. Their families are continuing the cases in their names. Tomlinson, then known as Eric, was jailed for two years in the first of three trials that lasted until 1974. Appellants Terry Renshaw (second left) and John McKinsie Jones (centre) at the Court of Appeal In June 1972, trade unionists called the UK's first-ever national builders' strike in protest against pay, unjust employment practices and dangerous conditions on sites. Flying pickets, in which trade unionists travel to demonstrate from one site to another, went from town to town urging builders to down tools - and in September six coach-loads of strikers demonstrated in Shrewsbury and Telford. Police arrested none of the demonstrators that day - but five months later, amid pressure from building industry bosses, Tomlinson and others were charged and subsequently convicted of offences including unlawful assembly, intimidation and affray. Those convictions triggered a massive campaign among left-wing groups during the 1970s - but the men failed to have the verdicts reversed on appeal. Last year, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the official body that looks at potential miscarriages of justice, sent the case back to the Court of Appeal after Eileen Turnbull, the researcher for the justice campaign, uncovered a potentially crucial document in the National Archives. Ricky Tomlinson (centre) leaving prison after his sentence That document, part of prosecution papers, revealed for the first time that police had destroyed some of the original witness statements. Danny Friedman QC, speaking for 12 of the men, told the Court of Appeal these missing original statements would have been crucial. ""If today a prosecution counsel is told by [police] officers ... original statements have been destroyed, two things absolutely have to happen. ""Number one, you need to immediately get a statement from the officer in the case, explaining in detail what on earth he is talking about. Secondly, you must also make sure that this issue is disclosed to defence and the judge."" Ricky Tomlinson's strike conviction to be reviewed Ricky Tomlinson battles to overturn 1970s prison term 'Shrewsbury 24': MPs vote for release of government papers Mr Friedman said the jury must have also known about a highly-prejudicial ITV documentary, Red under the Bed. Official government papers show its content was influenced by a then secret anti-communist propaganda unit inside the Foreign Office which, alongside MI5, was concerned about Moscow's potential infiltration of trade unionists. The programme was broadcast halfway through the trial - at a time when there were only three TV channels in the UK - and it was also reported in many national newspapers. It purportedly investigated communist agitators and included footage of the defendants, their supporters, police lines and pictures of strikers. Demonstration: Trade unionists came out in support of Tomlinson and Warren - and later the others A studio discussion following the film included a panellist referring to the builders' strike as an example of ""blatant communist influence"". That statement alone was deeply prejudicial, say the 14's lawyers, because it would have provoked ""panic"" in the mind of the jury. Mr Friedman told the court: ""It is obvious... a covert executive agency played a part in deliberately propagandising against the core subject matter of the [men's prosecution]. ""It is clear now that the higher echelons of the state bore responsibility for deliberate covert involvement in the production of the programme."" Lawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service are expected to argue during the appeal's second day that the TV documentary is irrelevant, and that no actual evidence was destroyed by police as they prepared case papers.

Russell Crowe backs round-the-world sailor,"This video can not be played The actor said he had just returned from kayaking on his local creek Hollywood actor Russell Crowe has sent a surprise birthday message to a sailor in a round-the world yacht race. Pip Hare, from Poole, Dorset, is competing in thegruelling Vendee Globeand was tweeted by Crowe after she said she was a big fan in a BBC interview.

Pip Hare has crossed the equator on her approach to the finish line in France During an interview from her yacht, she told BBC Radio Solent presenter Steve Harris that she was a big fan of the Master and Commander actor. The presenter speculatively tweeted Crowe asking for a birthday message for the sailor - and he obliged. Crowe, who is currently in Australia, responded with a video saying: ""Happy birthday Pip. What an amazing feeling you're going to have when you can say you've claimed the globe."" The three-month, solo, non-stop, round-the-world race is known as the ""Everest of the Seas"". Mr Harris described Hare as a ""force of nature"". ""I have enjoyed sharing her story with my listeners over the last three months, and with her birthday coming up, I started approaching people to record messages for her - I never expected Russell to work out,"" he said. Hare has been a professional sailor for 25 years but only started solo sailing 10 years ago. She is currently in 20th place in the race.

'Fatally flawed' uni testing system saw boss quit,"This video can not be played The university said it ""completely rejects"" Mr Evans' claims The manager of Cardiff University's Covid testing system quit because he thought it was ""fatally flawed"". Neil Evans said he thought results were not reliable before the system's launch and the university wanted to start it too quickly ahead of the autumn term. He left his role on 23 September and the system was rolled out in October. The university said it ""completely rejects"" Mr Evans's claims and that the system led to ""hundreds"" of asymptomatic cases being identified. Allan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said he had some concerns with the system. Which areas are having mass testing for the variant? Why is the UK bringing in travel testing? Cardiff University said it had carried out about 25,000 tests since the system was launched and that the programme helped to identify ""a few hundred"" asymptomatic positive cases. It said these people then self-isolated rather than ""unknowingly spreading infection"". The system involved students and staff giving a saliva sample, which then underwent a PCR test. People who tested positive were then told to get a confirmatory NHS swab test. The university ""estimates concordance with the NHS test at around 90%"". Cardiff University said it ""completely rejects"" Mr Evans's claims Mr Evans worked as a service manager at the facility in August and September while the system was being developed, before resigning on 23 September, two weeks before the programme was launched. He said he was happy to get the job as he felt the service could help staff and students return safely to campus in the autumn. But he said he became concerned at what he saw as the university's desire to introduce the service ""at pace"" when he felt more time was needed to validate the system by testing its results against known samples from an NHS laboratory. He said: ""It was fatally flawed for various reasons. ""You couldn't trust the test results, fundamentally there's no trust in any of the test results,"" he added. ""So all of those students will be giving saliva under false pretences that you get a result back either positive or negative. ""But for me at that point, I couldn't have signed off on those results, because I wouldn't have been happy with the validation of the process. ""The whole process needed a few more months and a bit more validation, a bit more accreditation, a bit more forethought and then, yes, it would have been a really good service."" The university said the testing system it used had uncovered ""a few hundred asymptomatic positive cases"" Mr Evans said Public Health Wales (PHW) shared his concerns about the risk of false results. ""PHW didn't want it to happen at all and they saw it as more of a hindrance than a help,"" he said. What has the university said? A Cardiff University spokesman said: ""We completely reject the claim that our screening service was not ready to go live. ""We have been clear throughout that our screening service is not (currently) accredited by the regulatory authorities. ""However, our screening service has been recognised by relevant authorities and we have responded to requests such as those to test students on NHS placements ahead of the Christmas break. ""During the early stages of the project, we took advice from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on all control and process requirements. Vaccine Q&A: Health minister answers your questions Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""Any positives identified by our in-house screening service in partnership with PHW are subject to confirmatory testing through an NHS swab test. ""Very few other national testing programmes had this level of cross-test validation in place. ""We also completely reject the claim that there was insufficient validation to have confidence in the results. ""Our validation processes are vigorous and thorough."" Mr Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: ""My primary concern is the use of saliva as a sample for a PCR. ""This is unusual practice within the UK and as far as I'm aware is not used in any other diagnostic laboratory setting. He said advising positive cases to get a confirmatory test was a ""reasonable step"" but added he was concerned over ""what confidence we can have in negative results without validation"". ""I think the issue of giving negative results out without that confidence is potentially the actions of individuals that think they're negative when, in actual fact, could be positive for the disease,"" he added. Some students isolated in their halls of residence after positive tests In response to Mr Wilson's concerns over saliva samples, the university said: ""This was unusual practice for the UK before the Covid-19 pandemic, but in line with some other university Covid-19 screening services and is increasingly seen as a valid sample for PCR diagnostics. ""Saliva is used routinely in Covid-19 screening elsewhere in the world. ""The Cardiff University screening service is not a clinical diagnostic test. All positive results must undergo further validation. In order to do this, all staff and students returning a positive or inconclusive test result will be instructed to book a confirmatory test through NHS Wales."" On the validation process, it said it has not requested negative samples externally analysed by PHW ""as we are mindful of the pressures on their services"". A PHW spokeswoman said: ""Public Health Wales was not a delivery partner in coronavirus testing set up by Cardiff University and so we are not able to comment further."" Cardiff University said it has an ""excellent working relationship with PHW"" and that senior representatives ""have acknowledged the university's screening service and its contribution to ensuring a safe campus"".

LiveLivePM joins 'national clap' for Capt Sir Tom1 minute ago,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson joins a ""national clap"" to honour NHS charity fundraiser Capt Sir Tom Moore and health workers Sir Tom, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus at the age of 100 on Tuesday Johnson hails the milestone reached by the UK of vaccinating 10 million people - and thanks health workers and vaccination staff England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says the UK has passed the peak of the second wave of coronavirus But Prof Whitty says deaths will remain high ""for quite some time"" but positive tests are starting to come down A vaccine to tackle Covid-19 variants could be ready to deploy by the autumn, the team behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says A further 1,322 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton Today's live page editors have been James Clarke and Sarah Collerton, and the writers have been Ella Wills, Gavin Stamp, Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Joshua Nevett. Rail staff at London Paddington station take part in a national clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now. Thank you for joining us. We'll bring you more live updates from the UK and around the world tomorrow morning. Here's a final round-up of the main headlines as we draw things to a close:  Annabel RackhamBBC Entertainment reporter Annabel Rackham has had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately. Being totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket. I've had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life. But one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up. I'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety. So when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed.

The city of San Antonio in Texas has been administering at-home Covid vaccinations to its homebound seniors. But now it's facing a problem: people are calling in to the 911 emergency hotline, to try to schedule their own at-home jab. ""It's clogging our 911 system,"" says Joe Arrington, a public information officer for the fire department, reminding people the number should only be used for emergencies. The city is currently only making appointments for seniors it has reached through the public housing authorities and a meal delivery program, but hopes to have more at-home vaccine slots open in the future. Texas was the first US state to top one million vaccines administered, but it has been accused of having a haphazard rollout that lacks coordination with the federal government. On Tuesday, a 16-lane drive-through mega-site launched on the Texas Motor Speedway, in the city of Fort Worth, one of the largest vaccine hubs in the nation. An education recovery commissioner has been appointed by the government to oversee a catch-up programme for children who have lost out on learning because of schools being closed during the pandemic. Sir Kevan Collins will report directly to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Prime Minister

Boris Johnson. Downing Street says his new role  will involving working with government to deliver measures to help children who have missed out on face-to-face learning, including addressing factors such as curriculum content and quantity of teaching time in the coming months. It added that education and the reopening of schools remains the ""top priority"", and the government is committing Â£300m to help children catch up on their education, on top of the Â£1bn announced last June as part of the Covid catch-up fund. Sir Kevan has worked in the education sector for over 30 years as a teacher, a director of childrenâs services and most recently as chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a lot to be hopeful for. Vaccine roll-out is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths. The peak, as Prof Chris Whitty suggests, has been passed. Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, itâs from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more in hospital now than there was at the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February, when all the over-70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be tread until the over-50s are protected. As we have reported, around 80,000 urgent coronavirustests are being carried out in parts of England afterprevious random checks found at least one case of the South African variant that could not be linked to international travel. Now volunteers delivering these door-to-door tests say they have encountered ""almost no negativity"" from the public. Kent Search and Rescue's Stewart Baird, who is helping to organise a team of about 100 volunteers, firefighters and police officers in the ME15 postcode area, said about 95% of residents had accepted a test kit when offered. Swabs were delivered to 2,697 people in Maidstone on Tuesday, with at least 2,050 already returned completed. ""For those that are in, over 95% are asking for testing kits,"" he said. ""Almost everyone is asking for the testing kits and handing them back an hour or two later."" Read more here The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been a key component of the UK's inoculation programme The Belgian government says AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should only be given to people aged under 55. It is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EUâs drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden have already recommended it be limited to under-65s. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks. UK health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages, whileresearch has shown it is highly effective. AstraZeneca has been embroiled in political controversy, however. The European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.

Joseph Flavill is still recovering in hospital after being hit by a car last March - shortly before the first lockdown. His family say the 19-year-old's condition is slowly improving. His aunt, Sally Flavill Smith, told BBC News that it was something âweâve been hoping for every day during lockdown.â She says when the family chat to Joseph - who is not allowed any visitors - they try to explain about the pandemic and why he can only see his loved ones via a screen.

Capt Tom's daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore and her family joined the applause, standing outside the gate to his home in the village of Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds stood outside 10 Downing Street to salute Capt Tom. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent So good news. Ten million have
had a dose of the vaccine. And, importantly, England's chief medical officer says
we're past the peak of this wave, or at least we should be if infection rates
donât start climbing again. Both are significant. Theyâre also the reason why
Boris Johnson was starting to come under pressure, with questions like why
canât those who have had the vaccine start to mix with each other at least? Could schools go back earlier in England? Itâs clearly still too early for the
government to be able to signal to people that they can begin to relax. The
numbers of people infected with Covid-19 around the country, at one in 55, are
still very high. The prime minister would only say that he will set out, on 22 February ""the timetable, the earliest dates we can do things"". And he indicated he was still thinking about loosening the current restrictions
in stages. ""It feels to us that we will be going down the tiers nationally,"" said Johnson. Expect many arguments to come about when any loosening should
happen, how soon should schools reopen, and whether some areas will move faster
than others. The extraordinary fundraising of Captain Sir Tom Moore was well documented last year. Capt Sir Tom raised Â£32.8m (Â£39.3m including Gift Aid) in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together, by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. Hospital staff treating the sickest patients have beenunder intense pressure in recent months, and a recent study suggested manyhad been left traumatised by their experience during the first wavelast spring. While things such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical apparatus are funded by taxpayers, the focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Back in May, the BBC's Hazel Shearing spoke to NHS staff about how the money was helping. Some of the donations went towards food and care packs for staff in Durham and a revamped wellbeing space for workers in Scotland to relax in during their breaks. You can read morehere. A clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore is now under way. The 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just finished leading today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Here's a quick roundup of what we learned: As we have been reporting, the public has been encouraged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take part in a clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore shortly, at 18:00 GMT. The 100-year-old, whoraised almost Â£33m for NHS charitiesby walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Johnson said the clap would also be for ""all those health workers for whom he raised money"". Capt Sir Tom's family said they were ""incredibly touched"". Read our story here Â© 2025 BBC.

"'Not practical' to close UK borders, says PM","It is ""not practical"" to completely close the UK's borders given the amount of medicines and food imported into the country, the prime minister has said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions to prevent new coronavirus variants entering the UK. Boris Johnson said the government had already tightened travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus. He said it would be going ahead with its plan for quarantine hotels for people arriving from Covid hotspots. It is not yet clear when the scheme - announced a week ago - will start or when there will be further details. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said government scientists had recommended ""a complete pre-emptive closure of borders"". In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Actually, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) did not recommend a complete ban and they say travel bans should not be relied upon to stop the importation of new variants. ""But we do have one of the toughest regimes in the world."" Why hasn't the UK closed its borders? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? What are the UK travel rules? Rules around international travel were tightened last month,meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK. The government also announced plans to make people quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels when arriving in the UK from certain ""high risk"" countries, where new coronavirus variants have been identified. The prime minister said at Wednesday evening's Downing Street briefing that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would make a statement on Thursday to give further details, although No 10 later clarified to say this was not happening. Labour chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Coopertweeted,externalin response: ""Oh for heaven's sake. Who is in charge of this borders policy? When will we get details? Does anyone have a grip?"" The UK has placed 33 high-risk countries ona so-called ""red list"",,externalincluding most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal. Scotland has announcedit will extend the measures to all travellers. Sir Keir said the government's new border arrangements were ""still weeks away"" from being introduced and would only affect direct flights from some countries. He asked whether the prime minister was saying that ""quarantining all arrivals would make no difference to fighting new variants of the virus"", or that it was ""too difficult to do it"". Mr Johnson responded by saying that 75% of the UK's medicines come into the country from the European mainland, 45% of food, while 250,000 businesses rely on imports. ""It is not practical to completely close off this country as he seems to be suggesting,"" he said. Introducing quarantine hotels is a logistical challenge. The government needs to make sure hotels are ready. That doesn't just mean securing enough rooms and making sure all the guests can have meals delivered, but also coming up with policies around things like security if a guest tries to leave early. The government could use existing guidelines written up by countries such as New Zealand as a template. Airlines and airports also have questions about how this will work and some areas are complicated. For instance, the policy currently only applies to arrivals from 33 countries - all of whom will arrive on indirect flights. Should airlines separate passengers from low and high-risk countries onboard? But the policy also requires compliance from passengers. If passengers split their tickets and don't declare they've been in one of the 33 high-risk countries, how will the government keep track? There are plenty of questions from all quarters about how to make this policy effective. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also defended the government's decision not to extend the hotel quarantine policy to arrivals from all countries. He told the Commons Transport Committee: ""The idea that the UK could completely batten down its hatches and remain battened down for a year is mistaken. But also the evidence that that is the only thing you need to do, or primary thing you need to do, is pretty shaky."" Mr Shapps also said the hotel quarantine scheme would not affect many people. ""The 33 countries on the so-called red list do not have direct flightsâ¦ so the numbers we would expect to see returning would be quite low,"" he said.

Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, itâs from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more in hospital now than there was at the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February, when all the over-70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be tread until the over-50s are protected. As we have reported, around 80,000 urgent coronavirustests are being carried out in parts of England afterprevious random checks found at least one case of the South African variant that could not be linked to international travel. Now volunteers delivering these door-to-door tests say they have encountered ""almost no negativity"" from the public. Kent Search and Rescue's Stewart Baird, who is helping to organise a team of about 100 volunteers, firefighters and police officers in the ME15 postcode area, said about 95% of residents had accepted a test kit when offered. Swabs were delivered to 2,697 people in Maidstone on Tuesday, with at least 2,050 already returned completed. ""For those that are in, over 95% are asking for testing kits,"" he said. ""Almost everyone is asking for the testing kits and handing them back an hour or two later.""

It is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EUâs drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden have already recommended it be limited to under-65s. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks. UK health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages, whileresearch has shown it is highly effective. AstraZeneca has been embroiled in political controversy, however. The European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.

Joseph Flavill is still recovering in hospital after being hit by a car last March - shortly before the first lockdown. His family say the 19-year-old's condition is slowly improving. His aunt, Sally Flavill Smith, told BBC News that it was something âweâve been hoping for every day during lockdown.â She says when the family chat to Joseph - who is not allowed any visitors - they try to explain about the pandemic and why he can only see his loved ones via a screen.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds stood outside 10 Downing Street to salute Capt Tom. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent So good news. Ten million have
had a dose of the vaccine. And, importantly, England's chief medical officer says
we're past the peak of this wave, or at least we should be if infection rates
donât start climbing again. Both are significant. Theyâre also the reason why
Boris Johnson was starting to come under pressure, with questions like why
canât those who have had the vaccine start to mix with each other at least? Could schools go back earlier in England? Itâs clearly still too early for the
government to be able to signal to people that they can begin to relax. The
numbers of people infected with Covid-19 around the country, at one in 55, are
still very high. The prime minister would only say that he will set out, on 22 February ""the timetable, the earliest dates we can do things"". And he indicated he was still thinking about loosening the current restrictions
in stages. ""It feels to us that we will be going down the tiers nationally,"" said Johnson. Expect many arguments to come about when any loosening should
happen, how soon should schools reopen, and whether some areas will move faster
than others. The extraordinary fundraising of Captain Sir Tom Moore was well documented last year. Capt Sir Tom raised Â£32.8m (Â£39.3m including Gift Aid) in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together, by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. Hospital staff treating the sickest patients have beenunder intense pressure in recent months, and a recent study suggested manyhad been left traumatised by their experience during the first wavelast spring. While things such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical apparatus are funded by taxpayers, the focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Back in May, the BBC's Hazel Shearing spoke to NHS staff about how the money was helping. Some of the donations went towards food and care packs for staff in Durham and a revamped wellbeing space for workers in Scotland to relax in during their breaks. You can read morehere. A clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore is now under way. The 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just finished leading today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Here's a quick roundup of what we learned: As we have been reporting, the public has been encouraged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take part in a clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore shortly, at 18:00 GMT. The 100-year-old, whoraised almost Â£33m for NHS charitiesby walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Johnson said the clap would also be for ""all those health workers for whom he raised money"". Capt Sir Tom's family said they were ""incredibly touched"". Read our story here Â© 2025 BBC.

UK 'past peak' but Covid infections still 'high'Boris Johnson praises health workers' effort in helping the UK pass 10 million first vaccinations.,"This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""Vaccines are going to protect in three different ways"" The UK is ""past the peak"" of the current wave of the pandemic but infection rates are still high, England's chief medical officer says. Prof Chris Whitty said the number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths were on a ""downward slope"" but that did not mean there would not be another peak. Boris Johnson praised the ""colossal"" effort to vaccinate 10 million people, including 90% of those aged over 75. But the NHS was still under ""huge pressure"", the prime minister said. New vaccine 'ready by autumn' to tackle mutations 'Not practical' to close UK borders, says PM How many people have been vaccinated so far? Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said while the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 had reduced ""quite noticeably"", it was still above that of the first peak in April 2020. ""So this is still a very major problem, but it is one that is heading the right way,"" he said. Prof Whitty said infection rates were ""coming down but they are still incredibly high"". If the rate was to increase again ""from the very high levels we are at the moment the NHS will get back into trouble extraordinarily fast"", he added. His comments were echoed by the prime minister, who warned the level of infection was still ""forbiddingly high"" and that it was too soon to relax current restrictions. On Wednesday the UK recorded a further 1,322 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, bringing the total number of people who have died by this measure to 109,335, while a further 19,202 new cases were recorded. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? VACCINES:Those that work - and others on the way Mr Johnson told the briefing: ""Though today there are some signs of hope - the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave - the level of infection is still alarmingly high."" There are also about 32,000 Covid patients in hospital, he added. The prime minister said he hoped schools in England would be able to begin reopening from 8 March, as evidence showed the coronavirus vaccines reduced ""death and serious illness"" from the main strains of the disease. But he insisted the government would not be opening schools any earlier than this date, despite First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying that schools in Scotland would begin a phased reopening from 22 February. Elsewhere, the Welsh government is due to make a decision by the end of the week on whether to reopen its schools after the February half-term. Prof Whitty said schools in England had been managing to ""hold the line"" and remain open up until the new, more transmissible variant of the virus hit. He said it was up to ministers to decide the opening dates for schools but that he was confident the risk to children of getting Covid-19 was ""incredibly low"". Meanwhile, he warned that predictions that every adult could offered a first dose of a vaccine by May and a second by August were ""at the very optimistic end"" due to supply constraints. Mr Johnson said at the news conference the government would be sticking with its ""cautious"" approach. He said ministers would outline a ""route map"" out of lockdown on 22 February and that the country would be in ""a very different situation"" to last summer, when disease levels had been reduced but there was no vaccine. Vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first. A list ofnine high-priority groups,externalwhich covers about 32 million people - including 90-99% of those most at risk of dying - is being followed, with an aim to vaccinate the first four by 15 February. There is a lot to be hopeful for. The vaccine rollout is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths. Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why?

Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be struck until the over-50s are protected. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the results of a study which showedthe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirusas ""absolutely superb"". The researchers behind the jab have also said that a vaccine to tackle variants of the viruscould be ready to deploy by the autumnshould they be needed. A ""small number"" of cases of the coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa have been found inBirminghamas well as three cases without any travel history inWales. It comes after door-to-door testing has been launched to detect the mutation, which is thought to bemore infectious but not necessarily more deadly.

PM told to 'be the unionist we need' over Brexit,"This video can not be played ""Be the unionist we need you to be"" - PM is told by DUP's Ian Paisley during PMQs A DUP MP has called on the prime minister to ""be the unionist we need him to be"" in addressing concerns over the Irish Sea border. Ian Paisley told the Commons that the Brexit agreement had betrayed unionists and made them ""feel like foreigners in our own country"". Meanwhile a ""cordial"" meeting between the UK government, EU and NI's first and deputy first ministers has ended. There will be further discussions next week. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". Speaking before that meeting took place, Mr Paisley said ""tea and sympathy would not cut the mustard"" and urged Downing Street to act. Boris Johnson said the government would ""do everything we need to do"". Unionists oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, arguing it damages trade and threatens UK unity. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, hasannounced plans to stop north-south activities related to the NI Protocoluntil action is taken to address what she called a ""growing crisis"" over the Irish Sea border. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said his commitment to the union is 'unshakeable' Responding to Mr Paisley in the Commons, the prime minister insisted he was committed to Northern Ireland and the union. He said the government would act ""legislatively"" or by invoking an emergency mechanism known as Article 16 to override part ofthe protocol,external, if other solutions cannot be reached with the EU to remove GB-NI trade barriers. The UKhas already written the EU,externalasking for agreement to a long extension of grace periods for the Irish Sea border. Currently, supermarkets and other businesses are being allowed to operate with reduced requirements for paperwork and certification when moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The first of those grace periods is due to expire in April,but in a letter to the EU the UK government has asked for an extension until 2023. What are NI's grace periods for Brexit? It has also requested the creation of a common travel area for pets which would reduce the new post-Brexit processes for moving pets across the Irish Sea. UK and EU leaders held talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster spoke to Mr Johnson ahead of the UK-EU meeting, which she took part in along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ. Following the meeting, the first minister said the UK government accepted problems with trade between GB and NI following Brexit were ""more than just teething problems"", however, she added: ""I'm not so sure that's the case in the European Commission."" ""I have to say I was disappointed with some of the statements made by Maros Sefcovic in relation to teething problems [relating] to the rigorous implementation of the protocol because of course that's not going to cut it,"" she said. ""I think everybody knows now that there's fundamental reform and that needs to be dealt with very, very quickly. ""We have some cliff edges coming up on 1 April and we all know that, so therefore we need to work very quickly to deal with these issues."" But Ms O'Neill welcomed the position from the European Commission. The deputy first minister said Mr Å efÄoviÄ had ""put his hands up"" in the meeting over the attempt to introduce Article 16 last Friday. Ms O'Neill said he also asked that the Commission's ""track record"" of political and financial support for peace in Northern Ireland was taken into account. ""I think they [European Commission] came at it with a very constructive and open mind in terms of resolution to some of the outstanding issues however they were also equally very clear that the protocol must be implemented in its entirety,"" she told BBC News NI. ""The EU has been very clear in saying that the protocol is not up for renegotiation - I share that view."" Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ released a joint statement to say they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". The statement said the UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the ""proper implementation"" of the protocol Both ""condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ is also set to travel to London to continue talks. On Monday night, Stormont's Department of Agriculture decided to suspend Brexit checks on animal products at some NI ports after ""threats"" were made against inspection staff. However, a senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents. Simon Coveney said the protocol needed to be improved where possible Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he recognised there were ""serious problems"" with the protocol that needed to be resolved. But he warned it should be improved where possible, rather than scrapped as unionists have demanded. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal Amazon prepares to stop selling some products to NI Brussels might feel battered and bruised over its Article 16 blunder, but is it ready to bend? That is the hope of Michael Gove and Arlene Foster as they attempt to squeeze some concessions from MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ around the NI Protocol. Asking for a two year extension for Protocol exemptions is a big demand from London and won't sit easy with Brussels. But the DUP asking for the Protocol to be binned is a big demand which won't sit easy with London. Removing the Protocol would involve renegotiating a Withdrawal deal which took four years to put together. Boris Johnson last night made clear his ""unshakeable"" commitment to securing Northern Ireland's place in the union, but he also made clear he wants to fix the protocol, not ditch it. What we may get today is an extension of the grace period to allow businesses more time to adjust to the new rules. That will be sold by some as the first victory in a longer battle, but for others it will be as much as the EU should bend. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""highly regrettable that the first minister had chosen to approach the challenges presented by Brexit in a way that will increase instability and heighten tension at a time of immense sensitivity"". The Foyle MP again called for a moderation in language. The NI Protocol was part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreementand guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On Friday evening the EU announced it would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland. Itlater reversed this decision, but unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.

"Missing hiker taken against will, partner fears","Esther Dingley was a ""highly intelligent and experienced hiker"" according to her partner Dan Colegate A British hiker who went missing in the Pyrenees in November was taken ""against her will"", her partner has said. Dan Colegate said he cannot believe anything but the ""terrifying prospect"" that ""somebody else was involved"" in the disappearance of Esther Dingley. Ms Dingley, 37, was on a solo trek from Pic de Sauvegarde near the French-Spanish border on 22 November when she last communicated with her partner. Extensive searches of the area have found no trace of her. French and Spanish police investigating her disappearance have said they are open to all options,including ""non-accidental"". Esther Dingley sent this photo of herself at the top of a mountain on 22 November In a post on the couple's Facebook page, Mr Colegate dismissed speculation that she voluntarily disappeared because she was unhappy in their relationship as ""salacious nonsense"". He said the couple, who wereliving in Durham before heading off on a six year-long campervan adventure, had purposely built an ""unconventional lifestyle"" which, like any relationship, had its tensions, but they were both happy with. He also said as a ""highly intelligent and experienced hiker"" who has seen search operations in action, the ""idea she would trigger that and put others at risk to get some time alone rather than simply say 'I need some time alone' is ridiculous to me"". Mr Colegate said if she had been injured in the mountains he is sure she would have been found by the searchers. ""All of which leads me to believe that somebody else has been involved in Esther's disappearance and against her will,"" he said. ""This is a terrifying prospect and I wish I could believe otherwise, but I cannot. ""A happy, experienced, well-equipped and fit young woman went missing in an area with clear paths and mostly open terrain. ""An intensive search found no sign of her, or any of her equipment. It is as though she vanished into thin air."" The couple's 19th anniversary together is in two weeks Mr Colegate, who is currently in France, said he plans to return to the area as soon as he is allowed to resume the search. ""All that matters to me and Esther's parents is finding her,"" he said. ""We all still hold on to the thin hope that she might still come back to us safely. ""Her face appears to me all the time, whether or not I am occupied with other things. ""For almost two decades now we have shared almost everything, building a life together that was occasionally challenging but mostly full of joy and love.

Influencers told not to use 'misleading' filters on ads,"Sasha Pallari says filters give a false impression Filters should not be applied to social media adverts if they exaggerate the effect of the product, the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled. The ASA was responding to the #filterdrop campaign that called for it to be compulsory for influencers to state when they use a beauty filter to promote skincare or cosmetics. Sasha Pallari, who started the campaign, said she was ""over the moon"". The ASA said filtered beauty content could be ""misleading"". Miss Pallari, 29, from Weston-super-Mare, said she started #filterdrop in July 2020 in the hope of seeing""more real skin"" on Instagram. The use of filters on social media is a widely debated issue, attracting the attention of not only celebrities and social media influencers but also MPs. Social media 'damages teens' mental health' Girl Guides: Digitally-enhanced photos need labels MP bids for law over digitally-altered body images The ASA examined two examples of where filters had been added to videos shared by influencers advertising tanning products, adding that the outcome of these rulings would apply to all UK brands, influencers and celebrities. They were: two Instagram stories for Skinny Tan Ltd and one for Tanologist Tan which was banned for applying a filter that ""misleadingly exaggerated the effect the product was capable of achieving"". It ruled the ads in both cases were likely to have misled consumers. Sasha Pallari, photographed without a filter (left) compared to using the 'Paris' filter (right) It said the ruling means that brands, influencers and celebrities should not apply filters to photos that promote beauty products if the filters are likely to exaggerate the effect the products are capable of achieving. The ASA said that filtered beauty content could still be misleading, even if the name of the filter was referenced in the Instagram story. Ads that break these rules would be taken down and prohibited from appearing again, which was likely to damage the advertiser and influencer's reputation, the ASA said. A spokesman said: ""An ongoing focus of our work in this area continues to be on raising awareness of the rules and supporting influencers with the guidance and tools they need to help get their ads right. ""We're also working closely with the social media platforms who can and will enforce our rulings where an advertiser is unwilling or able to work with us."" Sasha Pallari regularly uploads unfiltered content to her Instagram feed Miss Pallari said: ""I feel like the detrimental effect this is having on social media users has finally been taken seriously and this is a huge step in the right direction for how filters are used and the way cosmetics are advertised online."" She said it was an issue she had been passionate about for a long time and she received messages ""every day"" from women struggling to match the beauty standards in real life that they see online. ""I can now help make a difference to how these women view themselves in the mirror and that's amazing,"" she said. Molly Nutt said she used to find it hard to match what she could achieve in reality with what she was seeing online Molly Nutt, 20, has been following Miss Pallari's campaign and welcomed the ruling, adding that much of her life has ""revolved around filters"". ""Filters with names like 'Pretty Girl', with blue eyes, bigger lips and a smaller nose, that just implies what you should look like, and not everybody is going to look like that,"" she said. ""Not everyone is an expert at make-up... and then with the filters as well it enhances it even more... I can't match up to how they look on Instagram. ""Most days I couldn't even leave the house without putting on make-up, but now I don't care as much... Sasha has made me feel more at ease with who I am and that I'm not an alien because of the way I look."" Rahi Chadda says when it comes to advertising online brands need to be authentic With more than 900,000 followers on Instagram, model and influencer Rahi Chadda, said he ""completely agrees"" with the ruling but is concerned about how it will be policed. ""Having this ruling is a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""The logistics though will definitely be a point of concern for the majority of influencers, because what is the definition of a filter? ""When we are talking about filters, are we talking about lighting, special effects, make-up before promoting a product... in that way most pictures on social media will be naturally filtered... you have already glorified the product in such a way before it is reaching the audience. ""They are going to have to be a lot clearer about what they mean by a filter and where we draw the line."" A photograph of Sasha without filter is seen side-by-side with an adapted version that has had a 'cats eyes' filter added When Miss Pallari set out on her campaign, she said she wanted to see three outcomes: to encourage as many women as possible to not depend on filters, for the ASA to demand that social media influencers and celebrities must state if they have used a filter when promoting cosmetics and to get face-changing and morphing filters removed from Instagram. She said with two of her aims achieved, she would fight to get face-altering filters removed from Instagram altogether. ""There's no point coming this far, to only come this far,"" she said. ""How can Instagram agree to remove filters that promote plastic surgery, but not filters that alter your shape - how else are we going to alter our face without plastic surgery?"" The most recent celebrity to speak out about face-altering filters is former Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson. She took to her Instagram feed on Tuesday to encourage her 7.6m followers to embrace their natural looks. The 29-year-old said while she ""loves a little Instagram filter that makes you look a bit more tanned or your skin a bit fresher"", she does not understand why most filters alter her appearance, giving her a ""tiny nose and huge lips"". She went on: ""I don't understand why Instagram feels the need to squash your nose and make it really skinny. What's wrong with a standard nose? ""I'm so confused why whoever makes these filters think that is what beauty is?"" Little Mix star Jesy Nelson is the latest celebrity to criticise face-altering filters Responding to the ASA ruling, Skinny Tan said it had since reviewed its guidelines on the user-generated content it chose to share on social media. ""We do not encourage the use of beauty filters that exaggerate or provide a misleading impression of the results our products can achieve,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Whilst we were disappointed with the ASA ruling, as the intention behind the particular Instagram stories in question was not to mislead but rather to share her positive comments and experience with using our products, we do fully understand our responsibility as a brand to protect consumer interests. A spokesperson for Tanologist said it was disappointed but respected the ASA's ruling, although it had not used the content on its brand account. ""The influencer content in question demonstrated before and after self-tan product results. ""The 'after' content - which depicted the results of the self-tan product - did not have a filter applied."" When approached for comment about the #filterdrop campaign and the ASA ruling, Instagram declined to comment, but the BBC understands that brands, celebrities and influencers are asked to comply with CMA and ASA guidance on sponsored social media posts.

PM 'not aware' of Covid cases ahead of factory tour,"Boris Johnson visited the Valneva site in Livingston last Thursday Boris Johnson has said he was not aware of a Covid outbreak at a vaccine factory ahead of his visit last week. The prime minister toured the Valneva vaccine factory in Livingston as part of a trip to Scotland. The company has now said that a number of coronavirus cases had been reported among staff at the site earlier in January. But Valneva has insisted that Mr Johnson's tour of the factory last Thursday was ""Covid secure"". Mr Johnson told the House of Commons that ""nobody raised that issue with me before or since"". But Downing Street later admitted it had been told in advance of the visit. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""Valneva made us aware that some Covid cases had been reported and they had brought in some Covid secure procedures. ""The site director has said if there had been any risk they would not have allowed the visit to go ahead."" PM visits Scotland to push case for the Union Mr Johnson said it was his job to visit every part of the country and ""nothing or no one is going to stop me"". And he said there are ""few things more important"" than the vaccination programme and recognising the work of the scientists involved. His visit to Scotland had already proved controversial, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon questioning at the time whether it was genuinely ""essential"" for the prime minister to travel during the current lockdown restrictions. Boris Johnson also visited the Lighthouse Laboratory in Glasgow, which is used for processing PCR samples During Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the visit was ""utterly, utterly reckless"" and an ""absolutely shocking error of judgment"". He also accused Mr Johnson of putting ""politics before public health"". Mr Blackford added: ""What an absolute shambles, that he's gone to a plant where there was a Covid outbreak. ""The Daily Record story is very clear, the PM and his advisers knew there was a serious Covid outbreak at this plant, they knew the visit posed a risk but he made a deliberate choice, they made the irresponsible choice."" Mr Johnson replied: ""I think what the people of Scotland want to see is the whole country pulling together and working to develop the vaccine as that fantastic plant in Scotland is doing. ""One of the advantages of the Valneva vaccine is that it may be able to combat all sorts of variants in a very comprehensive way. It's amazing, wonderful to see Scottish scientists working to do that. I had a fantastic time. ""Nobody, by the way, raised that issue with me before or since and it is my job to visit every part of this country, nothing and no-one is going to stop me and I am very, very proud of the record of the government in rolling out the vaccine."" In a statement, Valneva said ""a number of coronavirus cases were reported among staff"" at the Livingston site last month. It said staff who may have been affected had been self-isolating and that the prime minister's visit was Covid-compliant. TheDaily Record,externalquoted Valneva's chief financial officer, David Lawrence, as saying that Downing Street was informed of the outbreak ahead of the trip. Mr Johnson also visited the Lighthouse Laboratory at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow, where coronavirus tests are processed, and met troops setting up a vaccination centre in Castlemilk. I was not aware of Covid cases among workers at Valneva when I visited the site to interview the prime minister on behalf of UK broadcasters last week. Boris Johnson made no reference to a Covid outbreak. Neither did anyone from his Downing Street team or from the company. It was simply not mentioned. However, Valneva appeared to be a highly Covid conscious company on the occasion of the prime minister's visit. I was required to fill out a form to confirm details of my health and travel history. I had to wear personal protective equipment including a lab coat, plastic shoe coverings and an industrial grade face covering. As did the PM. Downing Street has now confirmed it had been made aware of the cases before Mr Johnson's visit. Remarkably, it does not appear to have told the prime minister, having been advised by Valneva it had Covid-secure procedures in place. Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland had vaccinated more people on Tuesday than any other day so far With the Scottish government facing questions about the progress of the vaccine rollout north of the border, Mr Johnson has repeated the UK government's offer to ""help Scotland with the rollout of vaccines"". The British Army is to start administering the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland for the first time, with 57 personnel deploying on Thursday to help health boards with the vaccine rollout. The medics and management staff will make up a ""vaccine quick reaction force"" which will see five teams of 10 able to deploy across Scotland at short notice. They will be in addition to the 98 members of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who are already supporting the vaccine effort. Scotland has been lagging behind the other three UK nations in the overall percentage of people it has vaccinated, with Scotland's health secretary and national clinical director admitting on Tuesday that it needed to speed up the rollout. But at Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeon said more than 38,000 people had received their first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday - the highest daily total so far. She said the Scottish government had focused on getting the most vulnerable vaccinated first, and that the programme was now accelerating. The Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson called for the Scottish government to publish daily breakdowns of vaccination figures for each health board area. And Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie raised concern that there was a ""growing postcode lottery in vaccine rollout"", which Ms Sturgeon denied. After outlining cases brought to her attention of people not being told when they will receive their first dose, she told the first minister: ""These examples aren't a one-off but they are part of a growing postcode lottery in vaccine rollout, and it's slowing Scotland's recovery from Covid-19. ""The weekly Public Health Scotland figures show a huge variation across the country in the proportion of the population receiving the vaccine."" Ms Sturgeon insisted: ""People are not being penalised because of where they live. ""There will be differences in speed because of geographies, because of how different health boards are organising this to take account of the differences between urban areas and rural areas, the different sizes of communities, but all health boards are making progress.""

DUP urges PM to 'be unionist we need' over Brexit,"This video can not be played ""Be the unionist we need you to be"" - PM is told by DUP's Ian Paisley during PMQs A DUP MP has called on the prime minister to ""be the unionist we need him to be"" in addressing concerns over the Irish Sea border. Ian Paisley told the Commons that the Brexit agreement had betrayed unionists and made them ""feel like foreigners in our own country"". Meanwhile a ""cordial"" meeting between the UK government, EU and NI's first and deputy first ministers has ended. There will be further discussions next week. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". Speaking before that meeting took place, Mr Paisley said ""tea and sympathy would not cut the mustard"" and urged Downing Street to act. Boris Johnson said the government would ""do everything we need to do"". Unionists oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, arguing it damages trade and threatens UK unity. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, hasannounced plans to stop north-south activities related to the NI Protocoluntil action is taken to address what she called a ""growing crisis"" over the Irish Sea border. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said his commitment to the union is 'unshakeable' Responding to Mr Paisley in the Commons, the prime minister insisted he was committed to Northern Ireland and the union. He said the government would act ""legislatively"" or by invoking an emergency mechanism known as Article 16 to override part ofthe protocol,external, if other solutions cannot be reached with the EU to remove GB-NI trade barriers. The UKhas already written the EU,externalasking for agreement to a long extension of grace periods for the Irish Sea border. Currently, supermarkets and other businesses are being allowed to operate with reduced requirements for paperwork and certification when moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The first of those grace periods is due to expire in April,but in a letter to the EU the UK government has asked for an extension until 2023. What are NI's grace periods for Brexit? It has also requested the creation of a common travel area for pets which would reduce the new post-Brexit processes for moving pets across the Irish Sea. UK and EU leaders held talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster spoke to Mr Johnson ahead of the UK-EU meeting, which she took part in along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ. Following the meeting, the first minister said the UK government accepted problems with trade between GB and NI following Brexit were ""more than just teething problems"", however, she added: ""I'm not so sure that's the case in the European Commission."" ""I have to say I was disappointed with some of the statements made by Maros Sefcovic in relation to teething problems [relating] to the rigorous implementation of the protocol because of course that's not going to cut it,"" she said. ""I think everybody knows now that there's fundamental reform and that needs to be dealt with very, very quickly. ""We have some cliff edges coming up on 1 April and we all know that, so therefore we need to work very quickly to deal with these issues."" But Ms O'Neill welcomed the position from the European Commission. The deputy first minister said Mr Å efÄoviÄ had ""put his hands up"" in the meeting over the attempt to introduce Article 16 last Friday. Ms O'Neill said he also asked that the Commission's ""track record"" of political and financial support for peace in Northern Ireland was taken into account. ""I think they [European Commission] came at it with a very constructive and open mind in terms of resolution to some of the outstanding issues however they were also equally very clear that the protocol must be implemented in its entirety,"" she told BBC News NI. ""The EU has been very clear in saying that the protocol is not up for renegotiation - I share that view."" Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ released a joint statement to say they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". The statement said the UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the ""proper implementation"" of the protocol Both ""condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ is also set to travel to London to continue talks. On Monday night, Stormont's Department of Agriculture decided to suspend Brexit checks on animal products at some NI ports after ""threats"" were made against inspection staff. However, a senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents. Simon Coveney said the protocol needed to be improved where possible Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he recognised there were ""serious problems"" with the protocol that needed to be resolved. But he warned it should be improved where possible, rather than scrapped as unionists have demanded. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal Amazon prepares to stop selling some products to NI Brussels might feel battered and bruised over its Article 16 blunder, but is it ready to bend? That is the hope of Michael Gove and Arlene Foster as they attempt to squeeze some concessions from MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ around the NI Protocol. Asking for a two year extension for Protocol exemptions is a big demand from London and won't sit easy with Brussels. But the DUP asking for the Protocol to be binned is a big demand which won't sit easy with London. Removing the Protocol would involve renegotiating a Withdrawal deal which took four years to put together. Boris Johnson last night made clear his ""unshakeable"" commitment to securing Northern Ireland's place in the union, but he also made clear he wants to fix the protocol, not ditch it. What we may get today is an extension of the grace period to allow businesses more time to adjust to the new rules. That will be sold by some as the first victory in a longer battle, but for others it will be as much as the EU should bend. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""highly regrettable that the first minister had chosen to approach the challenges presented by Brexit in a way that will increase instability and heighten tension at a time of immense sensitivity"". The Foyle MP again called for a moderation in language. The NI Protocol was part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreementand guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On Friday evening the EU announced it would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland.

Sister sues Mariah Carey over 'vindictive' bookThe US singer's older sibling wants $1.2m for distress caused by comments in her recent memoir.Entertainment & Arts,"The Meaning of Mariah Carey was published in September Mariah Carey's older sister is suing the US singer for $1.2m (Â£875,000) for ""immense emotional distress"" she says was caused by remarks in her memoir. In her complaint, Alison Carey referred to claims in the book that she gave 12-year-old Mariah Valium, tried to pimp her out and threw boiling tea on her. Alison denied the claims, saying Mariah ""presented no evidence to substantiate these serious allegations"". The pop star published The Meaning of Mariah Carey in September. Alison, who was 20 at the time the alleged events took place, filed her two-page legal complaint at New York Supreme Court on Monday. It said the ""outrageous"" material in Mariah's book was meant to ""humiliate and embarrass"" her sister. Mariah Carey's memoir: Six key revelations Mariah's Christmas anthem finally tops the charts Mariah used ""her status as a public figure to attack her penniless sister, generating sensational headlines describing her lurid claims to promote sales of her book"", Alison claimed. She is now seeking damages for the ""heartless, vicious, vindictive, despicable and totally unnecessary public humiliation"". In December, the pop diva's All I Want For Christmas Is You topped the UK charts for the first time She also said she was severely depressed due to the ""unspeakable trauma of her childhood and having her own children abandon her"". According to the document, Mariah had publicly acknowledged her sister, or ""ex-sister"", to be a ""deeply wounded"" person. The BBC has asked the singer's representatives for a comment. Alison dropped in and out of Mariah life, through teenage pregnancy, drug dependency and suicidal thoughts, the performer wrote. Although they shared some tender moments, the singer depicted several occasions when she believes Alison put her at risk. One story involved her sister's boyfriend, who - Carey says she later realised - was running a prostitution ring. Aged 12, she claimed she was tricked into spending a night alone with him, ending up at a card game and a drive-in movie, where ""almost immediately"" he put his arm around her. Immobilised and terrified by the ""handgun resting against his thigh"", Carey said she only escaped after another car pulled up alongside them, prompting John to leave and drive home ""in silence"". The singer believes she was at risk of being pimped, reasoning: ""Dysfunctional families are ideal prey for abusers, the exposed little ones vulnerable to being picked off."" Speaking to The Sun when the book was published, Alison denied the claims and said she was shocked and appalled that Mariah would accuse her of pimping her out.

British man facing jail flees Iran over mountains,"This video can not be played Kameel Ahmady travelled high over the mountains on foot to escape Iran's Revolutionary Guards A British-Iranian academic facing nine years in jail in Iran has told the BBC how he escaped on foot over mountains to start a new life in the UK. Kameel Ahmady was convicted two months ago of collaborating with a hostile government. He denies the charge. He decided to try to flee while on bail and appealing against the sentence. Mr Ahmady trekked over a mountainous border to escape the Revolutionary Guards - a journey he described as ""very long, very dark and very scary"". Iran court 'jails British FGM researcher' 'Grave concern' over Zaghari-Ratcliffe court case Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Mr Ahmady was born of Kurdish stock in western Iran. But his parents sent him to Britain when he was 18 for his education. He remained there many years, studying at the University of Kent and the London School of Economics. Such was his affection for Britain that he applied for British citizenship before returning to Iran as an anthropologist. His research focuses on child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) in Iran. This brought him to the attention of the authorities because he campaigned to raise the age at which girls can marry, which is currently set at 13 years old. Kameel Ahmady travelled high over the mountains on foot to escape Iran's Revolutionary Guards One morning in August 2019, a man came to his door in Tehran saying he was a postman. Mr Ahmady opened the door and 16 Revolutionary Guards stormed in. He was arrested and taken to the notorious Evin prison. Mr Ahmady said he had been targeted not just because he was a dual national, but also because Iran wanted to retaliate after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar that was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. ""Being a dual national, you are always a potential case,"" he told the BBC. ""My chief interrogator said, 'You're very delicious,' a) because I was Kurdish; b) I was coming from a Sunni religious background as opposed with the majority of the Shia in Iran; and c) I was a researcher who was digging up sensitive issues. And I wasn't only a simple researcher, I was actually acting on my research and using it for awareness raising."" Kameel Ahmady decided to flee Tehran while out on bail and appealing against his sentence He spent three months at Evin prison where, he said, his interrogators played mind games with him. ""They treated me, on a human level, well. But don't underestimate the concept and the seriousness of so-called 'white torture' - the psychological pressure they put on you. And all these games are played stage by stage, and they're very well trained as to how to put a little bit of extra pressure on you when it's needed."" ""There are all sorts of mind games, it's almost like a trade. You give me this, I'll give you that - a minute of a phone call needs all sorts of negotiation with your interrogators. Five minutes more extra fresh air than the half an hour that you're entitled to. And it is becoming really sad and petty because you want to be interrogated even more, not going back to the cell, which is almost like a grave."" After three months he was released ahead of the trial but monitored closely. This video can not be played (August 2020): The other detainees held 'hostage' in Iran Last December, Mr Ahmady was convicted of collaborating with a hostile government, something he denies, after prosecutors claimed that a charity he had once done some work for had once received some funding from the United States. He also faced various other charges, including promoting homosexuality in his research. He was sentenced to more than nine years in jail and given a fine of more than Â£500,000 ($683,000).But while out on bail, he decided to flee Iran,external. He said: ""The appeal was overturned. That was the moment that I decided to escape because I couldn't see myself staying in prison for 10 years and watching my son from a distance growing up. By the time I would have been released - if I was released - my son would have been 15."" So, without telling anyone but his immediate family, Mr Ahmady fled in secret, travelling over the mountains on foot to escape. ""I just simply left. I packed my bag with a shaving kit, a few books of mine, and a laptop."" ""And warm clothes, because I knew I had to smuggle myself out of that train in the mountains. It was very cold, very long, very dark and very scary."" ""I had to leave behind everything I loved, I worked for, all my human connections. It was so sad and scary. If I got arrested, I would have been back before the judge, and God knows what other scenarios that would be. ""It was a very hard and difficult decision. It was emotionally difficult. It was physically, mentally difficult. It was a move a made against my will. They pushed me out. And that was just so sad."" Last September Mr Ahmady was accused of sexual misconduct towards female colleagues. The allegations were anonymous, and emerged shortly before his court hearing. But the Iranian Sociological Association revoked his membership. Mr Ahmady denied both the allegations and the suggestion they played a role in his decision to leave. Mr Ahmady said: ""I find these allegations very upsetting. As I said at the time I take full responsibility for my actions and I find the sociological association's decision rushed and unfair. I do not accept any of these allegations. They are not related to the charges brought against me by the court which led me to escape, to restart my life in safety with my family."" Mr Ahmady now faces an uncertain future in Britain, without a job. ""I had to do what I needed to do. I couldn't stay and spend 10 years [in prison]. I can be much more useful outside and I have a responsibility towards my family."" The question now is how Tehran might respond and what impact may be felt by other British-Iranian dual nationals.

'A ticket back to normal',"I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately. Being totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket. I've had an auto-immune disease since the age of ten and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life. But one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up. I'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety. So when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed. I immediately texted my parents, my sister and my friends - it felt like the biggest thing that had happened to me in a long time. As I walked to the vaccine centre on Saturday morning (in my new trainers and a full face of make-up, because why not?), I allowed myself to dream. I thought about all the things I used to take for granted, but now miss so much. Spontaneously planning a night out three hours in advance. The excitement you get before going to a gig. The countdown and frantic packing days before a holiday. Not that we can do any of that just yet - but still, it's good to dream. A paramedic gave me the jab and handed me a card with my batch number on, which now felt like the most precious thing I owned. It was my ticket to a return to normal life. El has been shielding since last year I called some fellow twentysomethings who've also had to shield and have got the jab. El Afzal is a 24-year-old from Manchester, whose severe asthma and skin condition have meant she's also had to shield. ""Everyone's struggled with lockdown but when you're clinically vulnerable there's a different stress level,"" she says. ""I was getting all the texts and letters from the government telling me I was more likely to get severe Covid and that's been really hard in terms of anxiety."" El found it very tough seeing her friends going out - even in a limited, socially-distanced way. ""It feels like a big kick in the face when you're sat at home and you can't even go to the shop."" She says her experience of trying to get the vaccine was tough at first because her health conditions meant she couldn't receive the Pfizer jab. ""I've had the Oxford one now and I'm really grateful that I've been able to have it at this point and at least get my first jab. ""There's a sense of relief and I can sleep through the night and actually know I've done everything that I possibly can to ensure I'm as safe as possible,"" she says. Georgie has a genetic condition which means she has to shield ""I remember sitting down with my family eating lunch and my mum looked at her phone and she'd got the text - I had my phone charging in the other room and I went to grab it. ""It was incredible to see that message - I was absolutely buzzing."" Georgie Hodges is a 20-year-old student from London who has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to a genetic condition. She says lockdown's had a really bad impact on her education and social life. ""My attention span has completely dropped in the last year and I can't sit down and focus - I also have joint pain and mobility issues,"" she says. Georgie, along with her key worker parents, has received the first dose of the vaccine  but doesn't expect her life to suddenly change, even when restrictions are relaxed. ""I won't be going out as normal until I get the second part but I'm actually quite overwhelmed with what to do,"" she says. ""I find going out for a walk quite overwhelming at the moment, so as much as I'd love to say I'll be going out with my friends, I don't know what I'll do."" But Georgie says she ""can't put into words"" how it feels to know that she's on her way back to a normal life. ""It's finally light at the end of the tunnel.""

The city of San Antonio in Texas has been administering at-home Covid vaccinations to its homebound seniors. But now it's facing a problem: people are calling in to the 911 emergency hotline, to try to schedule their own at-home jab. ""It's clogging our 911 system,"" says Joe Arrington, a public information officer for the fire department, reminding people the number should only be used for emergencies. The city is currently only making appointments for seniors it has reached through the public housing authorities and a meal delivery program, but hopes to have more at-home vaccine slots open in the future. Texas was the first US state to top one million vaccines administered, but it has been accused of having a haphazard rollout that lacks coordination with the federal government. On Tuesday, a 16-lane drive-through mega-site launched on the Texas Motor Speedway, in the city of Fort Worth, one of the largest vaccine hubs in the nation. An education recovery commissioner has been appointed by the government to oversee a catch-up programme for children who have lost out on learning because of schools being closed during the pandemic. Sir Kevan Collins will report directly to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Prime Minister

Boris Johnson. Downing Street says his new role  will involving working with government to deliver measures to help children who have missed out on face-to-face learning, including addressing factors such as curriculum content and quantity of teaching time in the coming months. It added that education and the reopening of schools remains the ""top priority"", and the government is committing Â£300m to help children catch up on their education, on top of the Â£1bn announced last June as part of the Covid catch-up fund. Sir Kevan has worked in the education sector for over 30 years as a teacher, a director of childrenâs services and most recently as chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a lot to be hopeful for. Vaccine roll-out is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths. The peak, as Prof Chris Whitty suggests, has been passed. Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, itâs from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more in hospital now than there was at the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February, when all the over-70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be tread until the over-50s are protected. As we have reported, around 80,000 urgent coronavirustests are being carried out in parts of England afterprevious random checks found at least one case of the South African variant that could not be linked to international travel. Now volunteers delivering these door-to-door tests say they have encountered ""almost no negativity"" from the public. Kent Search and Rescue's Stewart Baird, who is helping to organise a team of about 100 volunteers, firefighters and police officers in the ME15 postcode area, said about 95% of residents had accepted a test kit when offered. Swabs were delivered to 2,697 people in Maidstone on Tuesday, with at least 2,050 already returned completed. ""For those that are in, over 95% are asking for testing kits,"" he said. ""Almost everyone is asking for the testing kits and handing them back an hour or two later."" Read more here The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been a key component of the UK's inoculation programme The Belgian government says AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should only be given to people aged under 55. It is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EUâs drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden have already recommended it be limited to under-65s. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks. UK health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages, whileresearch has shown it is highly effective. AstraZeneca has been embroiled in political controversy, however. The European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.

Joseph Flavill is still recovering in hospital after being hit by a car last March - shortly before the first lockdown. His family say the 19-year-old's condition is slowly improving. His aunt, Sally Flavill Smith, told BBC News that it was something âweâve been hoping for every day during lockdown.â She says when the family chat to Joseph - who is not allowed any visitors - they try to explain about the pandemic and why he can only see his loved ones via a screen.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds stood outside 10 Downing Street to salute Capt Tom. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent So good news. Ten million have
had a dose of the vaccine. And, importantly, England's chief medical officer says
we're past the peak of this wave, or at least we should be if infection rates
donât start climbing again. Both are significant. Theyâre also the reason why
Boris Johnson was starting to come under pressure, with questions like why
canât those who have had the vaccine start to mix with each other at least? Could schools go back earlier in England? Itâs clearly still too early for the
government to be able to signal to people that they can begin to relax. The
numbers of people infected with Covid-19 around the country, at one in 55, are
still very high. The prime minister would only say that he will set out, on 22 February ""the timetable, the earliest dates we can do things"". And he indicated he was still thinking about loosening the current restrictions
in stages. ""It feels to us that we will be going down the tiers nationally,"" said Johnson. Expect many arguments to come about when any loosening should
happen, how soon should schools reopen, and whether some areas will move faster
than others. The extraordinary fundraising of Captain Sir Tom Moore was well documented last year. Capt Sir Tom raised Â£32.8m (Â£39.3m including Gift Aid) in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together, by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. Hospital staff treating the sickest patients have beenunder intense pressure in recent months, and a recent study suggested manyhad been left traumatised by their experience during the first wavelast spring. While things such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical apparatus are funded by taxpayers, the focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Back in May, the BBC's Hazel Shearing spoke to NHS staff about how the money was helping. Some of the donations went towards food and care packs for staff in Durham and a revamped wellbeing space for workers in Scotland to relax in during their breaks. You can read morehere. A clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore is now under way. The 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just finished leading today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Here's a quick roundup of what we learned: As we have been reporting, the public has been encouraged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take part in a clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore shortly, at 18:00 GMT. The 100-year-old, whoraised almost Â£33m for NHS charitiesby walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Johnson said the clap would also be for ""all those health workers for whom he raised money"". Capt Sir Tom's family said they were ""incredibly touched"". Read our story here Â© 2025 BBC.

Study showing vaccine slows virus spread 'superb',"It is the first time a study has shown a vaccine can reduce the spread of Covid-19 Results that show the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus have been hailed as ""absolutely superb"" by the health secretary. Matt Hancock said the study shows ""vaccines are the way out of this pandemic"". It is the first time a vaccine has been shown to reduce transmission of the virus. The UK has given a first Covid jab to more than 10 million people so far. The results of the study, which hasnot yet been formally published,external, suggest that the vaccine may have a ""substantial"" effect on transmission of the virus. It means the jab could have a greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who is vaccinated will indirectly protect other people too. Mr Hancock called the study ""really encouraging"" on Twitter, adding that the results were ""absolutely superb"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said this latest analysis showing the vaccine reduces transmission would ""help us all get out of this pandemic"". Mr Hancock said passing the 10 million mark for people who have received a first dose was a ""hugely significant milestone"",tweeting that ""every jab makes us all a bit safer"",external. How effective is the Oxford vaccine? Oxford vaccine could substantially cut spread How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? When will I get a Covid vaccine? The study by the University of Oxford, where the vaccine was developed, measured the impact on transmission by testing for asymptomatic infections, swabbing participants every week in addition to recording when anyone fell ill with Covid-19. As well as showing an effect on transmission, the study found the vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months. With no fall in protection during the three-month period, the researchers said the results supported gaps between first and second doses of between four and 12 weeks. The effectiveness of the vaccine increased with a longer gap of 12 weeks before the booster jab. When the second dose is given, the study found the level of protection from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rises to 82%. In other developments: One of the world's largest follow-up Covid studies found almost 90% of people who tested positive for Covid hadprotective antibodies against the virussix months after their initial infection The number of people with coronavirus has changed little in the week to 23 January,the Office for National Statistics says,,externalwith virus levels still high in England (one in 55) and level in Scotland (one in 110), Wales (one in 70) and Northern Ireland (one in 50) The UK has set itself apart from many other countries by prioritising giving the first dose to as many people as possible, delaying the second jab for about 12 weeks. The aim is to save more lives by giving some protection to a larger number of people, but the UK has faced criticism from the British Medical Association for following this path with no international support. Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said the results supported the UK's approach to delaying the booster shot. It ""reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine,"" he says. The new analysis of the Oxford vaccine suggests that transmission of the virus from those who have been vaccinated could be substantially reduced. If verified by the scientific review process, it means that as more people get the jab, infection levels could come down faster than they would otherwise and enable the government to lift restrictions sooner than they could otherwise. One in six of the population has had at least one jab so far. There's still a long way to go but the impact on case numbers could begin to be felt in the coming weeks. The fly in the ointment though is the recent emergence in the UK of variants that may be more resistant to some vaccines. Experts believe that jabs will still offer good protection especially against severe illness, but even so this could slow progress. The race is now on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, in order to keep a step ahead of the variants. The government is also trying to slow the spread of variants through enhanced surveillance and testing. But a critical part of the strategy is to drive down infection levels, so people don't catch the virus in the first place, whatever variant it might be. In France, use of the Oxford vaccine has been restricted by health authorities who say it should only be given to people under 65. Mr Hancock, the UK health secretary, said scientists had looked directly at the over-65s and there was ""a high degree of confidence"" that the Oxford vaccine worked on people of all ages. He added that the latest research showed the world the vaccine works - ""it works well"" and ""categorically supports"" the government's strategy. Asked if it could now mean children in England returning to school before 8 March, he pointed out 30,000 people were still in hospital. ""We've got to get this right down,"" he told the Today programme. ""It's too soon to be able to take action in England and we've set out the timescale because we think that's when we should be able to take action, if all goes well."" Alongside the Oxford vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is also being rolled out across the UK. Clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna, which has been approved but is not yet in use, did not look for a potential impact on transmission. However, BBC health correspondent James Gallagher said the different vaccines all target the same part of the virus so if one can cut transmission, there is a good chance the others can too. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The data from this latest trial was drawn before new variants, including the South Africa one, emerged. Asked how protective the Oxford vaccine could be against new mutations, Dr Pollard said he was anticipating ""good protection"" against the Kent variant and would publish details ""very soon"". On other variants, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When we look at the new mutations that have been arising in other countries and now also here in the UK - that is the virus trying to escape from human immunity, and that's whether it's from vaccines or from infection. ""I think that's telling us about what's to come, which is a virus that continues to transmit, but hopefully that will be like other coronaviruses that are around us all the time, which cause colds and mild infections. ""We will have built up enough immunity to prevent the other severe disease that we've been seeing over the last year."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Broadband switches should be less 'hassle' - Ofcom,"Swapping providers needs to be a ""one touch"" process, said Ofcom People who want to swap broadband providers should be able to do so more simply, regulator Ofcom has said. It follows its own research suggesting 40% of people are put off switching because it is considered too complex. Under its proposals, customers would just contact their chosen new provider and the switch would happen automatically. There is currently a mismatch between the number of superfast connections available and those taking them up. Fibre broadband: The cost of delivering in rural areas One in four UK homes can access 1Gbps broadband While 96% of UK homes can now get superfast broadband, offering speeds of at least 30Mbps (megabits per second), Ofcom estimates that only 60% have such services. This means around 11 million homes could upgrade to a faster service. Part of the reason they haven't done so could be down to what Ofcom describes as ""the hassle of having to deal with more than one provider"". Currently, if someone wants to swap providers and both firms use the Openreach network - for instance Sky and TalkTalk - the new company manages the switch. But if someone wishes to switch from a provider using Openreach to Virgin Media or another one like CityFibre or Hyperoptic, they would have to contact both their existing and new firms. There are many providers available and it can sometimes seem confusing Charles Davies, managing director of provider Hyperoptic's ISP division, said: ""These proposals, if introduced, will shift the power to shop around decisively in the customer's favour. ""It will also ensure that all of the investment being made to upgrade the UK's networks to full fibre is supported by properly functioning competition in the market."" In 2019, Ofcom changed the rules around mobile switching, so that customers can now swap operators by simply sending a free text message. Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's networks and communications group director, admitted the broadband landscape can be confusing. ""There are lots of different offers out there from a wide range of broadband and landline providers. ""We want to make it even easier for people to get a better deal or upgrade to a faster, more reliable service. Our proposals today aim to make the process as seamless as possible, for everyone."" Ofcom will consult on the proposals until the end of March, with a decision due in the summer. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at broadband comparison site Uswitch.com, said the proposals could help ""build consumer confidence"". ""Switching broadband can feel like a complicated process and can put some consumers off searching for a better deal, potentially costing them Â£90 a year as they sit out of contract with their existing provider,"" he said. ""Making things easier for consumers will become especially important in the future... so consumers can move to next generation services with minimal fuss."" Where has all the broadband money gone?

Capt Sir Tom 'inspired the best in us all' - PM,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson joins a ""national clap"" to honour NHS charity fundraiser Capt Sir Tom Moore and health workers Sir Tom, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus at the age of 100 on Tuesday Johnson hails the milestone reached by the UK of vaccinating 10 million people - and thanks health workers and vaccination staff England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says the UK has passed the peak of the second wave of coronavirus But Prof Whitty says deaths will remain high ""for quite some time"" but positive tests are starting to come down A vaccine to tackle Covid-19 variants could be ready to deploy by the autumn, the team behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says A further 1,322 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton Today's live page editors have been James Clarke and Sarah Collerton, and the writers have been Ella Wills, Gavin Stamp, Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Joshua Nevett. Rail staff at London Paddington station take part in a national clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now. Thank you for joining us. We'll bring you more live updates from the UK and around the world tomorrow morning. Here's a final round-up of the main headlines as we draw things to a close:  Annabel RackhamBBC Entertainment reporter Annabel Rackham has had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately. Being totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket. I've had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life. But one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up. I'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety. So when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed.

The city of San Antonio in Texas has been administering at-home Covid vaccinations to its homebound seniors. But now it's facing a problem: people are calling in to the 911 emergency hotline, to try to schedule their own at-home jab. ""It's clogging our 911 system,"" says Joe Arrington, a public information officer for the fire department, reminding people the number should only be used for emergencies. The city is currently only making appointments for seniors it has reached through the public housing authorities and a meal delivery program, but hopes to have more at-home vaccine slots open in the future. Texas was the first US state to top one million vaccines administered, but it has been accused of having a haphazard rollout that lacks coordination with the federal government. On Tuesday, a 16-lane drive-through mega-site launched on the Texas Motor Speedway, in the city of Fort Worth, one of the largest vaccine hubs in the nation. An education recovery commissioner has been appointed by the government to oversee a catch-up programme for children who have lost out on learning because of schools being closed during the pandemic. Sir Kevan Collins will report directly to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Prime Minister

Boris Johnson. Downing Street says his new role  will involving working with government to deliver measures to help children who have missed out on face-to-face learning, including addressing factors such as curriculum content and quantity of teaching time in the coming months. It added that education and the reopening of schools remains the ""top priority"", and the government is committing Â£300m to help children catch up on their education, on top of the Â£1bn announced last June as part of the Covid catch-up fund. Sir Kevan has worked in the education sector for over 30 years as a teacher, a director of childrenâs services and most recently as chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a lot to be hopeful for. Vaccine roll-out is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths. The peak, as Prof Chris Whitty suggests, has been passed. Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, itâs from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more in hospital now than there was at the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February, when all the over-70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be tread until the over-50s are protected. As we have reported, around 80,000 urgent coronavirustests are being carried out in parts of England afterprevious random checks found at least one case of the South African variant that could not be linked to international travel. Now volunteers delivering these door-to-door tests say they have encountered ""almost no negativity"" from the public. Kent Search and Rescue's Stewart Baird, who is helping to organise a team of about 100 volunteers, firefighters and police officers in the ME15 postcode area, said about 95% of residents had accepted a test kit when offered. Swabs were delivered to 2,697 people in Maidstone on Tuesday, with at least 2,050 already returned completed. ""For those that are in, over 95% are asking for testing kits,"" he said. ""Almost everyone is asking for the testing kits and handing them back an hour or two later."" Read more here The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been a key component of the UK's inoculation programme The Belgian government says AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should only be given to people aged under 55. It is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EUâs drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden have already recommended it be limited to under-65s. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks. UK health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages, whileresearch has shown it is highly effective. AstraZeneca has been embroiled in political controversy, however. The European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.

Joseph Flavill is still recovering in hospital after being hit by a car last March - shortly before the first lockdown. His family say the 19-year-old's condition is slowly improving. His aunt, Sally Flavill Smith, told BBC News that it was something âweâve been hoping for every day during lockdown.â She says when the family chat to Joseph - who is not allowed any visitors - they try to explain about the pandemic and why he can only see his loved ones via a screen.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds stood outside 10 Downing Street to salute Capt Tom. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent So good news. Ten million have
had a dose of the vaccine. And, importantly, England's chief medical officer says
we're past the peak of this wave, or at least we should be if infection rates
donât start climbing again. Both are significant. Theyâre also the reason why
Boris Johnson was starting to come under pressure, with questions like why
canât those who have had the vaccine start to mix with each other at least? Could schools go back earlier in England? Itâs clearly still too early for the
government to be able to signal to people that they can begin to relax. The
numbers of people infected with Covid-19 around the country, at one in 55, are
still very high. The prime minister would only say that he will set out, on 22 February ""the timetable, the earliest dates we can do things"". And he indicated he was still thinking about loosening the current restrictions
in stages. ""It feels to us that we will be going down the tiers nationally,"" said Johnson. Expect many arguments to come about when any loosening should
happen, how soon should schools reopen, and whether some areas will move faster
than others. The extraordinary fundraising of Captain Sir Tom Moore was well documented last year. Capt Sir Tom raised Â£32.8m (Â£39.3m including Gift Aid) in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together, by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. Hospital staff treating the sickest patients have beenunder intense pressure in recent months, and a recent study suggested manyhad been left traumatised by their experience during the first wavelast spring. While things such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical apparatus are funded by taxpayers, the focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Back in May, the BBC's Hazel Shearing spoke to NHS staff about how the money was helping. Some of the donations went towards food and care packs for staff in Durham and a revamped wellbeing space for workers in Scotland to relax in during their breaks. You can read morehere. A clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore is now under way. The 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just finished leading today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Here's a quick roundup of what we learned: As we have been reporting, the public has been encouraged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take part in a clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore shortly, at 18:00 GMT. The 100-year-old, whoraised almost Â£33m for NHS charitiesby walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday.

'Serious issues' with NI Protocol - Coveney,"This video can not be played ""Be the unionist we need you to be"" - PM is told by DUP's Ian Paisley during PMQs A DUP MP has called on the prime minister to ""be the unionist we need him to be"" in addressing concerns over the Irish Sea border. Ian Paisley told the Commons that the Brexit agreement had betrayed unionists and made them ""feel like foreigners in our own country"". Meanwhile a ""cordial"" meeting between the UK government, EU and NI's first and deputy first ministers has ended. There will be further discussions next week. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". Speaking before that meeting took place, Mr Paisley said ""tea and sympathy would not cut the mustard"" and urged Downing Street to act. Boris Johnson said the government would ""do everything we need to do"". Unionists oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, arguing it damages trade and threatens UK unity. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, hasannounced plans to stop north-south activities related to the NI Protocoluntil action is taken to address what she called a ""growing crisis"" over the Irish Sea border. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said his commitment to the union is 'unshakeable' Responding to Mr Paisley in the Commons, the prime minister insisted he was committed to Northern Ireland and the union. He said the government would act ""legislatively"" or by invoking an emergency mechanism known as Article 16 to override part ofthe protocol,external, if other solutions cannot be reached with the EU to remove GB-NI trade barriers. The UKhas already written the EU,externalasking for agreement to a long extension of grace periods for the Irish Sea border. Currently, supermarkets and other businesses are being allowed to operate with reduced requirements for paperwork and certification when moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The first of those grace periods is due to expire in April,but in a letter to the EU the UK government has asked for an extension until 2023. What are NI's grace periods for Brexit? It has also requested the creation of a common travel area for pets which would reduce the new post-Brexit processes for moving pets across the Irish Sea. UK and EU leaders held talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster spoke to Mr Johnson ahead of the UK-EU meeting, which she took part in along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ. Following the meeting, the first minister said the UK government accepted problems with trade between GB and NI following Brexit were ""more than just teething problems"", however, she added: ""I'm not so sure that's the case in the European Commission."" ""I have to say I was disappointed with some of the statements made by Maros Sefcovic in relation to teething problems [relating] to the rigorous implementation of the protocol because of course that's not going to cut it,"" she said. ""I think everybody knows now that there's fundamental reform and that needs to be dealt with very, very quickly. ""We have some cliff edges coming up on 1 April and we all know that, so therefore we need to work very quickly to deal with these issues."" But Ms O'Neill welcomed the position from the European Commission. The deputy first minister said Mr Å efÄoviÄ had ""put his hands up"" in the meeting over the attempt to introduce Article 16 last Friday. Ms O'Neill said he also asked that the Commission's ""track record"" of political and financial support for peace in Northern Ireland was taken into account. ""I think they [European Commission] came at it with a very constructive and open mind in terms of resolution to some of the outstanding issues however they were also equally very clear that the protocol must be implemented in its entirety,"" she told BBC News NI. ""The EU has been very clear in saying that the protocol is not up for renegotiation - I share that view."" Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ released a joint statement to say they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". The statement said the UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the ""proper implementation"" of the protocol Both ""condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ is also set to travel to London to continue talks. On Monday night, Stormont's Department of Agriculture decided to suspend Brexit checks on animal products at some NI ports after ""threats"" were made against inspection staff. However, a senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents. Simon Coveney said the protocol needed to be improved where possible Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he recognised there were ""serious problems"" with the protocol that needed to be resolved. But he warned it should be improved where possible, rather than scrapped as unionists have demanded. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal Amazon prepares to stop selling some products to NI Brussels might feel battered and bruised over its Article 16 blunder, but is it ready to bend? That is the hope of Michael Gove and Arlene Foster as they attempt to squeeze some concessions from MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ around the NI Protocol. Asking for a two year extension for Protocol exemptions is a big demand from London and won't sit easy with Brussels. But the DUP asking for the Protocol to be binned is a big demand which won't sit easy with London. Removing the Protocol would involve renegotiating a Withdrawal deal which took four years to put together. Boris Johnson last night made clear his ""unshakeable"" commitment to securing Northern Ireland's place in the union, but he also made clear he wants to fix the protocol, not ditch it. What we may get today is an extension of the grace period to allow businesses more time to adjust to the new rules. That will be sold by some as the first victory in a longer battle, but for others it will be as much as the EU should bend. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""highly regrettable that the first minister had chosen to approach the challenges presented by Brexit in a way that will increase instability and heighten tension at a time of immense sensitivity"". The Foyle MP again called for a moderation in language. The NI Protocol was part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreementand guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On Friday evening the EU announced it would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland. Itlater reversed this decision, but unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.

In a statement on Wednesday,India's external affairs ministry,externalsaid parliament had passed ""reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector"" after a full debate and discussion.

India suspended mobile internet services in three areas around the capital, Delhi, where tens of thousands of farmers are camping to protest against the new laws. The government said the shutdown was to ""maintain public safety"". The protest made international headlines last week when atractor rally by farmers ended in violent clashesthat left one protester dead and more than 500 police injured, according to the authorities. Some demonstrators stormed Delhi's historic Red Fort and occupied it until police pushed them back. Farmers' groups and union leaders condemned the violence but said they would not call off the protest. The pop superstar's tweet to her 101 million followers sent her name to the top of social media trends in India. Her post drew a global outpouring of support. Allow Twitter content?

The farmers' protest, now in its third month, presents the biggest challenge Mr Modi has faced. His BJP government has offered to suspend the laws but the farmers want them repealed. The authorities are extremely sensitive to criticism and, on Monday,Twitter restored dozens of Indian accountsthat were earlier blocked after a legal notice by the government, citing objections based on public order. The accounts included those of farmers' leaders, activists and a respected news magazine. Farmers have been camped out around Delhi for weeks The contentious farm laws loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce which have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades. Farmers fear that the new laws will threaten decades-old concessions - such as assured prices - and weaken their bargaining power, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private companies.

LiveLiveBoris Johnson faces weekly question time with MPsLess than a minute ago,"Boris Johnson is answering MPs' weekly question time in the Commons The PM says he will join a national clap in honour of Captain Sir Tom Moore at 18:00 GMT Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clashed on government plans for hotel quarantine for travellers arriving to the UK DUP MP Ian Paisley said people in Northern Ireland had been ""betrayed"" by post-Brexit border rules The prime minister has called for ""urgent action"" from the EU amid rising tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports Northern Ireland leaders will meet Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and EU commissioner Maros Sefcovic later Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he wants to find a way to remember Captain Sir Tom Moore ""properly and appropriately"" A study has found the Oxford-AstraZenenca vaccine may reduce the spread of coronavirus Gavin Stamp, Jennifer Scott and Richard Morris BBC Politics We'll end our coverage here of this week's PMQs. Thanks for following along with us. Today's session was brought to you by Gavin Stamp, Jennifer Scott and Richard Morris, with Johanna Howitt editing. The prime minister will be leading the No 10 press briefing at 17:00 GMT - full coverage will be over on theBBC Coronavirus live page. Hope you can join us there. Reality Check The prime minister and the Labour leader clashed over whether the UKâs borders should be closed, to limit the arrival of new variants of coronavirus identified in other countries, including the South African strain. Sir Keir Starmer said that 21,000 travellers were still coming to the UK every day. The government has yet to publish data for the number of people entering the country in December and January. But on January 21, Paul Lincoln, the director-general of UK Border Force, told MPs that on Monday 18 January, âwe had about 21,000 people coming into the countryâ. Incoming travellers now have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken in the previous 72 hours. Of the 21,000 who arrived that day, 10,000 were asked to show evidence of a negative test result, according to Paul Lincoln. You can read more about the debate over closing UK borders here.

We have just come to the end of another Prime Minister's Questions. But don't worry if you missed it - here are some of the key moments: The PM is asked a couple more similar questions about hotel quarantine and cladding on leasehold properties, and now PMQs is over. We'll bring you a quick round up of the main lines from today's session in our next post.... Conservative Tracey Crouch is up next. She says ""heroic"" doctors, nurses and other NHS workers on the Covid-19 frontline risk long-standing psychological harm from their experiences, akin to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She calls on the PM to ""utilise military understanding of the condition"" and look into the idea of training a team of psychological health professionals and assigning them to help NHS staff. The PM says it is an interesting idea and worthy of consideration, saying NHS staff have been through a ""really difficult time"". As part of the Â£52bn annual investment in the NHS, the PM says the government will make sure staff have access to mental health wellbeing counselling and advice and everything else they need. Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams has raised the issue of delays in mail deliveries in Gwynedd during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. The Arfon MP says delivery of post in his part of Wales has been delayed ""for days and weeks"" because of Covid-19 outbreaks amongst staff - something that has been echoed across the country. He asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""What is this government doing during this health crisis to make sure the once world beating, but now privatised, Royal Mail, is sufficiently robust to fulfil its duty to the public - particularly in rural areas?"" Mr Johnson said: ""The most important thing we can do is continue to rollout the vaccination programme."" He says the government wants to get to key workers such as postal workers vaccinated ""as soon as we can"". The DUP's Ian Paisley says his countrymen and women feel ""betrayed"" by theNorthern Ireland Protocolwhich has made them feel like ""foreigners in their own country"". He says ""tea and sympathy"" won't cut the mustard and urges the PM to urge all instruments at his disposal to help Northern Ireland, suggesting the EU will not lift a finger. ""Be the Unionist we need you to be,"" he pronounces. The PM uses the question as an opportunity to criticise the EU's recent behaviour and says he will not rule out passing legislation or indeed invoking an emergency provision in the protocol - called Article 16 - to ensure that NI businesses have ""unfettered"" access to GB markets. Labour's Julie Elliott says the government has said it is ""immensely proud of care workers"" and it is a ""sentiment we all share"". But she claims the PM has ""passed the buck"" on their low levels of pay, by saying most wages are set by private providers. She asks Mr Johnson: ""Why won't this government commit to ensuring our care workers are paid a wage they can live on?"" The prime minister says the government is ""proud of setting up the national living wage"", and that there were ""record breaking increases"" last year. He says focusing on this is ""the most important thing we can do for care workers and workers across the country"". Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says there are lots of children in her constituency who are ""priced out"" of British citizenship because of a Â£1,012 fee. She says the Home Office makes a 60% profit on these fees, she asks for them to be scrapped for children. Boris Johnson says it is ""fantastic"" that so many people choose the UK as their home and to seek British citizenship. He says he is ""interested"" in the point she's made, but there are ""costs which must be borne by the taxpayer"". Residents picking up sandbags in Tewkesbury. Conservative Laurence Robertson says hundreds of his constituents in Gloucestershire had their Christmas ruined by ""foul water"" seeping into their houses after floods in the area. He urges the PM to create a new body to ensure that new housing developments do not tap into existing drainage systems and place excessive pressure on local drainage capacity. The PM says it is an interesting idea and he will consider it, also praising the efforts of the Environment Agency and noting the Â£5bn in funding being put into flood defences. Reality Check Checks on animal and food products at two Northern Irelands ports have been suspended following concerns over staff safety. The checks, which apply to some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, were first introduced as part of a Brexit agreement called the Northern Ireland Protocol. But what exactly is it? BBC Reality Check's Tom Edgington explains here.  Stephen Farry - MP for the Alliance Party - raises the ongoing issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol. He says we need to be ""open and honest"" about why it exists and ""do all we can to make its implementation as easy as possible"". He asks the PM in his talks with the EU over the protocol in the coming days to make a UK/EU veterinary agreement a ""priority"" to help all food exporters with checks on products. Johnson does not commit to the measure. But he says it is ""very important the protocol should not place unnecessary barriers or barriers of any kind down the Irish Sea"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford pays tribute, too, to Captain Sir Tom Moore. He says it was wrong for Johnson to visit Scotland last week during a pandemic. He said the PM knew that a plant he was visiting had had an outbreak of Covid -19 just 24 hours earlier. He asks when the PM made the decision to go ahead with the visit. Johnson says the rollout of the vaccine across the country is a success, and he is prepared to help with the rollout of the vaccine ""across the whole of the UK"". Blackford says it is an ""absolute shambles"" and the PM ""can't just explain away this absolutely shocking error of judgement"". He says there was a ""serious Covid-19 outbreak at this plant"" but he still continued to visit the area anyway. He accuses the PM of putting ""politics ahead of public health"". He says Johnson is ""the worst possible leader at the worst possible time"". Johnson says that people of Scotland want to see ""the whole country pulling together"" and it is ""amazing to see Scottish scientists"" working on the coronavirus vaccine. He says it is his job to visit all areas of the UK and ""no-one is going to stop me"". Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Keir Starmer pushed the Prime Minister on why, as he put it, ""schools were closed but UK borders were open"". He accused the government of ignoring the advice of government scientists on how to stop the spread of new virus variants - though the PM said they hadnât recommended a complete travel ban. Boris Johnson seems committed to keeping the hotel quarantine requirement confined to âred-listâ countries for now, saying it was ânot practicalâ to close off the country completely. Heâs insisting the requirements currently in place are tough enough â although gave no details about when the new hotel policy will be introduced. Sir Keir raises the case of Hayley, a 27-year old who he says has been forced into bankruptcy, saying promises of financial support have ""come too late for her"". He says leaseholders in unsafe buildings have three ""simple asks"", including an unpfront package of financial support and a deadline next year to rectify all builldings with dangerous cladding. The PM says the government is addressing the problem, with work on remediating 95% of unsafe buildings under way, adding that Â£30m has just been made available to install fire alarms. Johnson then segues into a wide-ranging political attack on his counterpart, suggesting the Labour leader has been told by focus groups that he is ""sitting on the fence"" too much. After a couple of minutes and with the PM in full flow, the Speaker interrupts him, suggesting he can't touch on every subject under the sun and it is time for other MPs to have their say. This video can not be played Cladding crisis: 'I was a first-time buyer at 27, and bankrupt at 28' Twenty-eight-year-old Hayley Tillotson is the first person in the UK believed to have been made bankrupt because of the cladding crisis. She bought her first home in Leeds two years ago but learnt that it was clad with flammable material. Overwhelmed with the extra costs of dealing with the problems, she had to hand back her keys. She spoke to BBC reporter Sarah Corker. Sir Keir says ""whatever the prime minister claims is being done isn't working"". He says there are ""huge numbers of people who are stuck in the middle and living in unsafe homes"", saying they ""can't sell and are being asked to foot the bill"". The Labour leader gives an example of Dr Will Martin who owns a flat in Sheffield, saying he ""spends his days on the frontline fighting Covid-19 and spends his nights worrying about a Â£52,000 bill."" Sir Keir adds: ""He wants to know will he or will he not have to pay that Â£52,000?"" Mr Johnson says the government is ""determined no leaseholders should have to pay unaffordable costs"" for something that isn't their fault. He says they have set up a Â£1bn building safety fund for people in Dr Martin's position, which has already processed over 3,00 claims, and he hopes his case ""can be addressed in forthcoming package"". Sir Keir attacks what he says is a ""pre-prepared gag"" from the PM about the European Medicines Agency, saying if the UK's border controls were working why are the new variants in the UK and posing biggest threat to the vaccination programme. The Labour leader turns to another issue, asking the PM why more than three years after the Grenfell tragedy thousands of people are living in properties withunsafe cladding and facing extortionate costs to repair them. The PM says he has every sympathy for leaseholders and promises the government will come forward with a comprehensive package of support. Sir Keir says it is now 3 February and the UK has ""new variants in the country, our schools are shut and borders are open"". He says there will need to be exceptions for freight, but with 21,000 people coming into the country every day, more must be done than just direct flights from select countries having to face new quarantine rules. ""Why does the prime minister think variants will behave differently and only arrive by direct flights?"" Mr Johnson says the Labour leader ""can't have it both ways, keeping open for freight and business... whilst calling for tougher quarantine measures"". He says the government imposed new rules ""when it became aware of the new variant"" from South Africa, and the UK would ""still be at the starting blocks"" if Sir Keir was in charge.  Â© 2025 BBC.

PM urges EU action to ease Brexit tensions in NI,"Brexit-related checks on products from Great Britain were suspended after threats against port staff Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for ""urgent action"" from the EU amid rising tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports. UK and EU leaders are to hold talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Checks on goods were suspended on Tuesday after threats to staff. The UK government wrote to the European Commission overnight, calling for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. But Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, issued a warning against ""just kicking things down the road"", telling BBC Radio Ulster: ""We need to find solutions that are sustainable, that are workable and long lasting."" On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the EU had ""undermined"" the Brexit deal by threatening emergency controls of Covid vaccine exports across the Irish border. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the threat had been a ""mistake that shouldn't have happened"". But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a separate issue to address over trade rules, and it was Brexit ""causing all of this tension"" - not the measures being put in place. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP vows to send 'strong message' over NI Protocol EU condemns 'threats' against NI Brexit port staff PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who will be representing the UK government in talks with the EU Commission's Maros Sefcovic and Northern Ireland's devolved administration, said a three-month grace period with lighter enforcement of EU rules should be extended beyond March. The UK government wrote to the European Commission on Tuesday night to outline the changes it wanted made, which would continue temporary exemptions for supermarket goods, pharmaceuticals, chilled meats and parcels crossing from GB to Northern Ireland. According to a copy of a letter seen by the BBC, the UK would want these exemptions to stay in place until 1 January 2023. It comes after hauliers experienced problems transporting goods from Great Britain. Some parcel deliveries were stopped and supermarkets struggled to restock some products last month, although some of these problems have since been resolved. ""Trust has been eroded, damage has been done and urgent action is therefore needed,"" Mr Gove told the House of Commons on Tuesday, adding that supermarkets and other businesses needed to be sure they could continue to supply consumers. Mr Gove has also asked the EU to examine its decision to ban the import into Northern Ireland of some items like seed potatoes, and the UK wants the Irish government to be able to negotiate a deal with the UK to remove barriers to pets being taken across the Irish Sea. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic tweeted that the protocol was ""a cornerstone"" of the agreement between the UK and EU, and ""the only way to protect Good Friday Agreement"". What happens to parcels or dogs moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland might sound like small issues. But they are huge, because they threaten to break one of the things that was part of the promise in the post-Brexit protocol - that what happened would not disrupt the daily lives of people living in Northern Ireland. And, as we have seen in the past few days, this combination of all of these small changes could destabilise the very sensitive balance in Northern Ireland between the two different communities. The government has no intention of ditching this protocol. That is not going to happen, even though the past few days have given the DUP and some Eurosceptics reason to call again for it to be abandoned. But the government is really clear that they want to very quickly persuade the EU, as one minister put it to me, to start being pragmatic about this, rather than being purist. When the Brexit transition period ended in January, Northern Ireland remained in the EU single market while the rest of the UK left, meaning that checks had to be carried out on goods arriving from Great Britain. Unionists have criticised these rules, known as the Northern Ireland protocol, as damaging to trade and posing a risk to UK unity. In recent days, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas, referring to staff carrying out checks on goods at ports as ""targets"". Stormont suspended physical checks on food consignments at two ports on Tuesday amid the security concerns, although police said paramilitary groups are not involved. Mr Johnson said on Twitter that his commitment to people of Northern Ireland and the union was ""unshakeable"". He called for ""urgent action from the EU to resolve outstanding problems"" with the way the protocol was implemented, to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and ensure ""Northern Ireland benefits from Brexit just like every other part of our United Kingdom"". Recent moves by the EU had ""undermined the protocol and understandably provoked concern"", he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ireland's Mr Coveney said ""elements of protocol are causing problems"" and the two sides ""need to focus on improving"" it, but he said Brexit was to blame for growing tensions in Northern Ireland, rather than the protocol itself. He told Today: ""Senior political figures need to talk seriously now about trying to diffuse tension which is clearly there and need to talk about how we can make protocol work effectively. ""[The protocol] is an Irish and British and EU negotiated solution, an agreed solution to try to limit the disruptive impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""What is causing all of this tension is Brexit, not the protocol. The protocol is an attempt to try and reduce tension and solve problems linked to Brexit."" Amid a dispute with manufacturers over supplies, the EU on Friday briefly threatened to use an emergency measure to override part of the deal and restrict the export of vaccines. It was concerned that Northern Ireland could be used as a way to bypass export controls, using its place in the single market as a backdoor to the rest of the UK. The dispute has intensified pressure among some unionist politicians to end the checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with the DUP saying it intends to work with other unionist parties to send a message thatNorthern Ireland must be ""freed from the protocol"". Ms Foster, the party's leader, is due to meet Mr Johnson on Wednesday morning, to discuss her concerns before attending the talks with the EU Commission in the afternoon. Also at the talks will be Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, who said the DUP was  ""whipping up hysteria"" while others were ""calling for calm and resolution"". Mr Coveney said the move by the Commission on Friday had been ""a mistake"", adding: ""It should not have happened and would not have happened if there had been the appropriate consultation."" Part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. It was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. However, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but laterreversed the decision. Unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

British man facing jail flees Iran over mountainsKameel Ahmady escaped while appealing against a sentence for collaborating with a hostile country.Middle East,"This video can not be played Kameel Ahmady travelled high over the mountains on foot to escape Iran's Revolutionary Guards A British-Iranian academic facing nine years in jail in Iran has told the BBC how he escaped on foot over mountains to start a new life in the UK. Kameel Ahmady was convicted two months ago of collaborating with a hostile government. He denies the charge. He decided to try to flee while on bail and appealing against the sentence. Mr Ahmady trekked over a mountainous border to escape the Revolutionary Guards - a journey he described as ""very long, very dark and very scary"". Iran court 'jails British FGM researcher' 'Grave concern' over Zaghari-Ratcliffe court case Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Mr Ahmady was born of Kurdish stock in western Iran. But his parents sent him to Britain when he was 18 for his education. He remained there many years, studying at the University of Kent and the London School of Economics. Such was his affection for Britain that he applied for British citizenship before returning to Iran as an anthropologist. His research focuses on child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) in Iran. This brought him to the attention of the authorities because he campaigned to raise the age at which girls can marry, which is currently set at 13 years old. Kameel Ahmady travelled high over the mountains on foot to escape Iran's Revolutionary Guards One morning in August 2019, a man came to his door in Tehran saying he was a postman. Mr Ahmady opened the door and 16 Revolutionary Guards stormed in. He was arrested and taken to the notorious Evin prison. Mr Ahmady said he had been targeted not just because he was a dual national, but also because Iran wanted to retaliate after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar that was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. ""Being a dual national, you are always a potential case,"" he told the BBC. ""My chief interrogator said, 'You're very delicious,' a) because I was Kurdish; b) I was coming from a Sunni religious background as opposed with the majority of the Shia in Iran; and c) I was a researcher who was digging up sensitive issues. And I wasn't only a simple researcher, I was actually acting on my research and using it for awareness raising."" Kameel Ahmady decided to flee Tehran while out on bail and appealing against his sentence He spent three months at Evin prison where, he said, his interrogators played mind games with him. ""They treated me, on a human level, well. But don't underestimate the concept and the seriousness of so-called 'white torture' - the psychological pressure they put on you. And all these games are played stage by stage, and they're very well trained as to how to put a little bit of extra pressure on you when it's needed."" ""There are all sorts of mind games, it's almost like a trade. You give me this, I'll give you that - a minute of a phone call needs all sorts of negotiation with your interrogators. Five minutes more extra fresh air than the half an hour that you're entitled to. And it is becoming really sad and petty because you want to be interrogated even more, not going back to the cell, which is almost like a grave."" After three months he was released ahead of the trial but monitored closely. This video can not be played (August 2020): The other detainees held 'hostage' in Iran Last December, Mr Ahmady was convicted of collaborating with a hostile government, something he denies, after prosecutors claimed that a charity he had once done some work for had once received some funding from the United States. He also faced various other charges, including promoting homosexuality in his research. He was sentenced to more than nine years in jail and given a fine of more than Â£500,000 ($683,000).But while out on bail, he decided to flee Iran,external. He said: ""The appeal was overturned. That was the moment that I decided to escape because I couldn't see myself staying in prison for 10 years and watching my son from a distance growing up. By the time I would have been released - if I was released - my son would have been 15."" So, without telling anyone but his immediate family, Mr Ahmady fled in secret, travelling over the mountains on foot to escape. ""I just simply left. I packed my bag with a shaving kit, a few books of mine, and a laptop."" ""And warm clothes, because I knew I had to smuggle myself out of that train in the mountains. It was very cold, very long, very dark and very scary."" ""I had to leave behind everything I loved, I worked for, all my human connections. It was so sad and scary. If I got arrested, I would have been back before the judge, and God knows what other scenarios that would be. ""It was a very hard and difficult decision. It was emotionally difficult. It was physically, mentally difficult. It was a move a made against my will. They pushed me out. And that was just so sad."" Last September Mr Ahmady was accused of sexual misconduct towards female colleagues. The allegations were anonymous, and emerged shortly before his court hearing. But the Iranian Sociological Association revoked his membership. Mr Ahmady denied both the allegations and the suggestion they played a role in his decision to leave. Mr Ahmady said: ""I find these allegations very upsetting. As I said at the time I take full responsibility for my actions and I find the sociological association's decision rushed and unfair. I do not accept any of these allegations. They are not related to the charges brought against me by the court which led me to escape, to restart my life in safety with my family."" Mr Ahmady now faces an uncertain future in Britain, without a job. ""I had to do what I needed to do. I couldn't stay and spend 10 years [in prison]. I can be much more useful outside and I have a responsibility towards my family."" The question now is how Tehran might respond and what impact may be felt by other British-Iranian dual nationals.

UK must 'mark the memory' of Capt Sir Tom,"Capt Sir Tom won the nation's hearts with his fundraising walk which took in 100 laps of his garden in Marston Moretaine near Bedford The memory of Captain Sir Tom Moore is to be marked ""properly and appropriately"", the government said. The 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden,died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospitalon Tuesday. Health secretary Matt Hancock said he had ""touched the hearts of the nation and we should remember that"". Meanwhile, dozens of tributes have been left outside the veteran's home in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire. Wembley Stadium said it was joining the nation ""in remembering and celebrating the life and achievements"" of Capt Sir Tom Moore When announcing his death via a family statement, his daughters Hannah Ingram-Moore and Lucy Teixeira said they ""shared laughter and tears"" with their father in their final few hours together. They said his final year of fundraising had been ""nothing short of remarkable"". He tested positive for Covid-19 last week. His family said due to other medication he was receiving for pneumonia, he was unable to be vaccinated. Mr Hancock said Capt Sir Tom had been ""a symbol of people's resilience during an incredibly difficult year"". ""When the NHS was under pressure during the first lockdown - he didn't just sit at home, he asked the question 'what can I do to help?',"" he said. ""We should find a way to make sure we mark the memory of Captain Tom and thank him for the contribution he made to the NHS. ""I will ensure that we mark his contribution properly and appropriately at the right moment. ""I think everybody would welcome that... he touched the hearts of the nation and we should remember that."" The Speaker of the House Sir Lindsay Hoyle led the minute's silence tribute to Captain Sir Tom Moore There was a one-minute silence in the House of Commons in honour of Capt Sir Tom, and all victims of the pandemic, ahead of Prime Minister's Questions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced there would be anational clapfor Capt Sir Tom and ""all those health workers for whom he raised money"" at 18:00 GMT. Asked by a newspaper journalist later if he supported calls for a statue of Captain Sir Tom, the prime minister said the idea was ""an excellent one"". ""We will be working with his family to see what they think is most appropriate,"" he added. The Army veteranwon the nation's heartsby walking 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden last spring during the first coronavirus lockdown, raising money for NHS Charities Together.

Thanks for following along with us. Today's session was brought to you by Gavin Stamp, Jennifer Scott and Richard Morris, with Johanna Howitt editing. The prime minister will be leading the No 10 press briefing at 17:00 GMT - full coverage will be over on theBBC Coronavirus live page. Hope you can join us there. Reality Check The prime minister and the Labour leader clashed over whether the UKâs borders should be closed, to limit the arrival of new variants of coronavirus identified in other countries, including the South African strain. Sir Keir Starmer said that 21,000 travellers were still coming to the UK every day. The government has yet to publish data for the number of people entering the country in December and January. But on January 21, Paul Lincoln, the director-general of UK Border Force, told MPs that on Monday 18 January, âwe had about 21,000 people coming into the countryâ. Incoming travellers now have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken in the previous 72 hours. Of the 21,000 who arrived that day, 10,000 were asked to show evidence of a negative test result, according to Paul Lincoln. You can read more about the debate over closing UK borders here.

We have just come to the end of another Prime Minister's Questions. But don't worry if you missed it - here are some of the key moments: The PM is asked a couple more similar questions about hotel quarantine and cladding on leasehold properties, and now PMQs is over. We'll bring you a quick round up of the main lines from today's session in our next post.... Conservative Tracey Crouch is up next. She says ""heroic"" doctors, nurses and other NHS workers on the Covid-19 frontline risk long-standing psychological harm from their experiences, akin to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She calls on the PM to ""utilise military understanding of the condition"" and look into the idea of training a team of psychological health professionals and assigning them to help NHS staff. The PM says it is an interesting idea and worthy of consideration, saying NHS staff have been through a ""really difficult time"". As part of the Â£52bn annual investment in the NHS, the PM says the government will make sure staff have access to mental health wellbeing counselling and advice and everything else they need. Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams has raised the issue of delays in mail deliveries in Gwynedd during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. The Arfon MP says delivery of post in his part of Wales has been delayed ""for days and weeks"" because of Covid-19 outbreaks amongst staff - something that has been echoed across the country. He asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""What is this government doing during this health crisis to make sure the once world beating, but now privatised, Royal Mail, is sufficiently robust to fulfil its duty to the public - particularly in rural areas?"" Mr Johnson said: ""The most important thing we can do is continue to rollout the vaccination programme."" He says the government wants to get to key workers such as postal workers vaccinated ""as soon as we can"". The DUP's Ian Paisley says his countrymen and women feel ""betrayed"" by theNorthern Ireland Protocolwhich has made them feel like ""foreigners in their own country"". He says ""tea and sympathy"" won't cut the mustard and urges the PM to urge all instruments at his disposal to help Northern Ireland, suggesting the EU will not lift a finger. ""Be the Unionist we need you to be,"" he pronounces. The PM uses the question as an opportunity to criticise the EU's recent behaviour and says he will not rule out passing legislation or indeed invoking an emergency provision in the protocol - called Article 16 - to ensure that NI businesses have ""unfettered"" access to GB markets. Labour's Julie Elliott says the government has said it is ""immensely proud of care workers"" and it is a ""sentiment we all share"". But she claims the PM has ""passed the buck"" on their low levels of pay, by saying most wages are set by private providers. She asks Mr Johnson: ""Why won't this government commit to ensuring our care workers are paid a wage they can live on?"" The prime minister says the government is ""proud of setting up the national living wage"", and that there were ""record breaking increases"" last year. He says focusing on this is ""the most important thing we can do for care workers and workers across the country"". Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says there are lots of children in her constituency who are ""priced out"" of British citizenship because of a Â£1,012 fee. She says the Home Office makes a 60% profit on these fees, she asks for them to be scrapped for children. Boris Johnson says it is ""fantastic"" that so many people choose the UK as their home and to seek British citizenship. He says he is ""interested"" in the point she's made, but there are ""costs which must be borne by the taxpayer"". Residents picking up sandbags in Tewkesbury. Conservative Laurence Robertson says hundreds of his constituents in Gloucestershire had their Christmas ruined by ""foul water"" seeping into their houses after floods in the area. He urges the PM to create a new body to ensure that new housing developments do not tap into existing drainage systems and place excessive pressure on local drainage capacity. The PM says it is an interesting idea and he will consider it, also praising the efforts of the Environment Agency and noting the Â£5bn in funding being put into flood defences. Reality Check Checks on animal and food products at two Northern Irelands ports have been suspended following concerns over staff safety. The checks, which apply to some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, were first introduced as part of a Brexit agreement called the Northern Ireland Protocol. But what exactly is it? BBC Reality Check's Tom Edgington explains here.  Stephen Farry - MP for the Alliance Party - raises the ongoing issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol. He says we need to be ""open and honest"" about why it exists and ""do all we can to make its implementation as easy as possible"". He asks the PM in his talks with the EU over the protocol in the coming days to make a UK/EU veterinary agreement a ""priority"" to help all food exporters with checks on products. Johnson does not commit to the measure. But he says it is ""very important the protocol should not place unnecessary barriers or barriers of any kind down the Irish Sea"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford pays tribute, too, to Captain Sir Tom Moore. He says it was wrong for Johnson to visit Scotland last week during a pandemic. He said the PM knew that a plant he was visiting had had an outbreak of Covid -19 just 24 hours earlier. He asks when the PM made the decision to go ahead with the visit. Johnson says the rollout of the vaccine across the country is a success, and he is prepared to help with the rollout of the vaccine ""across the whole of the UK"". Blackford says it is an ""absolute shambles"" and the PM ""can't just explain away this absolutely shocking error of judgement"". He says there was a ""serious Covid-19 outbreak at this plant"" but he still continued to visit the area anyway. He accuses the PM of putting ""politics ahead of public health"". He says Johnson is ""the worst possible leader at the worst possible time"". Johnson says that people of Scotland want to see ""the whole country pulling together"" and it is ""amazing to see Scottish scientists"" working on the coronavirus vaccine. He says it is his job to visit all areas of the UK and ""no-one is going to stop me"". Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Keir Starmer pushed the Prime Minister on why, as he put it, ""schools were closed but UK borders were open"". He accused the government of ignoring the advice of government scientists on how to stop the spread of new virus variants - though the PM said they hadnât recommended a complete travel ban. Boris Johnson seems committed to keeping the hotel quarantine requirement confined to âred-listâ countries for now, saying it was ânot practicalâ to close off the country completely. Heâs insisting the requirements currently in place are tough enough â although gave no details about when the new hotel policy will be introduced. Sir Keir raises the case of Hayley, a 27-year old who he says has been forced into bankruptcy, saying promises of financial support have ""come too late for her"". He says leaseholders in unsafe buildings have three ""simple asks"", including an unpfront package of financial support and a deadline next year to rectify all builldings with dangerous cladding. The PM says the government is addressing the problem, with work on remediating 95% of unsafe buildings under way, adding that Â£30m has just been made available to install fire alarms. Johnson then segues into a wide-ranging political attack on his counterpart, suggesting the Labour leader has been told by focus groups that he is ""sitting on the fence"" too much. After a couple of minutes and with the PM in full flow, the Speaker interrupts him, suggesting he can't touch on every subject under the sun and it is time for other MPs to have their say. This video can not be played Cladding crisis: 'I was a first-time buyer at 27, and bankrupt at 28' Twenty-eight-year-old Hayley Tillotson is the first person in the UK believed to have been made bankrupt because of the cladding crisis. She bought her first home in Leeds two years ago but learnt that it was clad with flammable material. Overwhelmed with the extra costs of dealing with the problems, she had to hand back her keys. She spoke to BBC reporter Sarah Corker. Sir Keir says ""whatever the prime minister claims is being done isn't working"". He says there are ""huge numbers of people who are stuck in the middle and living in unsafe homes"", saying they ""can't sell and are being asked to foot the bill"". The Labour leader gives an example of Dr Will Martin who owns a flat in Sheffield, saying he ""spends his days on the frontline fighting Covid-19 and spends his nights worrying about a Â£52,000 bill."" Sir Keir adds: ""He wants to know will he or will he not have to pay that Â£52,000?"" Mr Johnson says the government is ""determined no leaseholders should have to pay unaffordable costs"" for something that isn't their fault. He says they have set up a Â£1bn building safety fund for people in Dr Martin's position, which has already processed over 3,00 claims, and he hopes his case ""can be addressed in forthcoming package"". Sir Keir attacks what he says is a ""pre-prepared gag"" from the PM about the European Medicines Agency, saying if the UK's border controls were working why are the new variants in the UK and posing biggest threat to the vaccination programme. The Labour leader turns to another issue, asking the PM why more than three years after the Grenfell tragedy thousands of people are living in properties withunsafe cladding and facing extortionate costs to repair them. The PM says he has every sympathy for leaseholders and promises the government will come forward with a comprehensive package of support. Sir Keir says it is now 3 February and the UK has ""new variants in the country, our schools are shut and borders are open"". He says there will need to be exceptions for freight, but with 21,000 people coming into the country every day, more must be done than just direct flights from select countries having to face new quarantine rules. ""Why does the prime minister think variants will behave differently and only arrive by direct flights?"" Mr Johnson says the Labour leader ""can't have it both ways, keeping open for freight and business... whilst calling for tougher quarantine measures"". He says the government imposed new rules ""when it became aware of the new variant"" from South Africa, and the UK would ""still be at the starting blocks"" if Sir Keir was in charge.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Bebo chief reveals how he aims to take on Facebook,"This video can not be played WATCH: Michael Birch said the ""temptation was too great"" not to relaunch Bebo Bebo's co-founder plans to relaunch the social network with a focus on profiles and ""real-time"" interactions between friends rather than the news feeds at the core of Twitter and Facebook. Michael Birch says his aim is to provide a ""refreshing break"" from the misinformation spread elsewhere. In an exclusive interview, he told the BBC he was coding the effort himself. And while he has high hopes, he acknowledges the odds are stacked against him. Bebo - an acronym for ""blog early, blog often"" - was once the most popular network in the UK, as well as being big in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. At its peak it had more than 40 million members. In, 2008 Mr Birch and his wife Xochi sold the site to AOL for $850m (Â£623m). They later bought it back for $1m and tried to revamp it in several ways, most recently as an e-sports streaming service, before finally selling the business on to Amazon's Twitch in 2019 for $25m. Bebo and its competitor MySpace were once the dominant social networks However, the couple retained the rights to the brand. And with time on his hands during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Birch began thinking about what kind of gap there might be in the market. ""We're calling it live social networking - when you're logged into Bebo, you are aware of which other friends are online,"" he says, explaining his plan from his home in the British Virgin Islands. ""You can interact with them in real-time. You can comment on their photo on their profile. They'll get notified, they'll come to the photo, and they may even have a conversation under the photo. ""It's an experiment, we'll see how it how it actually does. But we think it's a more exciting way of actually connecting."" Even before he had announced plans for a relaunch, Mr Birch said Bebo's web address was attracting about one visit every three seconds despite the service being offline. He hopes a mix of nostalgia and curiosity will attract enough early adopters to let people find friends on the regenerated site to interact with. However, some of those familiar with the original Bebo are sceptical about its prospects. ""It's probably brave to launch a new social network in this climate when there are concerns about potential harms from misinformation spread on social media, so I hope Bebo will take its responsibilities to look after its members and their data seriously,"" says Kate Bevan, computing editor at Which?. ""But there's also something delightfully optimistic about this plan."" Mr Birch is not yet willing to share screenshots of the new Bebo, and for now its only online presence is a ""coming soon"" page advising prospective users that they will not be able to access their old accounts, and a promise that Donald Trump will be banned. Bebo's relaunch plan trended on Twitter after Mr Birch posted this noticed to its website But the entrepreneur says he is spending about 100 hours a week coding the platform, and plans to let the first invite-only members start trying it out before the month's end. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: How will Bebo distinguish itself? Now is a good time to launch another social network. Covid has had a lot of detrimental effects, but I think it sort of opened people's eyes to new things in new ways. And people are craving interaction. We're going to do some nods to the past, but you're not going to log in and see the original Bebo as it was. But what we want to do is go back a little bit to this idea of a profile. That you have an identity you sort of take pride in. That you can visit a profile and see things that aren't just the latest news articles being shared. On Facebook, if someone posts something to their news feed, they may have done it one minute ago - but you don't feel you're online, in this experience with that person. And that's what we're trying to achieve. In its heyday, Bebo was the UK's biggest social network. Are you aiming for that kind of scale again? At the moment, I'm the only one coding it. This started as a fun lockdown project to give me something to do. It certainly didn't start out as can it become as big as we used to be. But you know, in the back of my mind is that a possibility? Of course it is. And it's a fun thing to contemplate. Do I realistically think that's going to happen? No, I don't. But it is more fun trying a thing sometimes than necessarily achieving it. Mr Birch says he is coding 100 hours a week to get Bebo ready Social media is in a very different place than when Bebo was first about. There's been privacy and hate speech scandals. There's lots of talk of regulation. If this takes off, do you really want to have to deal with those kinds of headaches? That does not look like fun. Do I want to do that part of it? No. But do I have to do that part of it? Yes. When we first did Bebo, I spent 95% of my media time talking to journalists about privacy and bullying. And those issues are still obviously as relevant today. But I think one of the most damaging things has been the spread of misinformation and people sharing things similar to what their friends believe, which self-reinforces and doesn't allow for different perspectives to be put in front of people. We're not focusing on new sharing. But were we to go down that road and explore that, I think we'd have to think long and hard about how to avoid some of the pitfalls. For now, people may think it's a refreshing break for Bebo not to be another news feed of misinformation. Do you think social media has done more harm than good? I think it's possibly true. Yeah, I do. I think social media companies are in a difficult position. Could they have handled things better? Probably. Are things easy for them to handle, and are they entirely responsible? Probably not. Some of the repercussions of social media were not obvious at the beginning. You sold Bebo for $850 million. But Mark Zuckerberg had proposed you sell it to Facebook for stock options. Do you ever regret not having taken him up on that offer and maybe becoming one of Facebook's senior executives? I wouldn't want to be working at Facebook. Not that it's not a great place to work. But that would be quite a stressful job. I've been very happy with the path that we followed. Would it have been worth more money? Almost certainly. But I've enjoyed the freedom of being able to start new things on my own and having my own path. I'm excited to have the opportunity to do Bebo again. It's very rare that you get to start something with a blank sheet of paper and rethink it from the ground up. You normally have so much legacy. In many ways it's harder to reboot a company than it is to start over. But because such a long period of time has elapsed, we're sort of getting closer to a start-over than a reboot.

The prime minister will be leading the No 10 press briefing at 17:00 GMT - full coverage will be over on theBBC Coronavirus live page. Hope you can join us there. Reality Check The prime minister and the Labour leader clashed over whether the UKâs borders should be closed, to limit the arrival of new variants of coronavirus identified in other countries, including the South African strain. Sir Keir Starmer said that 21,000 travellers were still coming to the UK every day. The government has yet to publish data for the number of people entering the country in December and January. But on January 21, Paul Lincoln, the director-general of UK Border Force, told MPs that on Monday 18 January, âwe had about 21,000 people coming into the countryâ. Incoming travellers now have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken in the previous 72 hours. Of the 21,000 who arrived that day, 10,000 were asked to show evidence of a negative test result, according to Paul Lincoln. You can read more about the debate over closing UK borders here.

We have just come to the end of another Prime Minister's Questions. But don't worry if you missed it - here are some of the key moments: The PM is asked a couple more similar questions about hotel quarantine and cladding on leasehold properties, and now PMQs is over. We'll bring you a quick round up of the main lines from today's session in our next post.... Conservative Tracey Crouch is up next. She says ""heroic"" doctors, nurses and other NHS workers on the Covid-19 frontline risk long-standing psychological harm from their experiences, akin to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She calls on the PM to ""utilise military understanding of the condition"" and look into the idea of training a team of psychological health professionals and assigning them to help NHS staff. The PM says it is an interesting idea and worthy of consideration, saying NHS staff have been through a ""really difficult time"". As part of the Â£52bn annual investment in the NHS, the PM says the government will make sure staff have access to mental health wellbeing counselling and advice and everything else they need. Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams has raised the issue of delays in mail deliveries in Gwynedd during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. The Arfon MP says delivery of post in his part of Wales has been delayed ""for days and weeks"" because of Covid-19 outbreaks amongst staff - something that has been echoed across the country. He asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""What is this government doing during this health crisis to make sure the once world beating, but now privatised, Royal Mail, is sufficiently robust to fulfil its duty to the public - particularly in rural areas?"" Mr Johnson said: ""The most important thing we can do is continue to rollout the vaccination programme."" He says the government wants to get to key workers such as postal workers vaccinated ""as soon as we can"". The DUP's Ian Paisley says his countrymen and women feel ""betrayed"" by theNorthern Ireland Protocolwhich has made them feel like ""foreigners in their own country"". He says ""tea and sympathy"" won't cut the mustard and urges the PM to urge all instruments at his disposal to help Northern Ireland, suggesting the EU will not lift a finger. ""Be the Unionist we need you to be,"" he pronounces. The PM uses the question as an opportunity to criticise the EU's recent behaviour and says he will not rule out passing legislation or indeed invoking an emergency provision in the protocol - called Article 16 - to ensure that NI businesses have ""unfettered"" access to GB markets. Labour's Julie Elliott says the government has said it is ""immensely proud of care workers"" and it is a ""sentiment we all share"". But she claims the PM has ""passed the buck"" on their low levels of pay, by saying most wages are set by private providers. She asks Mr Johnson: ""Why won't this government commit to ensuring our care workers are paid a wage they can live on?"" The prime minister says the government is ""proud of setting up the national living wage"", and that there were ""record breaking increases"" last year. He says focusing on this is ""the most important thing we can do for care workers and workers across the country"". Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says there are lots of children in her constituency who are ""priced out"" of British citizenship because of a Â£1,012 fee. She says the Home Office makes a 60% profit on these fees, she asks for them to be scrapped for children. Boris Johnson says it is ""fantastic"" that so many people choose the UK as their home and to seek British citizenship. He says he is ""interested"" in the point she's made, but there are ""costs which must be borne by the taxpayer"". Residents picking up sandbags in Tewkesbury. Conservative Laurence Robertson says hundreds of his constituents in Gloucestershire had their Christmas ruined by ""foul water"" seeping into their houses after floods in the area. He urges the PM to create a new body to ensure that new housing developments do not tap into existing drainage systems and place excessive pressure on local drainage capacity. The PM says it is an interesting idea and he will consider it, also praising the efforts of the Environment Agency and noting the Â£5bn in funding being put into flood defences. Reality Check Checks on animal and food products at two Northern Irelands ports have been suspended following concerns over staff safety. The checks, which apply to some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, were first introduced as part of a Brexit agreement called the Northern Ireland Protocol. But what exactly is it? BBC Reality Check's Tom Edgington explains here.  Stephen Farry - MP for the Alliance Party - raises the ongoing issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol. He says we need to be ""open and honest"" about why it exists and ""do all we can to make its implementation as easy as possible"". He asks the PM in his talks with the EU over the protocol in the coming days to make a UK/EU veterinary agreement a ""priority"" to help all food exporters with checks on products. Johnson does not commit to the measure. But he says it is ""very important the protocol should not place unnecessary barriers or barriers of any kind down the Irish Sea"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford pays tribute, too, to Captain Sir Tom Moore. He says it was wrong for Johnson to visit Scotland last week during a pandemic. He said the PM knew that a plant he was visiting had had an outbreak of Covid -19 just 24 hours earlier. He asks when the PM made the decision to go ahead with the visit. Johnson says the rollout of the vaccine across the country is a success, and he is prepared to help with the rollout of the vaccine ""across the whole of the UK"". Blackford says it is an ""absolute shambles"" and the PM ""can't just explain away this absolutely shocking error of judgement"". He says there was a ""serious Covid-19 outbreak at this plant"" but he still continued to visit the area anyway. He accuses the PM of putting ""politics ahead of public health"". He says Johnson is ""the worst possible leader at the worst possible time"". Johnson says that people of Scotland want to see ""the whole country pulling together"" and it is ""amazing to see Scottish scientists"" working on the coronavirus vaccine. He says it is his job to visit all areas of the UK and ""no-one is going to stop me"". Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Keir Starmer pushed the Prime Minister on why, as he put it, ""schools were closed but UK borders were open"". He accused the government of ignoring the advice of government scientists on how to stop the spread of new virus variants - though the PM said they hadnât recommended a complete travel ban. Boris Johnson seems committed to keeping the hotel quarantine requirement confined to âred-listâ countries for now, saying it was ânot practicalâ to close off the country completely. Heâs insisting the requirements currently in place are tough enough â although gave no details about when the new hotel policy will be introduced. Sir Keir raises the case of Hayley, a 27-year old who he says has been forced into bankruptcy, saying promises of financial support have ""come too late for her"". He says leaseholders in unsafe buildings have three ""simple asks"", including an unpfront package of financial support and a deadline next year to rectify all builldings with dangerous cladding. The PM says the government is addressing the problem, with work on remediating 95% of unsafe buildings under way, adding that Â£30m has just been made available to install fire alarms. Johnson then segues into a wide-ranging political attack on his counterpart, suggesting the Labour leader has been told by focus groups that he is ""sitting on the fence"" too much. After a couple of minutes and with the PM in full flow, the Speaker interrupts him, suggesting he can't touch on every subject under the sun and it is time for other MPs to have their say. This video can not be played Cladding crisis: 'I was a first-time buyer at 27, and bankrupt at 28' Twenty-eight-year-old Hayley Tillotson is the first person in the UK believed to have been made bankrupt because of the cladding crisis. She bought her first home in Leeds two years ago but learnt that it was clad with flammable material. Overwhelmed with the extra costs of dealing with the problems, she had to hand back her keys. She spoke to BBC reporter Sarah Corker. Sir Keir says ""whatever the prime minister claims is being done isn't working"". He says there are ""huge numbers of people who are stuck in the middle and living in unsafe homes"", saying they ""can't sell and are being asked to foot the bill"". The Labour leader gives an example of Dr Will Martin who owns a flat in Sheffield, saying he ""spends his days on the frontline fighting Covid-19 and spends his nights worrying about a Â£52,000 bill."" Sir Keir adds: ""He wants to know will he or will he not have to pay that Â£52,000?"" Mr Johnson says the government is ""determined no leaseholders should have to pay unaffordable costs"" for something that isn't their fault. He says they have set up a Â£1bn building safety fund for people in Dr Martin's position, which has already processed over 3,00 claims, and he hopes his case ""can be addressed in forthcoming package"". Sir Keir attacks what he says is a ""pre-prepared gag"" from the PM about the European Medicines Agency, saying if the UK's border controls were working why are the new variants in the UK and posing biggest threat to the vaccination programme. The Labour leader turns to another issue, asking the PM why more than three years after the Grenfell tragedy thousands of people are living in properties withunsafe cladding and facing extortionate costs to repair them. The PM says he has every sympathy for leaseholders and promises the government will come forward with a comprehensive package of support. Sir Keir says it is now 3 February and the UK has ""new variants in the country, our schools are shut and borders are open"". He says there will need to be exceptions for freight, but with 21,000 people coming into the country every day, more must be done than just direct flights from select countries having to face new quarantine rules. ""Why does the prime minister think variants will behave differently and only arrive by direct flights?"" Mr Johnson says the Labour leader ""can't have it both ways, keeping open for freight and business... whilst calling for tougher quarantine measures"". He says the government imposed new rules ""when it became aware of the new variant"" from South Africa, and the UK would ""still be at the starting blocks"" if Sir Keir was in charge.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bebo chief reveals how he aims to take on FacebookMichael Birch sold Bebo for $850m in 2008, but now plans to revive it with a focus on profiles.TechnologyComments","This video can not be played WATCH: Michael Birch said the ""temptation was too great"" not to relaunch Bebo Bebo's co-founder plans to relaunch the social network with a focus on profiles and ""real-time"" interactions between friends rather than the news feeds at the core of Twitter and Facebook. Michael Birch says his aim is to provide a ""refreshing break"" from the misinformation spread elsewhere. In an exclusive interview, he told the BBC he was coding the effort himself. And while he has high hopes, he acknowledges the odds are stacked against him. Bebo - an acronym for ""blog early, blog often"" - was once the most popular network in the UK, as well as being big in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. At its peak it had more than 40 million members. In, 2008 Mr Birch and his wife Xochi sold the site to AOL for $850m (Â£623m). They later bought it back for $1m and tried to revamp it in several ways, most recently as an e-sports streaming service, before finally selling the business on to Amazon's Twitch in 2019 for $25m. Bebo and its competitor MySpace were once the dominant social networks However, the couple retained the rights to the brand. And with time on his hands during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Birch began thinking about what kind of gap there might be in the market. ""We're calling it live social networking - when you're logged into Bebo, you are aware of which other friends are online,"" he says, explaining his plan from his home in the British Virgin Islands. ""You can interact with them in real-time. You can comment on their photo on their profile. They'll get notified, they'll come to the photo, and they may even have a conversation under the photo. ""It's an experiment, we'll see how it how it actually does. But we think it's a more exciting way of actually connecting."" Even before he had announced plans for a relaunch, Mr Birch said Bebo's web address was attracting about one visit every three seconds despite the service being offline. He hopes a mix of nostalgia and curiosity will attract enough early adopters to let people find friends on the regenerated site to interact with. However, some of those familiar with the original Bebo are sceptical about its prospects. ""It's probably brave to launch a new social network in this climate when there are concerns about potential harms from misinformation spread on social media, so I hope Bebo will take its responsibilities to look after its members and their data seriously,"" says Kate Bevan, computing editor at Which?. ""But there's also something delightfully optimistic about this plan."" Mr Birch is not yet willing to share screenshots of the new Bebo, and for now its only online presence is a ""coming soon"" page advising prospective users that they will not be able to access their old accounts, and a promise that Donald Trump will be banned. Bebo's relaunch plan trended on Twitter after Mr Birch posted this noticed to its website But the entrepreneur says he is spending about 100 hours a week coding the platform, and plans to let the first invite-only members start trying it out before the month's end. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: How will Bebo distinguish itself? Now is a good time to launch another social network. Covid has had a lot of detrimental effects, but I think it sort of opened people's eyes to new things in new ways. And people are craving interaction. We're going to do some nods to the past, but you're not going to log in and see the original Bebo as it was. But what we want to do is go back a little bit to this idea of a profile. That you have an identity you sort of take pride in. That you can visit a profile and see things that aren't just the latest news articles being shared. On Facebook, if someone posts something to their news feed, they may have done it one minute ago - but you don't feel you're online, in this experience with that person. And that's what we're trying to achieve. In its heyday, Bebo was the UK's biggest social network. Are you aiming for that kind of scale again? At the moment, I'm the only one coding it. This started as a fun lockdown project to give me something to do. It certainly didn't start out as can it become as big as we used to be. But you know, in the back of my mind is that a possibility? Of course it is. And it's a fun thing to contemplate. Do I realistically think that's going to happen? No, I don't. But it is more fun trying a thing sometimes than necessarily achieving it. Mr Birch says he is coding 100 hours a week to get Bebo ready Social media is in a very different place than when Bebo was first about. There's been privacy and hate speech scandals. There's lots of talk of regulation. If this takes off, do you really want to have to deal with those kinds of headaches? That does not look like fun. Do I want to do that part of it? No. But do I have to do that part of it? Yes. When we first did Bebo, I spent 95% of my media time talking to journalists about privacy and bullying. And those issues are still obviously as relevant today. But I think one of the most damaging things has been the spread of misinformation and people sharing things similar to what their friends believe, which self-reinforces and doesn't allow for different perspectives to be put in front of people. We're not focusing on new sharing. But were we to go down that road and explore that, I think we'd have to think long and hard about how to avoid some of the pitfalls. For now, people may think it's a refreshing break for Bebo not to be another news feed of misinformation. Do you think social media has done more harm than good? I think it's possibly true. Yeah, I do. I think social media companies are in a difficult position. Could they have handled things better? Probably. Are things easy for them to handle, and are they entirely responsible? Probably not. Some of the repercussions of social media were not obvious at the beginning. You sold Bebo for $850 million. But Mark Zuckerberg had proposed you sell it to Facebook for stock options. Do you ever regret not having taken him up on that offer and maybe becoming one of Facebook's senior executives? I wouldn't want to be working at Facebook. Not that it's not a great place to work. But that would be quite a stressful job. I've been very happy with the path that we followed. Would it have been worth more money? Almost certainly. But I've enjoyed the freedom of being able to start new things on my own and having my own path. I'm excited to have the opportunity to do Bebo again. It's very rare that you get to start something with a blank sheet of paper and rethink it from the ground up. You normally have so much legacy. In many ways it's harder to reboot a company than it is to start over. But because such a long period of time has elapsed, we're sort of getting closer to a start-over than a reboot.

LiveLiveVaccine test results 'support booster delay approach'6 minutes ago,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson joins a ""national clap"" to honour NHS charity fundraiser Capt Sir Tom Moore and health workers Sir Tom, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus at the age of 100 on Tuesday Johnson hails the milestone reached by the UK of vaccinating 10 million people - and thanks health workers and vaccination staff England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says the UK has passed the peak of the second wave of coronavirus But Prof Whitty says deaths will remain high ""for quite some time"" but positive tests are starting to come down A vaccine to tackle Covid-19 variants could be ready to deploy by the autumn, the team behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says A further 1,322 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton Today's live page editors have been James Clarke and Sarah Collerton, and the writers have been Ella Wills, Gavin Stamp, Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Joshua Nevett. Rail staff at London Paddington station take part in a national clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now. Thank you for joining us. We'll bring you more live updates from the UK and around the world tomorrow morning. Here's a final round-up of the main headlines as we draw things to a close:  Annabel RackhamBBC Entertainment reporter Annabel Rackham has had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately. Being totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket. I've had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life. But one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up. I'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety. So when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed.

The city of San Antonio in Texas has been administering at-home Covid vaccinations to its homebound seniors. But now it's facing a problem: people are calling in to the 911 emergency hotline, to try to schedule their own at-home jab. ""It's clogging our 911 system,"" says Joe Arrington, a public information officer for the fire department, reminding people the number should only be used for emergencies. The city is currently only making appointments for seniors it has reached through the public housing authorities and a meal delivery program, but hopes to have more at-home vaccine slots open in the future. Texas was the first US state to top one million vaccines administered, but it has been accused of having a haphazard rollout that lacks coordination with the federal government. On Tuesday, a 16-lane drive-through mega-site launched on the Texas Motor Speedway, in the city of Fort Worth, one of the largest vaccine hubs in the nation. An education recovery commissioner has been appointed by the government to oversee a catch-up programme for children who have lost out on learning because of schools being closed during the pandemic. Sir Kevan Collins will report directly to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Prime Minister

Boris Johnson. Downing Street says his new role  will involving working with government to deliver measures to help children who have missed out on face-to-face learning, including addressing factors such as curriculum content and quantity of teaching time in the coming months. It added that education and the reopening of schools remains the ""top priority"", and the government is committing Â£300m to help children catch up on their education, on top of the Â£1bn announced last June as part of the Covid catch-up fund. Sir Kevan has worked in the education sector for over 30 years as a teacher, a director of childrenâs services and most recently as chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a lot to be hopeful for. Vaccine roll-out is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths. The peak, as Prof Chris Whitty suggests, has been passed. Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, itâs from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more in hospital now than there was at the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February, when all the over-70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be tread until the over-50s are protected. As we have reported, around 80,000 urgent coronavirustests are being carried out in parts of England afterprevious random checks found at least one case of the South African variant that could not be linked to international travel. Now volunteers delivering these door-to-door tests say they have encountered ""almost no negativity"" from the public. Kent Search and Rescue's Stewart Baird, who is helping to organise a team of about 100 volunteers, firefighters and police officers in the ME15 postcode area, said about 95% of residents had accepted a test kit when offered. Swabs were delivered to 2,697 people in Maidstone on Tuesday, with at least 2,050 already returned completed. ""For those that are in, over 95% are asking for testing kits,"" he said. ""Almost everyone is asking for the testing kits and handing them back an hour or two later."" Read more here The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been a key component of the UK's inoculation programme The Belgian government says AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should only be given to people aged under 55. It is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EUâs drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden have already recommended it be limited to under-65s. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks. UK health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages, whileresearch has shown it is highly effective. AstraZeneca has been embroiled in political controversy, however. The European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.

Joseph Flavill is still recovering in hospital after being hit by a car last March - shortly before the first lockdown. His family say the 19-year-old's condition is slowly improving. His aunt, Sally Flavill Smith, told BBC News that it was something âweâve been hoping for every day during lockdown.â She says when the family chat to Joseph - who is not allowed any visitors - they try to explain about the pandemic and why he can only see his loved ones via a screen.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds stood outside 10 Downing Street to salute Capt Tom. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent So good news. Ten million have
had a dose of the vaccine. And, importantly, England's chief medical officer says
we're past the peak of this wave, or at least we should be if infection rates
donât start climbing again. Both are significant. Theyâre also the reason why
Boris Johnson was starting to come under pressure, with questions like why
canât those who have had the vaccine start to mix with each other at least? Could schools go back earlier in England? Itâs clearly still too early for the
government to be able to signal to people that they can begin to relax. The
numbers of people infected with Covid-19 around the country, at one in 55, are
still very high. The prime minister would only say that he will set out, on 22 February ""the timetable, the earliest dates we can do things"". And he indicated he was still thinking about loosening the current restrictions
in stages. ""It feels to us that we will be going down the tiers nationally,"" said Johnson. Expect many arguments to come about when any loosening should
happen, how soon should schools reopen, and whether some areas will move faster
than others. The extraordinary fundraising of Captain Sir Tom Moore was well documented last year. Capt Sir Tom raised Â£32.8m (Â£39.3m including Gift Aid) in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together, by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. Hospital staff treating the sickest patients have beenunder intense pressure in recent months, and a recent study suggested manyhad been left traumatised by their experience during the first wavelast spring. While things such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical apparatus are funded by taxpayers, the focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Back in May, the BBC's Hazel Shearing spoke to NHS staff about how the money was helping. Some of the donations went towards food and care packs for staff in Durham and a revamped wellbeing space for workers in Scotland to relax in during their breaks. You can read morehere.

"Study showing vaccine slows virus spread 'superb'As results show the Oxford jab may cut transmission, the health secretary says it offers a ""way out"".","It is the first time a study has shown a vaccine can reduce the spread of Covid-19 Results that show the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus have been hailed as ""absolutely superb"" by the health secretary. Matt Hancock said the study shows ""vaccines are the way out of this pandemic"". It is the first time a vaccine has been shown to reduce transmission of the virus. The UK has given a first Covid jab to more than 10 million people so far. The results of the study, which hasnot yet been formally published,external, suggest that the vaccine may have a ""substantial"" effect on transmission of the virus. It means the jab could have a greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who is vaccinated will indirectly protect other people too. Mr Hancock called the study ""really encouraging"" on Twitter, adding that the results were ""absolutely superb"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said this latest analysis showing the vaccine reduces transmission would ""help us all get out of this pandemic"". Mr Hancock said passing the 10 million mark for people who have received a first dose was a ""hugely significant milestone"",tweeting that ""every jab makes us all a bit safer"",external. How effective is the Oxford vaccine? Oxford vaccine could substantially cut spread How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? When will I get a Covid vaccine? The study by the University of Oxford, where the vaccine was developed, measured the impact on transmission by testing for asymptomatic infections, swabbing participants every week in addition to recording when anyone fell ill with Covid-19. As well as showing an effect on transmission, the study found the vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months. With no fall in protection during the three-month period, the researchers said the results supported gaps between first and second doses of between four and 12 weeks. The effectiveness of the vaccine increased with a longer gap of 12 weeks before the booster jab. When the second dose is given, the study found the level of protection from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rises to 82%. In other developments: One of the world's largest follow-up Covid studies found almost 90% of people who tested positive for Covid hadprotective antibodies against the virussix months after their initial infection The number of people with coronavirus has changed little in the week to 23 January,the Office for National Statistics says,,externalwith virus levels still high in England (one in 55) and level in Scotland (one in 110), Wales (one in 70) and Northern Ireland (one in 50) The UK has set itself apart from many other countries by prioritising giving the first dose to as many people as possible, delaying the second jab for about 12 weeks. The aim is to save more lives by giving some protection to a larger number of people, but the UK has faced criticism from the British Medical Association for following this path with no international support. Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said the results supported the UK's approach to delaying the booster shot. It ""reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine,"" he says. The new analysis of the Oxford vaccine suggests that transmission of the virus from those who have been vaccinated could be substantially reduced. If verified by the scientific review process, it means that as more people get the jab, infection levels could come down faster than they would otherwise and enable the government to lift restrictions sooner than they could otherwise. One in six of the population has had at least one jab so far. There's still a long way to go but the impact on case numbers could begin to be felt in the coming weeks. The fly in the ointment though is the recent emergence in the UK of variants that may be more resistant to some vaccines. Experts believe that jabs will still offer good protection especially against severe illness, but even so this could slow progress. The race is now on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, in order to keep a step ahead of the variants. The government is also trying to slow the spread of variants through enhanced surveillance and testing. But a critical part of the strategy is to drive down infection levels, so people don't catch the virus in the first place, whatever variant it might be. In France, use of the Oxford vaccine has been restricted by health authorities who say it should only be given to people under 65. Mr Hancock, the UK health secretary, said scientists had looked directly at the over-65s and there was ""a high degree of confidence"" that the Oxford vaccine worked on people of all ages. He added that the latest research showed the world the vaccine works - ""it works well"" and ""categorically supports"" the government's strategy. Asked if it could now mean children in England returning to school before 8 March, he pointed out 30,000 people were still in hospital. ""We've got to get this right down,"" he told the Today programme. ""It's too soon to be able to take action in England and we've set out the timescale because we think that's when we should be able to take action, if all goes well."" Alongside the Oxford vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is also being rolled out across the UK. Clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna, which has been approved but is not yet in use, did not look for a potential impact on transmission. However, BBC health correspondent James Gallagher said the different vaccines all target the same part of the virus so if one can cut transmission, there is a good chance the others can too. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The data from this latest trial was drawn before new variants, including the South Africa one, emerged. Asked how protective the Oxford vaccine could be against new mutations, Dr Pollard said he was anticipating ""good protection"" against the Kent variant and would publish details ""very soon"". On other variants, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When we look at the new mutations that have been arising in other countries and now also here in the UK - that is the virus trying to escape from human immunity, and that's whether it's from vaccines or from infection. ""I think that's telling us about what's to come, which is a virus that continues to transmit, but hopefully that will be like other coronaviruses that are around us all the time, which cause colds and mild infections. ""We will have built up enough immunity to prevent the other severe disease that we've been seeing over the last year."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

China blocks UN condemnation of Myanmar coup,"Aung San Suu Kyi remains detained by the military China has blocked a UN Security Council statement condemning the military coup in Myanmar. The military took power in the South East Asian nation on Monday after arresting political leader Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of other lawmakers. The coup leaders have since formed a supreme council which will sit above the cabinet. In Myanmar's biggest city Yangon though, signs of resistance and civil disobedience have been growing. Doctors and medical staff in dozens of hospitals across the country are stopping work in protest against the coup and to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. Yangon General Hospital - medics wear red ribbons in protest The United Nations Security Council met on Tuesday but failed to agree on a joint statement after China did not support it. China has the power of veto as one of five permanent members of the council. Ahead of the talks, the UN's Special Envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner, strongly condemned the military takeover which came after the army refused to accept the outcome of general elections held in November. She said it was clear that ""the recent outcome of the election was a landslide victory"" for Ms Suu Kyi's party. In further criticism, the Group of Seven major economic powers said it was ""deeply concerned"" and called for the return of democracy. ""We call upon the military to immediately end the state of emergency, restore power to the democratically-elected government, to release all those unjustly detained and to respect human rights and the rule of law,"" the statement released in London said.  The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. China has been warning since the coup that sanctions or international pressure would only make things worse in Myanmar. Beijing has long played a role of protecting the country from international scrutiny. It sees the country as economically important and is one of Myanmar's closest allies. Alongside Russia, it has repeatedly protected Myanmar from criticism at the UN over the military crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya population. ""Beijing's stance on the situation is consistent with its overall scepticism of international intervention,"" Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia editor at The Diplomat, told the BBC. While China does benefit strategically from Myanmar's alienation from the west, this does not mean that Beijing is happy with the coup, he cautions. ""They had a pretty good arrangement with the NLD and invested a lot to build a relationship with Aung San Suu Kyi. The return of the military actually means that China now has to deal with the institution in Myanmar that historically is the most suspicious of China's intentions."" The ousted political leaders remain in detention, guarded by soldiers ""Through this foreign policy equivalent of gaslighting, China seems to be signalling its tacit support, if not emphatic endorsement, for the generals' actions,"" Myanmar expert Elliott Prasse-Freeman, of the National University of Singapore, told the BBC. ""China seems to be proceeding as if this is Myanmar's 'internal issue' in which what we are observing is a 'cabinet reshuffle,' as China's state media put it."" While he thinks a UN statement would not have made an immediate difference, it would still serve as ""a first step for cohering an international response. That appears to not be forthcoming"". Aung San Suu Kyi, who led the now-ousted elected government, has not been seen since she was detained by the military on Monday morning. Dozens of others also remain detained, including President Win Myint, members of her party's central committee and her personal attorney. They are reportedly being held under house arrest. Her National League for Democracy (NLD) demanded her immediate release on Tuesday. It has also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. Meanwhile, the United States said it had been unsuccessful in contacting the Myanmar military and has formally declared the takeover to be a coup d'etat. This means the US cannot directly assist the government, though most of its assistance goes to non-governmental entities. The EU, UK, Australia and others have also condemned the takeover. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in. Power has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, were replaced. In the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been ""inevitable"". Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds The country was calm in the aftermath of the coup, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. Myanmar has a long history of military rule andmany people can still remember the terror of previous coups. But on Tuesday evening, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. Activist groups have called for civil disobedience campaigns, setting up a Facebook group to organise their efforts. This video can not be played People in Yangon banged pots and pans to protest against the military coup Staff at 70 hospitals and medical departments across the country have reportedly stepped away from all non-emergency work. Hundreds of healthcare workers, including senior doctors, have participated in the ""Red Ribbon movement"", with many donning a red ribbon on their clothes to show they were against the coup. Online, many changed their social media profile pictures to one of just the colour red. Some medics are alsowearing symbols like black ribbons in silent protest. How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet Myanmar coup: 'Our world turned upside down' Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

Influencers told not to use 'misleading' filters,"Sasha Pallari says filters give a false impression Filters should not be applied to social media adverts if they exaggerate the effect of the product, the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled. The ASA was responding to the #filterdrop campaign that called for it to be compulsory for influencers to state when they use a beauty filter to promote skincare or cosmetics. Sasha Pallari, who started the campaign, said she was ""over the moon"". The ASA said filtered beauty content could be ""misleading"". Miss Pallari, 29, from Weston-super-Mare, said she started #filterdrop in July 2020 in the hope of seeing""more real skin"" on Instagram. The use of filters on social media is a widely debated issue, attracting the attention of not only celebrities and social media influencers but also MPs. Social media 'damages teens' mental health' Girl Guides: Digitally-enhanced photos need labels MP bids for law over digitally-altered body images The ASA examined two examples of where filters had been added to videos shared by influencers advertising tanning products, adding that the outcome of these rulings would apply to all UK brands, influencers and celebrities. They were: two Instagram stories for Skinny Tan Ltd and one for Tanologist Tan which was banned for applying a filter that ""misleadingly exaggerated the effect the product was capable of achieving"". It ruled the ads in both cases were likely to have misled consumers. Sasha Pallari, photographed without a filter (left) compared to using the 'Paris' filter (right) It said the ruling means that brands, influencers and celebrities should not apply filters to photos that promote beauty products if the filters are likely to exaggerate the effect the products are capable of achieving. The ASA said that filtered beauty content could still be misleading, even if the name of the filter was referenced in the Instagram story. Ads that break these rules would be taken down and prohibited from appearing again, which was likely to damage the advertiser and influencer's reputation, the ASA said. A spokesman said: ""An ongoing focus of our work in this area continues to be on raising awareness of the rules and supporting influencers with the guidance and tools they need to help get their ads right. ""We're also working closely with the social media platforms who can and will enforce our rulings where an advertiser is unwilling or able to work with us."" Sasha Pallari regularly uploads unfiltered content to her Instagram feed Miss Pallari said: ""I feel like the detrimental effect this is having on social media users has finally been taken seriously and this is a huge step in the right direction for how filters are used and the way cosmetics are advertised online."" She said it was an issue she had been passionate about for a long time and she received messages ""every day"" from women struggling to match the beauty standards in real life that they see online. ""I can now help make a difference to how these women view themselves in the mirror and that's amazing,"" she said. Molly Nutt said she used to find it hard to match what she could achieve in reality with what she was seeing online Molly Nutt, 20, has been following Miss Pallari's campaign and welcomed the ruling, adding that much of her life has ""revolved around filters"". ""Filters with names like 'Pretty Girl', with blue eyes, bigger lips and a smaller nose, that just implies what you should look like, and not everybody is going to look like that,"" she said. ""Not everyone is an expert at make-up... and then with the filters as well it enhances it even more... I can't match up to how they look on Instagram. ""Most days I couldn't even leave the house without putting on make-up, but now I don't care as much... Sasha has made me feel more at ease with who I am and that I'm not an alien because of the way I look."" Rahi Chadda says when it comes to advertising online brands need to be authentic With more than 900,000 followers on Instagram, model and influencer Rahi Chadda, said he ""completely agrees"" with the ruling but is concerned about how it will be policed. ""Having this ruling is a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""The logistics though will definitely be a point of concern for the majority of influencers, because what is the definition of a filter? ""When we are talking about filters, are we talking about lighting, special effects, make-up before promoting a product... in that way most pictures on social media will be naturally filtered... you have already glorified the product in such a way before it is reaching the audience. ""They are going to have to be a lot clearer about what they mean by a filter and where we draw the line."" A photograph of Sasha without filter is seen side-by-side with an adapted version that has had a 'cats eyes' filter added When Miss Pallari set out on her campaign, she said she wanted to see three outcomes: to encourage as many women as possible to not depend on filters, for the ASA to demand that social media influencers and celebrities must state if they have used a filter when promoting cosmetics and to get face-changing and morphing filters removed from Instagram. She said with two of her aims achieved, she would fight to get face-altering filters removed from Instagram altogether. ""There's no point coming this far, to only come this far,"" she said. ""How can Instagram agree to remove filters that promote plastic surgery, but not filters that alter your shape - how else are we going to alter our face without plastic surgery?"" The most recent celebrity to speak out about face-altering filters is former Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson. She took to her Instagram feed on Tuesday to encourage her 7.6m followers to embrace their natural looks. The 29-year-old said while she ""loves a little Instagram filter that makes you look a bit more tanned or your skin a bit fresher"", she does not understand why most filters alter her appearance, giving her a ""tiny nose and huge lips"". She went on: ""I don't understand why Instagram feels the need to squash your nose and make it really skinny. What's wrong with a standard nose? ""I'm so confused why whoever makes these filters think that is what beauty is?"" Little Mix star Jesy Nelson is the latest celebrity to criticise face-altering filters Responding to the ASA ruling, Skinny Tan said it had since reviewed its guidelines on the user-generated content it chose to share on social media. ""We do not encourage the use of beauty filters that exaggerate or provide a misleading impression of the results our products can achieve,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Whilst we were disappointed with the ASA ruling, as the intention behind the particular Instagram stories in question was not to mislead but rather to share her positive comments and experience with using our products, we do fully understand our responsibility as a brand to protect consumer interests. A spokesperson for Tanologist said it was disappointed but respected the ASA's ruling, although it had not used the content on its brand account. ""The influencer content in question demonstrated before and after self-tan product results. ""The 'after' content - which depicted the results of the self-tan product - did not have a filter applied."" When approached for comment about the #filterdrop campaign and the ASA ruling, Instagram declined to comment, but the BBC understands that brands, celebrities and influencers are asked to comply with CMA and ASA guidance on sponsored social media posts.

Welsh households Â£73m in arrears amid pandemic,"Mental health charity Hafal said it was being ""swamped"" by people needing help with their finances The pandemic is creating a ""debt time-bomb"" according to charities concerned about the impact it is having on people's mental health. More than 280,000 people in Wales have fallen behind on payments since the start of the Covid pandemic, according to research by Citizens Advice Cymru. The charity estimates households in Wales are Â£73m in arrears on the likes of rent, energy bills and council tax. Mental health charity Hafal said it was being ""swamped"" by people needing help. Wales' minister for mental health said 115,000 people had accessed the Â£10m made available for problems involving debt and employment. How much will coronavirus cost the UK? What help is available to pay my bills? Adrian Nicholas, from Hafal said there was an ""inevitable link"" between debt and mental health, which can cause a ""vicious cycle"". He said: ""It's going to be a very rough and bumpy few months. Obviously, we've still got the pandemic going on, but unfortunately the debt incurred during this period isn't going to go away overnight. ""The sooner people can start to obtain help with the money worries they have, the better it'll be for their financial health and their mental health."" Rose, not her real name, is a mother of two from Caerphilly county. Citizens Advice Cymru estimates households in Wales are Â£73m in arrears She has struggled financially for a number of years, but said her debt spiralled out of control since losing her mother to Covid-19 last April. Rose said: ""I struggled to come to terms with losing her. It was hard enough dealing with home-schooling my 15-year-old and 12-year-old while she was ill in hospital, but since we lost her, my mental health has really suffered.

My bills were going up because there was extra food to buy as the children were not eating in school. The heating and electricity costs went up and everything just got on top of me. ""The worry about the effect it is having on my children's education because they don't have a laptop each to do their schooling has made me so low. Being stuck at home because of Covid has made me and the children feel isolated. I had nobody to talk to and I couldn't face my debts."" Rhiannon Evans, head of policy and campaigns at Citizens Advice Cymru, said: ""We're really concerned that we're building up a debt time-bomb for people. ""There are various schemes in place to help people but as the pandemic progresses and we move out of those schemes, people will find themselves with a lot of debt they can't pay off. ""We've also seen worrying reports that some councils have started debt collection practises for council taxes again, even during lockdown."" There is an ""inevitable link"" between debt and mental health, Hafal says A recent report by UK debt advice charity Stepchange saida ""personal debt crisis"" was emergingas a result of the pandemic. Director Richard Lane said: ""In Wales, much like the rest of the UK, we're seeing worrying levels of financial vulnerability concentrated among those hardest hit by the pandemic. ""In total Â£10.3bn of debt and arrears attributable to Covid has been built up across the UK, most often by those who were already struggling before the pandemic, such as renters, young people, single parents and low earners."" Earlier this week the Welsh Government minister for mental health and wellbeing, Eluned Morgan, said more than Â£10million had been made available through the Single Advice Fund to help resolve problems, which include debt and employment. Ms Morgan said more than 115,000 have already benefitted from the fund. The Welsh Government is also piloting a scheme to refer people to Citizens Advice if they are in extreme need of help due to debt problems. HM Treasury said it had invested more than Â£280bn throughout the crisis to protect jobs and businesses and provided the Welsh Government with an additional Â£5.2bn to respond the pandemic. A spokesperson said: ""As the Chancellor has set out, the Budget will be the moment to take decisions in the round and outline the next stages of our plan for jobs to support businesses and families. ""That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.""

'Thousands' living in inadequate military housing,"Thousands of armed forces personnel are living in sub-standard accommodation, according to a report by the government's spending watchdog. The National Audit Office said barracks had suffered from ""decades of under-investment"" by the Ministry of Defence. Issues with basics such as heating and hot water were among the common complaints, the report said. The MoD said it had invested Â£1.2bn over the last decade in improving military housing. But the watchdog said there was still a Â£1.5bn backlog of repairs and the MoD was failing in its commitment to provide high-quality subsidised housing. As of last year, more than half of the armed forces - nearly 80,000 people - were occupying single living accommodation blocks, either on a full or part-time basis. Of those, the NAO found more than a third - 36% - were living in ""poorer grade"" accommodation, while almost 2,400 were in housing considered such bad quality that they were not charged any rent. Fewer than half - 49% - were satisfied with the overall standard of their accommodation, compared with 58% in 2015, according to the armed forces continuous attitude survey. Other common issues included a lack of cooking facilities, limited storage space and poor or expensive wifi, the NAO said. Military housing still 'not good enough' Barracks 'worse than the frontline' Despite the MoD planning to spend Â£1.5bn on renovation work over the next 10 years, the NAO said it could be ""some time"" before significant improvements were seen because of long-term under-investment. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: ""Problems with heating and hot water are not conditions that [members of the armed forces] should have to tolerate. ""MoD needs to get this right if it is to retain service personnel in the long term.""

Here's a final round-up of the main headlines as we draw things to a close:  Annabel RackhamBBC Entertainment reporter Annabel Rackham has had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately. Being totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket. I've had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life. But one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up. I'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety. So when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed.

The city of San Antonio in Texas has been administering at-home Covid vaccinations to its homebound seniors. But now it's facing a problem: people are calling in to the 911 emergency hotline, to try to schedule their own at-home jab. ""It's clogging our 911 system,"" says Joe Arrington, a public information officer for the fire department, reminding people the number should only be used for emergencies. The city is currently only making appointments for seniors it has reached through the public housing authorities and a meal delivery program, but hopes to have more at-home vaccine slots open in the future. Texas was the first US state to top one million vaccines administered, but it has been accused of having a haphazard rollout that lacks coordination with the federal government. On Tuesday, a 16-lane drive-through mega-site launched on the Texas Motor Speedway, in the city of Fort Worth, one of the largest vaccine hubs in the nation. An education recovery commissioner has been appointed by the government to oversee a catch-up programme for children who have lost out on learning because of schools being closed during the pandemic. Sir Kevan Collins will report directly to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Prime Minister

Boris Johnson. Downing Street says his new role  will involving working with government to deliver measures to help children who have missed out on face-to-face learning, including addressing factors such as curriculum content and quantity of teaching time in the coming months. It added that education and the reopening of schools remains the ""top priority"", and the government is committing Â£300m to help children catch up on their education, on top of the Â£1bn announced last June as part of the Covid catch-up fund. Sir Kevan has worked in the education sector for over 30 years as a teacher, a director of childrenâs services and most recently as chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There is a lot to be hopeful for. Vaccine roll-out is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths. The peak, as Prof Chris Whitty suggests, has been passed. Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, itâs from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more in hospital now than there was at the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February, when all the over-70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be tread until the over-50s are protected. As we have reported, around 80,000 urgent coronavirustests are being carried out in parts of England afterprevious random checks found at least one case of the South African variant that could not be linked to international travel. Now volunteers delivering these door-to-door tests say they have encountered ""almost no negativity"" from the public. Kent Search and Rescue's Stewart Baird, who is helping to organise a team of about 100 volunteers, firefighters and police officers in the ME15 postcode area, said about 95% of residents had accepted a test kit when offered. Swabs were delivered to 2,697 people in Maidstone on Tuesday, with at least 2,050 already returned completed. ""For those that are in, over 95% are asking for testing kits,"" he said. ""Almost everyone is asking for the testing kits and handing them back an hour or two later."" Read more here The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been a key component of the UK's inoculation programme The Belgian government says AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should only be given to people aged under 55. It is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EUâs drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden have already recommended it be limited to under-65s. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks. UK health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages, whileresearch has shown it is highly effective. AstraZeneca has been embroiled in political controversy, however. The European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time. There was a tribute to Capt Tom at the Piccadilly Circus lights, in central London Doctors, nurses and NHS staff at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, joining in the applause Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria clapped for Capt Tom outside their London home A bus displaying a tribute to Capt Tom drove past his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined the applause for Capt Tom from St Andrew's House, Edinburgh This video can not be played Covid-19: Teen Joseph Flavill wakes from coma with no knowledge of pandemic A teenager who woke from a 10-month long coma has no knowledge of the coronavirus pandemic, despite being infected with the virus twice. Joseph Flavill is still recovering in hospital after being hit by a car last March - shortly before the first lockdown. His family say the 19-year-old's condition is slowly improving. His aunt, Sally Flavill Smith, told BBC News that it was something âweâve been hoping for every day during lockdown.â She says when the family chat to Joseph - who is not allowed any visitors - they try to explain about the pandemic and why he can only see his loved ones via a screen. Local residents stand beside a mural of Captain Sir Tom Moore in Clonduff, east Belfast, as they applauded him NHS staff outside Bedford Hospital - where Capt Tom died with coronavirus - honoured the 100-year-old charity fundraiser Residents clap for Capt Tom in his village of Marston Moretaine, near Milton Keynes Junior soldiers at the Army Foundation College in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, joining in the clap for the war veteran. Sir Tom, originally from Keighley, was appointed as Honorary Colonel of the college to mark his 100th birthday last year Fulham and Leicester City players clap in a tribute for Captain Sir Tom Moore before their Premier League match at Craven Cottage, London: As did Burnley and Manchester City players at Turf Moor, Burnley: People across the UK have joined in the national clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore. Capt Tom's daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore and her family joined the applause, standing outside the gate to his home in the village of Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds stood outside 10 Downing Street to salute Capt Tom. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent So good news. Ten million have
had a dose of the vaccine. And, importantly, England's chief medical officer says
we're past the peak of this wave, or at least we should be if infection rates
donât start climbing again. Both are significant. Theyâre also the reason why
Boris Johnson was starting to come under pressure, with questions like why
canât those who have had the vaccine start to mix with each other at least? Could schools go back earlier in England? Itâs clearly still too early for the
government to be able to signal to people that they can begin to relax. The
numbers of people infected with Covid-19 around the country, at one in 55, are
still very high. The prime minister would only say that he will set out, on 22 February ""the timetable, the earliest dates we can do things"". And he indicated he was still thinking about loosening the current restrictions
in stages. ""It feels to us that we will be going down the tiers nationally,"" said Johnson. Expect many arguments to come about when any loosening should
happen, how soon should schools reopen, and whether some areas will move faster
than others. The extraordinary fundraising of Captain Sir Tom Moore was well documented last year. Capt Sir Tom raised Â£32.8m (Â£39.3m including Gift Aid) in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together, by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. Hospital staff treating the sickest patients have beenunder intense pressure in recent months, and a recent study suggested manyhad been left traumatised by their experience during the first wavelast spring. While things such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical apparatus are funded by taxpayers, the focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Back in May, the BBC's Hazel Shearing spoke to NHS staff about how the money was helping. Some of the donations went towards food and care packs for staff in Durham and a revamped wellbeing space for workers in Scotland to relax in during their breaks. You can read morehere. A clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore is now under way. The 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just finished leading today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He was joined by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Here's a quick roundup of what we learned: As we have been reporting, the public has been encouraged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take part in a clap for Captain Sir Tom Moore shortly, at 18:00 GMT. The 100-year-old, whoraised almost Â£33m for NHS charitiesby walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday.

While the numbers in hospital are coming down, itâs from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more in hospital now than there was at the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February, when all the over-70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be tread until the over-50s are protected. As we have reported, around 80,000 urgent coronavirustests are being carried out in parts of England afterprevious random checks found at least one case of the South African variant that could not be linked to international travel. Now volunteers delivering these door-to-door tests say they have encountered ""almost no negativity"" from the public. Kent Search and Rescue's Stewart Baird, who is helping to organise a team of about 100 volunteers, firefighters and police officers in the ME15 postcode area, said about 95% of residents had accepted a test kit when offered. Swabs were delivered to 2,697 people in Maidstone on Tuesday, with at least 2,050 already returned completed. ""For those that are in, over 95% are asking for testing kits,"" he said. ""Almost everyone is asking for the testing kits and handing them back an hour or two later.""

It is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EUâs drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy. Germany, France, Austria and Sweden have already recommended it be limited to under-65s. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks. UK health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages, whileresearch has shown it is highly effective. AstraZeneca has been embroiled in political controversy, however. The European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.

Here's a final round-up of the main headlines as we draw things to a close:  Annabel RackhamBBC Entertainment reporter Annabel Rackham has had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately. Being totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket. I've had an auto-immune disease since the age of 10 and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life. But one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up. I'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety. So when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed.

The city of San Antonio in Texas has been administering at-home Covid vaccinations to its homebound seniors. But now it's facing a problem: people are calling in to the 911 emergency hotline, to try to schedule their own at-home jab. ""It's clogging our 911 system,"" says Joe Arrington, a public information officer for the fire department, reminding people the number should only be used for emergencies. The city is currently only making appointments for seniors it has reached through the public housing authorities and a meal delivery program, but hopes to have more at-home vaccine slots open in the future. Texas was the first US state to top one million vaccines administered, but it has been accused of having a haphazard rollout that lacks coordination with the federal government. On Tuesday, a 16-lane drive-through mega-site launched on the Texas Motor Speedway, in the city of Fort Worth, one of the largest vaccine hubs in the nation. An education recovery commissioner has been appointed by the government to oversee a catch-up programme for children who have lost out on learning because of schools being closed during the pandemic. Sir Kevan Collins will report directly to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Prime Minister

Boris Johnson. Downing Street says his new role  will involving working with government to deliver measures to help children who have missed out on face-to-face learning, including addressing factors such as curriculum content and quantity of teaching time in the coming months. It added that education and the reopening of schools remains the ""top priority"", and the government is committing Â£300m to help children catch up on their education, on top of the Â£1bn announced last June as part of the Covid catch-up fund. Sir Kevan has worked in the education sector for over 30 years as a teacher, a director of childrenâs services and most recently as chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation.

"PM urges EU action to ease Brexit tensions in NIBoris Johnson says the EU ""undermined"" the Brexit deal as port staff face threats over goods checks.","Brexit-related checks on products from Great Britain were suspended after threats against port staff Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for ""urgent action"" from the EU amid rising tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports. UK and EU leaders are to hold talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Checks on goods were suspended on Tuesday after threats to staff. The UK government wrote to the European Commission overnight, calling for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. But Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, issued a warning against ""just kicking things down the road"", telling BBC Radio Ulster: ""We need to find solutions that are sustainable, that are workable and long lasting."" On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the EU had ""undermined"" the Brexit deal by threatening emergency controls of Covid vaccine exports across the Irish border. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the threat had been a ""mistake that shouldn't have happened"". But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a separate issue to address over trade rules, and it was Brexit ""causing all of this tension"" - not the measures being put in place. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP vows to send 'strong message' over NI Protocol EU condemns 'threats' against NI Brexit port staff PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who will be representing the UK government in talks with the EU Commission's Maros Sefcovic and Northern Ireland's devolved administration, said a three-month grace period with lighter enforcement of EU rules should be extended beyond March. The UK government wrote to the European Commission on Tuesday night to outline the changes it wanted made, which would continue temporary exemptions for supermarket goods, pharmaceuticals, chilled meats and parcels crossing from GB to Northern Ireland. According to a copy of a letter seen by the BBC, the UK would want these exemptions to stay in place until 1 January 2023. It comes after hauliers experienced problems transporting goods from Great Britain. Some parcel deliveries were stopped and supermarkets struggled to restock some products last month, although some of these problems have since been resolved. ""Trust has been eroded, damage has been done and urgent action is therefore needed,"" Mr Gove told the House of Commons on Tuesday, adding that supermarkets and other businesses needed to be sure they could continue to supply consumers. Mr Gove has also asked the EU to examine its decision to ban the import into Northern Ireland of some items like seed potatoes, and the UK wants the Irish government to be able to negotiate a deal with the UK to remove barriers to pets being taken across the Irish Sea. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic tweeted that the protocol was ""a cornerstone"" of the agreement between the UK and EU, and ""the only way to protect Good Friday Agreement"". What happens to parcels or dogs moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland might sound like small issues. But they are huge, because they threaten to break one of the things that was part of the promise in the post-Brexit protocol - that what happened would not disrupt the daily lives of people living in Northern Ireland. And, as we have seen in the past few days, this combination of all of these small changes could destabilise the very sensitive balance in Northern Ireland between the two different communities. The government has no intention of ditching this protocol. That is not going to happen, even though the past few days have given the DUP and some Eurosceptics reason to call again for it to be abandoned. But the government is really clear that they want to very quickly persuade the EU, as one minister put it to me, to start being pragmatic about this, rather than being purist. When the Brexit transition period ended in January, Northern Ireland remained in the EU single market while the rest of the UK left, meaning that checks had to be carried out on goods arriving from Great Britain. Unionists have criticised these rules, known as the Northern Ireland protocol, as damaging to trade and posing a risk to UK unity. In recent days, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas, referring to staff carrying out checks on goods at ports as ""targets"". Stormont suspended physical checks on food consignments at two ports on Tuesday amid the security concerns, although police said paramilitary groups are not involved. Mr Johnson said on Twitter that his commitment to people of Northern Ireland and the union was ""unshakeable"". He called for ""urgent action from the EU to resolve outstanding problems"" with the way the protocol was implemented, to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and ensure ""Northern Ireland benefits from Brexit just like every other part of our United Kingdom"". Recent moves by the EU had ""undermined the protocol and understandably provoked concern"", he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ireland's Mr Coveney said ""elements of protocol are causing problems"" and the two sides ""need to focus on improving"" it, but he said Brexit was to blame for growing tensions in Northern Ireland, rather than the protocol itself. He told Today: ""Senior political figures need to talk seriously now about trying to diffuse tension which is clearly there and need to talk about how we can make protocol work effectively. ""[The protocol] is an Irish and British and EU negotiated solution, an agreed solution to try to limit the disruptive impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""What is causing all of this tension is Brexit, not the protocol. The protocol is an attempt to try and reduce tension and solve problems linked to Brexit."" Amid a dispute with manufacturers over supplies, the EU on Friday briefly threatened to use an emergency measure to override part of the deal and restrict the export of vaccines. It was concerned that Northern Ireland could be used as a way to bypass export controls, using its place in the single market as a backdoor to the rest of the UK. The dispute has intensified pressure among some unionist politicians to end the checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with the DUP saying it intends to work with other unionist parties to send a message thatNorthern Ireland must be ""freed from the protocol"". Ms Foster, the party's leader, is due to meet Mr Johnson on Wednesday morning, to discuss her concerns before attending the talks with the EU Commission in the afternoon. Also at the talks will be Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, who said the DUP was  ""whipping up hysteria"" while others were ""calling for calm and resolution"". Mr Coveney said the move by the Commission on Friday had been ""a mistake"", adding: ""It should not have happened and would not have happened if there had been the appropriate consultation."" Part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. It was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. However, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but laterreversed the decision. Unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

British-Iranian academic facing jail escapes Iran,"This video can not be played Kameel Ahmady travelled high over the mountains on foot to escape Iran's Revolutionary Guards A British-Iranian academic facing nine years in jail in Iran has told the BBC how he escaped on foot over mountains to start a new life in the UK. Kameel Ahmady was convicted two months ago of collaborating with a hostile government. He denies the charge. He decided to try to flee while on bail and appealing against the sentence. Mr Ahmady trekked over a mountainous border to escape the Revolutionary Guards - a journey he described as ""very long, very dark and very scary"". Iran court 'jails British FGM researcher' 'Grave concern' over Zaghari-Ratcliffe court case Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Mr Ahmady was born of Kurdish stock in western Iran. But his parents sent him to Britain when he was 18 for his education. He remained there many years, studying at the University of Kent and the London School of Economics. Such was his affection for Britain that he applied for British citizenship before returning to Iran as an anthropologist. His research focuses on child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) in Iran. This brought him to the attention of the authorities because he campaigned to raise the age at which girls can marry, which is currently set at 13 years old. Kameel Ahmady travelled high over the mountains on foot to escape Iran's Revolutionary Guards One morning in August 2019, a man came to his door in Tehran saying he was a postman. Mr Ahmady opened the door and 16 Revolutionary Guards stormed in. He was arrested and taken to the notorious Evin prison. Mr Ahmady said he had been targeted not just because he was a dual national, but also because Iran wanted to retaliate after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar that was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. ""Being a dual national, you are always a potential case,"" he told the BBC. ""My chief interrogator said, 'You're very delicious,' a) because I was Kurdish; b) I was coming from a Sunni religious background as opposed with the majority of the Shia in Iran; and c) I was a researcher who was digging up sensitive issues. And I wasn't only a simple researcher, I was actually acting on my research and using it for awareness raising."" Kameel Ahmady decided to flee Tehran while out on bail and appealing against his sentence He spent three months at Evin prison where, he said, his interrogators played mind games with him. ""They treated me, on a human level, well. But don't underestimate the concept and the seriousness of so-called 'white torture' - the psychological pressure they put on you. And all these games are played stage by stage, and they're very well trained as to how to put a little bit of extra pressure on you when it's needed."" ""There are all sorts of mind games, it's almost like a trade. You give me this, I'll give you that - a minute of a phone call needs all sorts of negotiation with your interrogators. Five minutes more extra fresh air than the half an hour that you're entitled to. And it is becoming really sad and petty because you want to be interrogated even more, not going back to the cell, which is almost like a grave."" After three months he was released ahead of the trial but monitored closely. This video can not be played (August 2020): The other detainees held 'hostage' in Iran Last December, Mr Ahmady was convicted of collaborating with a hostile government, something he denies, after prosecutors claimed that a charity he had once done some work for had once received some funding from the United States. He also faced various other charges, including promoting homosexuality in his research. He was sentenced to more than nine years in jail and given a fine of more than Â£500,000 ($683,000).But while out on bail, he decided to flee Iran,external. He said: ""The appeal was overturned. That was the moment that I decided to escape because I couldn't see myself staying in prison for 10 years and watching my son from a distance growing up. By the time I would have been released - if I was released - my son would have been 15."" So, without telling anyone but his immediate family, Mr Ahmady fled in secret, travelling over the mountains on foot to escape. ""I just simply left. I packed my bag with a shaving kit, a few books of mine, and a laptop."" ""And warm clothes, because I knew I had to smuggle myself out of that train in the mountains. It was very cold, very long, very dark and very scary."" ""I had to leave behind everything I loved, I worked for, all my human connections. It was so sad and scary. If I got arrested, I would have been back before the judge, and God knows what other scenarios that would be. ""It was a very hard and difficult decision. It was emotionally difficult. It was physically, mentally difficult. It was a move a made against my will. They pushed me out. And that was just so sad."" Last September Mr Ahmady was accused of sexual misconduct towards female colleagues. The allegations were anonymous, and emerged shortly before his court hearing. But the Iranian Sociological Association revoked his membership. Mr Ahmady denied both the allegations and the suggestion they played a role in his decision to leave. Mr Ahmady said: ""I find these allegations very upsetting. As I said at the time I take full responsibility for my actions and I find the sociological association's decision rushed and unfair. I do not accept any of these allegations. They are not related to the charges brought against me by the court which led me to escape, to restart my life in safety with my family."" Mr Ahmady now faces an uncertain future in Britain, without a job. ""I had to do what I needed to do. I couldn't stay and spend 10 years [in prison]. I can be much more useful outside and I have a responsibility towards my family."" The question now is how Tehran might respond and what impact may be felt by other British-Iranian dual nationals.

"PM urges EU action to ease Brexit tensions in NIBoris Johnson says the EU ""undermined"" the Brexit deal as port staff face threats over goods checks.UK Politics","Brexit-related checks on products from Great Britain were suspended after threats against port staff Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for ""urgent action"" from the EU amid rising tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports. UK and EU leaders are to hold talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Checks on goods were suspended on Tuesday after threats to staff. The UK government wrote to the European Commission overnight, calling for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. But Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, issued a warning against ""just kicking things down the road"", telling BBC Radio Ulster: ""We need to find solutions that are sustainable, that are workable and long lasting."" On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the EU had ""undermined"" the Brexit deal by threatening emergency controls of Covid vaccine exports across the Irish border. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the threat had been a ""mistake that shouldn't have happened"". But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a separate issue to address over trade rules, and it was Brexit ""causing all of this tension"" - not the measures being put in place. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP vows to send 'strong message' over NI Protocol EU condemns 'threats' against NI Brexit port staff PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who will be representing the UK government in talks with the EU Commission's Maros Sefcovic and Northern Ireland's devolved administration, said a three-month grace period with lighter enforcement of EU rules should be extended beyond March. The UK government wrote to the European Commission on Tuesday night to outline the changes it wanted made, which would continue temporary exemptions for supermarket goods, pharmaceuticals, chilled meats and parcels crossing from GB to Northern Ireland. According to a copy of a letter seen by the BBC, the UK would want these exemptions to stay in place until 1 January 2023. It comes after hauliers experienced problems transporting goods from Great Britain. Some parcel deliveries were stopped and supermarkets struggled to restock some products last month, although some of these problems have since been resolved. ""Trust has been eroded, damage has been done and urgent action is therefore needed,"" Mr Gove told the House of Commons on Tuesday, adding that supermarkets and other businesses needed to be sure they could continue to supply consumers. Mr Gove has also asked the EU to examine its decision to ban the import into Northern Ireland of some items like seed potatoes, and the UK wants the Irish government to be able to negotiate a deal with the UK to remove barriers to pets being taken across the Irish Sea. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic tweeted that the protocol was ""a cornerstone"" of the agreement between the UK and EU, and ""the only way to protect Good Friday Agreement"". What happens to parcels or dogs moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland might sound like small issues. But they are huge, because they threaten to break one of the things that was part of the promise in the post-Brexit protocol - that what happened would not disrupt the daily lives of people living in Northern Ireland. And, as we have seen in the past few days, this combination of all of these small changes could destabilise the very sensitive balance in Northern Ireland between the two different communities. The government has no intention of ditching this protocol. That is not going to happen, even though the past few days have given the DUP and some Eurosceptics reason to call again for it to be abandoned. But the government is really clear that they want to very quickly persuade the EU, as one minister put it to me, to start being pragmatic about this, rather than being purist. When the Brexit transition period ended in January, Northern Ireland remained in the EU single market while the rest of the UK left, meaning that checks had to be carried out on goods arriving from Great Britain. Unionists have criticised these rules, known as the Northern Ireland protocol, as damaging to trade and posing a risk to UK unity. In recent days, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas, referring to staff carrying out checks on goods at ports as ""targets"". Stormont suspended physical checks on food consignments at two ports on Tuesday amid the security concerns, although police said paramilitary groups are not involved. Mr Johnson said on Twitter that his commitment to people of Northern Ireland and the union was ""unshakeable"". He called for ""urgent action from the EU to resolve outstanding problems"" with the way the protocol was implemented, to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and ensure ""Northern Ireland benefits from Brexit just like every other part of our United Kingdom"". Recent moves by the EU had ""undermined the protocol and understandably provoked concern"", he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ireland's Mr Coveney said ""elements of protocol are causing problems"" and the two sides ""need to focus on improving"" it, but he said Brexit was to blame for growing tensions in Northern Ireland, rather than the protocol itself. He told Today: ""Senior political figures need to talk seriously now about trying to diffuse tension which is clearly there and need to talk about how we can make protocol work effectively. ""[The protocol] is an Irish and British and EU negotiated solution, an agreed solution to try to limit the disruptive impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""What is causing all of this tension is Brexit, not the protocol. The protocol is an attempt to try and reduce tension and solve problems linked to Brexit."" Amid a dispute with manufacturers over supplies, the EU on Friday briefly threatened to use an emergency measure to override part of the deal and restrict the export of vaccines. It was concerned that Northern Ireland could be used as a way to bypass export controls, using its place in the single market as a backdoor to the rest of the UK. The dispute has intensified pressure among some unionist politicians to end the checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with the DUP saying it intends to work with other unionist parties to send a message thatNorthern Ireland must be ""freed from the protocol"". Ms Foster, the party's leader, is due to meet Mr Johnson on Wednesday morning, to discuss her concerns before attending the talks with the EU Commission in the afternoon. Also at the talks will be Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, who said the DUP was  ""whipping up hysteria"" while others were ""calling for calm and resolution"". Mr Coveney said the move by the Commission on Friday had been ""a mistake"", adding: ""It should not have happened and would not have happened if there had been the appropriate consultation."" Part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. It was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. However, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but laterreversed the decision. Unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

Hancock hails vaccine for slowing virus spread,"It is the first time a study has shown a vaccine can reduce the spread of Covid-19 Results that show the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus have been hailed as ""absolutely superb"" by the health secretary. Matt Hancock said the study shows ""vaccines are the way out of this pandemic"". It is the first time a vaccine has been shown to reduce transmission of the virus. The UK has given a first Covid jab to more than 10 million people so far. The results of the study, which hasnot yet been formally published,external, suggest that the vaccine may have a ""substantial"" effect on transmission of the virus. It means the jab could have a greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who is vaccinated will indirectly protect other people too. Mr Hancock called the study ""really encouraging"" on Twitter, adding that the results were ""absolutely superb"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said this latest analysis showing the vaccine reduces transmission would ""help us all get out of this pandemic"". Mr Hancock said passing the 10 million mark for people who have received a first dose was a ""hugely significant milestone"",tweeting that ""every jab makes us all a bit safer"",external. How effective is the Oxford vaccine? Oxford vaccine could substantially cut spread How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? When will I get a Covid vaccine? The study by the University of Oxford, where the vaccine was developed, measured the impact on transmission by testing for asymptomatic infections, swabbing participants every week in addition to recording when anyone fell ill with Covid-19. As well as showing an effect on transmission, the study found the vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months. With no fall in protection during the three-month period, the researchers said the results supported gaps between first and second doses of between four and 12 weeks. The effectiveness of the vaccine increased with a longer gap of 12 weeks before the booster jab. When the second dose is given, the study found the level of protection from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rises to 82%. In other developments: One of the world's largest follow-up Covid studies found almost 90% of people who tested positive for Covid hadprotective antibodies against the virussix months after their initial infection The number of people with coronavirus has changed little in the week to 23 January,the Office for National Statistics says,,externalwith virus levels still high in England (one in 55) and level in Scotland (one in 110), Wales (one in 70) and Northern Ireland (one in 50) The UK has set itself apart from many other countries by prioritising giving the first dose to as many people as possible, delaying the second jab for about 12 weeks. The aim is to save more lives by giving some protection to a larger number of people, but the UK has faced criticism from the British Medical Association for following this path with no international support. Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said the results supported the UK's approach to delaying the booster shot. It ""reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine,"" he says. The new analysis of the Oxford vaccine suggests that transmission of the virus from those who have been vaccinated could be substantially reduced. If verified by the scientific review process, it means that as more people get the jab, infection levels could come down faster than they would otherwise and enable the government to lift restrictions sooner than they could otherwise. One in six of the population has had at least one jab so far. There's still a long way to go but the impact on case numbers could begin to be felt in the coming weeks. The fly in the ointment though is the recent emergence in the UK of variants that may be more resistant to some vaccines. Experts believe that jabs will still offer good protection especially against severe illness, but even so this could slow progress. The race is now on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, in order to keep a step ahead of the variants. The government is also trying to slow the spread of variants through enhanced surveillance and testing. But a critical part of the strategy is to drive down infection levels, so people don't catch the virus in the first place, whatever variant it might be. In France, use of the Oxford vaccine has been restricted by health authorities who say it should only be given to people under 65. Mr Hancock, the UK health secretary, said scientists had looked directly at the over-65s and there was ""a high degree of confidence"" that the Oxford vaccine worked on people of all ages. He added that the latest research showed the world the vaccine works - ""it works well"" and ""categorically supports"" the government's strategy. Asked if it could now mean children in England returning to school before 8 March, he pointed out 30,000 people were still in hospital. ""We've got to get this right down,"" he told the Today programme. ""It's too soon to be able to take action in England and we've set out the timescale because we think that's when we should be able to take action, if all goes well."" Alongside the Oxford vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is also being rolled out across the UK. Clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna, which has been approved but is not yet in use, did not look for a potential impact on transmission. However, BBC health correspondent James Gallagher said the different vaccines all target the same part of the virus so if one can cut transmission, there is a good chance the others can too. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The data from this latest trial was drawn before new variants, including the South Africa one, emerged. Asked how protective the Oxford vaccine could be against new mutations, Dr Pollard said he was anticipating ""good protection"" against the Kent variant and would publish details ""very soon"". On other variants, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When we look at the new mutations that have been arising in other countries and now also here in the UK - that is the virus trying to escape from human immunity, and that's whether it's from vaccines or from infection. ""I think that's telling us about what's to come, which is a virus that continues to transmit, but hopefully that will be like other coronaviruses that are around us all the time, which cause colds and mild infections. ""We will have built up enough immunity to prevent the other severe disease that we've been seeing over the last year."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Medics and residents stand against Myanmar coup,"This video can not be played People in Yangon banged pots and pans to protest against the military coup Resistance to Monday's army takeover in Myanmar is growing, with residents of the biggest city Yangon banging pots and pans, and honking car horns. Medical staff in several major cities are planning strikes, while activists are calling for a campaign of civil disobedience. However, correspondents say the military appears firmly in control. Calls are growing for the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has not been seen since her detention. Over 100 lawmakers had been confined by the military in their accommodation in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, but have now been told they can leave. The military took power in the early hours of Monday and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing Ms Suu Kyi's party of fraud over its recent election win. All you need to know about the coup Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? Her National League for Democracy (NLD) has demanded her immediate release. It also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. However, the military has appointed a new election commission and chief of police. The previous commission found no evidence of election fraud. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in. The country was calm in the aftermath of the coup, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. Communications systems disrupted by the coup returned by Tuesday morning. Growing up under Myanmar's military rule Military coup likely to damage Myanmar's economy But as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. Youth and student groups also called for civil disobedience campaigns, and a Facebook page for the campaign gained over 100,000 likes. Doctors working in government hospitals said they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. Some medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest.

At least one doctor has quit in protest, saying ""such coups cannot be tolerated at all"". Dr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: ""I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them."" The military says the takeover was ""inevitable"" Another doctor involved in the campaign, Myo Thet Oo, told Reuters news agency: ""We cannot accept dictators and an unelected government. ""They can arrest us anytime. We have decided to face it... All of us have decided not to go to the hospital."" Power has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, were replaced. In the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been ""inevitable"" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud. There have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday. But unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest. Aung San Suu Kyi is still in detention after the military coup Ms Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to ""protest against the coup"" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship. She was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. How the military disrupted the internet Who is the general behind the coup? This video can not be played Myanmar coup: What's happened so far? Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China. Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011. Nearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more. US President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not ""overrule the will of the people,external"". Later the State Department declared events in Myanmar to be a coup and said it would review foreign aid to the country. Along with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. UK Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams said he hoped a phone call planned with Ms Suu Kyi later this week would go ahead to confirm her safety. It is unclear though how much effect the warnings from Western countries will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans.
