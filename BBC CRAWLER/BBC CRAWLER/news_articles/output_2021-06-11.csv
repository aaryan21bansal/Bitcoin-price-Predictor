Is there a limit to how bad variants can get?,"Oxygen cylinders in India, where the more transmissible Delta variant was first seen It is clear we are now dealing with a virus that spreads far more easily - probably more than twice as easily - as the version that emerged in Wuhan at the end of 2019. The Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, UK, performed a large jump in its ability to transmit. Now Delta, seen first in India, leapt further still. This is evolution in action. So are we doomed to a never-ending parade of new and improved variants that get harder and harder to contain? Or is there a limit to how much worse coronavirus can become? It's worth remembering the journey this virus is on. It has made the jump from infecting a completely different species - itsclosest relatives are in bats,external- to us. It's like you, starting a new job: you're competent, but not the finished article. The first variant was good enough to start a devastating pandemic, but now it's learning on the job. When viruses jump to humans it would be ""very rare for them to be perfect,"" said Prof Wendy Barclay, a virologist from Imperial College London. ""They settle in and then they have a great time."" There are examples of viruses, she said, from flu pandemics to Ebola outbreaks, making the jump and then accelerating. So how far could it go? The cleanest way of comparing the pure biological spreading power of viruses is to look at their R0 (pronounced R-naught). It's the average number of people each infected person passes a virus on to if nobody were immune and nobody took extra precautions to avoid getting infected. That number was around 2.5 when the pandemic started in Wuhan and could be as high as 8.0 for the Delta variant, according to disease modellers at Imperial. ""This virus has surprised us a lot. It is beyond anything we feared,"" said Dr Aris Katzourakis, who studies viral evolution at the University of Oxford. ""The fact it has happened twice in 18 months, two lineages (Alpha and then Delta) each 50% more transmissible is a phenomenal amount of change."" It's ""foolish"", he thinks, to attempt to put a number on how high it could go, but he can easily see further jumps in transmission over the next couple of years. Other viruses have far higher R0s and the record holder, measles, can cause explosive outbreaks. ""There is still space for it to move higher,"" said Prof Barclay. ""Measles is between 14 and 30 depending on who you ask, I don't know how it's going to play out."" So, how are the variants doing it? There are many tricks the virus could employ to get better at spreading, such as: improving how it opens the doorway to our body's cells surviving longer in the air increasing the viral load so patients breathe or cough out more viruses changing when in the course of an infection it spreads to another person One way the Alpha variantbecame more transmissible,externalwas by getting better at sneaking past the intruder alarm - called the interferon response - inside our body's cells. But this does not mean that by the time we work through the Greek alphabet of variants and reach Omega that we'll end up with an unstoppable beast. ""Ultimately there are limits and there isn't a super-ultimate virus that has every bad combination of mutations,"" said Dr Katzourakis. There is also the concept of evolutionary trade-offs - in order to become better at one thing you often get worse at something else. The fastest vaccination programme in history will give the virus a different hurdle to overcome and squeeze it in another evolutionary direction. ""It is quite possible that changes in the virus that make it better at avoiding vaccines could end up compromising its ability to transmit in an absolute sense,"" said Dr Katzourakis. He thinks the Beta variant - which has a mutation called E484K that helps evade the immune system but hasn't managed to take off - is an example of this. However, the Delta does have mutations that both help it spread and partially dodge immunity. What will turn out to be the optimal strategy for coronavirus is still hard to predict. Different viruses use different techniques to keep on infecting. Measles is explosive, but leaves behind lifelong immunity so it always has to find someone new. Influenza has a much lower R0, barely above 1, but constantly mutates to side-step immunity. ""We're in a really interesting, intermediate and somewhat unpredictable phase, it is difficult to predict how that's going to play out a year from now,"" said Prof Barclay. One thing that is often claimed, but attracts scientific scorn, is that the virus must get milder in order to spread more easily. There is very little evolutionary pressure on the virus for that to happen. The virus is already off into the next person long before it kills the person it infected. And the people who do the most spreading (younger people) are those who don't get very ill. In rich countries with good vaccination campaigns it is hoped the next variants won't be able to pose a major problem due to widespread immunity. But these progressively more transmissible variants are a nightmare for the rest of the world where they are making it harder and harder to stay on top of Covid.

Kent to turn away lone child migrants from Monday,"Children arriving by boat risk overwhelming services, KCC says Kent County Council says it will not be taking on any unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Monday as it has reached ""the limit of safe capacity"". The council hasthreatened legal actionagainst the Home Secretary over the ""extreme pressure"" on its services. More than 400 such children are in the care of the council. The government's recommended maximum number is 231. The Home Office on Thursday announced measures encouraging other local authorities to take on child migrants. Kent County Council (KCC)had to take similar action in August. Children arriving next week will be taken by Border Force to the Kent Intake Unit at Dover. They would usually then be passed on to KCC, but now they will now remain the responsibility of the Home Office, who will have to find places for them with other local authorities, KCC said. By Mark Easton, Home Editor, BBC News For a Conservative council to threaten a Conservative Home Secretary with legal action is indicative of the frustration and anger felt in Kent at the unfolding crisis hitting the county for the second time in ten months. Unless another council agrees to help, Kent County Council has a legal duty to take care of any unaccompanied child migrant that arrives among the thousands of asylum seekers who turn up on its coast each year. But Kent's leaders say the current voluntary transfer scheme is not good enough, and despite extra government cash and a new rota system, it is inevitable that highly vulnerable children at the end of a long and traumatic journey will be left in a psychologically-damaging limbo. This Tory authority appears determined to follow through on its threat to take the Home Secretary to court unless she forces other local authorities to share the burden. Priti Patel, however, is reluctant to oblige councils to take responsibility for child asylum-seekers. Council leader Roger Gough said: ""I am profoundly saddened to be in this unthinkable position once again in such a short period of time. ""Despite warnings, and continued dialogue with government, Kent's UASC [unaccompanied asylum-seeking children] support resources are again significantly overwhelmed."" Kent County Council believes it can no longer safely accept new arrivals Mr Gough said no further arrivals could be accepted until ""sufficient transfers have been made outside of Kent bringing our numbers back to safe levels"". He said it was ""a small problem for the nation to resolve but a huge and unreasonable responsibility for Kent"". KCC has taken its first steps in legal action against Home Secretary Priti Patel and wants her to make other councils take ""their fair share"". Without any substantive response to its proposals by 17 June, KCC said it would issue a claim for judicial review. Child migrant legal threat to Home Secretary How many migrant children cross the Channel? Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? A Home Office spokesman said: ""The Home Office is grateful for the role KCC has played in supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, and we have provided them with substantial operational support, including transferring those in need of support to other local authorities in the UK. ""We recently announced vital updates to the National Transfer Scheme to alleviate pressures on certain areas and continue to work closely across Government on provision for unaccompanied minors."" So far this year at least 4,449 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats, with 925 people arriving in Dover in the first 10 days of June.

Sony Music writes off pop stars' decades-old debts,"The move was announced by Sony boss Rob Stringer, pictured with BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z (who are not eligible for the scheme) Sony Music has cancelled the debts of thousands of artists who signed to the record label before the year 2000. It means that many will now, for the first time, earn money when their songs are streamed on services like Spotify and Amazon Music. Sony said it could not name the eligible acts due to confidentiality agreements, but a source said it would ""include household names"". It said some artists stood to receive ""many thousands of dollars per year"". Pop icons TLC were left with millions of dollars in debt thanks to their record deal with LaFace Records in the 1990s Musicians typically take on debt when they first sign to a record label. They are given a lump sum, known as an advance, to pay for recording studios, video shoots, distribution and other expenses. The money is then paid back when they sell their music. However, many artists never earn enough to repay their advances, often because they get unfavourable royalty rates from their own record companies. Heritage black artists have been particularly affected. And until the debt to their label is repaid, those artists are not eligible to receive income from streaming, and other royalty payments. Stones and Jones call for streaming reforms Meet the writers who told pop stars: 'Stop stealing' Classic bands accused of crowding out new music That's how an act like TLC, who were signed to Sony subsidiary LaFace Records, ended up declaring bankruptcy in the 1990s. The R&B stars declared debts of $3.5m, despite having one of the decade's best selling albums, CrazySexyCool. Sony's announcement came in a letter to artists on Friday, a copy of which has been shared with the BBC. ""We are not modifying existing contracts, but choosing to pay through on existing unrecouped balances to increase the ability of those who qualify to receive more money from uses of their music,"" it said. In other words, the debt hasn't been explicitly wiped out - but Sony will ignore it and pay royalties to affected acts, backdated to 1 January 2021. Music industry lawyer Aurelia Butler-Ball said the scheme would ""unlock"" streaming revenues that artists were not previously entitled to, under contracts signed during the CD and cassette era. ""Many of the record deals [made] before 2000 didn't recognise that streaming platforms would ever exist,"" she said. ""Therefore, artists didn't have the right mechanisms in place to see those revenues."" This video can not be played Tom Gray: 'I get paid nothing when someone streams my music' Sony's initative comes amid mounting pressure on the record industry to be more transparent about the way it distributes money, particularly from streaming services. A parliamentary inquiry is currently looking into the streaming economy, prompted by the vocal #BrokenRecord campaign, which seeks to address the imbalance in how profits are shared between record labels, musicians and the streaming services themselves. Gomez musician Tom Gray, who founded the campaign, said Sony's move was ""incredibly welcome"". ""From the perspective of somebody who's been running a campaign to try and get these companies to behave more ethically and transparently, it feels like a win,"" he told the BBC. Butler-Ball, who is a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said the initiative was something musicians had been ""pushing for"" for some time, but that it was only when the public began to take notice of the #BrokenRecord and #FixStreaming campaigns that record companies felt they had to act. ""I think this is absolutely a sign of labels recognising that there is pressure coming from not only artists but fan bases, and it's increasingly being talked about publicly,"" she said. Sony is not the first company to take such a step. Indie label Beggars Group, which is home to acts like Grimes, Jarvis Cocker and The xx, has previously written off unrecouped balances on older contracts. However, Sony is the only major label to do so. Its direct competitors, Universal and Warner Music, may feel they should follow suit - but Gray says they should go even further by fixing the low royalty rates given to artists in the 1960s and 70s. ""If that person's on a 5% royalty, they're not suddenly going to start earning lots of money,"" he said, referring to the new deal. ""If you look at what labels like BMG are doing now, where they're doing standard 30% deals [where artists gets 70% of the money], then Sony haven't even got to what 'good' looked like a decade ago."" Why the Church of England co-owns a BeyoncÃ© hit Meanwhile, Sony's move could enable heritage artists to sell their song catalogues to interested buyers - as Bob Dylan, Blondie and Barry Manilow have all recently done. ""There are plenty of funds out there looking to buy catalogues at multiple of 10 times and above [in exhange] for artist royalties,"" music consultant Alasiter Moughan told the BBC. ""If an artist was unrecouped a potential buyer might want the artist to pay this balance back or not purchase the royalties at all, as no actual cash would be flowing through. ""This change in policy from Sony could be significant for an artist in this position."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Last year, the reality starvisited the White House with prisoners she helped to free. Crystal Munoz, Judith Negron and Tynice Hall had their jail sentences cut short after Kardashian West lobbied US President Donald Trump. The women had been jailed for drug-related and white collar crimes, and all had young children when imprisoned. Kardashian West is also campaigning for changes to the US justice system, particularly long sentences handed down to first-time offenders and the disproportionate effect on ethnic minority communities.

Jail for rapist who faked his death at 'Mortuary Beach',"Avis following his arrest by US Marshals A rapist who tried to evade justice by fleeing Scotland then faking his own death at one of California's most dangerous beaches has been jailed for 15 years. Kim Avis, a market trader from Inverness, was eventually tracked down more than 1,000 miles away in Colorado, then brought home to Scotland - where he was convicted of rape and sexual abuse offences committed in the Highlands. The Scot had been on bail when he flew into Los Angeles International Airport on 16 February 2019, and was using the name Ken Gordon-Avis. Nine days later, his son reported him missing at Monastery Beach, telling the local sheriff's office that his dad had gone for an evening swim. The beach is near Carmel-by-the-Sea, a city of about 3,800 people on the Big Sur - a rugged and mountainous stretch of Californian coastline. Avis was reported missing at Monastery Beach on California's Big Sur Monastery Beach is renowned for its beautiful sand - and notorious for its water's dangerous strong undertow and treacherous high surf conditions. Deaths of swimmers and divers led to it being nicknamed Mortuary Beach. Mary Schley, who has been a reporter on the Carmel Pine Cone newspaper for almost 23 years, said that nickname was ""well entrenched"". ""The beach is full of posted warnings,"" she said. ""Numerous people, including experienced divers, have drowned there."" Scot who went missing in US guilty of rapes Sex assault accused says claims 'like a film script' Man was 'in trance' during alleged sex attack Man tried to rape girl, 12, then 'joked about it' The authorities were initially unaware of Avis' background and an extensive three-day search of the shore and sea was carried out. However, from the start some things did not seem quite right. ""The water is very cold, so it's unusual for someone to go swimming only in a pair of shorts in the evening in late February, when it's nearing dark, as Avis was said to have done,"" said Ms Schley. ""The water that night was unusually flat and calm, and therefore not nearly as dangerous as when the surf is high, and the weather was clear."" The search, which was co-ordinated by the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, included forestry and fire protection personnel, a dive team, a coastguard helicopter and a drone which swept the area. Sgt David Murray, of Monterey Sheriff's Office, had felt that something did not add up But Commander Derrel Simpson said one of his officers, Sgt David Murray, felt something did not add up. Avis appeared to have taken all his personal belongings - including his passport - with him on the swim. The sheriff's office was also told that the father and son had been staying in hotels and been camping, but they had no equipment for a hiking trip. Sgt Murray found out that the hotel where Avis was said to have stayed had no record of him as a guest. When he contacted one of Avis' relatives in Scotland, he learned that the missing man was facing charges of sexual attacks against women and girls in the Highlands. Commander Simpson, a 30-year sheriff's office veteran, said: ""We have had a lot of deaths at Monastery Beach, but I can't think of anyone using it as a ploy before."" Search teams looking for Avis at Monastery Beach in February 2019 in an image from TV new station KSBW The investigation was turned over to the US Marshals Service, which has responsibility for catching wanted criminals. Over the next few months, Monterey sheriff's deputies worked with US Marshals, Interpol and the Scottish authorities to secure an arrest and extradition warrant for Avis. They established that Avis had entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport, using a different name. It also emerged that his bank account had been used in Colorado after his disappearance in California. Commander Simpson said the most valuable tip-off they received was that Avis had been seen driving a white Ford van in the Big Sur area. Five months after he disappeared, that piece of information helped US Marshals trace Avis in Colorado Springs - more than 1,300 miles (2,092km) away from where he was reported missing. The following week, on 27 July 2019, he was arrested. Kim Avis ran a stall selling jewellery in Inverness Commander Simpson said bringing Avis to justice was a team effort. ""It was impressive how everyone played a part, including the Scottish authorities - and how the US Marshals tracked him half way across the country,"" he said. Avis was returned to Scotland, where he was held in prison until his trial. Last month, a jury at the High Court in Glasgow found the 57-year-old market trader guilty of raping three women. He was also found guilty of attempting to rape one of them when she was 12, and guilty of sexually assaulting a girl when she was 11. He was further convicted of failing to appear for the previous trial. In total, Avis was found guilty of 14 charges from between 2006 and 2017. He had denied all the charges. On Friday, Avis was jailed for 12 years for the sex crimes he committed in the Highlands, and three years for failing to appear in court. Judge Lord Sandison said Avis had been a well-known street trader in Inverness for many years, busking and selling jewellery from his market stall - and even receiving a good citizen award. But the judge said there was another side to Avis, with a background report describing him as ""a controlling and dominant personality"". He said Avis had manipulated, managed and coerced his victims. Fraser Gibson, of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, said it had been a ""difficult and complex"" investigation. He said: ""Kim Avis went to great lengths to evade justice for his crimes. ""Thanks to the efforts of police and prosecutors, working together with US law enforcement, he has been brought to justice and sentenced today."" Police Scotland praised his victims for the ""courage, strength and dignity"" they had shown throughout the investigation and court case.

Johnson kicks off G7 with plea to tackle inequality,"The Queen was greeted by the PM and his wife Carrie as she arrived at Friday evening's dinner Boris Johnson has urged fellow world leaders to ""build back better"" after the Covid pandemic at this week's G7 summit in Cornwall. The UK prime minister said it was vital to learn from the ""mistakes"" of the 2008 financial crisis and tackle the ""scar"" of inequality. After a day of talks at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay, leaders have joined the Queen for a dinner nearby. The distribution of Covid vaccines is also high on the summit agenda. Earlier, the leaders posed for a group photo with the Queen, where the monarch was heard to joke: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?"" The leaders around the Queen laughed, and Mr Johnson replied emphatically: ""Yes."" The prime minister added: ""We have been enjoying ourselves - in spite of appearances."" Allow Twitter content?

US President Joe Biden is among those being hosted by Mr Johnson for the three-day meeting, as well the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada. It is the first face-to-face summit of the G7 - representing most of the world's biggest economies - since before the pandemic started early last year. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel are also attending. Why are world leaders coming to Cornwall In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party In his opening remarks at the main round-table discussions, Mr Johnson said that, as the world recovered from the pandemic, it was important to ""level up across our societies"" and ""build back better"". He added: ""I actually think that we have a huge opportunity to that because, as G7, we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world, a solution to the problems of climate change."" The prime minister also said it was ""vital that we don't repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis - the last great economic recession of 2008 - when the recovery was not uniform across all parts of society"". Politicians are attending a Friday evening reception at the nearby Eden Project, attended by the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Mr Johnson and US President Joe Biden attended a session earlier on economic recovery after Covid The UK governmentannounced it was giving Â£430m in aid to the Global Partnership for Education, to help the world's ""most vulnerable children"" get better schooling, with a ""particular"" focus on girls. It was important for the world economy to rebuild in a ""more equal and... in a more gender-neutral and perhaps a more feminine way"" after the huge damage caused by coronavirus, Mr Johnson told his fellow leaders. As camera crews and photographers left the meeting room at the Carbis Bay Hotel, he joked that what had been intended as a ""fireside chat"" had turned into a ""media circus"". Several of the European leaders enjoyed a seaside drink before the talks started Tweeting a photograph of himself,externalwith some of the other European leaders sitting on a seaside terrace, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote: ""As always, the same union, the same determination to act, the same enthusiasm! The G7 can begin."" As G7 leaders got round the table and down to business Boris Johnson's opening remarks initially followed a familiar pattern as he talked about ""building back better"". But he ended on a less familiar pledge to build back in a ""more gender-neutral"" and ""feminine"" way. So what does that mean? Downing Street sources are pointing to the PM's education announcement. Mr Johnson, I'm told, wants to improve the prospects of girls around the world. While the prime minister's terminology may cause some to cringe a little (""ugh, just ugh,"" remarked one senior Tory MP), the underlying aim might attract praise, even if the UK government is temporarily cutting its overseas aid budget overall. But, more broadly, the prime minister is keen to insert his ""build back better"" domestic agenda into the international scene. ""Build back better"" also happens to be the name of Joe Biden's mammoth jobs and recovery plan. For any G7 leader, the world stage is still a chance to reach the audience at home. Mr Johnson has pledged the UK will donate more than 100 million Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. But some charities and campaigners have criticised the scale of the UK's plan, under which 5 million doses will be given out by the end of September, with 25 million by the end of 2021 and the rest provided during 2022. Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was ""not happening anywhere near fast enough"", and called on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away. And US pop star Selena Gomez told her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that the promise to deliver 5 million vaccines by the end of September was ""too little too late"". Ms Gomez was among anumber of celebritieswho took part in a concert aimed at increasing access to Covid vaccines in April. Mr Biden also appeared at the event, as did Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022. The World Health Organization estimates 11 billion doses will be needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly affected. Security is tight, with thousands of extra police having been sent to Cornwall Hundreds of people joineda march in St Ives,just along the coast from Carbis Bay, urging leaders to ""address the climate and ecological emergency"". Three people were arrested a few miles away from the summit venue earlier on suspicion of possession of an article with intent to commit criminal damage, and four were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance.

Monk admits abuse after victim's fight for justice,"Fr Denis ""Chrysostom"" Alexander arrived at court in a wheelchair A former monk at a Catholic boarding school has pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse, bringing to an end one victim's eight-year fight for justice. Fr Denis ""Chrysostom"" Alexander, who is now 85, admitted two charges of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices against two boys between 1973 and 1976. The offences took place at the Fort Augustus Abbey school in the Highlands. Alexander, an Australian national, was first named as a paedophile by a BBC Scotland documentary in 2013. One of his victims was Hugh Kennedy, now aged 58. He was in court and afterwards said his nightmare was ""now finally over."" Alexander has been in custody in Australia and then Scotland since 2017. He will be sentenced next month. The allegations relate to the former Fort Augustus Abbey Roman Catholic boarding school Fort Augustus Abbey, at the southern end of Loch Ness, had been monastery for more than 100 years. The austere Benedictine monks who lived there operated a prestigious fee-paying Catholic boarding school, thought of as one of the best in the country. The imposing abbey and school buildings were neatly tucked away behind the trees on the outskirts of the town. The monks were rarely seen by locals, and were thought of as an amusing peculiarity. At its peak, about 300 pupils would board at the school. Hugh Kennedy enrolled in 1974; a wide-eyed, blonde-haired boy of 11 who loved sport. He was exactly the type of boy expected to excel within this environment. But the strict and regularly brutal regime at Fort Augustus, alongside a hierarchical culture of bullying by his peers, would soon have him living in fear. One teacher in particular had started to single him out for special punishment. Fr Denis Alexander, also known as Fr Chrysostom, was an Australian priest who had arrived at Fort Augustus in the 1950s, around the same time as his fellow Australians, Frs Aidan and Fabian Duggan. Fr Aidan Duggan was another Australian priest at the school Each of this trio could be sadistically violent and would be eventually be exposed by the BBC as child sex abusers. Hugh Kennedy says Alexander would call him to his room, where he would be told to take his pants down and he would cane his bare backside. ""He was softening me up, I now understand,"" Hugh says. ""I used to ask him why he was doing this but he just told me to shut up. ""I was receiving inexplicable beatings. He once made me kneel against the wall for six hours - he was terrorising me. ""Then suddenly it turned around on a sixpence. The beatings stopped; I was put back on his social list, which meant special treats like toast in his office, and yoga lessons. I was even made head altar boy. ""But this was all part of the grooming process, just to get me used to saying yes to everything."" Hugh Kennedy attended the school in 1970s Soon after, the sexual abuse started. One night, in the dormitory Hugh shared with more than a dozen other boys, he awoke with a start to the smell of whisky close to his face. Alexander had crept into Hugh's dorm and abused him on his top bunk while the boy below him slept. ""By the next day, I'd convinced myself it hadn't happened,"" Hugh says. But the abuse escalated, and during a yoga class, Alexander carried out a serious sexual attack on Hugh. ""He told me it was a special thing between the two of us and no-one needed to know about it, and that no-one would believe me in any case,"" Hugh says. The abuse by Alexander stopped, but later he was abused by another man at the school - an art teacher called Bill Owen, who is now dead - fuelling fears that abusive staff had shared victims. Hugh says the abuse by Owen was serious and lasted several years. ""I believe it was organised, that there was a bit of 'pass the parcel' going on,"" Hugh says. Hugh decided to tell someone about the abuse by Alexander. He told his step-mother and the headmaster at the time, Fr Francis Davidson. However, Davidson took Alexander's side and allowed the monk to visit Hugh's step-mother at home, to persuade her that her son was lying. It worked, and Hugh was returned to the school. The police were never called. Fr Chrysostom was known as the ""piping monk"" because of his love of the bagpipes Fr Chrysostom, who was known as the ""piping monk"" because of his love of the bagpipes, was free to carry on abusing. And he did. Nearly a decade ago, alongside producer Murdoch Rodgers, I started investigating allegations of abuse at Fort Augustus. We met former Fort Augustus pupil Brendan, not his real name, who told us he had been repeatedly abused by Alexander when aged 13. He had struggled with his mental health throughout his life, a condition rooted in, he believes, the abuse he suffered at the hands of the monk he knew as Fr Chrysostom It was Brendan's story which started us on our path of investigating Alexander, who we knew had abruptly returned to his native Australia in 1977. Brendan had raised the alarm about Alexander's abuse, and his parents complained to the school. The matter was once more dealt with internally by Fr Francis Davidson. There would be no police involvement, but this time Alexander was sent home to Australia. Father Francis Davidson dealt with complaints against Alexander I had wanted to find and confront Alexander in Australia but needed more evidence. Then Brendan told us about a letter he'd been written by Alexander. It had been an apology - a confession - written to him and his parents on his return to Australia. Brendan told us he'd been so angry he'd ripped it into pieces and threw it in the bin. Crucial evidence, apparently destroyed 35 years previously in the heat of the moment But unknown to Brendan, his father had taped it back together and kept it. Brendan's father taped the letter back together after he ripped it up The letter reads: ""I am writing this letter with some consideration to apologise for the events of last term. I ask forgiveness not only for the incidents themselves but for the considerable distress it must have causedâ¦ ""All I can say is that I was under severe strain for the past 18 monthsâ¦"" It was all the evidence I needed. I tracked Alexander down to a quiet suburb of Sydney. He'd been allowed to take up the priesthood in Australia without any prior warnings about his offending being given by the Benedictines. In fact, he'd been sent a cheque for Â£50,000 in 2000 by the Benedictines, after the Fort Augustus Abbey had been closed and its affairs wound up. This was despite his confession about abusing children. Unfettered by allegations about his past, he worked as a supply priest in Sydney for more than 20 years, attending holy communions and baptisms up until his retirement in the 2000s. Cameraman Alan Harcus and I watched his home for eight days, waiting for the opportunity to put Brendan's allegations to him. Finally, just hours before we were due to fly home, he emerged from his front door. The former monk refused to engage with my questions, told me to ""go to blazes"" and get off his property, then rammed his car into mine. He'd been defiant, but this was a watershed moment in the investigation. The clock was now running. This video can not be played Father Chrysostom Alexander is accused of abuse while teaching at a Catholic school The confrontation featured our 2013 documentary Sins of Our Fathers, which sparked a chain of events which ultimately would lead to the setting up of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and a major police investigation into Alexander and others. The programme and subsequent follow-ups named more than a dozen Fort Augustus monks as abusers and several headmasters, including Fr Davidson, of covering up the abuse. Davidson, who is now dead, resigned from a religious post at Oxford university in the wake of the scandal. In 2013, Hugh Kennedy had just gone to the police about his abuse, and after watching the film, decided to speak publicly. Hugh had struggled with his mental health throughout his life and believes his experiences at Fort Augustus contributed to a breakdown of his marriage and put pressure on other relationships. He told me then that he wanted to apologise to his family ""for what I put them through"". He said that Alexander had to face the consequences for his actions, saying, ""I will face Chrysostom if needs beâ¦ because this is a bogeyman that's been on my shoulder my whole life."" Today, he says that had he known what the experience of going through the criminal justice system would be for a survivor of child sexual abuse, he would never have come forward. ""It has been eight years of pain,"" Hugh said. July 2013: BBC airs Sins of Our Fathers, revealing decades of sexual and physical abuse at the Fort Augustus Abbey School and Carlkemp preparatory school, and confronts Fr Alexander in Sydney December 2015: The Crown announces plans to extradite Fr Alexander back to Scotland January 2017: Fr Alexander is arrested in Sydney and remanded in custody May 2017: Fr Alexander is found eligible for extradition by an Australian court. He appeals, claiming he is too ill to travel March 2019: The attorney general of Australia determines that Fr Alexander be surrendered to the UK. Fr Alexander seeks a judicial review. September 2019: The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry takes evidence about Fort Augustus November 2019: The Federal Court of Australia dismisses Fr Alexander's application for a judicial review December 2019: Fr Alexander fails to lodge an appeal against the federal court ruling within the 28-day deadline January 2020: Fr Alexander is extradited to Scotland June 2021: Fr Alexander pleads guilty to two charges What followed for Hugh Kennedy was a rollercoaster eight years of not knowing whether his abuser would ever face justice. It was more than two years before the Crown Office sought Alexander's extradition from Australia, then another two years before he was arrested. In the meantime, the BBC continued to report on Hugh's case and ask questions about the delays. Alexander had claimed he was too ill to be extradited and lodged several appeals. He had told the BBC before his arrest that he was being supported by the Catholic Church in Sydney, although this was denied by the church. Eventually, having expended all legal means of defiance, he was flown to Scotland in January last year. ""I was told the matter would be dealt with swiftly and expected a trial within a few months,"" said Hugh. Hugh Kennedy said the journey to this day was horrific But then the pandemic struck, and justice ground to halt. Even once trials resumed, Hugh felt the case had been put on the back burner. ""It was almost as if it would have been easier for them if he just passed away in his cell. ""To survive the abuse is one thing, but to survive going through the criminal justice system is another thing altogether. The journey is horrific. ""I was continually kept in the dark. ""There's so much that could have been done differently. There seems to be no insight into the mental trauma involved for victims. ""Initially I put my trust in these people, but then found myself being let down continually. There's a lack of compassion, you're treated dismissively and there seems to be total lack training for staff dealing with these sorts of situations ""I would have crumbled if it wasn't for the support I was getting. I've got a fairly strong constitution but I've not been particularly well during this process, and people with lesser capacity would have sunk and gone away. ""If the BBC hadn't been continually covering this case, I doubt I had the ability to get it this far. What about all the other people who haven't journalists keeping the story in the public eye? They've got no chance of getting a case like this to court. ""Something has to change to make it easier for people to go through this process."" Denis Alexander has never given a full public account of his time at the Fort Augustus Abbey school Until three days ago, Hugh had been living in fear that the case would be abandoned because of Alexander's failing health, or that he would die before going to trial. On Wednesday morning, he was told of Alexander's intention to plead guilty. In a voice racked with emotion, Hugh had struggled to get the words out when he called. ""All I've ever wanted was for him to admit what he's done to me and the others,"" he said. ""It's finally over."" He travelled up from the south of England overnight to see his ""bogeyman"" one final time. Dressed in a green prison jumper, Alexander listened to the court proceedings in his wheelchair. His defence counsel said the man sitting in court was very different to the one who carried out the offences. Hugh says he is now ready to get on with his life. The ghosts of Fort Augustus are fading, and despite the struggle, he knows he has achieved something that for years had hung in the balance. He'd survived, and he'd won justice. He said: ""There are others who didn't feel able to go through with this. So even if it has been a living nightmare for eight years, I feel I did something right, for Brendan, for me, and for the others who didn't make it this far.""

Drakeford says jabs buffer claim 'simply untrue'The first minister rejects a claim the Welsh vaccine strategy relied on an English buffer.Wales politics,"Mark Drakeford told Newsnight that Wales had drawn no vaccine from an ""English buffer"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has accused England's health secretary of making ""simply factually untrue"" comments about Wales' vaccine rollout. Matt Hancock said Wales had a faster programme becauseit could draw on England's supply if needed. But Mr Drakeford said Wales' success was based on the management of its own stocks, not any extra supply from the UK government. Wales currently has one of thebest vaccination programmes in the world. People aged 25 to 29 in Englandcan book to have their first dose of Covid vaccine, while in Wales nearly two thirds of 18 to 29-year-olds have had at least one dose of a vaccine. Latest figures on Friday, showed more than 300,000 people aged under 30 in Wales had been given a first doses, joining similar numbers in their 30s. Hancock says UK approach helped Wales jab quicker How is Wales leading the UK on vaccine rollout? Mr Hancock told MPs England had a slower rollout due to its ""buffer"" of supply. He said UK ministers needed to make sure there was always enough supply for second doses, while Wales could draw on England's supply if needed But Mr Drakeford told the BBC's Newsnight: ""It's simply factually untrue. ""We've drawn nothing out of an English buffer, we manage our own stocks and the fact that we have some of the best vaccination rates in the world is just because of the way in which the programme in Wales has been organised and delivered."" Mr Drakeford also said he was not prepared to follow England by announcing a date when all freedoms would be restored in Wales. ""I think it's too optimistic to say that vaccination has broken the link between falling ill and hospitalisation with the new Delta variant,"" he said. ""We really don't know that sufficiently to be confident that the vaccination is going to defend us in exactly that way. ""Wales is very largely free already. A great majority of things that people weren't able to do before, they're able to do already."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Wales was ""extremely fortunate to enjoy a world-leading vaccination programme"" but said it would not have been possible with a Labour government in Westminster. ""Let's make no bones about it. This first-class programme wouldn't have been possible if Labour had been calling the shots as Wales and the rest of Britain would have been stuck in the EU scheme,"" he said.

Four key numbers to watch out for,"The UK government faces a difficult choice in the next few days. Many people are desperate to see the return to normality promised by the final stage of the roadmap to lifting lockdown. But ministers always said 21 June was not set in stone - and could be affected by changes in the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants. What will they be weighing up as they make their final decision? Here are four key numbers to watch out for in the coming days. There are just under 1,000 people with coronavirus in hospitals in the UK, up about 5% from a low point a week ago. That's far below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January. And NHS Providers say the people who are going in aren't as seriously ill as they were in early waves. They are younger, or don't require intensive care as much - and they're coming out sooner. That means this wave is different, and better, than previous ones but eventually rising admissions will mount up. In the two parts of the UK that are furthest into this ""third wave"", the North West of England and Scotland, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is rising faster than the rest of the UK. How far and how fast this trend develops depends on how fast infections are rising and how likely you are to get seriously sick with the new variant. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Tuesday that the main type of coronavirus in the UK - the Delta variant first identified in India - is ""at least 40%"" more transmissible than the version that sparked the winter wave - the Alpha variant first seen in Kent. And as Delta takes over, infections are on the rise again. Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested thatUK infections had risen by 60% in a single week. If that growth rate remains steady or picks up, it suggests that cases will rise pretty quickly if and when society reopens further. We'll learn more on Friday. But rising infections on their own aren't a reason to extend lockdown. The government'skey test,externalis whether rising infections ""risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". And that also depends on your chances of getting seriously ill if you catch coronavirus. When could social distancing end? That is much harder to predict now than it was in the first or second waves, when scientists could predict what proportion of cases would need treatment. That's because vaccines do reduce your chance of getting really sick if you do get infected with any variant. Already we can see thatwhile people who have been double jabbed make up more than 40% of the population, they make up fewer than 5% of people who have been admitted to hospitalwith the Delta variant. But it does look like it takes two doses before someone gets high levels of protection from that variant. So there's a race on: double-jab as many people as possible, before the virus spreads enough to find the vulnerable or to put pressure on the NHS. More than 50% of adults have been given the best protection possible - two doses of the vaccine. That's still a way off herd immunity, even if you add in people who have some immunity from having had coronavirus in the past. Say each infected person would, on average, pass the virus on to six other people in a fully open society that hadn't seen the virus before. Then five out of six people, not just five out of six adults, would need to be able to fight off the virus - that would be the ""herd immunity threshold"". We're not there yet, and it's possible that the threshold is higher as Delta could be more infectious than imagined in this example. But every person vaccinated helps to slow the spread. How many people have been vaccinated so far? To predict what rising infections will mean for the NHS, you need to know how fast cases will rise and how many cases will get really sick. We don't know either figure precisely, and probably won't by 14 June. And a rough estimate doesn't help. The last time UK government modellers made their forecasts, the difference between ""40% more transmissible"" (the orange line below) and ""50% more transmissible"" (the blue line below) made a huge difference to the predicted severity of a third wave. And then, to know what to do about rising cases, you need to predict what effect any change to the rules might have on spread. It's uncertainty piled on uncertainty. To know the cost of that action, you need to know what effect another few weeks of being shut, or trading at a loss, would do to the businesses that are desperate to open up. It's a mammoth task and one that will require some old-fashioned political judgement as well as hi-tech epidemiological models. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Why are world leaders in UK?,"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

"Delay 21 June lockdown lifting, urge health leadersThe government is warned that unlocking in England on 21 June risks the country ""going backwards"".UKComments","Lifting the last Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be delayed to ""stop us going backwards"", public health officials have said. Unlocking then would risk an increase in hospital admissions, the Association of Directors of Public Health said. The government is expected to announce on Monday whether it will remove the last of the restrictions a week later. Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it had to be careful not to squander the progress made in tackling the virus. The final stage of lifting restrictions would see all legal limits on social contact removed. Nightclubs would reopen, and restrictions on performances, weddings and other life events would also be lifted. But concerns about the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, have led some scientists to call for a delay to ending lockdown. Public Health England (PHE) estimates the variantis roughly 60% more spreadablethan the previously dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, and could make people more seriously ill. The latest official data suggests there have been nearly 30,000 new UK cases of the Delta variant in the past week, accounting for 90% of cases. PHE said nearly two thirds of people infected with the Delta variant have not had a vaccine at all. Another 8,125 virus cases were recorded in the UK on Friday, according to official figures, and another 17 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Association of Directors of Public Health vice-president Jim McManus told Radio 4's Today programme the government had a ""fiendishly difficult decision"" to make on whether to ease restrictions further. However, he said if we ""invest that little bit of time to keep us going forwards, it will stop us going backwards"". ""If you get enough people infected, you will get a rise in hospitalisations,"" he said. Why we may have to wait longer for Freedom Day Lockdown lifting - the four key numbers When will we know if rules will change on 21 June? He added that more people getting infected would allow more variants to develop, which could risk a variant developing that evades the vaccine completely. ""So actually, investing a bit of time is really important to enable the vaccine programme to finish and do its job."" Asked aboutreports in the Times,externalthat the government was considering a four-week delay, he said that would be ""really welcome"". Latest government figures show that more than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.4% of the adult population. Asked about the government decision on 14 June, Mr Zahawi, the vaccines minister, told BBC Breakfast: ""We have to be really careful so that those hard won wars against the virus are not squandered."" He reiterated that the government would ""share the data on Monday"". ""We all know the virus hasn't gone away, it will attempt to mutate,"" he said. ""The Delta variant is more infectious and more severe for those it infects. So, we have to be really careful."" Meanwhile, the latest R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, up from between 1 and 1.2 last week,according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.,external It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others. If the R number is above 1.0, the number of cases is increasing. Mr Zahawi said that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June. He also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global vaccination effort. The UK has pledgedto start donating vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks,as part of 100 million surplus doses which will be delivered in the next year.

Drakeford says jabs buffer claim 'simply untrue',"Mark Drakeford told Newsnight that Wales had drawn no vaccine from an ""English buffer"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has accused England's health secretary of making ""simply factually untrue"" comments about Wales' vaccine rollout. Matt Hancock said Wales had a faster programme becauseit could draw on England's supply if needed. But Mr Drakeford said Wales' success was based on the management of its own stocks, not any extra supply from the UK government. Wales currently has one of thebest vaccination programmes in the world. People aged 25 to 29 in Englandcan book to have their first dose of Covid vaccine, while in Wales nearly two thirds of 18 to 29-year-olds have had at least one dose of a vaccine. Latest figures on Friday, showed more than 300,000 people aged under 30 in Wales had been given a first doses, joining similar numbers in their 30s. Hancock says UK approach helped Wales jab quicker How is Wales leading the UK on vaccine rollout? Mr Hancock told MPs England had a slower rollout due to its ""buffer"" of supply. He said UK ministers needed to make sure there was always enough supply for second doses, while Wales could draw on England's supply if needed But Mr Drakeford told the BBC's Newsnight: ""It's simply factually untrue. ""We've drawn nothing out of an English buffer, we manage our own stocks and the fact that we have some of the best vaccination rates in the world is just because of the way in which the programme in Wales has been organised and delivered."" Mr Drakeford also said he was not prepared to follow England by announcing a date when all freedoms would be restored in Wales. ""I think it's too optimistic to say that vaccination has broken the link between falling ill and hospitalisation with the new Delta variant,"" he said. ""We really don't know that sufficiently to be confident that the vaccination is going to defend us in exactly that way. ""Wales is very largely free already. A great majority of things that people weren't able to do before, they're able to do already."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Wales was ""extremely fortunate to enjoy a world-leading vaccination programme"" but said it would not have been possible with a Labour government in Westminster. ""Let's make no bones about it. This first-class programme wouldn't have been possible if Labour had been calling the shots as Wales and the rest of Britain would have been stuck in the EU scheme,"" he said.

Conducting again after a stroke,"This video can not be played Grant Llewellyn did not know if it would be possible to conduct again after his stroke When the conductor Grant Llewellyn had a stroke last summer, it was not a sudden attack, as you might expect - more of a ""funny feeling"" to start. But the impact was no less dramatic, leaving him at first hardly able to walk or carry out basic tasks without help. Here he shares his story and explains how he has worked to return to conducting and why. ""I was out mowing the lawn - I felt just a passing weakness in my right leg, eventually my right hand also felt funny. I finished mowing the lawn and then went for a cycle ride - 10 kilometres or so - but not feeling quite right,"" said Grant. Live music performances to return in Wales Kanneh-Masons: Hoping to demystify classical music Walking speed clue to stroke recovery Later that evening the 60 year old, who lives in Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan, went to hospital. It took three days for his symptoms to stop getting worse and many scans to confirm he had had a stroke. ""It was quite frightening - it being so gradual. It was almost that I didn't dare go to sleep in hospital because I knew that waking up, I'd have lost further control of my arm and leg.  Where would it end?"" he said. According to the Stroke Association, around 8,000 people in Wales will have a stroke every year with 69,000 stroke survivors living here. Grant says he is now on a ""voyage of discovery"" After a month in the stroke unit in nearby Llandough Hospital, Grant returned home. The six months that followed were a ""severe learning curve"" in managing his expectations of recovery. ""The physiotherapists were concerned that I wouldn't hurt myself - not that I would ever conduct again,"" he said. As his rehabilitation has progressed, mobility in Grant's right leg has increased and his right arm has also improved - but not to the point that he could hold a baton to conduct. ""So at that stage, I had to come to terms with what would it mean, as a conductor, to only have use of my left arm, probably without a baton and anything else that's left to me. ""And that's where I am now, it's a voyage of discovery."" Since March, Grant has been back working with his orchestra in France, L'Orchestre National de Bretagne, finding out what is possible. He recently conducted an hour and a half concert - including technically difficult pieces likeBeethoven's Symphony No 5. ""I didn't know if I would be able to stand up to conduct. I was also anxious to know what I would do with my right arm and whether I would be self conscious about it. ""Once I got on the rostrum, I didn't think about it. You're in the music. ""I have navigated Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and I don't see that there are technical limitation to just using the left hand."" But the reality of what has happened can hit home unexpectedly. ""The irony of my situation is that I can conduct Beethoven symphonies but I can't get out of bed. I can't tie my shoelaces."" Grant knows the journey is not over yet The emotion is clear as Grant said this - he is, as he admits, ""still coming to terms"" with his stroke. Now in Grant's room at home, alongside the piano, musical scores and photographs of him conducting around the world are the things he uses for physio - a rowing machine, exercise bike and electrodes. It is clear the journey is not yet over and Grant said he knew his recovery would ""not be 100%"". But with a full diary of engagements from September, Grant is focusing on what he can do and the joy of making music again.

Kim Kardashian fails law exam againThe reality TV star was seen getting her result in the last episode of her family's reality TV show.,"Kardashian West wants to open a law firm focusing on sentencing and prison reform Kim Kardashian West has revealed she has failed her first-year law exam for a second time. The reality TV star and businesswoman got her results on the final episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. The hit TV show ended on Thursday after 14 years, having catapulted the family to global fame and fortune. Kardashian, who is studying for a law degree, aims to open her own law firm. She was seen saying: ""I failed... I just have to not stress about it."" Keeping Up With the Kardashians: 8 ways one family became a hot topic She said she was ""bummed"" about the result, which was ""a little bit worse"" than her first attempt earlier this year. She added: ""I just have to do better in the future."" Left-right: Kris, KhloÃ©, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Caitlyn, Kylie and Kim's daughter North West The reality star was takingthe baby bar exam,external, a one-day test that is taken after a year's study. She pledged to take the exam for a third time later this month. She has said she wants to open her own law firm focusing on sentencing and prison reform after finishing her law degree. Last year, the reality starvisited the White House with prisoners she helped to free. Crystal Munoz, Judith Negron and Tynice Hall had their jail sentences cut short after Kardashian West lobbied US President Donald Trump. The women had been jailed for drug-related and white collar crimes, and all had young children when imprisoned. Kardashian West is also campaigning for changes to the US justice system, particularly long sentences handed down to first-time offenders and the disproportionate effect on ethnic minority communities. In Thursday's finale, her sister Khloe consoled her by saying: ""You had Covid, you had your 40th birthday. You had a lot personally in your relationship. And quarantine itself. I really don't think this time counted."" This video can not be played Kim Kardashian becomes a Forbes billionaire Kardashian West is in the process ofdivorcing rapper Kanye West. The couple married seven years ago and have four children. The show's final episode saw her discussing her marital situation, telling her mother Kris she was now seeking ""total happiness"" and that she realised she was unhappily married after speaking to a therapist. ""Obviously, I know complete bliss is not a full reality but if I can have it more the majority of the time, that's all I want to do,"" she said. ""I just feel I've worked so hard in life to achieve everything that I wanted to and I lived up to my expectations and achieved 10 times more than I even thought was humanly possible, but I don't have a life to share that with.""

Sony Music writes off pop stars' decades-old debtsThousands of artists will finally be able to start earning money from their music.,"The move was announced by Sony boss Rob Stringer, pictured with BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z (who are not eligible for the scheme) Sony Music has cancelled the debts of thousands of artists who signed to the record label before the year 2000. It means that many will now, for the first time, earn money when their songs are streamed on services like Spotify and Amazon Music. Sony said it could not name the eligible acts due to confidentiality agreements, but a source said it would ""include household names"". It said some artists stood to receive ""many thousands of dollars per year"". Pop icons TLC were left with millions of dollars in debt thanks to their record deal with LaFace Records in the 1990s Musicians typically take on debt when they first sign to a record label. They are given a lump sum, known as an advance, to pay for recording studios, video shoots, distribution and other expenses. The money is then paid back when they sell their music. However, many artists never earn enough to repay their advances, often because they get unfavourable royalty rates from their own record companies. Heritage black artists have been particularly affected. And until the debt to their label is repaid, those artists are not eligible to receive income from streaming, and other royalty payments. Stones and Jones call for streaming reforms Meet the writers who told pop stars: 'Stop stealing' Classic bands accused of crowding out new music That's how an act like TLC, who were signed to Sony subsidiary LaFace Records, ended up declaring bankruptcy in the 1990s. The R&B stars declared debts of $3.5m, despite having one of the decade's best selling albums, CrazySexyCool. Sony's announcement came in a letter to artists on Friday, a copy of which has been shared with the BBC. ""We are not modifying existing contracts, but choosing to pay through on existing unrecouped balances to increase the ability of those who qualify to receive more money from uses of their music,"" it said. In other words, the debt hasn't been explicitly wiped out - but Sony will ignore it and pay royalties to affected acts, backdated to 1 January 2021. Music industry lawyer Aurelia Butler-Ball said the scheme would ""unlock"" streaming revenues that artists were not previously entitled to, under contracts signed during the CD and cassette era. ""Many of the record deals [made] before 2000 didn't recognise that streaming platforms would ever exist,"" she said. ""Therefore, artists didn't have the right mechanisms in place to see those revenues."" This video can not be played Tom Gray: 'I get paid nothing when someone streams my music' Sony's initative comes amid mounting pressure on the record industry to be more transparent about the way it distributes money, particularly from streaming services. A parliamentary inquiry is currently looking into the streaming economy, prompted by the vocal #BrokenRecord campaign, which seeks to address the imbalance in how profits are shared between record labels, musicians and the streaming services themselves. Gomez musician Tom Gray, who founded the campaign, said Sony's move was ""incredibly welcome"". ""From the perspective of somebody who's been running a campaign to try and get these companies to behave more ethically and transparently, it feels like a win,"" he told the BBC. Butler-Ball, who is a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said the initiative was something musicians had been ""pushing for"" for some time, but that it was only when the public began to take notice of the #BrokenRecord and #FixStreaming campaigns that record companies felt they had to act. ""I think this is absolutely a sign of labels recognising that there is pressure coming from not only artists but fan bases, and it's increasingly being talked about publicly,"" she said. Sony is not the first company to take such a step. Indie label Beggars Group, which is home to acts like Grimes, Jarvis Cocker and The xx, has previously written off unrecouped balances on older contracts. However, Sony is the only major label to do so. Its direct competitors, Universal and Warner Music, may feel they should follow suit - but Gray says they should go even further by fixing the low royalty rates given to artists in the 1960s and 70s. ""If that person's on a 5% royalty, they're not suddenly going to start earning lots of money,"" he said, referring to the new deal. ""If you look at what labels like BMG are doing now, where they're doing standard 30% deals [where artists gets 70% of the money], then Sony haven't even got to what 'good' looked like a decade ago."" Why the Church of England co-owns a BeyoncÃ© hit Meanwhile, Sony's move could enable heritage artists to sell their song catalogues to interested buyers - as Bob Dylan, Blondie and Barry Manilow have all recently done. ""There are plenty of funds out there looking to buy catalogues at multiple of 10 times and above [in exhange] for artist royalties,"" music consultant Alasiter Moughan told the BBC. ""If an artist was unrecouped a potential buyer might want the artist to pay this balance back or not purchase the royalties at all, as no actual cash would be flowing through. ""This change in policy from Sony could be significant for an artist in this position."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Why is summit in Cornwall?,"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

UK pledges Â£430m on girls' education amid aid row,"A school project in Malawi - educating girls can improve health and prosperity in the wider community Boris Johnson at the G7 summit has pledged Â£430m to improve education in some of the world's poorest countries - with girls' education a priority. The prime minister said it was a source of ""international shame"" that so many girls in poorer countries were missing out on access to school. With an education, these children could have been ""titans of industry or scientific pioneers"", he said. But aid agencies called for a reversal of cuts to the UK's aid budget. ""The best way we can lift countries out of poverty and lead a global recovery is by investing in education and particularly girls' education,"" the prime minister told world leaders gathered in Cornwall. The prime minister has made girls' education a flagship issue of the G7 - and the summit will approve plans to get 40 million more girls into school, in countries where girls might either be kept out of school or drop out early. Girls' education key to ending poverty, says PM Aid agencies warn of cuts to girls' education funding Boris Johnson says girls' education should be priority 10 toughest places for girls to go to school The Â£430m over five years will be the UK's biggest amount contributed to the Global Partnership for Education, an international co-ordinating body which wants to raise $5bn (Â£3.5bn) at an education summit next month, for projects in 90 countries. Helen Grant, special envoy for girls' education, at a school in Sierra Leone Lis Wallace of the anti-poverty charity, One, said the destructive impact of the pandemic on education in poorer countries had been ""staggering"" and a ""silent emergency"". But she said the amount offered so far ""falls short"" of what is needed - and warned the cut to international aid risked ""undermining these efforts"". The funding announcement was ""a good start"" but there still needed to be a reversal of ""shameful cuts to overseas aid"", said Rose Caldwell, chief executive of Plan International UK. Mark Sheard, chief executive  of World Vision UK, said the funding announced was not enough after the ""drastic cuts"" to the aid budget. Helen Grant, the prime minister's special envoy for girls' education, said the ambition to get 12 years of quality education for every girl would be a ""game changer"". ""If you want to change the world for the better, girls' education has to be the place to start,"" she told the BBC. A Voluntary Service Overseas project is backing educational technology in Malawi Better education would mean an upward cycle of improvement in health and economic chances for girls and their families, and would reduce the risk of early marriage and poverty, she said. ""An example would be that a child with a mother who can read is 50% more likely to live beyond the age of five,"" she said. Mrs Grant said it was in the UK's own interests not to ""pull up the drawbridge on some of the most vulnerable, marginalised and needy people"". Improving education in developing countries, particularly in Africa, would create a ""better, safer, fairer and more prosperous world - which is good for all of us"". The government has faced a rebellion, including from some of its own MPs, over the reduction in the international aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income. The chair of the international development select committee said it was ""ridiculous that the government trumpets its commitment to girls' education"" while cutting aid. Mrs Grant said the ""seismic impact of the pandemic"" meant taking ""tough choices"" - including a ""temporary reduction in aid"". ""We are hoping that it will return to 0.7% when fiscal conditions allow."" Helen Grant says it is in the UK's interests to support education in countries such as Uganda Describing how education could be such a crossroads in young lives, Mrs Grant said she'd spoken in a school in Uganda to a ""clever little girl, embracing everything, full of life"". The girl told her she wanted to become a doctor - but without access to school she would have a life of ""collecting wood, collecting water, making the food"". ""That drives us all on,"" she said. This video can not be played Bangladesh education charity faces funding withdrawal The UK Bangladesh Education Trust (UKBET) is a UK charity working with child domestic workers in Bangladesh. It pays for local teachers to visit girls like Sayeeda, 9, who works as a servant to earn money for her family, or 16-year-old Lalit, who has now learned to write her own name, having never gone to school. In March 2020, UKBET began applying for UK funding of Â£50,000 over two years to continue with and expand its programme. But in April of this year the charity was told the fund it had applied to had been withdrawn due to the government's aid cuts. Reacting to news of the new funding, announced at the G7,, UKBET's Annette Zara said she was ""I'm bewildered and infuriated"". ""A month ago the government needed to save Â£25,000 by cutting one of the few programmes bringing education to young girls enslaved in domestic work in Bangladesh. Yet today, they have found Â£400m at the back of the cupboard."" Among the beneficiaries of UK aid is Matandani school, near Zomba in Malawi, in southern Africa. Talking on Zoom, the head teacher Givemore Chipanga said pupils might walk 5km or 6km to school each morning - and the younger pupils were in classes of more than 180 children. The school, which has been proud of its efforts to get solar power and piped water, has been trying to recover from the impact of the pandemic. Mr Chipanga said he was worried that the disruption would push learners permanently out of education - such as girls going into an early marriage. The rural school is part of the Unlocking Talent educational technology project, supported by Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), which uses tablet computers to help teachers track the progress of pupils in such large classes. The project, backed by the University of Nottingham and the charity onebillion, has particularly helped girls, said the head teacher. Mr Chipanga said supporting girls' education was vital for countries such as Malawi - with benefits to health and the economy. ""You have to fill that gender gap,"" he said. ""Once a girl is educated, her family will be educated, society will be assisted,"" said the head teacher. ""You educate the nation.""

Neo-Nazi guilty of terror charges,"Andrew Dymock has also been found guilty of three hate crimes A politics student who called for the ""extermination"" of Jewish people has been found guilty of 12 terrorism charges. Andrew Dymock, from Bath, established the banned right-wing groups System Resistance Network (SRN) and Sonnenkrieg Division. He also published an article stating that Jewish people were a ""cancer"". The 24-year-old was convicted at the Old Bailey and is due to be sentenced on 24 June. Images taken from SRN videos were shown to jurors From his parents' house in Bath and his student bedroom in Aberystwyth he established two now proscribed groups. Dymock believed in what is known as the ""Siege"" ideology which advocates rape as a political weapon. The groups claimed they were committed to using violence to end democracy and drive non-white people out of Britain. The son of two academics, Stella and Dr David Dymock, a professor of dentistry at Bristol University, Andrew Dymockwas first exposed by a BBC investigation in 2018. As the verdicts were delivered, he told jurors ""thank you for killing me"". In total he was convicted of 15 offences: Five counts of encouraging terrorism Four of disseminating terrorist publications Two of terrorist fundraising One of possessing material useful to a terrorist One of possessing racially inflammatory material One of stirring up racial hatred One of stirring up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden, head of counter terrorism policing north east, said as he had established two terrorist organisations, Dymock was a ""key leader"" and his conviction was a ""key step in protecting the UK"". The neo-Nazi given away by his rainbow sheets The trial heard he used the SRN website to publish an article stating Jewish people should be exterminated. He stated a ""racial holy war is inevitable"" and ""every stabbing, bombing, shooting further plays into our hands"". Dymock had also engaged in terrorist fundraising by seeking and receiving financial donations via the SRN website using a dedicated Paypal account he created. He used the SRN Twitter account to share extremist texts and called for ""total war"". Dymock denied responsibility for the accounts, claiming he was set up by his now former partner, who had failed to recruit him to join banned terrorist group National Action (NA). As the verdicts were delivered, he told jurors ""thank you for killing me"" Prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward earlier told jurors he was not being prosecuted for holding racist, anti-Semitic or homophobic beliefs, or for his ""adherence to a neo-Nazi creed"". She said: ""Rather, he is facing prosecution for his encouragement of terrorist activity, of violence, as a means to shape society in accordance with his beliefs, rather than through free speech and democracy."" An examination of Dymock's computer revealed longstanding extremist views dating back to when he was 17, including a Google translation of the words ""Kill all of the Jews"". On 8 October, 2017, he wrote about the creation of SRN on a right-wing webpage stating the group was ""focused on building a group of loyal men, true to the cause of national socialism and establishing the fascist state through revolution"". Dymock admitted being in images provided to the court by Counter Terrorism Policing North Jurors heard how he was expelled from SRN in late February 2018. Dymock was arrested the morning after a BBC News investigation in December 2018 exposed his extremist activities. Police found extreme right-wing literature in his luggage along with clothing bearing neo-Nazi logos. He also had books, flags, clothes and badges with links to the extreme right wing in his bedroom at home and university. Dymock claimed he was ""set up"" by others, and that material linking him to content on the SRN website and Twitter account was ""planted in his possession without his knowledge"". At trial he denied being a neo-Nazi and told police: ""In fact, I am bisexual but lean towards being homosexual, in direct conflict with Nazism.""

However, many artists never earn enough to repay their advances, often because they get unfavourable royalty rates from their own record companies. Heritage black artists have been particularly affected. And until the debt to their label is repaid, those artists are not eligible to receive income from streaming, and other royalty payments. Stones and Jones call for streaming reforms Meet the writers who told pop stars: 'Stop stealing' Classic bands accused of crowding out new music That's how an act like TLC, who were signed to Sony subsidiary LaFace Records, ended up declaring bankruptcy in the 1990s. The R&B stars declared debts of $3.5m, despite having one of the decade's best selling albums, CrazySexyCool. Sony's announcement came in a letter to artists on Friday, a copy of which has been shared with the BBC. ""We are not modifying existing contracts, but choosing to pay through on existing unrecouped balances to increase the ability of those who qualify to receive more money from uses of their music,"" it said. In other words, the debt hasn't been explicitly wiped out - but Sony will ignore it and pay royalties to affected acts, backdated to 1 January 2021. Music industry lawyer Aurelia Butler-Ball said the scheme would ""unlock"" streaming revenues that artists were not previously entitled to, under contracts signed during the CD and cassette era. ""Many of the record deals [made] before 2000 didn't recognise that streaming platforms would ever exist,"" she said. ""Therefore, artists didn't have the right mechanisms in place to see those revenues."" This video can not be played Tom Gray: 'I get paid nothing when someone streams my music' Sony's initative comes amid mounting pressure on the record industry to be more transparent about the way it distributes money, particularly from streaming services. A parliamentary inquiry is currently looking into the streaming economy, prompted by the vocal #BrokenRecord campaign, which seeks to address the imbalance in how profits are shared between record labels, musicians and the streaming services themselves. Gomez musician Tom Gray, who founded the campaign, said Sony's move was ""incredibly welcome"". ""From the perspective of somebody who's been running a campaign to try and get these companies to behave more ethically and transparently, it feels like a win,"" he told the BBC. Butler-Ball, who is a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said the initiative was something musicians had been ""pushing for"" for some time, but that it was only when the public began to take notice of the #BrokenRecord and #FixStreaming campaigns that record companies felt they had to act. ""I think this is absolutely a sign of labels recognising that there is pressure coming from not only artists but fan bases, and it's increasingly being talked about publicly,"" she said. Sony is not the first company to take such a step. Indie label Beggars Group, which is home to acts like Grimes, Jarvis Cocker and The xx, has previously written off unrecouped balances on older contracts. However, Sony is the only major label to do so. Its direct competitors, Universal and Warner Music, may feel they should follow suit - but Gray says they should go even further by fixing the low royalty rates given to artists in the 1960s and 70s. ""If that person's on a 5% royalty, they're not suddenly going to start earning lots of money,"" he said, referring to the new deal. ""If you look at what labels like BMG are doing now, where they're doing standard 30% deals [where artists gets 70% of the money], then Sony haven't even got to what 'good' looked like a decade ago."" Why the Church of England co-owns a BeyoncÃ© hit Meanwhile, Sony's move could enable heritage artists to sell their song catalogues to interested buyers - as Bob Dylan, Blondie and Barry Manilow have all recently done. ""There are plenty of funds out there looking to buy catalogues at multiple of 10 times and above [in exhange] for artist royalties,"" music consultant Alasiter Moughan told the BBC. ""If an artist was unrecouped a potential buyer might want the artist to pay this balance back or not purchase the royalties at all, as no actual cash would be flowing through. ""This change in policy from Sony could be significant for an artist in this position."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Johnson kicks off G7 with plea to tackle inequalityThe UK prime minister urges world leaders to ""build back better"" after the coronavirus pandemic.UK PoliticsComments","The Queen was greeted by the PM and his wife Carrie as she arrived at Friday evening's dinner Boris Johnson has urged fellow world leaders to ""build back better"" after the Covid pandemic at this week's G7 summit in Cornwall. The UK prime minister said it was vital to learn from the ""mistakes"" of the 2008 financial crisis and tackle the ""scar"" of inequality. After a day of talks at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay, leaders have joined the Queen for a dinner nearby. The distribution of Covid vaccines is also high on the summit agenda. Earlier, the leaders posed for a group photo with the Queen, where the monarch was heard to joke: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?"" The leaders around the Queen laughed, and Mr Johnson replied emphatically: ""Yes."" The prime minister added: ""We have been enjoying ourselves - in spite of appearances."" Allow Twitter content?

US President Joe Biden is among those being hosted by Mr Johnson for the three-day meeting, as well the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada. It is the first face-to-face summit of the G7 - representing most of the world's biggest economies - since before the pandemic started early last year. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel are also attending. Why are world leaders coming to Cornwall In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party In his opening remarks at the main round-table discussions, Mr Johnson said that, as the world recovered from the pandemic, it was important to ""level up across our societies"" and ""build back better"". He added: ""I actually think that we have a huge opportunity to that because, as G7, we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world, a solution to the problems of climate change."" The prime minister also said it was ""vital that we don't repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis - the last great economic recession of 2008 - when the recovery was not uniform across all parts of society"". Politicians are attending a Friday evening reception at the nearby Eden Project, attended by the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Mr Johnson and US President Joe Biden attended a session earlier on economic recovery after Covid The UK governmentannounced it was giving Â£430m in aid to the Global Partnership for Education, to help the world's ""most vulnerable children"" get better schooling, with a ""particular"" focus on girls. It was important for the world economy to rebuild in a ""more equal and... in a more gender-neutral and perhaps a more feminine way"" after the huge damage caused by coronavirus, Mr Johnson told his fellow leaders. As camera crews and photographers left the meeting room at the Carbis Bay Hotel, he joked that what had been intended as a ""fireside chat"" had turned into a ""media circus"". Several of the European leaders enjoyed a seaside drink before the talks started Tweeting a photograph of himself,externalwith some of the other European leaders sitting on a seaside terrace, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote: ""As always, the same union, the same determination to act, the same enthusiasm! The G7 can begin."" As G7 leaders got round the table and down to business Boris Johnson's opening remarks initially followed a familiar pattern as he talked about ""building back better"". But he ended on a less familiar pledge to build back in a ""more gender-neutral"" and ""feminine"" way. So what does that mean? Downing Street sources are pointing to the PM's education announcement. Mr Johnson, I'm told, wants to improve the prospects of girls around the world. While the prime minister's terminology may cause some to cringe a little (""ugh, just ugh,"" remarked one senior Tory MP), the underlying aim might attract praise, even if the UK government is temporarily cutting its overseas aid budget overall. But, more broadly, the prime minister is keen to insert his ""build back better"" domestic agenda into the international scene. ""Build back better"" also happens to be the name of Joe Biden's mammoth jobs and recovery plan. For any G7 leader, the world stage is still a chance to reach the audience at home. Mr Johnson has pledged the UK will donate more than 100 million Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. But some charities and campaigners have criticised the scale of the UK's plan, under which 5 million doses will be given out by the end of September, with 25 million by the end of 2021 and the rest provided during 2022. Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was ""not happening anywhere near fast enough"", and called on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away. And US pop star Selena Gomez told her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that the promise to deliver 5 million vaccines by the end of September was ""too little too late"". Ms Gomez was among anumber of celebritieswho took part in a concert aimed at increasing access to Covid vaccines in April. Mr Biden also appeared at the event, as did Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022. The World Health Organization estimates 11 billion doses will be needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly affected. Security is tight, with thousands of extra police having been sent to Cornwall Hundreds of people joineda march in St Ives,just along the coast from Carbis Bay, urging leaders to ""address the climate and ecological emergency"". Three people were arrested a few miles away from the summit venue earlier on suspicion of possession of an article with intent to commit criminal damage, and four were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance.

Jail for rapist who faked his death at 'Mortuary Beach'Kim Avis tried to evade justice by fleeing Scotland then faking his death at one of California's most dangerous beaches.,"Avis following his arrest by US Marshals A rapist who tried to evade justice by fleeing Scotland then faking his own death at one of California's most dangerous beaches has been jailed for 15 years. Kim Avis, a market trader from Inverness, was eventually tracked down more than 1,000 miles away in Colorado, then brought home to Scotland - where he was convicted of rape and sexual abuse offences committed in the Highlands. The Scot had been on bail when he flew into Los Angeles International Airport on 16 February 2019, and was using the name Ken Gordon-Avis. Nine days later, his son reported him missing at Monastery Beach, telling the local sheriff's office that his dad had gone for an evening swim. The beach is near Carmel-by-the-Sea, a city of about 3,800 people on the Big Sur - a rugged and mountainous stretch of Californian coastline. Avis was reported missing at Monastery Beach on California's Big Sur Monastery Beach is renowned for its beautiful sand - and notorious for its water's dangerous strong undertow and treacherous high surf conditions. Deaths of swimmers and divers led to it being nicknamed Mortuary Beach. Mary Schley, who has been a reporter on the Carmel Pine Cone newspaper for almost 23 years, said that nickname was ""well entrenched"". ""The beach is full of posted warnings,"" she said. ""Numerous people, including experienced divers, have drowned there."" Scot who went missing in US guilty of rapes Sex assault accused says claims 'like a film script' Man was 'in trance' during alleged sex attack Man tried to rape girl, 12, then 'joked about it' The authorities were initially unaware of Avis' background and an extensive three-day search of the shore and sea was carried out. However, from the start some things did not seem quite right. ""The water is very cold, so it's unusual for someone to go swimming only in a pair of shorts in the evening in late February, when it's nearing dark, as Avis was said to have done,"" said Ms Schley. ""The water that night was unusually flat and calm, and therefore not nearly as dangerous as when the surf is high, and the weather was clear."" The search, which was co-ordinated by the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, included forestry and fire protection personnel, a dive team, a coastguard helicopter and a drone which swept the area. Sgt David Murray, of Monterey Sheriff's Office, had felt that something did not add up But Commander Derrel Simpson said one of his officers, Sgt David Murray, felt something did not add up. Avis appeared to have taken all his personal belongings - including his passport - with him on the swim. The sheriff's office was also told that the father and son had been staying in hotels and been camping, but they had no equipment for a hiking trip. Sgt Murray found out that the hotel where Avis was said to have stayed had no record of him as a guest. When he contacted one of Avis' relatives in Scotland, he learned that the missing man was facing charges of sexual attacks against women and girls in the Highlands. Commander Simpson, a 30-year sheriff's office veteran, said: ""We have had a lot of deaths at Monastery Beach, but I can't think of anyone using it as a ploy before."" Search teams looking for Avis at Monastery Beach in February 2019 in an image from TV new station KSBW The investigation was turned over to the US Marshals Service, which has responsibility for catching wanted criminals. Over the next few months, Monterey sheriff's deputies worked with US Marshals, Interpol and the Scottish authorities to secure an arrest and extradition warrant for Avis. They established that Avis had entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport, using a different name. It also emerged that his bank account had been used in Colorado after his disappearance in California. Commander Simpson said the most valuable tip-off they received was that Avis had been seen driving a white Ford van in the Big Sur area. Five months after he disappeared, that piece of information helped US Marshals trace Avis in Colorado Springs - more than 1,300 miles (2,092km) away from where he was reported missing. The following week, on 27 July 2019, he was arrested. Kim Avis ran a stall selling jewellery in Inverness Commander Simpson said bringing Avis to justice was a team effort. ""It was impressive how everyone played a part, including the Scottish authorities - and how the US Marshals tracked him half way across the country,"" he said. Avis was returned to Scotland, where he was held in prison until his trial. Last month, a jury at the High Court in Glasgow found the 57-year-old market trader guilty of raping three women. He was also found guilty of attempting to rape one of them when she was 12, and guilty of sexually assaulting a girl when she was 11. He was further convicted of failing to appear for the previous trial. In total, Avis was found guilty of 14 charges from between 2006 and 2017. He had denied all the charges. On Friday, Avis was jailed for 12 years for the sex crimes he committed in the Highlands, and three years for failing to appear in court. Judge Lord Sandison said Avis had been a well-known street trader in Inverness for many years, busking and selling jewellery from his market stall - and even receiving a good citizen award. But the judge said there was another side to Avis, with a background report describing him as ""a controlling and dominant personality"". He said Avis had manipulated, managed and coerced his victims. Fraser Gibson, of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, said it had been a ""difficult and complex"" investigation. He said: ""Kim Avis went to great lengths to evade justice for his crimes. ""Thanks to the efforts of police and prosecutors, working together with US law enforcement, he has been brought to justice and sentenced today."" Police Scotland praised his victims for the ""courage, strength and dignity"" they had shown throughout the investigation and court case.

Neo-Nazi guilty of terror chargesPolice say that Andrew Dymock's conviction is a âkey step in protecting the UKâ.Somerset,"Andrew Dymock has also been found guilty of three hate crimes A politics student who called for the ""extermination"" of Jewish people has been found guilty of 12 terrorism charges. Andrew Dymock, from Bath, established the banned right-wing groups System Resistance Network (SRN) and Sonnenkrieg Division. He also published an article stating that Jewish people were a ""cancer"". The 24-year-old was convicted at the Old Bailey and is due to be sentenced on 24 June. Images taken from SRN videos were shown to jurors From his parents' house in Bath and his student bedroom in Aberystwyth he established two now proscribed groups. Dymock believed in what is known as the ""Siege"" ideology which advocates rape as a political weapon. The groups claimed they were committed to using violence to end democracy and drive non-white people out of Britain. The son of two academics, Stella and Dr David Dymock, a professor of dentistry at Bristol University, Andrew Dymockwas first exposed by a BBC investigation in 2018. As the verdicts were delivered, he told jurors ""thank you for killing me"". In total he was convicted of 15 offences: Five counts of encouraging terrorism Four of disseminating terrorist publications Two of terrorist fundraising One of possessing material useful to a terrorist One of possessing racially inflammatory material One of stirring up racial hatred One of stirring up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden, head of counter terrorism policing north east, said as he had established two terrorist organisations, Dymock was a ""key leader"" and his conviction was a ""key step in protecting the UK"". The neo-Nazi given away by his rainbow sheets The trial heard he used the SRN website to publish an article stating Jewish people should be exterminated. He stated a ""racial holy war is inevitable"" and ""every stabbing, bombing, shooting further plays into our hands"". Dymock had also engaged in terrorist fundraising by seeking and receiving financial donations via the SRN website using a dedicated Paypal account he created. He used the SRN Twitter account to share extremist texts and called for ""total war"". Dymock denied responsibility for the accounts, claiming he was set up by his now former partner, who had failed to recruit him to join banned terrorist group National Action (NA). As the verdicts were delivered, he told jurors ""thank you for killing me"" Prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward earlier told jurors he was not being prosecuted for holding racist, anti-Semitic or homophobic beliefs, or for his ""adherence to a neo-Nazi creed"". She said: ""Rather, he is facing prosecution for his encouragement of terrorist activity, of violence, as a means to shape society in accordance with his beliefs, rather than through free speech and democracy."" An examination of Dymock's computer revealed longstanding extremist views dating back to when he was 17, including a Google translation of the words ""Kill all of the Jews"". On 8 October, 2017, he wrote about the creation of SRN on a right-wing webpage stating the group was ""focused on building a group of loyal men, true to the cause of national socialism and establishing the fascist state through revolution"". Dymock admitted being in images provided to the court by Counter Terrorism Policing North Jurors heard how he was expelled from SRN in late February 2018. Dymock was arrested the morning after a BBC News investigation in December 2018 exposed his extremist activities. Police found extreme right-wing literature in his luggage along with clothing bearing neo-Nazi logos. He also had books, flags, clothes and badges with links to the extreme right wing in his bedroom at home and university. Dymock claimed he was ""set up"" by others, and that material linking him to content on the SRN website and Twitter account was ""planted in his possession without his knowledge"". At trial he denied being a neo-Nazi and told police: ""In fact, I am bisexual but lean towards being homosexual, in direct conflict with Nazism.""

"UK and US relationship indestructible, PM saysBoris Johnson tells the BBC he has coined a new term for the so-called special relationship.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the BBCâs Laura Kuenssberg that the UK-US relationship is ""indestructible"" The alliance between the US and the UK should be known as the ""indestructible relationship"", Boris Johnson has told the BBC after meeting US President Joe Biden for the first time. He said he had ""terrific"" talks with Mr Biden, who has travelled to Cornwall for the G7 summit of world leaders. The summit begins later, with vaccines and climate change on the agenda. Mr Johnson insisted the US president had not rebuked him over post-Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland. However, Mr Biden is said to have ""deep concern"" over the situation. The prime minister was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, after meeting Mr Biden in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, on Thursday ahead of the G7 summit. The summit will see the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK gathering in person for the first time since the pandemic. Why is President Biden concerned about the Northern Ireland Protocol? Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? Carrie Johnson prepares to entertain G7 spouses In Pictures: G7 leaders in Cornwall Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson pledgedthe UK would donate more than 100 million vaccines to poorer countriesin the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. The G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022. Mr Johnson told the BBC the UK and US shared a belief in human rights, the rules-based international order and the transatlantic alliance. He said he thought of the association as ""an indestructible relationship"" or the ""deep and meaningful relationship"". ""It's a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world,"" he said. The PM had previously let it be known that he preferred a new term for the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and US after decades of use. The first real-life meeting between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden clearly went well. Mr Johnson and his team believe chemistry between leaders matters, and that the simple fact of gathering in person sends an important message. But the issues the prime minister wants to confront this week can't be solved by just bonhomie at the beach. Read Laura's blog One area which could cause friction between the two men isthe Northern Ireland Protocol- the part of the Brexit deal that prevents checks along the Irish border. Mr Biden has previously warned that the new arrangements should not jeopardise theGood Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998 that helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland.

"UK and US relationship indestructible, PM says","This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the BBCâs Laura Kuenssberg that the UK-US relationship is ""indestructible"" The alliance between the US and the UK should be known as the ""indestructible relationship"", Boris Johnson has told the BBC after meeting US President Joe Biden for the first time. He said he had ""terrific"" talks with Mr Biden, who has travelled to Cornwall for the G7 summit of world leaders. The summit begins later, with vaccines and climate change on the agenda. Mr Johnson insisted the US president had not rebuked him over post-Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland. However, Mr Biden is said to have ""deep concern"" over the situation. The prime minister was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, after meeting Mr Biden in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, on Thursday ahead of the G7 summit. The summit will see the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK gathering in person for the first time since the pandemic. Why is President Biden concerned about the Northern Ireland Protocol? Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? Carrie Johnson prepares to entertain G7 spouses In Pictures: G7 leaders in Cornwall Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson pledgedthe UK would donate more than 100 million vaccines to poorer countriesin the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. The G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022. Mr Johnson told the BBC the UK and US shared a belief in human rights, the rules-based international order and the transatlantic alliance. He said he thought of the association as ""an indestructible relationship"" or the ""deep and meaningful relationship"". ""It's a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world,"" he said. The PM had previously let it be known that he preferred a new term for the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and US after decades of use. The first real-life meeting between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden clearly went well. Mr Johnson and his team believe chemistry between leaders matters, and that the simple fact of gathering in person sends an important message. But the issues the prime minister wants to confront this week can't be solved by just bonhomie at the beach. Read Laura's blog One area which could cause friction between the two men isthe Northern Ireland Protocol- the part of the Brexit deal that prevents checks along the Irish border. Mr Biden has previously warned that the new arrangements should not jeopardise theGood Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998 that helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland.

"Kent to turn away lone child migrants from MondayKent County Council has reached ""the limit of safe capacity"" 10 months after taking similar action.Kent","Children arriving by boat risk overwhelming services, KCC says Kent County Council says it will not be taking on any unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Monday as it has reached ""the limit of safe capacity"". The council hasthreatened legal actionagainst the Home Secretary over the ""extreme pressure"" on its services. More than 400 such children are in the care of the council. The government's recommended maximum number is 231. The Home Office on Thursday announced measures encouraging other local authorities to take on child migrants. Kent County Council (KCC)had to take similar action in August. Children arriving next week will be taken by Border Force to the Kent Intake Unit at Dover. They would usually then be passed on to KCC, but now they will now remain the responsibility of the Home Office, who will have to find places for them with other local authorities, KCC said. By Mark Easton, Home Editor, BBC News For a Conservative council to threaten a Conservative Home Secretary with legal action is indicative of the frustration and anger felt in Kent at the unfolding crisis hitting the county for the second time in ten months. Unless another council agrees to help, Kent County Council has a legal duty to take care of any unaccompanied child migrant that arrives among the thousands of asylum seekers who turn up on its coast each year. But Kent's leaders say the current voluntary transfer scheme is not good enough, and despite extra government cash and a new rota system, it is inevitable that highly vulnerable children at the end of a long and traumatic journey will be left in a psychologically-damaging limbo. This Tory authority appears determined to follow through on its threat to take the Home Secretary to court unless she forces other local authorities to share the burden. Priti Patel, however, is reluctant to oblige councils to take responsibility for child asylum-seekers. Council leader Roger Gough said: ""I am profoundly saddened to be in this unthinkable position once again in such a short period of time. ""Despite warnings, and continued dialogue with government, Kent's UASC [unaccompanied asylum-seeking children] support resources are again significantly overwhelmed."" Kent County Council believes it can no longer safely accept new arrivals Mr Gough said no further arrivals could be accepted until ""sufficient transfers have been made outside of Kent bringing our numbers back to safe levels"". He said it was ""a small problem for the nation to resolve but a huge and unreasonable responsibility for Kent"". KCC has taken its first steps in legal action against Home Secretary Priti Patel and wants her to make other councils take ""their fair share"". Without any substantive response to its proposals by 17 June, KCC said it would issue a claim for judicial review. Child migrant legal threat to Home Secretary How many migrant children cross the Channel? Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? A Home Office spokesman said: ""The Home Office is grateful for the role KCC has played in supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, and we have provided them with substantial operational support, including transferring those in need of support to other local authorities in the UK. ""We recently announced vital updates to the National Transfer Scheme to alleviate pressures on certain areas and continue to work closely across Government on provision for unaccompanied minors."" So far this year at least 4,449 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats, with 925 people arriving in Dover in the first 10 days of June.

What is G7 summit?,"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

Here is a round-up of what's been happening at the G7 summit today in Cornwall:  Boris Johnson and Italy's Mario Draghi G7 leaders were in agreement over the need to continue supporting their economies with fiscal stimulus after the pandemic, Reuters news agency reported. ""There was broad consensus across the table on continued support for fiscal expansion at this stage,"" a source said. Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Italy's Mario Draghi expressed particular support, they added. The leaders believe there should be

long-term policies for ensuring the health of public finances in

the future, the source said. Leaders emphasised the importance of taking action to

reduce unemployment. These included policies such as retraining and offering support for

younger workers. The Queen posed for photos with world leaders Diplomatic summits can sometimes be awkward affairs, as presidents and prime ministers are forced to put on smiling faces for the surrounding cameras. But the Queen seems to have tried to ease any nerves among G7 leaders, by joking to the group as they posed for photos this evening: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?"" According to PA Media, the leaders around the Queen laughed and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said emphatically: ""yes"". The Prince of Wales and US climate envoy John Kerry at St James's Palace on Thursday The Prince of Wales has called on G7 leaders to take climate change as seriously as they have taken the pandemic. ""The global health emergency has shown us what a truly borderless crisis looks like.  Of course, we did not fully see Covid coming,"" he said in a speech. ""Yet climate change and bio-diversity loss represent a borderless crisis, the solutions to which have been argued about and postponed for far too long."" ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are doing it for the pandemic.  So if you donât mind me saying so, we must also do it for the planet,"" he added. Boris Johnson met Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for talks this morning Boris Johnson has given his backing to the Tokyo Olympics during a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this morning, Downing Street says. The games - postponed from last year due to the pandemic - are scheduled to
start on 23 July. Japan had been hoping to gain support for the event, which has come under criticism in recent weeks amid a rise in Covid cases in the country - and it seems the British prime minister was happy to provide it. ""The prime minister expressed his support for the Tokyo Olympics, and welcomed Japanese efforts to ensure the Games can take place safely,"" the Number 10 spokesperson says. Boris Johnson will meet the European Union's key players on Saturday as the dispute over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements intensifies. The prime minister will hold talks with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in Cornwall. Ahead of the talks, No 10 indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain. The move risks triggering a ""sausage war"" trade dispute, with the EU threatening to respond to any breach of the deal. Johnson has suggested the EU was taking an ""excessively burdensome"" approach to the arrangements and insisted he is not trying to back out of the agreement. But he said the UK's ""internal market"" has to be respected and ""we just need to make it work"". The G7 leaders pose for a picture with the Queen in front of the iconic Eden Project domes after they gathered for the evening reception. South Korean President Moon
Jae-in is among world leaders to have arrived at the summit. ""We will show our leadership at the G7 in formulating joint
responses to pressing global challenges including health issues
and climate change,"" a senior presidential official told
reporters before Moon set off. South Korea has committed to zero emissions by
2050 and backed a Green New Deal to promote investment in
green technology as a way to bounce back from the pandemic. The G7 is also likely to include talks on free trade and countering China's growing influence. The Queen is smiling broadly as she speaks to US President Joe Biden and his wife at the G7 reception at Cornwall's Eden Project. Prince Charles chats to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, in the background. The Eden Project is the venue for this evening's G7 reception. So what do we know about it? The project - an educational charity based in Cornwall - has been billed as ""the largest indoor rainforest in the world"" and attracts about a million visitors a year. It was built in a disused china clay quarry and first opened in 2001. It was chosen because climate change and biodiversity are among the main themes for the summit. US journalists are taking in the sights and sounds of Cornwall in Britain's far south-west as they travel with President Biden on his first official trip outside the US. Steve Holland, who has been filing pool reports about the president's movements, took a moment to share a photo of the iconic cliff tops. Allow Twitter content?

After President Biden dropped by a hotel pub last night with his wife -displacing a US-based BBC journalist who happened to be dining outdoors- a Washington Post reporter made a crack about his decision to spend time outside despite the grey weather. ""Classic Tourist Perseverance: It's cold, it's rainy, we overpaid for this castle' hotel â but we're putting on our jackets, dammit, and getting a pint,""tweeted Ashley Parker,external. By the way, while our BBC team was moving tables for the Bidens, the president himself commented on the famous British weather. ""Well I tell you, this is so beautiful it doesn't even need the sun,"" Biden said. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has touched down in Cornwall for the G7 summit. In a phone call with Boris Johnson this week, Ramaphosa discussed how the summit would be an important opportunity to lead a global effort to end the pandemic, ""including by increasing access to vaccines and taking steps towards a global treaty to prevent future pandemics"",a Downing Street statement said.,external The leaders also discussed the need to make progress on tackling climate change, it said. The Queen is hosting G7 leaders at the worldâs largest indoor rainforest at the Eden Project. Her Majesty arrived with the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and was greeted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie. World leaders enjoyed welcome drinks in the giant biodomes at the globally renowned eco-attraction. The Queen has arrived at the world-famous biodomes of the Eden Project near St Austell in Cornwall to host an evening reception for G7 leaders. The monarch arrived shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Carrie Johnson and French President Macron and his wife Brigitte. Joe Biden will be the 13th US president to meet the Queen when they come face-to-face at a reception in Cornwall this evening. The two previously met in 1982 when Biden was a senator, according to a White House official. The Queen has met every single president since Dwight Eisenhower. Only one president did not meet her during her 69-year-reign: Lyndon Baines Johnson, who never visited the UK as president. Obama and the queen rub elbows in 2011 Selena Gomez hosted a star-studded concert called Vax Live last month US pop singer and actress Selena Gomez has condemned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's vaccine-sharing plan, telling her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that he must do more. "".@BorisJohnson, 5million doses by September is too little too late. You promised Britain would donate ALL its surplus vaccines,""she wrote,external. Gomez also instructed her followers to ""call on the PM to help meet 1B doses"" and included a link to a petition. The singer hosted a star studded concert called Vax Live in Los Angeles last month, wherePrince Harry appeared on stage to call for vaccines to be ""distributed to everyone everywhere"". Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor This whole G7 summit is a huge push by the UK, the red carpet has been rolled out for world leaders and the royals are coming to Cornwall tonight. The Queen is actually hosting the summit dinner and in terms of effort from the country to welcome people, well they couldn't really do more than that. But when it comes to the solid commitments that Boris Johnson wants to see and those crucial vows on vaccines, although the numbers sound huge campaigners and charities are convinced the problem is so acute even those numbers aren't enough. We're expecting to bring you more from that royal reception early this evening. If youâre just joining
us, here are the main developments: A police officer who was staying on the ferry moored in Falmouth for the G7 summit has tested positive for Covid-19, the Devon and Cornwall force says. The officer, along with 11 others who were in close contact with them, are all now in self-isolation at a different location. There are around 6,500 police officers in Cornwall to provide cover for the meeting of world leaders in Carbis Bay. As well as officers from Devon and Cornwall Police, others have been drafted in from forces across the UK to work on security for the event. The ferry moored in Falmouth is just one provider of accommodation for police officers with others staying in locations across Cornwall. Here's the full story. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov A spokesman for Russia's Kremlin says he does not expect the leaders of the US and Russia to hold a joint press conference when they meet in Geneva on Wednesday. Dmitry Peskov told CNN that the two sides are still negotiating the terms of the meeting, which is highly anticipated by both countries. âWe heard about such a possibility from our American counterparts, but we are still waiting for final confirmation but since the very beginning President Putin has been open to any alternatives,â Peskov told the US network. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, was often criticised for allegedly being too cosy with Putin. Biden has sought to take a tougher line, but has so far given no indication as to what he is planning to tell the Russian president. Asked by reporters on Friday what his message will be, Mr Biden responded: âIâll tell you after I deliver it.â Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK and US relationship indestructible, PM saysBoris Johnson tells the BBC he has coined a new term for the so-called special relationship.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the BBCâs Laura Kuenssberg that the UK-US relationship is ""indestructible"" The alliance between the US and the UK should be known as the ""indestructible relationship"", Boris Johnson has told the BBC after meeting US President Joe Biden for the first time. He said he had ""terrific"" talks with Mr Biden, who has travelled to Cornwall for the G7 summit of world leaders. The summit begins later, with vaccines and climate change on the agenda. Mr Johnson insisted the US president had not rebuked him over post-Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland. However, Mr Biden is said to have ""deep concern"" over the situation. The prime minister was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, after meeting Mr Biden in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, on Thursday ahead of the G7 summit. The summit will see the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK gathering in person for the first time since the pandemic. Why is President Biden concerned about the Northern Ireland Protocol? Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? Carrie Johnson prepares to entertain G7 spouses In Pictures: G7 leaders in Cornwall Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson pledgedthe UK would donate more than 100 million vaccines to poorer countriesin the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. The G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022. Mr Johnson told the BBC the UK and US shared a belief in human rights, the rules-based international order and the transatlantic alliance. He said he thought of the association as ""an indestructible relationship"" or the ""deep and meaningful relationship"". ""It's a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world,"" he said. The PM had previously let it be known that he preferred a new term for the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and US after decades of use. The first real-life meeting between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden clearly went well. Mr Johnson and his team believe chemistry between leaders matters, and that the simple fact of gathering in person sends an important message. But the issues the prime minister wants to confront this week can't be solved by just bonhomie at the beach. Read Laura's blog One area which could cause friction between the two men isthe Northern Ireland Protocol- the part of the Brexit deal that prevents checks along the Irish border. Mr Biden has previously warned that the new arrangements should not jeopardise theGood Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998 that helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Asked if Mr Biden had expressed his concerns, Mr Johnson said: ""No, the president didn't say anything of the kind."" Boris Johnson and Joe Biden met in Cornwall on Thursday ahead of the start of the G7 summit Boris Johnson's wife Carrie and their son Wilfred were joined on the beach by US First Lady, Dr Jill Biden The prime minister did suggest the way the EU was implementing the agreed arrangement was ""excessively burdensome"" and said while the UK, the US and the EU wanted to preserve the balance in Northern Ireland, a resolution to the issue was unlikely to be found in the coming days. However, he added that the different sides would be able to ""work it out"". The arrangements were set down in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal, but the UK has since sought more flexibility. Speaking on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the protocol was the ""only solution"" and should be implemented fully. And French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""I think it's not serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December. ""We have a trade deal - it has been painfully discussed for years... if six months later, they say: 'What we negotiated with you, we don't know how to respect it', then that means that nothing is respectable anymore."" Mr Johnson also defended his decision to reduce overseas aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, despite a manifesto promise to maintain the higher level. Earlier in the week, Mr Johnsonfaced strong criticism from some of his own MPs,one of whom said the cuts would lead to ""hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths"". The prime minister said his government's aid spending as a percentage of GDP exceeded the amount spent by the last two Labour prime ministers. He argued the public understood the financial strain caused by the pandemic, adding: ""I think people in this country, in spite of the constant running down of this country's efforts are incredibly proud of what we're doing in spite of the difficulties that were facing."" He also pointed to theUK's commitment to donate 100 million surplus vaccine dosesto poorer countries in the next year, as well as previous doses contributed to Covax - the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest nations. ""We will have a colossal sum of vaccines that we'll be distributing - the fight against Covid would not be possible without the UK's efforts on vaccines,"" he said. Mr Johnson also said he had discussed the case ofHarry Dunnwith the US president and that Mr Biden was ""extremely sympathetic"" and ""actively engaged"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arriving for the G7 summit at Cornwall airport in Newquay The G7 brings together seven leading industrialised nations. They will spend the day discussing issues including the pandemic before a reception attended by the Queen. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also take part in their first G7 events. Prince William and Catherine will join the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at the G7 leaders' reception. Afterwards, Prince Charles will host a reception for the G7 leaders and heads of the world's largest companies to discuss how the private sector can work with governments to tackle the climate emergency.

"Delay 21 June lockdown lifting, urge local health leadersThe government is warned that unlocking in England on 21 June risks the country ""going backwards"".UKComments","Lifting the last Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be delayed to ""stop us going backwards"", public health officials have said. Unlocking then would risk an increase in hospital admissions, the Association of Directors of Public Health said. The government is expected to announce on Monday whether it will remove the last of the restrictions a week later. Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it had to be careful not to squander the progress made in tackling the virus. The final stage of lifting restrictions would see all legal limits on social contact removed. Nightclubs would reopen, and restrictions on performances, weddings and other life events would also be lifted. But concerns about the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, have led some scientists to call for a delay to ending lockdown. Public Health England (PHE) estimates the variantis roughly 60% more spreadablethan the previously dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, and could make people more seriously ill. The latest official data suggests there have been nearly 30,000 new UK cases of the Delta variant in the past week, accounting for 90% of cases. PHE said nearly two thirds of people infected with the Delta variant have not had a vaccine at all. Another 8,125 virus cases were recorded in the UK on Friday, according to official figures, and another 17 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Association of Directors of Public Health vice-president Jim McManus told Radio 4's Today programme the government had a ""fiendishly difficult decision"" to make on whether to ease restrictions further. However, he said if we ""invest that little bit of time to keep us going forwards, it will stop us going backwards"". ""If you get enough people infected, you will get a rise in hospitalisations,"" he said. Why we may have to wait longer for Freedom Day Lockdown lifting - the four key numbers When will we know if rules will change on 21 June? He added that more people getting infected would allow more variants to develop, which could risk a variant developing that evades the vaccine completely. ""So actually, investing a bit of time is really important to enable the vaccine programme to finish and do its job."" Asked aboutreports in the Times,externalthat the government was considering a four-week delay, he said that would be ""really welcome"". Latest government figures show that more than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.4% of the adult population. Asked about the government decision on 14 June, Mr Zahawi, the vaccines minister, told BBC Breakfast: ""We have to be really careful so that those hard won wars against the virus are not squandered."" He reiterated that the government would ""share the data on Monday"". ""We all know the virus hasn't gone away, it will attempt to mutate,"" he said. ""The Delta variant is more infectious and more severe for those it infects. So, we have to be really careful."" Meanwhile, the latest R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, up from between 1 and 1.2 last week,according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.,external It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others. If the R number is above 1.0, the number of cases is increasing. Mr Zahawi said that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June. He also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global vaccination effort. The UK has pledgedto start donating vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks,as part of 100 million surplus doses which will be delivered in the next year.

"OnlyFans must act on underage use, watchdog says","The children's commissioner for England says OnlyFans needs to do more to stop underage users after the BBC revealed some were selling explicit videos. BBC News found under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts on the site and police say a 14-year-old used her grandmother's passport. Dame Rachel de Souza has written to the British website expressing her ""shock"" and ""deepest concern"" at the findings. OnlyFans said it plans to meet her and correct any misinformation. The social media site allows people to share videos, photos and messages directly with subscribers for tips or a monthly fee. In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments. Founded by Essex businessman Tim Stokely in 2016, the site has boomed during the pandemic and now has more than 120 million users. Creators can post a range of content from cooking to fitness videos, but it is best known for pornography. But BBC News found thatunder-18s have sold explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for people to share indecent images of children. The 'incredible' number of UK adults watching porn This included a 17-year-old who sold explicit videos of herself masturbating and playing with sex toys after signing up with a fake driving licence. While a fake ID did not work, BBC News was also able to set up an account for an underage creator by using her 26-year-old sister's identification, showing how the site's age verification process could be cheated. Now the Children's Commissioner for England has told BBC News the site needs to do more to tackle underage users illegally selling explicit images on the platform. ""Children paid a huge price for keeping us all safe during the pandemic I think it's time we gave them something back,"" said Dame Rachel. ""On any level no child should need or want to sell images of themselves."" In a letter to Mr Stokely, seen by BBC News, Dame Rachel said she wanted to discuss what the company is doing to ""eradicate the harm that children are experiencing"" on the site. ""You say that you have replaced your age verification system with an 'exceptionally effective' one, yet it appears to have been easily circumvented by the BBC team,"" it adds. ""This is unacceptable."" In a statement, OnlyFans said it had received the letter and is planning a meeting with Dame Rachel ""to explain our trust and safety processes and correct any misinformation"". The company added: ""We take our obligations extremely seriously."" In response to the BBC News investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions. It added that its age verification systems exceed regulatory requirements and continue to evolve as new technology becomes available to ""help us to reduce incidences of under-18-year-olds becoming OnlyFans users"".

UK economy grows in April as shops reopen,"The UK economy grew 2.3% in April, its fastest monthly growth since July last year. Shoppers spent more on the High Street as non-essential shops reopened, and people bought more cars and caravans. There was also more spending in pubs, cafes and restaurants as restrictions easedthe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. Despite the surge in activity, the UK economy is still 3.7% below its pre-pandemic peak. Construction fell in April, compared to strong growth the previous month, but the sector remains above its pre-pandemic peak. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the figures were ""a promising sign that our economy is beginning to recover"". Mr Sunak said more than one million people had come off the government's furlough scheme in March and April as businesses reopened. Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics said: ""Strong growth in retail spending, increased car and caravan purchases, schools being open for the full month, and the beginning of the reopening of hospitality all boosted the economy in April."" Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said shoppers flocked back to the High Street as households spent some of their savings on non-essential goods. UK economy lags behind other countries in Covid recovery Coronavirus: Industry dismisses US-UK moves to reopen travel Spending in non-essential shops drove much of the growth as customers were allowed back into stores from 12 April in England, with clothes stores seeing a boost of 69.4%. Overall growth in the services sector was 3.4%, although it remains 4.1% below pre-pandemic levels of February 2020. This included restaurants, bars and cafes, where customers could eat and drink outdoors again, seeing a 39% rise in growth. People also used the ability to travel across the country again, with activity at caravan parks and holiday lets growing 68.6%, while hairdressers and other personal services grew 63.5%. A further relaxation of lockdown rules is planned for 21 June, which would let pubs, bars and restaurants increase the number of people allowed indoors. But that is now lookingincreasingly unlikelywhich may put downward pressure on growth in the summer. Regardless of any pause in reopening, Ms Selfin said economic activity levels in May and June would not rise at the same rate as the April rebound. One of the ways the pandemic has turned normal assumptions upside down is that a shrinking economy can be the successful outcome of deliberate government policy. The government wanted to suppress economic activity to combat the virus, the public largely abided by the restrictions, and the economy shrank. Similarly when you ease restrictions, and that suppressed activity comes back, leading to the sort of growth in a month that you're more normally see in a year, it's a deliberate and predictable outcome of policy rather than a stellar economic performance. The economy has been growing now since January. But the ""bounceback"" is slower than the 7.3% growth recorded in July 2020, when restrictions of much greater severity were being lifted. And we still have a steep hill to climb. At the end of the first quarter of the year our economy had taken the biggest knock of all the G20 economies, in stark contrast to the likes of Korea, Australia, India or Turkey, which had already recovered beyond pre-pandemic levels. The confident official prediction is that we're in for 7% growth this year which should boost that weak international performance. Let's hope that confidence isn't misplaced. Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of UK think tank New Economics Foundation, told the BBC the figures were in line with what was expected ""which is a big bounce as the restrictions were eased and the economy starts going back to normal"". ""But underneath this is probably going to be a story of two halves - the GDP numbers tell us the economy is recovering, but it's likely to be uneven, with the bounceback driven by parts of the economy that have essentially been insulated from the worst parts of the pandemic, and other parts of the economy - those with no work, or small businesses - really, really struggling, particularly as the government starts removing some [support] going into the autumn."" Separately, there is continued friction in trade with EU due to post-Brexit restrictions, although less than at the start of the year. Mr Athow from the ONS said: ""Exports of goods have now, broadly, recovered from the disruptions seen at the beginning of the year. However, imports of goods from the EU are still significantly down on 2020 levels"". Compared with three years ago - the last time trade was unaffected by either Covid or concerns of a disruptive Brexit - British goods exports to the EU this April were 7.1% lower and imports from the EU were 15.3% lower. Exports to the EU were also below their average for 2019. ""That is a disappointing performance, given the boom in global trade flows; UK exporters have lost market share,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Total imports of goods excluding precious metals in April rose 3.9% or Â£1.4bn, while exports fell slightly. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"Delay lockdown lifting, urge local health leadersThe government is warned that unlocking in England on 21 June risks the country ""going backwards"".","Lifting the last Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be delayed to ""stop us going backwards"", public health officials have said. Unlocking then would risk an increase in hospital admissions, the Association of Directors of Public Health said. The government is expected to announce on Monday whether it will remove the last of the restrictions a week later. Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it had to be careful not to squander the progress made in tackling the virus. The final stage of lifting restrictions would see all legal limits on social contact removed. Nightclubs would reopen, and restrictions on performances, weddings and other life events would also be lifted. But concerns about the spread of the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, have led some scientists to call for a delay to ending lockdown. Public Health England (PHE) estimates the variantis roughly 60% more spreadablethan the previously dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, and could make people more seriously ill. The latest official data suggests there have been nearly 30,000 new UK cases of the Delta variant in the past week, accounting for 90% of cases. PHE said nearly two thirds of people infected with the Delta variant have not had a vaccine at all. Another 8,125 virus cases were recorded in the UK on Friday, according to official figures, and another 17 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Association of Directors of Public Health vice-president Jim McManus told Radio 4's Today programme the government had a ""fiendishly difficult decision"" to make on whether to ease restrictions further. However, he said if we ""invest that little bit of time to keep us going forwards, it will stop us going backwards"". ""If you get enough people infected, you will get a rise in hospitalisations,"" he said. Why we may have to wait longer for Freedom Day Lockdown lifting - the four key numbers When will we know if rules will change on 21 June? He added that more people getting infected would allow more variants to develop, which could risk a variant developing that evades the vaccine completely.

Jail for rapist who faked his death at 'Mortuary Beach'Kim Avis tried to evade justice by fleeing Scotland then faking his death at one of California's most dangerous beaches.Highlands & Islands,"Avis following his arrest by US Marshals A rapist who tried to evade justice by fleeing Scotland then faking his own death at one of California's most dangerous beaches has been jailed for 15 years. Kim Avis, a market trader from Inverness, was eventually tracked down more than 1,000 miles away in Colorado, then brought home to Scotland - where he was convicted of rape and sexual abuse offences committed in the Highlands. The Scot had been on bail when he flew into Los Angeles International Airport on 16 February 2019, and was using the name Ken Gordon-Avis. Nine days later, his son reported him missing at Monastery Beach, telling the local sheriff's office that his dad had gone for an evening swim. The beach is near Carmel-by-the-Sea, a city of about 3,800 people on the Big Sur - a rugged and mountainous stretch of Californian coastline. Avis was reported missing at Monastery Beach on California's Big Sur Monastery Beach is renowned for its beautiful sand - and notorious for its water's dangerous strong undertow and treacherous high surf conditions. Deaths of swimmers and divers led to it being nicknamed Mortuary Beach. Mary Schley, who has been a reporter on the Carmel Pine Cone newspaper for almost 23 years, said that nickname was ""well entrenched"". ""The beach is full of posted warnings,"" she said. ""Numerous people, including experienced divers, have drowned there."" Scot who went missing in US guilty of rapes Sex assault accused says claims 'like a film script' Man was 'in trance' during alleged sex attack Man tried to rape girl, 12, then 'joked about it' The authorities were initially unaware of Avis' background and an extensive three-day search of the shore and sea was carried out. However, from the start some things did not seem quite right. ""The water is very cold, so it's unusual for someone to go swimming only in a pair of shorts in the evening in late February, when it's nearing dark, as Avis was said to have done,"" said Ms Schley. ""The water that night was unusually flat and calm, and therefore not nearly as dangerous as when the surf is high, and the weather was clear."" The search, which was co-ordinated by the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, included forestry and fire protection personnel, a dive team, a coastguard helicopter and a drone which swept the area. Sgt David Murray, of Monterey Sheriff's Office, had felt that something did not add up But Commander Derrel Simpson said one of his officers, Sgt David Murray, felt something did not add up. Avis appeared to have taken all his personal belongings - including his passport - with him on the swim. The sheriff's office was also told that the father and son had been staying in hotels and been camping, but they had no equipment for a hiking trip. Sgt Murray found out that the hotel where Avis was said to have stayed had no record of him as a guest. When he contacted one of Avis' relatives in Scotland, he learned that the missing man was facing charges of sexual attacks against women and girls in the Highlands. Commander Simpson, a 30-year sheriff's office veteran, said: ""We have had a lot of deaths at Monastery Beach, but I can't think of anyone using it as a ploy before."" Search teams looking for Avis at Monastery Beach in February 2019 in an image from TV new station KSBW The investigation was turned over to the US Marshals Service, which has responsibility for catching wanted criminals. Over the next few months, Monterey sheriff's deputies worked with US Marshals, Interpol and the Scottish authorities to secure an arrest and extradition warrant for Avis. They established that Avis had entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport, using a different name. It also emerged that his bank account had been used in Colorado after his disappearance in California. Commander Simpson said the most valuable tip-off they received was that Avis had been seen driving a white Ford van in the Big Sur area. Five months after he disappeared, that piece of information helped US Marshals trace Avis in Colorado Springs - more than 1,300 miles (2,092km) away from where he was reported missing. The following week, on 27 July 2019, he was arrested. Kim Avis ran a stall selling jewellery in Inverness Commander Simpson said bringing Avis to justice was a team effort. ""It was impressive how everyone played a part, including the Scottish authorities - and how the US Marshals tracked him half way across the country,"" he said. Avis was returned to Scotland, where he was held in prison until his trial. Last month, a jury at the High Court in Glasgow found the 57-year-old market trader guilty of raping three women. He was also found guilty of attempting to rape one of them when she was 12, and guilty of sexually assaulting a girl when she was 11. He was further convicted of failing to appear for the previous trial. In total, Avis was found guilty of 14 charges from between 2006 and 2017. He had denied all the charges. On Friday, Avis was jailed for 12 years for the sex crimes he committed in the Highlands, and three years for failing to appear in court. Judge Lord Sandison said Avis had been a well-known street trader in Inverness for many years, busking and selling jewellery from his market stall - and even receiving a good citizen award. But the judge said there was another side to Avis, with a background report describing him as ""a controlling and dominant personality"". He said Avis had manipulated, managed and coerced his victims. Fraser Gibson, of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, said it had been a ""difficult and complex"" investigation. He said: ""Kim Avis went to great lengths to evade justice for his crimes. ""Thanks to the efforts of police and prosecutors, working together with US law enforcement, he has been brought to justice and sentenced today."" Police Scotland praised his victims for the ""courage, strength and dignity"" they had shown throughout the investigation and court case.

"OnlyFans must act on underage use, watchdog saysEngland's children's commissioner writes to the firm to express her ""shock"" after a BBC investigation.UK","The children's commissioner for England says OnlyFans needs to do more to stop underage users after the BBC revealed some were selling explicit videos. BBC News found under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts on the site and police say a 14-year-old used her grandmother's passport. Dame Rachel de Souza has written to the British website expressing her ""shock"" and ""deepest concern"" at the findings. OnlyFans said it plans to meet her and correct any misinformation. The social media site allows people to share videos, photos and messages directly with subscribers for tips or a monthly fee. In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments. Founded by Essex businessman Tim Stokely in 2016, the site has boomed during the pandemic and now has more than 120 million users. Creators can post a range of content from cooking to fitness videos, but it is best known for pornography. But BBC News found thatunder-18s have sold explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for people to share indecent images of children. The 'incredible' number of UK adults watching porn This included a 17-year-old who sold explicit videos of herself masturbating and playing with sex toys after signing up with a fake driving licence. While a fake ID did not work, BBC News was also able to set up an account for an underage creator by using her 26-year-old sister's identification, showing how the site's age verification process could be cheated. Now the Children's Commissioner for England has told BBC News the site needs to do more to tackle underage users illegally selling explicit images on the platform. ""Children paid a huge price for keeping us all safe during the pandemic I think it's time we gave them something back,"" said Dame Rachel. ""On any level no child should need or want to sell images of themselves."" In a letter to Mr Stokely, seen by BBC News, Dame Rachel said she wanted to discuss what the company is doing to ""eradicate the harm that children are experiencing"" on the site. ""You say that you have replaced your age verification system with an 'exceptionally effective' one, yet it appears to have been easily circumvented by the BBC team,"" it adds. ""This is unacceptable."" In a statement, OnlyFans said it had received the letter and is planning a meeting with Dame Rachel ""to explain our trust and safety processes and correct any misinformation"". The company added: ""We take our obligations extremely seriously."" In response to the BBC News investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions. It added that its age verification systems exceed regulatory requirements and continue to evolve as new technology becomes available to ""help us to reduce incidences of under-18-year-olds becoming OnlyFans users"".

UK to donate more than 100m surplus vaccine dosesBoris Johnson says the donations to countries in need will begin within weeks.UK,"Boris Johnson says the UK will start donating coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks. More than 100 million surplus doses will be delivered in the next year, he announced ahead of the G7 summit. US President Joe Biden has promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. Five million doses will be given by the UK by the end of September, with 25 million more by the end of the year. The prime minister said: ""As a result of the success of the UK's vaccine programme we are now in a position to share some of our surplus doses with those who need them. ""In doing so we will take a massive step towards beating this pandemic for good."" He said he hoped his fellow leaders at the summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, which starts on Friday, would ""make similar pledges so that, together, we can vaccinate the world by the end of next year"". What difference could half a billion doses make? What is the Covax scheme and how does it work? The group of leaders of wealthy nations is expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of coronavirus vaccines in a collective effort to end the pandemic. The leaders of Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy as well as the US and the UK, are also setting out a plan to expand vaccine manufacturing to help hit that goal. Speaking in Cornwall, Mr Biden said: ""The United States is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached. No strings attached. ""Our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions. We're doing this to save lives."" The announcement came after the US and UK leaders met for the first time in Cornwall ahead of the G7 summit It is not the first contribution to global vaccination by the UK government - it has already donated more than Â£500m to Covax, the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest countries. And it helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is available at cost price - with two-thirds of the 400m doses going to low and middle-income countries, including 170m to India. Why does the G7 summit matter? Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face meeting Mr Johnson wants the G7 leaders to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to also provide vaccines at cost price, while the pandemic continues. About a fifth of the doses being donated by the UK will be delivered through specific agreements with countries in need, with the rest being donated through Covax. Speaking to the BBC, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi agreed that even with the G7 donation pledges ""fundamentally, there's a shortage"" to vaccinate everyone and called on manufacturers to scale up production across the world. He also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global effort. He added that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June. The government has orderedmore than 500m dosesof seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. It is hoped that the surplus doses of vaccine could help prevent the spread of the virus around the world and in doing so, restrict the emergence of more new variants. The donations announcement comes after the UK went back on a commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, insteadcutting that to 0.5%, citing the pandemic's effect on public finances. The donation of vaccines will count as extra aid spending on top of the Â£10bn promised under the reduced target. Zoe Abrams, executive director at the British Red Cross, said the promise on vaccines was ""heartening"" but added: ""While every commitment must be welcomed, more needs to be done, and fast."" And Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was ""not happening anywhere near fast enough"", calling on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away. What difference could a billion jabs make? Joe Biden is breath of fresh air, says Johnson Why does the G7 summit matter?

Founded by Essex businessman Tim Stokely in 2016, the site has boomed during the pandemic and now has more than 120 million users. Creators can post a range of content from cooking to fitness videos, but it is best known for pornography. But BBC News found thatunder-18s have sold explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for people to share indecent images of children. The 'incredible' number of UK adults watching porn This included a 17-year-old who sold explicit videos of herself masturbating and playing with sex toys after signing up with a fake driving licence. While a fake ID did not work, BBC News was also able to set up an account for an underage creator by using her 26-year-old sister's identification, showing how the site's age verification process could be cheated. Now the Children's Commissioner for England has told BBC News the site needs to do more to tackle underage users illegally selling explicit images on the platform. ""Children paid a huge price for keeping us all safe during the pandemic I think it's time we gave them something back,"" said Dame Rachel. ""On any level no child should need or want to sell images of themselves."" In a letter to Mr Stokely, seen by BBC News, Dame Rachel said she wanted to discuss what the company is doing to ""eradicate the harm that children are experiencing"" on the site. ""You say that you have replaced your age verification system with an 'exceptionally effective' one, yet it appears to have been easily circumvented by the BBC team,"" it adds. ""This is unacceptable."" In a statement, OnlyFans said it had received the letter and is planning a meeting with Dame Rachel ""to explain our trust and safety processes and correct any misinformation"". The company added: ""We take our obligations extremely seriously."" In response to the BBC News investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions. It added that its age verification systems exceed regulatory requirements and continue to evolve as new technology becomes available to ""help us to reduce incidences of under-18-year-olds becoming OnlyFans users"".

Here is a round-up of what's been happening at the G7 summit today in Cornwall:  Boris Johnson and Italy's Mario Draghi G7 leaders were in agreement over the need to continue supporting their economies with fiscal stimulus after the pandemic, Reuters news agency reported. ""There was broad consensus across the table on continued support for fiscal expansion at this stage,"" a source said. Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Italy's Mario Draghi expressed particular support, they added. The leaders believe there should be

long-term policies for ensuring the health of public finances in

the future, the source said. Leaders emphasised the importance of taking action to

reduce unemployment. These included policies such as retraining and offering support for

younger workers. The Queen posed for photos with world leaders Diplomatic summits can sometimes be awkward affairs, as presidents and prime ministers are forced to put on smiling faces for the surrounding cameras. But the Queen seems to have tried to ease any nerves among G7 leaders, by joking to the group as they posed for photos this evening: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?"" According to PA Media, the leaders around the Queen laughed and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said emphatically: ""yes"". The Prince of Wales and US climate envoy John Kerry at St James's Palace on Thursday The Prince of Wales has called on G7 leaders to take climate change as seriously as they have taken the pandemic. ""The global health emergency has shown us what a truly borderless crisis looks like.  Of course, we did not fully see Covid coming,"" he said in a speech. ""Yet climate change and bio-diversity loss represent a borderless crisis, the solutions to which have been argued about and postponed for far too long."" ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are doing it for the pandemic.  So if you donât mind me saying so, we must also do it for the planet,"" he added. Boris Johnson met Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for talks this morning Boris Johnson has given his backing to the Tokyo Olympics during a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this morning, Downing Street says. The games - postponed from last year due to the pandemic - are scheduled to
start on 23 July. Japan had been hoping to gain support for the event, which has come under criticism in recent weeks amid a rise in Covid cases in the country - and it seems the British prime minister was happy to provide it. ""The prime minister expressed his support for the Tokyo Olympics, and welcomed Japanese efforts to ensure the Games can take place safely,"" the Number 10 spokesperson says. Boris Johnson will meet the European Union's key players on Saturday as the dispute over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements intensifies. The prime minister will hold talks with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in Cornwall. Ahead of the talks, No 10 indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain. The move risks triggering a ""sausage war"" trade dispute, with the EU threatening to respond to any breach of the deal. Johnson has suggested the EU was taking an ""excessively burdensome"" approach to the arrangements and insisted he is not trying to back out of the agreement. But he said the UK's ""internal market"" has to be respected and ""we just need to make it work"". The G7 leaders pose for a picture with the Queen in front of the iconic Eden Project domes after they gathered for the evening reception. South Korean President Moon
Jae-in is among world leaders to have arrived at the summit. ""We will show our leadership at the G7 in formulating joint
responses to pressing global challenges including health issues
and climate change,"" a senior presidential official told
reporters before Moon set off. South Korea has committed to zero emissions by
2050 and backed a Green New Deal to promote investment in
green technology as a way to bounce back from the pandemic. The G7 is also likely to include talks on free trade and countering China's growing influence. The Queen is smiling broadly as she speaks to US President Joe Biden and his wife at the G7 reception at Cornwall's Eden Project. Prince Charles chats to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, in the background. The Eden Project is the venue for this evening's G7 reception. So what do we know about it? The project - an educational charity based in Cornwall - has been billed as ""the largest indoor rainforest in the world"" and attracts about a million visitors a year. It was built in a disused china clay quarry and first opened in 2001. It was chosen because climate change and biodiversity are among the main themes for the summit. US journalists are taking in the sights and sounds of Cornwall in Britain's far south-west as they travel with President Biden on his first official trip outside the US.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor This whole G7 summit is a huge push by the UK, the red carpet has been rolled out for world leaders and the royals are coming to Cornwall tonight. The Queen is actually hosting the summit dinner and in terms of effort from the country to welcome people, well they couldn't really do more than that. But when it comes to the solid commitments that Boris Johnson wants to see and those crucial vows on vaccines, although the numbers sound huge campaigners and charities are convinced the problem is so acute even those numbers aren't enough. We're expecting to bring you more from that royal reception early this evening. If youâre just joining
us, here are the main developments: A police officer who was staying on the ferry moored in Falmouth for the G7 summit has tested positive for Covid-19, the Devon and Cornwall force says. The officer, along with 11 others who were in close contact with them, are all now in self-isolation at a different location. There are around 6,500 police officers in Cornwall to provide cover for the meeting of world leaders in Carbis Bay. As well as officers from Devon and Cornwall Police, others have been drafted in from forces across the UK to work on security for the event. The ferry moored in Falmouth is just one provider of accommodation for police officers with others staying in locations across Cornwall. Here's the full story. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov A spokesman for Russia's Kremlin says he does not expect the leaders of the US and Russia to hold a joint press conference when they meet in Geneva on Wednesday. Dmitry Peskov told CNN that the two sides are still negotiating the terms of the meeting, which is highly anticipated by both countries. âWe heard about such a possibility from our American counterparts, but we are still waiting for final confirmation but since the very beginning President Putin has been open to any alternatives,â Peskov told the US network. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, was often criticised for allegedly being too cosy with Putin. Biden has sought to take a tougher line, but has so far given no indication as to what he is planning to tell the Russian president. Asked by reporters on Friday what his message will be, Mr Biden responded: âIâll tell you after I deliver it.â Â© 2025 BBC.

UK to donate more than 100m surplus vaccine dosesBoris Johnson says the donations to countries in need will begin within weeks.,"Boris Johnson says the UK will start donating coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks. More than 100 million surplus doses will be delivered in the next year, he announced ahead of the G7 summit. US President Joe Biden has promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. Five million doses will be given by the UK by the end of September, with 25 million more by the end of the year. The prime minister said: ""As a result of the success of the UK's vaccine programme we are now in a position to share some of our surplus doses with those who need them. ""In doing so we will take a massive step towards beating this pandemic for good."" He said he hoped his fellow leaders at the summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, which starts on Friday, would ""make similar pledges so that, together, we can vaccinate the world by the end of next year"". What difference could half a billion doses make? What is the Covax scheme and how does it work? The group of leaders of wealthy nations is expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of coronavirus vaccines in a collective effort to end the pandemic. The leaders of Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy as well as the US and the UK, are also setting out a plan to expand vaccine manufacturing to help hit that goal. Speaking in Cornwall, Mr Biden said: ""The United States is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached. No strings attached. ""Our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions. We're doing this to save lives."" The announcement came after the US and UK leaders met for the first time in Cornwall ahead of the G7 summit It is not the first contribution to global vaccination by the UK government - it has already donated more than Â£500m to Covax, the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest countries. And it helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is available at cost price - with two-thirds of the 400m doses going to low and middle-income countries, including 170m to India. Why does the G7 summit matter? Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face meeting Mr Johnson wants the G7 leaders to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to also provide vaccines at cost price, while the pandemic continues. About a fifth of the doses being donated by the UK will be delivered through specific agreements with countries in need, with the rest being donated through Covax. Speaking to the BBC, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi agreed that even with the G7 donation pledges ""fundamentally, there's a shortage"" to vaccinate everyone and called on manufacturers to scale up production across the world. He also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global effort. He added that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June. The government has orderedmore than 500m dosesof seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. It is hoped that the surplus doses of vaccine could help prevent the spread of the virus around the world and in doing so, restrict the emergence of more new variants. The donations announcement comes after the UK went back on a commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, insteadcutting that to 0.5%, citing the pandemic's effect on public finances. The donation of vaccines will count as extra aid spending on top of the Â£10bn promised under the reduced target. Zoe Abrams, executive director at the British Red Cross, said the promise on vaccines was ""heartening"" but added: ""While every commitment must be welcomed, more needs to be done, and fast."" And Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was ""not happening anywhere near fast enough"", calling on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away.

Here is a round-up of what's been happening at the G7 summit today in Cornwall:  Boris Johnson and Italy's Mario Draghi G7 leaders were in agreement over the need to continue supporting their economies with fiscal stimulus after the pandemic, Reuters news agency reported. ""There was broad consensus across the table on continued support for fiscal expansion at this stage,"" a source said. Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Italy's Mario Draghi expressed particular support, they added. The leaders believe there should be

long-term policies for ensuring the health of public finances in

the future, the source said. Leaders emphasised the importance of taking action to

reduce unemployment. These included policies such as retraining and offering support for

younger workers. The Queen posed for photos with world leaders Diplomatic summits can sometimes be awkward affairs, as presidents and prime ministers are forced to put on smiling faces for the surrounding cameras. But the Queen seems to have tried to ease any nerves among G7 leaders, by joking to the group as they posed for photos this evening: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?"" According to PA Media, the leaders around the Queen laughed and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said emphatically: ""yes"". The Prince of Wales and US climate envoy John Kerry at St James's Palace on Thursday The Prince of Wales has called on G7 leaders to take climate change as seriously as they have taken the pandemic. ""The global health emergency has shown us what a truly borderless crisis looks like.  Of course, we did not fully see Covid coming,"" he said in a speech. ""Yet climate change and bio-diversity loss represent a borderless crisis, the solutions to which have been argued about and postponed for far too long."" ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are doing it for the pandemic.  So if you donât mind me saying so, we must also do it for the planet,"" he added. Boris Johnson met Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for talks this morning Boris Johnson has given his backing to the Tokyo Olympics during a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this morning, Downing Street says. The games - postponed from last year due to the pandemic - are scheduled to
start on 23 July. Japan had been hoping to gain support for the event, which has come under criticism in recent weeks amid a rise in Covid cases in the country - and it seems the British prime minister was happy to provide it. ""The prime minister expressed his support for the Tokyo Olympics, and welcomed Japanese efforts to ensure the Games can take place safely,"" the Number 10 spokesperson says. Boris Johnson will meet the European Union's key players on Saturday as the dispute over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements intensifies. The prime minister will hold talks with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in Cornwall. Ahead of the talks, No 10 indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain. The move risks triggering a ""sausage war"" trade dispute, with the EU threatening to respond to any breach of the deal. Johnson has suggested the EU was taking an ""excessively burdensome"" approach to the arrangements and insisted he is not trying to back out of the agreement. But he said the UK's ""internal market"" has to be respected and ""we just need to make it work"". The G7 leaders pose for a picture with the Queen in front of the iconic Eden Project domes after they gathered for the evening reception. South Korean President Moon
Jae-in is among world leaders to have arrived at the summit. ""We will show our leadership at the G7 in formulating joint
responses to pressing global challenges including health issues
and climate change,"" a senior presidential official told
reporters before Moon set off. South Korea has committed to zero emissions by
2050 and backed a Green New Deal to promote investment in
green technology as a way to bounce back from the pandemic. The G7 is also likely to include talks on free trade and countering China's growing influence. The Queen is smiling broadly as she speaks to US President Joe Biden and his wife at the G7 reception at Cornwall's Eden Project. Prince Charles chats to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, in the background. The Eden Project is the venue for this evening's G7 reception. So what do we know about it? The project - an educational charity based in Cornwall - has been billed as ""the largest indoor rainforest in the world"" and attracts about a million visitors a year. It was built in a disused china clay quarry and first opened in 2001. It was chosen because climate change and biodiversity are among the main themes for the summit. US journalists are taking in the sights and sounds of Cornwall in Britain's far south-west as they travel with President Biden on his first official trip outside the US. Steve Holland, who has been filing pool reports about the president's movements, took a moment to share a photo of the iconic cliff tops. Allow Twitter content?

After President Biden dropped by a hotel pub last night with his wife -displacing a US-based BBC journalist who happened to be dining outdoors- a Washington Post reporter made a crack about his decision to spend time outside despite the grey weather. ""Classic Tourist Perseverance: It's cold, it's rainy, we overpaid for this castle' hotel â but we're putting on our jackets, dammit, and getting a pint,""tweeted Ashley Parker,external. By the way, while our BBC team was moving tables for the Bidens, the president himself commented on the famous British weather. ""Well I tell you, this is so beautiful it doesn't even need the sun,"" Biden said. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has touched down in Cornwall for the G7 summit. In a phone call with Boris Johnson this week, Ramaphosa discussed how the summit would be an important opportunity to lead a global effort to end the pandemic, ""including by increasing access to vaccines and taking steps towards a global treaty to prevent future pandemics"",a Downing Street statement said.,external The leaders also discussed the need to make progress on tackling climate change, it said. The Queen is hosting G7 leaders at the worldâs largest indoor rainforest at the Eden Project. Her Majesty arrived with the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and was greeted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie. World leaders enjoyed welcome drinks in the giant biodomes at the globally renowned eco-attraction. The Queen has arrived at the world-famous biodomes of the Eden Project near St Austell in Cornwall to host an evening reception for G7 leaders. The monarch arrived shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Carrie Johnson and French President Macron and his wife Brigitte. Joe Biden will be the 13th US president to meet the Queen when they come face-to-face at a reception in Cornwall this evening. The two previously met in 1982 when Biden was a senator, according to a White House official. The Queen has met every single president since Dwight Eisenhower. Only one president did not meet her during her 69-year-reign: Lyndon Baines Johnson, who never visited the UK as president. Obama and the queen rub elbows in 2011 Selena Gomez hosted a star-studded concert called Vax Live last month US pop singer and actress Selena Gomez has condemned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's vaccine-sharing plan, telling her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that he must do more. "".@BorisJohnson, 5million doses by September is too little too late. You promised Britain would donate ALL its surplus vaccines,""she wrote,external. Gomez also instructed her followers to ""call on the PM to help meet 1B doses"" and included a link to a petition. The singer hosted a star studded concert called Vax Live in Los Angeles last month, wherePrince Harry appeared on stage to call for vaccines to be ""distributed to everyone everywhere"". Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor This whole G7 summit is a huge push by the UK, the red carpet has been rolled out for world leaders and the royals are coming to Cornwall tonight. The Queen is actually hosting the summit dinner and in terms of effort from the country to welcome people, well they couldn't really do more than that. But when it comes to the solid commitments that Boris Johnson wants to see and those crucial vows on vaccines, although the numbers sound huge campaigners and charities are convinced the problem is so acute even those numbers aren't enough. We're expecting to bring you more from that royal reception early this evening. If youâre just joining
us, here are the main developments: A police officer who was staying on the ferry moored in Falmouth for the G7 summit has tested positive for Covid-19, the Devon and Cornwall force says. The officer, along with 11 others who were in close contact with them, are all now in self-isolation at a different location. There are around 6,500 police officers in Cornwall to provide cover for the meeting of world leaders in Carbis Bay. As well as officers from Devon and Cornwall Police, others have been drafted in from forces across the UK to work on security for the event. The ferry moored in Falmouth is just one provider of accommodation for police officers with others staying in locations across Cornwall. Here's the full story. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov A spokesman for Russia's Kremlin says he does not expect the leaders of the US and Russia to hold a joint press conference when they meet in Geneva on Wednesday. Dmitry Peskov told CNN that the two sides are still negotiating the terms of the meeting, which is highly anticipated by both countries. âWe heard about such a possibility from our American counterparts, but we are still waiting for final confirmation but since the very beginning President Putin has been open to any alternatives,â Peskov told the US network. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, was often criticised for allegedly being too cosy with Putin. Biden has sought to take a tougher line, but has so far given no indication as to what he is planning to tell the Russian president. Asked by reporters on Friday what his message will be, Mr Biden responded: âIâll tell you after I deliver it.â Â© 2025 BBC.

'Half of fast fashion' clothes made of new plastics,"The report said 60% of Boohoo's women's clothing were made solely from new plastics Nearly half of of women's clothes for sale on some of the leading online websites are made entirely from new plastics, according to a study. The research by the charity the Royal Society for the Arts (RSA) looked at 10,000 items being sold by  Boohoo, Prettylittlething, Missguided and Asos. It found on average 49% were made of polyester, acrylic, nylon and elastane. The RSA said the numbers varied by outlet with Asos using comparatively less new plastic than the others. The study found that 60% of Boohoo's women's clothing and 57% of Boohoo-owned Prettylittlething's were made entirely from new plastics. Missguided had 42% of its items made entirely from new plastics and Asos 36%. âGoing outâ gear out and athleisure in for Boohoo Asos 'rips up the playbook' for pandemic boost The RSA also said that the study found that on average, just 3% of clothes which contained any plastics used recycled plastics - ""although this rises to 6% among items from Asos"". Missguided's head of sourcing and product technology Paul Smith said the company was ""proud of the progress it had made"" and that all its own brand products were packaged and despatched in 100% recycled plastic. However, it added: ""We agree there's more to do."" The company said it had ""committed to making sure 10% of our products will use recycled fibres by the end of 2021 and 25% by the end of 2022"". Asos said the figures reflected positively on it, but like the rest of the industry it recognised more needed to be done. The study for the report Fast Fashion's Plastic Problem, was carried out between 11 and 29 May. The researchers looked at more than 2,500 recently added items from each website, spread across different product categories. The RSA said the plastic used large amounts of energy and created environmental damage in their production and could take thousands of years to break down. It added that a ""throwaway culture"", meant that ""the bulk of these garments are ending up in landfill"". ""The sheer volume of clothing produced by these websites is shocking - we should see many of these items, which go for rock-bottom prices, as akin to other short-lived plastics. The nature of fast fashion trends means they are not designed to have long lives in our wardrobes,"" said the report's co-author Josie Warden. The RSA is calling for action to cut down on the use of plastic in fashion items. It wants to government to look at introducing a plastics tax on clothes imported into or produced in the UK. It says websites should come  up with ways of promoting second-hand clothing, ""along the lines of Depop and Asos' marketplace"" and to publish figures on how much plastic they use. And it is encouraging consumers to buy less and keep clothes for longer, rather than only wearing garments a ""handful of times"". Asos, said its prices were not at ""throwaway"" levels and disputed the report's description of it as a fast-fashion retailer. It pointed out it does publish information about fabrics and their care, including on a new page on its website about how to care for clothes in a more environmentally-friendly way. It said it is encouraging that the RSA figures reflected positively on it because shifting to more sustainable materials was a key element of its Fashion With Integrity programme. However, it said like the rest of the industry it recognised there was much more work to do and that it was continually reviewing and developing programmes to minimise its impact on people and the planet. Boohoo has published itsUp Front strategy,externalwhich sets an ""ambitious"" goal of all polyester and cotton being recycled or more sustainable for 2025. However, the RSA report said the company had a ""mountain to climb"" to meet this target. Boohoo said: ""Solutions to these complex challenges require collaboration which is why we are delighted with the response from our existing and new suppliers to help us identify innovative solutions to achieve this target,"" a spokesperson said. Boohoo is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and a signatory of Textiles 2030. ""We've engaged with our customers extensively through focus groups and a recent survey, that received over 14,500 responses, to understand their attitudes to textile waste,"" the spokesperson added. ""What they tell us is that the price they pay does not determine how long they keep an item of clothing and 88% said that they use either charity shops or resale sites as a responsible form of disposal, throwing an item away is an absolute last resort for them.""

OnlyFans: âDeep concernâ over illegal underage use,"The children's commissioner for England says OnlyFans needs to do more to stop underage users after the BBC revealed some were selling explicit videos. BBC News found under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts on the site and police say a 14-year-old used her grandmother's passport. Dame Rachel de Souza has written to the British website expressing her ""shock"" and ""deepest concern"" at the findings. OnlyFans said it plans to meet her and correct any misinformation. The social media site allows people to share videos, photos and messages directly with subscribers for tips or a monthly fee. In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments. Founded by Essex businessman Tim Stokely in 2016, the site has boomed during the pandemic and now has more than 120 million users. Creators can post a range of content from cooking to fitness videos, but it is best known for pornography. But BBC News found thatunder-18s have sold explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for people to share indecent images of children. The 'incredible' number of UK adults watching porn This included a 17-year-old who sold explicit videos of herself masturbating and playing with sex toys after signing up with a fake driving licence. While a fake ID did not work, BBC News was also able to set up an account for an underage creator by using her 26-year-old sister's identification, showing how the site's age verification process could be cheated. Now the Children's Commissioner for England has told BBC News the site needs to do more to tackle underage users illegally selling explicit images on the platform. ""Children paid a huge price for keeping us all safe during the pandemic I think it's time we gave them something back,"" said Dame Rachel. ""On any level no child should need or want to sell images of themselves."" In a letter to Mr Stokely, seen by BBC News, Dame Rachel said she wanted to discuss what the company is doing to ""eradicate the harm that children are experiencing"" on the site. ""You say that you have replaced your age verification system with an 'exceptionally effective' one, yet it appears to have been easily circumvented by the BBC team,"" it adds. ""This is unacceptable."" In a statement, OnlyFans said it had received the letter and is planning a meeting with Dame Rachel ""to explain our trust and safety processes and correct any misinformation"". The company added: ""We take our obligations extremely seriously."" In response to the BBC News investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions. It added that its age verification systems exceed regulatory requirements and continue to evolve as new technology becomes available to ""help us to reduce incidences of under-18-year-olds becoming OnlyFans users"".

Wildlife officials reunite leopard cub with mum,"Wildlife officials in India have helped reunite a leopard cub that was separated from her mother. Villagers in the north-eastern state of Assam found the two-month old female stuck in a trench in a tea garden. Wildlife vet Khanin Changmai, who was called to attend to the cub, told the BBC that he found her ""playful and uninjured, but slightly dehydrated"". India has more than 12,500 leopards. With their habitat shrinking, the cats often stray into villages near forests. Reports of man-animal conflict have been growing in recent years across the country as leopards come into the villages and kill livestock. They have also sometimes entered crowded areas and attacked people. The latest incident, which took place in Natun Gaon village in Tinsukia district on the morning of 23 May, has been reported only recently by wildlife officials. Dr Khanin Changmai gave the cub some oral rehydration solution ""There was panic in the nearby villages when tea pluckers spotted the leopard in the tea garden. She fled when they raised an alarm,"" Dr Changmai, a vet with the Wildlife Trust of India, told the BBC's Geeta Pandey. He said the plantation owner was led to the trench by the cub's crying. Since she was unable to come up on her own, the villagers rescued her and took her to a nearby house. Leopard wreaks havoc in school in India Baby injured after being snatched by leopard India school attack leopard escapes from enclosure Leopard kills monk meditating in forest Dr Changmai said he gave her ""15-20ml of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to treat her dehydration"". The village is close to two small sanctuaries and is separated by a river from the Dibru-Soikhowa National Park, home to tigers, leopards and other wild animals. Dr Changmai said the villagers were worried that the leopard would return to find the cub and insisted that we take her away and also set a trap to catch the mother, ""but we convinced them that they must not interfere and leave the cub where they'd found her"". Images from the camera trap showed the leopard carrying away her cub The cub was returned to the area ""in a cardboard box, lightly sealed with tape to ensure it couldn't get out on its own but the mother would be able to tear it open"". ""We checked on her again in the evening and gave her some more ORS. We set up camera traps to monitor the area. The villagers also kept an eye to ensure it wasn't attacked by dogs,"" Dr Changmai said. ""At night, less than 12 hours after they were separated, the mother found the box and retrieved her cub,"" he added.

"Joe Biden is breath of fresh air, says Johnson","This video can not be played There is âso muchâ the US presidential team want to do with the UK says Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson has described US President Joe Biden as a ""breath of fresh air"" after they met for the first time on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall. ""There's so much that they want to do together with us, from security, NATO, to climate change,"" Mr Johnson said. He also said there was ""complete harmony"" with Mr Biden over Northern Ireland. The US, UK and EU all want to protect theGood Friday Agreement, the PM said. It comes after Mr Biden had earlier warned that the UK-EU dispute over border controls should not risk the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998, helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Johnson said he was ""optimistic"" the peace process would be kept going and that there is ""absolutely common ground"" on the issue between the two leaders. During their meeting, the two men also established a taskforce to re-establish travel across the Atlantic, after the US banned most British people from entering at the start of the pandemic. And they agreed a deal - labelled the ""Atlantic Charter"" - which commits the two countries to work together on global challenges. Mr Johnson said: ""It's incredibly important that we should affirm that [relationship] and the talks were great, they went on for a long time, we covered a huge range of subjects, and it's wonderful to listen to the Biden administration and to Joe Biden."" Mr Biden said the ""Atlantic Charter"" would address the ""key challenges of this century - cyber security, emerging technologies, global health and climate change"". ""We affirmed the special relationship - that is not said lightly - the special relationship between our people and renewed our commitment to defending the enduring democratic values that both our nations share,"" he added. Earlier, the leaders posed for photographs with their wives and the four exchanged gifts, with keen cyclist Mr Johnson receiving a US-made bike and helmet. Mr Johnson gave the president a photo of Frederick Douglass - a former slave who campaigned against slavery in the 19th Century - and a first edition of Daphne du Maurier's The Apple Tree, a collection of short stories, to First Lady Jill Biden. The G7 summit begins on Friday and will be the first time world leaders have assembled in person since the coronavirus pandemic. They will be joined by the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who will all attend the G7 leaders' reception on Friday evening. Afterwards, Prince Charles will host a reception for the G7 leaders and CEOs from the world's largest companies to discuss how the private sector can work with governments to tackle the climate emergency, with Prince William also attending. Why does the G7 summit matter? From Air Force One to Beast - Biden's travel kit Biden to warn PM not to risk NI peace over Brexit Covid vaccines and climate change will be among the main issues on the G7 agenda. But the on-going disagreement between the UK and the EU over post-Brexit regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from Great Britain also look set to feature heavily in diplomatic discussions. The arrangements were agreed in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal, but the UK has since sought more flexibility. Asked about the dispute on Thursday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""I think it's not serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December. ""We have a trade deal - it has been painfully discussed for years... if six months later, they say: 'What we negotiated with you, we don't know how to respect it', then that means that nothing is respectable anymore."" European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the Northern Ireland protocol - the name for the post-Brexit trading rules - was the ""only solution"" and should be implemented fully. Northern Ireland was given special status as a result of the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement between the UK and the EU. While England, Scotland and Wales no longer follow EU rules, Northern Ireland still does, because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. In order to avoid a physical border between the two countries - and thereby protect the peace process - it was agreed that customs checks would take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK. But unionists say this has effectively put a border down the Irish Sea instead - something they are ideologically opposed to - and business say supply chains have been complicated and disrupted. Talks on Wednesday between Brexit minister Lord Frost and the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to try to resolve the standoff ended without a breakthrough. Since becoming president, Mr Biden has frequently stressed the importance of the Good Friday Agreement, which was brokered by the US. And speaking before the summit,the president's national security adviser told the BBCthat Mr Biden has ""deep"" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in the region. Asked if Mr Biden made his alarm about the situation in Northern Ireland clear, Mr Johnson replied: ""No, he didn't."" Carrie Johnson and her young son, Wilfred, with First Lady Jill Biden Before the meeting, Mrs Biden and Mrs Johnson joined their husbands in Cornwall for a walk in Carbis Bay. Admiring the view, Mr Biden said: ""It's gorgeous - I don't want to go home."" The two women dipped their feet in the sea and later had tea together. Dr Biden told reporters: ""It's really nice to be here in Cornwall. It's my first time. Obviously it's beautiful for those of you who have been here before."" Mr Biden suggested that both he and the prime minister had ""married way above our stations"" - something with which Mr Johnson agreed. The prime minister married his partner Carrie in a low-key wedding in Westminster Cathedral, at the end of May.
