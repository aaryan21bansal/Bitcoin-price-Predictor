Jewish newspapers unite against Labour,"The UK's three main Jewish newspapers have published the same front page, warning that a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". The Jewish Chronicle,,externalJewish News,externalandJewish Telegraph,externalmove comes amid anger over Labour's anti-Semitism code. They say the party must sign up to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism. Labour says its version ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA definition. The party added the security and wellbeing of Jewish people was a priority and a Labour government would pose ""no threat of any kind"" to Jewish people. Labour's new code of conduct was approved by its National Executive Committee last week, but it has been criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs. Although it includes the definition of anti-Semitism given by the IHRA, it has not included all of the body's ""working examples"". Labour MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night. Labour 'wrong to investigate Hodge' How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded MPs criticise Labour's anti-Semitism code Under the same headline, ""United we stand"", the newspapers said Labour had ""diluted"" the IHRA definition in its new code and there was a ""stubborn refusal"" from the party to accept it. They said the party had the choice of accepting the definition or ""be seen by all decent people as a racist, anti-Semitic party"". ""The stain and shame of anti-Semitism has coursed through Her Majesty's Opposition since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015,"" the papers say. Labour veteran Dame Margaret Hodge confronted Mr Corbyn in the Commons last week, reportedly swearing at him and calling him an anti-Semite. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the MP said she ""blew my top"" when she found out Labour had, despite criticism, written its anti-Semitism guidelines in such a way. ""And I thought rather than do what politicians usually do, and talk each other down behind our backs, I would go and confront him,"" she added. The party launched a disciplinary inquiry into the MP, which shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith has called ""completely absurd"". Speaking onNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast,Ms Griffith said: ""The idea that Jeremy would want to set up an atmosphere in the party where people couldn't go and say things to him is completely absurd. ""It's just not his way of dealing with things. I think we'd all prefer to have somebody speak to your face rather than behind your back."" Dame Margaret Hodge has been a fierce critic of Labour's new anti-Semitism guidelines Shadow chancellor John McDonnell felt Dame Margaret had ""misunderstood"" Labour's new code of conduct. He toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme:""I can understand why she was so angry, if that's what she believed this code had done, and I think it is a complete misunderstanding and we can resolve that amicably."" He said the issue had to be resolved quickly and that Mr Corbyn had asked Labour's chief whip and general secretary to do this. Asked about Mr McDonnell's comments, Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I hope she [Dame Margaret] has now had a chance to read the code of conduct that we agreed at the national executive, and I hope she has had time to reflect that this is a very honest endeavour to ensure we prevent any anti-Semitism rising in our party."" The Labour Party said it was ""fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations"". ""The next Labour government poses no threat of any kind whatsoever to Jewish people,"" a statement said. ""The security and wellbeing of Jewish people is a priority for our party and in government we will always ensure schools, synagogues and institutions are properly protected. ""We understand the strong concerns raised in the Jewish community and are seeking to engage with communal organisations to build trust and confidence in our party. We know there is a huge amount of work to do."" The party said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"". Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry. It followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks. The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples provided by the IHRA definition: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis But Labour has insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code.

Liquid water 'lake' revealed on Mars,"Researchers have found evidence of an existing body of liquid water on Mars. What they believe to be a lake sits under the planet's south polar ice cap, and is about 20km (12 miles) across. Previous research found possible signs ofintermittent liquid water flowingon the martian surface, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water on the planet in the present day. Lake beds like those explored by Nasa's Curiosity rover show water was present on the surface of Mars in the past. However, the planet's climate has since cooled due to its thin atmosphere, leaving most of its water locked up in ice. The result is exciting because scientists have long searched for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars, but these have come up empty or yielded ambiguous findings. It will also interest those studying the possibilities for life beyond Earth - though it does not yet raise the stakes in the search for biology. Read more about Mars exploration Science correspondent Jonathan Amos sees Europe's Red Planet rover taking shape The woman whose day job is flying to Mars All the BBC's coverage of Mars The discovery was made using Marsis, a radar instrument on board the European Space Agency's (Esa) Mars Express orbiter. The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars ""It's probably not a very large lake,"" said Prof Roberto Orosei from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, who led the study. Marsis wasn't able to determine how thick the layer of water might be, but the research team estimate that it is a minimum of one metre. ""This really qualifies this as a body of water. A lake, not some kind of meltwater filling some space between rock and ice, as happens in certain glaciers on Earth,"" Prof Orosei added. Artists' impression: Mars Express probing the planet's surface. Marsis radar results above. Radar instruments like Marsis examine the surface and immediate subsurface of the planet by sending out a signal and examining what is bounced back. The continuous white line at the top of the radar results above marks the beginning of the South Polar Layered Deposit; a filo pastry-like accumulation of water ice and dust. Beneath this, researchers spotted something unusual 1.5km under the ice. ""In light blue you can see where the reflections from the bottom are stronger than surface reflection. This is something that is to us the tell tale sign of the presence of water,"" says Prof Orosei. Artists' impression: Marsis data shows an area of high reflectivity (dark blue) which is thought to be water Nothing definitive. Yet. Dr Manish Patel from the Open University explained: ""We have long since known that the surface of Mars is inhospitable to life as we know it, so the search for life on Mars is now in the subsurface. ""This is where we get sufficient protection from harmful radiation, and the pressure and temperature rise to more favourable levels. Most importantly, this allows liquid water, essential for life."" This principle of following the water is key to astrobiology - the study of potential life beyond Earth. So while the findings suggest water is present, they don't confirm anything further. ""We are not closer to actually detecting life,"" Dr Patel told BBC News, ""but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars. It is like a treasure map - except in this case, there will be lots of 'X's marking the spots."" Astrobiologists study extreme environments like salt lakes on Earth to understand how life might survive on Mars The water's temperature and chemistry could also pose a problem for any potential martian organisms. In order to remain liquid in such cold conditions (the research team estimate between -10 and -30 Celsius where it meets the ice above), the water likely has a great many salts dissolved in it. ""It's plausible that the water may be an extremely cold, concentrated brine, which would be pretty challenging for life,"" explained Dr Claire Cousins, an astrobiologist from the University of St Andrews, UK. While its existence provides a tantalising prospect for those interested in the possibility of past or present life on Mars, the lake's characteristics must first be verified by further research. ""What needs to be done now,"" explained Dr Matt Balme from the Open University, ""is for the measurements to be repeated elsewhere to look for similar signals, and, if possible, for all other explanation to be examined and - hopefully - ruled out. ""Maybe this could even be the trigger for an ambitious new Mars mission to drill into this buried water-pocket - like has been done for sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica on Earth,"" he added. The area has been compared to Lake Vostok, which lies 4km beneath the Antarctic ice Scientists havepreviously claimed to find bacterial lifein the buried depths of Antarctica's Lake Vostok, but drilling on Mars would make for an ambitious project indeed. ""Getting there and acquiring the final evidence that this is indeed a lake will not be an easy task,"" said Prof Orosei. ""It will require flying a robot there which is capable of drilling through 1.5km of ice. This will certainly require some technological developments that at the moment are not available.""

US and EU 'deal' to avoid trade clash,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""This was a very big day for free and fair trade"" The US and EU have agreed to avoid an all-out trade war and work to lower tariffs, in talks that US President Donald Trump hailed as ""a very strong understanding"". He and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker announced a ""new phase"" in EU-US relations, after Wednesday's meeting at the White House. Mr Trump's threat to impose tariffs on European cars was put aside. The EU plans to buy more US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and soybeans. A joint statement said the two leaders agreed,externalto ""work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods"". US import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, imposed in March, will however remain in place. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A working group of senior advisers will meet to facilitate trade and lower barriers. The two sides pledged to refrain from new trade restrictions during those negotiations. A full-blown trade war had been looming, fuelled by the tariffs introduced by Mr Trump. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Trade tariffs: Real war or phoney war US carmakers hit by trade disputes EU-US relations had been further frayed by Mr Trump's tributes to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his attacks on Nato and the EU. Mr Trump's language after meeting Mr Juncker was enthusiastic, in contrast with the angry tone he adopted previously towards the EU, calling it a ""foe"" on trade. Mr Trump has come under pressure domestically because of retaliatory tariffs imposed on US goods by China, the EU, Canada and Mexico. US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc appeared to be the latest casualty of the trade row with China.It dropped a $44bn (Â£33.5bn) bidto take over NXP Semiconductors, after China failed to give approval for it. On Tuesday theTrump administration announced up to $12bn in aid for US farmershurt by the Chinese tariffs. Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump declared a ""new phase in the relationship"" between the US and the EU, calling it a ""very big day for free and fair trade"". Mr Juncker thanked the president and hailed a ""constructive meeting"". Mr Trump said the EU would become a ""massive buyer"" of US liquefied natural gas and the joint statement said EU imports of LNG would increase, to diversify Europe's energy supply. Mr Trump has condemned Germany's project to expand imports of Russian natural gas, via a new Baltic pipeline. ""The EU is going (...) to buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers, primarily in the Midwest,"" Mr Trump said. Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels EU officials have been giving more details of the deal brokered in Washington. The working group will investigate long-term ways to reduce tariffs on industrial goods - not cars or agricultural products - and how to bring down the extra tariffs on steel and aluminium recently applied by US authorities. It will report at the end of November - after the midterm elections in the US. The pledge to buy more American soybeans is actually a promise not to interfere in market forces that mean the EU is buying more anyway. ""We are not turning into a Soviet-style economy,"" said an official. And this is not a revival of the controversial TTIP trade pact between the EU and US or a big free trade agreement. That would take much longer and would require the consent of the EU member states. This video can not be played Many American farmers say they support US President Trump's approach to trade The pair also agreed to work towards reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Mr Trump accuses the WTO of treating the US unfairly - though mostly the US has won in arbitration cases there. Mr Juncker said striking a deal on zero tariffs on industrial goods was his ""main intention"". ""I had one intention today, to make a deal, and we made a deal. We have a number of areas on which to work together,"" he said. No announcement was made on car tariffs, and it was not clear whether any progress had been made on resolving the issue. Mr Trump had threatened to impose 25% import tariffs on European cars. On Twitter, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the two were ""turning a page"" on trade, while German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hailed it as a ""breakthrough"". Allow Twitter content?

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted (in German),external: ""Juncker showed in Washington that it's really not about who tweets most aggressively, but about whether one offers real solutions. Because Trump's grassroots also feels that it only loses when we impose more and more senseless tariffs on each other."" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the agreement, but called for ""clarifications"". He said there was no point trying to clinch any major trade deal with the US. Agriculture must be excluded, he said, because Europe could not compromise on food safety and environmental standards. Mr Trump scorned the proposed EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which stalled two years ago. But his ""deal"" with Mr Juncker echoes some of TTIP's ambition.

Curiosity sees Mars methane swing,"The Curiosity rover carries an onboard lab to measure the chemistry of the atmosphere It may only be a very small part of  Mars' atmosphere but methane waxes and wanes with the seasons, scientists say. The discovery made by theCuriosity rover,externalis important because it helps narrow the likely sources of the gas. On Earth, those sources largely involve biological emissions - from wetlands, paddy fields, livestock and the like. No-one can yet tie a life signature to Mars' methane, but the nature of its seasonal behaviour probably rules out some geological explanations for it. ""For the first time in the history of Mars methane measurements, we have something that's repeatable,"" said Dr Chris Webster, a US space agency (Nasa) scientist working on Curiosity. ""It's like trying to find a fault on your car. If it's intermittent you can never solve it, but if you've got some repeatability you've got some chance of understanding it,"" he told BBC News. Mars probe despatched on methane quest Methane 'belches' detected on Mars Mars probe returns first pictures Methane in Mars' atmosphere is a fascinating topic. The gas is short-lived so the fact that it persists in the planet's air points to a constant, on-going source - and given CHâ's link to biology on Earth, scientists need to get to the bottom of this martian mystery. Ever since it landed in the Red Planet's equatorial Gale Crater in 2012, Curiosity has been sniffing the air for methane. The roving robotic laboratory has seen wafts where the concentration has risen upwards of seven parts per billion (ppb) (by comparison, on Earth it is about 1,860ppb). But over the past few years, the one-tonne vehicle has also been tracking the general background trend. It is this behaviour thatDr Webster and colleagues report in Science Magazine,externalthis week. On Earth, subsurface methane can be stored in a ""flammable ice"". On Mars? They show methane rises from just above 0.2ppb in the northern hemisphere winter to a fraction over 0.6ppb in the summer. The team's best explanation is that methane is seeping up from underground, perhaps from stored ices, and is then being released when surface soils are warmed. The team cannot positively identify the origin of the methane, but the researchers think they can close down one particular mechanism for its production. This involves sunlight breaking up carbon-rich (organic) molecules that have fallen to the planet's surface in meteorites. The variation in ultraviolet light over the course of the seasons is not big enough to drive the scale of the change seen in the methane concentration, says Dr Webster. ""We know the intensity of the Sun and this mechanism should produce only a 20% increase in methane during the summer, but we're seeing it increase by a factor of three,"" he explained. Artwork: Esa has a new satellite in orbit designed to map methane across the planet All this leaves open the question of what type of sub-surface reservoir is feeding the release - whether it derives from some other geochemical process or is the product of microbial activity; whether it is newly minted methane or some ancient store. ""We can't distinguish; but importantly we still can't rule out a biological contribution,"" Dr Webster told BBC News. The European Space Agency (Esa) has a new satellite at Mars known as theTrace Gas Orbiter,external. This started a global search for methane in the atmosphere during the past fortnight. It is possible the probe might be able to detect places on the planet where the gas is being emitted in larger quantities. If such a location can be identified, some future mission could then visit it with the sensitive analytical tools needed to determine whether the CHâ is the kind normally associated with life. On Earth, biology has a preference to incorporate the lighter form of carbon atom when making the molecule. A second paper published in the same edition of Science Magazine,externaldescribes some of the new types of organic molecules that Curiosity has found inside Gale Crater's rocks. Once again, like methane, organics are not a direct indicator of life - but life cannot exist without such molecules, DNA and proteins being good examples. The story of organics on Mars is therefore of enormous interest if the presence of life is to be confirmed, if only in the long-distant past. The Curiosity team has previously reported pretty simple carbon-rich compounds - what are termed chlorinated hydrocarbons because of their inclusion of chlorine atoms in their carbon-hydrogen structures. The new molecules, drilled from three-billion-year-old mudstones that were laid down in a lake environment, are more diverse and more complex. They include thiophenes, which are a class that have sulphur atoms bonded into their structures; and that is important because the sulphur aids preservation. If, as the team believes, the molecules Curiosity is seeing are mere fragments of much larger forms, this bodes well for those future missions that can drill deeper into the planet's surface. An Esa rover aims to do just this in 2021. ""ExoMars is going to go deep - 2m deep,"" explained the Science paper's lead author, Dr Jennifer Eigenbrode. ""That gives it the possibility of encountering rocks that have not been exposed to any significant (degradation from) ionising radiation at the surface. ""ExoMars has a chance of discovering extant life. But, even if it doesn't, just understanding the change of organic matter from the surface to what's at depth is going to be hugely revealing. ""I've no doubt that humans when they get to Mars are going to want to try farming. And if they do, they're going to need a source of organic matter,"" she told BBC News.

Radar instruments like Marsis examine the surface and immediate subsurface of the planet by sending out a signal and examining what is bounced back. The continuous white line at the top of the radar results above marks the beginning of the South Polar Layered Deposit; a filo pastry-like accumulation of water ice and dust. Beneath this, researchers spotted something unusual 1.5km under the ice. ""In light blue you can see where the reflections from the bottom are stronger than surface reflection. This is something that is to us the tell tale sign of the presence of water,"" says Prof Orosei. Artists' impression: Marsis data shows an area of high reflectivity (dark blue) which is thought to be water Nothing definitive. Yet. Dr Manish Patel from the Open University explained: ""We have long since known that the surface of Mars is inhospitable to life as we know it, so the search for life on Mars is now in the subsurface. ""This is where we get sufficient protection from harmful radiation, and the pressure and temperature rise to more favourable levels. Most importantly, this allows liquid water, essential for life."" This principle of following the water is key to astrobiology - the study of potential life beyond Earth. So while the findings suggest water is present, they don't confirm anything further. ""We are not closer to actually detecting life,"" Dr Patel told BBC News, ""but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars. It is like a treasure map - except in this case, there will be lots of 'X's marking the spots."" Astrobiologists study extreme environments like salt lakes on Earth to understand how life might survive on Mars The water's temperature and chemistry could also pose a problem for any potential martian organisms. In order to remain liquid in such cold conditions (the research team estimate between -10 and -30 Celsius where it meets the ice above), the water likely has a great many salts dissolved in it. ""It's plausible that the water may be an extremely cold, concentrated brine, which would be pretty challenging for life,"" explained Dr Claire Cousins, an astrobiologist from the University of St Andrews, UK. While its existence provides a tantalising prospect for those interested in the possibility of past or present life on Mars, the lake's characteristics must first be verified by further research. ""What needs to be done now,"" explained Dr Matt Balme from the Open University, ""is for the measurements to be repeated elsewhere to look for similar signals, and, if possible, for all other explanation to be examined and - hopefully - ruled out. ""Maybe this could even be the trigger for an ambitious new Mars mission to drill into this buried water-pocket - like has been done for sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica on Earth,"" he added. The area has been compared to Lake Vostok, which lies 4km beneath the Antarctic ice Scientists havepreviously claimed to find bacterial lifein the buried depths of Antarctica's Lake Vostok, but drilling on Mars would make for an ambitious project indeed. ""Getting there and acquiring the final evidence that this is indeed a lake will not be an easy task,"" said Prof Orosei. ""It will require flying a robot there which is capable of drilling through 1.5km of ice. This will certainly require some technological developments that at the moment are not available.""

Facebook shares dive as growth disappointsThe social media firm's shares were hit by news that growth in monthly active users is slowing.Business,"Facebook shares tumbled by more than 20% on Wednesday after the social media network's revenue and user growth fell short of investor expectations. The firm, which is facing backlash for its handling of fake news and privacy, said it had 2.23 billion monthly active users at the end of June. This was up 11% on June 2017, the slowest growth in more than two years. It also warned investors that spending growth would outstrip revenue gains in 2019, pinching profits. Facebook said it expected revenue gains to slow, as people make use of new options to limit advertising and less profitable overseas markets drive growth. The firm also plans to spend billions to improve the way it monitors content, tracks advertisers and treats user data - areas where it has faced regulator scrutiny. The firm, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, is also investing in new features, such as virtual reality and video. Facebook will not remove fake news - but will 'demote' it Instagram pins hopes on IGTV's vertical video Shares in Facebook initially fell about 12% in after-hours trade in New York, but losses accelerated as the firm outlined its spending plans. Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights, said the firm's forecast was ""nightmareish"". ""They gave a very disappointing outlook for the second half of the year and 2019 and that's going to significantly weigh on the stock in the near term,"" he said. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has appeared before regulators this year Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco This is hardly Armageddon for Mark Zuckerberg. On the whole, people are apparently not deserting Facebook. Monthly active users - ie those who interact at least once a month - were steady in the US, down ever-so-slightly in Europe, and up everywhere else. But for a company used to growing those numbers handsomely throughout the year, a lack of meaningful growth will cause concern, if not panic. Sadly the company doesn't break down its Europe numbers into anything more granular - which means we can't see the effect the Cambridge Analytica scandal had on British users. Analysts tell me they consider Cambridge Analytica a ""blip"" in Facebook's history, though another quarter like this one would be even more impactful than what we saw during Wednesday's after hours trading. During its earnings call, Facebook warned investors to brace themselves: it doesn't expect revenue growth to improve for at least the rest of this year. Facebook profits in the quarter were $5.1bn, up 31% from the same period in 2017. Revenue was $13.2bn, up 42% year-on-year, but expenses grew even faster, rising 50% to about $7.4bn. User growth has flattened in the US and Canada, key markets for the company due to the high prices ads there command. The number of EU users fell amid the rollout of tighter privacy regulations, though Facebook continued to attract new users in countries like Indonesia. Mr Ives said the popularity of Instagram should help Facebook to blunt fallout from challenges at its namesake network. In February, the research firm eMarketer estimated that the number of Facebook users under the age of 25 would fall by about 2 million this year. But it forecast that Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, would add about 1.6 million users in that age range in 2018.

MP accused of lying about speeding,"Fiona Onasanya was elected as the MP for Peterborough in 2017 A Labour MP has been charged with perverting the course of justice over allegedly lying about who was behind the wheel of a speeding vehicle. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 12 July charged with the offence. The 34-year-old faces two counts of perverting the course of justice. Her brother Festus Onasanya, 33, faces three counts of the same offence. They are both due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 August. Mr Onasanya, of Cambridge, is jointly charged with his sister on the two counts she faces relating to incidents on 24 July 2017 and 23 August 2017. The charges allege they intended to pervert the course of justice by driving a vehicle in excess of the speed limit, falsely informing the investigating authorities that a third party had been the driver and enabling them, as a consequence, to avoid such prosecution and punishment. During the July incident, Ms Onasanya is alleged to have been driving - and during the August incident, her brother is alleged to have been driving. The single count that Mr Onasanya faces relates to an incident on 17 June 2017. The BBC has contacted the office of Ms Onasanya, who won her seat in 2017. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing case."" Ms Onasanya, who was a solicitor before being elected to Parliament, is a Labour whip, meaning she is responsible for party discipline. She won the Peterborough seat with a majority of just 607 votes, ousting Tory Stewart Jackson. Mr Jackson then took up a role as David Davis's chief of staff until the then Brexit secretary quit earlier this month.

Bomb attacks strike voters in Pakistan,"The attack in Quetta has been claimed by the Islamic State group Pakistan has been hit by violence on the day of its general elections - with at least 31 dead in the worst attack. A man blew himself up outside a polling station in Quetta, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. Preliminary, unofficial results suggest ex-cricket star Imran Khan's PTI party is in the lead as votes are counted. However, the rival party of disgraced former PM Nawaz Sharif, PML-N, has rejected the results amid allegations of vote rigging. The campaign has been overshadowed by concerns of fraud and violence, and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says there have been ""blatant"" attempts to manipulate the polls. There have also been delays in releasing the results. Baber Yaqoob, the secretary of the Electoral Commission, said this was due to technical errors, adding: ""There's no conspiracy."" ""The delay is being caused because the result transmission system has collapsed,"" Mr Yaqoob said. According to unofficial initial results, the PTI party is currently leading in 109 national assembly seats, while PML-N is ahead in about 67 seats, local media report. However, only votes from 34% of polling stations have so far been counted, Dawn newspaper says. The turnout has been estimated at between 50% and 55% out of 106 million registered voters, AFP reports. Why Pakistan's election matters Fears of 'creeping coup' in Pakistan Who are the 'angels' and the 'electables'? Several political groups have alleged that vote rigging is taking place in polling stations - something denied by election officials. Representatives from several parties say that their polling agents were expelled from polling stations during vote count and were denied certified copies of results - breaching election procedures. Analysts have also highlighted unusual delays in the announcement of unofficial results in dozens of constituencies, especially in the crucial province of Punjab which has been a stronghold of PML-N. Shehbaz Sharif, leader of the PML-N party and brother of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif, said the vote counting process was ""unbearable and unacceptable"" due to ""manifest and massive irregularities"". ""It's such a blatant rigging that everyone has started crying. Today what they have done has pushed Pakistan back 30 years,"" he said. Mr Khan has vowed to tackle corruption but his rivals accuse him of benefiting from alleged meddling by the military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half of its history. Mr Sharif, who won the last election, has been jailed for corruption after ascandal stemming from the Panama Papers leak. Despite tight security, with hundreds of thousands of troops and police officers deployed across the country, there have been violent attacks. In addition to the suicide attack in Quetta, in Balochistan province, one person died in a grenade attack in Khuzdar, and another died in a shooting between political rivals in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The Dawn newspaper also reported clashes,externalin Mardan, Rajanpur, Khipro and Kohistan. Viewpoint: Pakistan's dirtiest election in years An IS-claimed attack targeting a political rally earlier this month in nearby Mastung killed at least 149 people. A woman casts her vote at a polling station in Islamabad Pakistan has been ruled on and off by the military during its 71-year history. This election is significant because it will mark only the second time that one civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term. But the run-up to the vote has been controversial. Mr Sharif's PML-N complains of a targeted crackdown by the security establishment, with the alleged help of the courts, in favour of Imran Khan and his PTI party. On Sunday, a judge in the High Court of Islamabad appeared to support that allegation, saying that the military Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) organisation had been interfering in the judiciary. In a BBC interview on Monday, Mr Sharif's daughter Maryam Nawaz - who was jailed earlier this month with her father on corruption-related charges - criticised the military. ""When a prime minister refuses to put down his head and do their [the military's] bidding, they pull him down with four things; get a religious fatwa issued against him, call him a traitor, call him a friend of India, or call him corrupt. They use these things against every elected prime minister,"" she said. Several PML-N candidates also say they have been coerced to switch to the PTI. The Pakistani military denies interfering in politics. Imran Khan scents victory in Pakistan vote Independent media, meanwhile, say there have been blatant attempts to muzzle them. There are also concerns about the participation of militants on international terror blacklists in the election process. For all these reasons,the human rights commission has said there are ""ample grounds"" to question the legitimacy of the polls,external, ""with alarming implications for Pakistan's transition to an effective democracy"". By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Imran Khan is seen as the favourite of the military As voters queued up outside polling stations, the question on everyone's mind was whether Mr Khan will be the next prime minister. He entered politics in the late 1990s when memories of Pakistan's cricketers winning the World Cup were still fresh. But only in 2013 did his party emerge as a serious contender, with its leader touted as a harbinger of change, out to fight corruption. He lost by a wide margin, but has continued to lead what many see as a divisive campaign. In the constituency being contested by Mr Khan, a voter called Rauf told me he was voting for ""anyone who uplifts the country"". I asked who could do that, and he replied: ""It's easy to guess. See what those who have been in power have done to the country. They've destroyed it."" Mr Khan has staked his campaign on shaking up the political order and taking on Pakistan's entrenched political dynasties. This election is the closest he's ever got to being prime minister. Will that happen? Or will the PML-N stay the largest party after a sympathy wave by voters for the man he helped oust? The election is generally seen as a contest between the PML-N and the PTI. Nawaz Sharif - a 68-year-old three-time PM - made a dramatic return to Pakistan ahead of the vote to face a 10-year prison sentence. He was disqualified from office last year by the Supreme Court after the Panama Papers leak revealed his family's ownership of several luxury flats in London. His appeal hearing will not be held until after the vote. As he cast his vote in the Islamabad suburb of Bani Gala, Mr Khan, 65, told reporters it was ""time to defeat parties which kept this country hostage for years"". The cricket hero who could be Pakistan's next PM Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's three-time PM Bilawal Bhutto Zardari: Heir to a political dynasty The country's best-known opposition politician has denied colluding with the military. Analysts say he will have to make serious inroads in Punjab province - a PML-N stronghold - in order to win the vote. The party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,the historically liberal PPP, is widely expected to come third. It is now fronted by Ms Bhutto's son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a 29-year-old Oxford University graduate.

More than 200 dead in Syria attacks,"Images of the aftermath of the attacks were broadcast by state media At least 215 people have died in a series of apparently co-ordinated attacks in south-western Syria, local officials and a monitoring group say. Several suicide bombings struck in and around the government-held city of Suweida - the main city in the province - on Wednesday. The Islamic State group (IS) said it carried out the attacks. Pro-government forces were later reported to be engaged in gun battles with IS militants east of the city. The Syrian government, backed by Russia, recently launched a campaign to retake the remaining rebel-held areas across the south of the country. Wednesday's wave of attacks was the deadliest on government-held territory in months, correspondents say. The unstoppable momentum of Assadâs war Why is there a war in Syria? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported a string of suicide blasts in Suweida, south of the capital Damascus, and in villages to the north and east. It said militants also stormed homes in the villages and killed the occupants. It said at least 221 people had been killed, 127 of them civilians. ""It's the bloodiest death toll in Suweida province since the start of the war [in 2011],"" observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP news agency. The Suweida health authority told pro-government radio station Sham FM that 215 people had been killed and 180 injured. This video can not be played IS has lost lots of territory but has not been defeated State news agency Sana earlier reported one suicide attack at a market in Suweida and said security forces had killed two other attackers before they could blow themselves up. Militants also attacked three villages north-east of the city, it said. State TV also said government forces were ""targeting positions of the Daesh [IS] terrorist group"" in countryside to the east of Suweida. Suweida governor Amer al-Eshi told state-run Ikhbariyah TV that the city was now ""secure and calm"". Over the past year, IS has lost most of the land it once held across Syria and neighbouring Iraq. The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts At the peak of its power, around 10 million people lived in IS-controlled areas, but the US military said earlier this year that the jihadist group had been ousted from 98% of its former territory. In Syria, the group is still present in small pockets in the southern provinces of Suweida and Deraa, as well as parts of the country's east. The Syrian military, backed by Russian forces, recently launched an operation to drive rebels from their remaining strongholds in the south-west. On Wednesday, Russia-backed government forces were also reported to be bombarding pockets of IS-held territory in Deraa, west of Suweida. At least 270,000 people have fled their homes in the region as fighting continues, the UN says. On Sunday,Israel allowed the evacuation of hundreds of White Helmets civil defence workerswho were trapped in a war zone in southern Syria. The Syrian government condemned the move, describing it as a ""criminal operation"" by Israel and others. Why has the Syrian war lasted 12 years? Assadâs momentum No, IS has not been defeated.

Doctor would face 'truth drug rape case',"Dr Kenneth Milner ran the hospital for nearly 40 years A doctor would have been interviewed for rape and child cruelty over claims a ""truth drug"" was used to carry out abuse at a hospital, had he been alive. Dr Kenneth Milner ran Aston Hall psychiatric hospital in Derbyshire from 1947 to the 1970s, which former patients described as ""pure hell"". A report by police found 65 children were allegedly drugged to a zombie-like state, stripped and abused. Police said there would have been ""sufficient evidence"" to pursue a case. The vast majority of the allegations were made against Dr Milner, who died in 1975, and police said no inference should be drawn from the report other than the doctor would be questioned if he were here today. Other staff members accused of physical abuse have either been eliminated from the inquiry, have died or were unable to be identified. This video can not be played Aston Hall victims talk of 'truth drug' doctor abuse The Derbyshire force, under the direction of the area's safeguarding children's board, started an investigation in February 2016 after concerns were raised about the hospital which closed in the 1990s. Allegations first came to light in 2011 then 2014 and 2015. No allegations of sexual abuse were identified in 2011 by police. Then in July 2014 an individual made an allegation of rape followed by another person alleging abuse at the hospital in September of that year. A deserted Aston Hall hospital pictured in 2008, posted on the Project Mayhem website In July 2015 another person came forward and said she was injected, gassed and woke up feeling sore between her legs while at the hospital. Some children, who were sent to the hospital between the 1950s and 1970s, also claimed they were put in straitjackets. Home sent girls to drug scandal hospital What went on at the hospital that 'experimented' on child patients? Girl 'experimented on' at hospital As well as the sexual abuse, the report found claims of patients being hit while trying to resist treatment, one having her head repeatedly forced under water, and another having her hair repeatedly pulled to force her to take medication. Aston Hall was opened in the 1920s for those deemed to have mental health problems. It could cater for about 100 children of both sexes, but took adults as well. Allegations centred on the use of sodium amytal as part of ""narcoanalysis,external"" - the uncovering of repressed traumatic memories. Sodium amytal, a so-called truth serum, was originally used on traumatised soldiers But stories emerged, in part via social media, of children being isolated, stripped and abused sexually, physically and mentally. Other stories from East Midlands Police collated 115 witness statements, recorded 77 crimes - including 33 instances of physical abuse and 40 sexual - and heard from 65 alleged victims. Stephen Edwards, from law firm Bond Turner, which is representing 47 patients sent to the hospital in the 1960s and 1970s, said the ""horrific treatment"" had ""undoubtedly caused permanent, damaging effects"". ""Every doctor should have to demonstrate their accountability in treating patients, especially those as vulnerable as children,"" he said. This video can not be played 'I was injected with drugs and abused at a mental health hospital as a teenager in the 1960s' After trying to take his own life Jason Stubbings, from Cornwall, was sent to Aston Hall in the 1960s, aged 14, where he said he was injected with drugs and abused. He said he remembers being injected with what he now knows is sodium amytal, also known as the truth drug, as well as another drug which is still unknown to him. Mr Stubbings said he was then taken back to a memory where his brother was beating him with a garden cane and it felt like he was being hit at the time. When he woke up, he found his hands had been tied and he had marks on his body. Mr Stubbings also remembers looking out the window once and seeing ""a guy in the exercise yard in a straightjacket screaming"" and thinking he did not know if he was ever going to get out of there. ""It said on the administration form 'a slight timid boy', and they did that to me,"" he added. No evidence of a conspiracy to supply children for abuse was found at Aston Hall The report said there were consistent allegations of drugs being given to restrained children, with limited or no records being taken. Current medical opinion was these methods were not acceptable, even by the standards of the day, it added. But officers said the length of time since the alleged crimes had proven a major issue - to the extent they had been unable to find out whether some members of staff were still alive. The report said: ""Having regard to these difficulties and the scale of the alleged physical and sexual abuse that has emerged in the evidence; we do not consider that it would be either practicable or appropriate for us to attempt to reach firm conclusions on each specific allegation. Many stories about abuse at Aston Hall came out through social media ""There would have been sufficient evidence to justify interviewing Dr Milner under caution in relation to a number of potential offences."" The report said the offences would have namely been ""rape, indecent assault contrary to the Sexual Offences Act 1956, Child Cruelty and Assault contrary to Children and Young Persons Act 1933 and Offences Against the Person act 1861 respectively"". While it noted children were sent to Aston Hall from a variety of homes, the report found no evidence of a conspiracy to supply children for abuse. Barbara O'Hare, who claims she was abused by Dr Milner in the 1970s, told the BBC the report was positive. ""It gives recognition to what happened to me and others at the hospital and I'm very grateful to the police,"" she said. Derbyshire Safeguarding Children board said the treatment of children had radically changed and if a similar situation occurred today, there were clear routes for them to raise concerns. At least 30 former patients who have submitted a claim for compensation to the Department for Health through a solicitor. Other claims are also believed to have been submitted. A spokesman for the department has said the matter was under investigation. An NSPCC spokesman said the report was ""truly harrowing reading and shines a light on the decades of sickening abuse"".

Facebook tumbles as growth disappoints,"Facebook shares tumbled by more than 20% on Wednesday after the social media network's revenue and user growth fell short of investor expectations. The firm, which is facing backlash for its handling of fake news and privacy, said it had 2.23 billion monthly active users at the end of June. This was up 11% on June 2017, the slowest growth in more than two years. It also warned investors that spending growth would outstrip revenue gains in 2019, pinching profits. Facebook said it expected revenue gains to slow, as people make use of new options to limit advertising and less profitable overseas markets drive growth. The firm also plans to spend billions to improve the way it monitors content, tracks advertisers and treats user data - areas where it has faced regulator scrutiny. The firm, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, is also investing in new features, such as virtual reality and video. Facebook will not remove fake news - but will 'demote' it Instagram pins hopes on IGTV's vertical video Shares in Facebook initially fell about 12% in after-hours trade in New York, but losses accelerated as the firm outlined its spending plans. Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights, said the firm's forecast was ""nightmareish"". ""They gave a very disappointing outlook for the second half of the year and 2019 and that's going to significantly weigh on the stock in the near term,"" he said. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has appeared before regulators this year Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco This is hardly Armageddon for Mark Zuckerberg. On the whole, people are apparently not deserting Facebook. Monthly active users - ie those who interact at least once a month - were steady in the US, down ever-so-slightly in Europe, and up everywhere else. But for a company used to growing those numbers handsomely throughout the year, a lack of meaningful growth will cause concern, if not panic. Sadly the company doesn't break down its Europe numbers into anything more granular - which means we can't see the effect the Cambridge Analytica scandal had on British users. Analysts tell me they consider Cambridge Analytica a ""blip"" in Facebook's history, though another quarter like this one would be even more impactful than what we saw during Wednesday's after hours trading. During its earnings call, Facebook warned investors to brace themselves: it doesn't expect revenue growth to improve for at least the rest of this year. Facebook profits in the quarter were $5.1bn, up 31% from the same period in 2017. Revenue was $13.2bn, up 42% year-on-year, but expenses grew even faster, rising 50% to about $7.4bn. User growth has flattened in the US and Canada, key markets for the company due to the high prices ads there command. The number of EU users fell amid the rollout of tighter privacy regulations, though Facebook continued to attract new users in countries like Indonesia. Mr Ives said the popularity of Instagram should help Facebook to blunt fallout from challenges at its namesake network. In February, the research firm eMarketer estimated that the number of Facebook users under the age of 25 would fall by about 2 million this year. But it forecast that Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, would add about 1.6 million users in that age range in 2018.

Harrods big spender fights to keep mansion,"Mrs A has spent tens of thousands of pounds a week in Harrods on luxury goods The fugitive wife of a ""fat cat banker"" who's spent Â£16m in Harrods is battling to keep her London mansion after the UK's first use of a new power to combat international corruption. The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is challenging a demand by the National Crime Agency that she reveal the source of her wealth or face losing her British properties. The hearing at the High Court is the first time the agency has used an ""Unexplained Wealth Order"" to force a suspected corrupt foreign official and his family to account for their riches. The NCA wants the couple to explain how two properties worth Â£22m were bought, amid suspicions the cash was stolen by the woman's husband while he was working for a state bank in their home country. If the woman fails to overturn the court order, or fails to prove she is legitimately wealthy, the NCA can ask the courts to seize the homes. Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs)came into force earlier this yearto help investigators identify and seize British property suspected to have been bought by cash laundered by corrupt foreign politicians and officials. The power was introduced because it's difficult for agencies to prove how these suspects obtained their wealth overseas - and that makes criminal prosecutions almost impossible. During the first challenge to an UWO, the High Court revealed that ""Mrs A"" is the wife of a state banker from a ""non-EEA country"", that also cannot be named for legal reasons. The couple have an estimated wealth of more than Â£55m ($72.5m), and 10 years ago, Mr A applied to settle in the UK under the visa scheme for wealthy investors. The first London property was bought the following year - but Mr A was subsequently jailed overseas after being convicted of a major fraud. Mrs A is also wanted for trial - but has been living what the court heard was an ""extravagant"" lifestyle in the UK, spending the vast sums her husband allegedly embezzled. Jonathan Hall QC, for the NCA, told the court that Mrs A had spent Â£16m in Harrods over 10 years. Mr and Mrs A cannot be identified for legal reasons Each week, she'd spent tens of thousands of pounds on luxury goods. Her child has their own share fund worth Â£15m. Mrs A has claimed in court papers that her wealth comes from her husband's successful overseas enterprises. But the court heard this claim is not supported in confidential papers or online profiles of the banker. Mr Hall said: ""It's an astonishing omission that if he were a titan of business, that there is no reference [on websites] to his successful business."" James Lewis QC, appearing for Mrs A, said the NCA's demand that she account for her wealth was unjustified and the agency had misrepresented her husband's career. Far from being a modestly-paid banker, Mr Lewis said that Mr A had been a stereotypical ""fat cat international banker"", similar to many others in the private sector. He'd been the victim of an unfair trial and a major miscarriage of justice, the lawyer said. ""The reality is [the NCA] have to wait years for him to come out of prison. They cannot [seek to seize the homes] when he is unable to participate. She can't call the witness she needs."" If the UWO against Mrs A stands, it's likely to pave the way for more orders against suspects, including Russian oligarchs and corrupt former politicians from Africa, with property in Britain.

French gangster on the run evades police,"FaÃ¯d abandoned a car with explosives in an underground car park north of Paris A French armed robber narrowly avoided capture more than three weeks after escaping from prison, police say. Convicted gangster RÃ©doine FaÃ¯d was spotted by patrol officers near Paris on Tuesday afternoon, police sources told AFP news agency. He fled the scene and abandoned a car with explosives and fake number plates in a shopping centre car park. On 1 JulyFaÃ¯d, 46, broke out of a prisonwith the help of armed accomplices who hijacked a helicopter. The Jailbird King, as he is dubbed by French media, was serving a 25-year sentence for a failed 2010 robbery during which a police officer was killed. This was FaÃ¯d's second jailbreak - in 2013,he escaped prison for six weeksafter seizing four guards as human shields and blowing off several doors with dynamite. Police have warned that ""beyond his charisma and aura, beyond the folklore, [FaÃ¯d] is a dangerous individual"". Gangster's 'loyal friends' behind jailbreak A history of dramatic prison escapes Around 16:40 local time (14:40 GMT) on Tuesday, police officers identified FaÃ¯d as one of two people in a car ""observing a service station"", AFP says. The officers ""wanted to carry out a check on the people in the car"", when ""they fled the scene and drove towards Sarcelles"", a northern suburb of Paris. Redoine Faid was placed on Interpol's most-wanted list after his 2013 escape When police found the abandoned Renault Laguna with plastic explosives in an underground car park, authorities sealed off the shopping centre and bomb disposal experts were called in. ""We do not yet know where the explosives were being taken,"" a senior prosecutor told AFP. This is the first sighting of the escaped convict since 1 July, despite some 2,900 police officers joining a national manhunt. A well-known criminal in France, FaÃ¯d was born in 1972 and grew up in a notoriously rough part of Paris. In the '90s, he ran a gang involved in armed robbery and extortion in the French capital. He has spoken of his love of Hollywood heist films, saying they inspire some of his schemes. He once told France's Point magazine he had watched the 1995 gangster film Heat seven times at the cinema and ""a hundred times on DVD"" to dissect the scene of an armoured car robbery. FaÃ¯d then approached its director Michael Mann at a Paris film festival and told him: ""You were my technical adviser"". French robber stages dramatic escape Gangster in helicopter prison break His fame has been helped by his 2009 book, outlining his younger days on the streets of Paris and his descent into the life of a professional criminal. He then claimed to have turned his back on crime, but police believe he was the mastermind behind the botched robbery he is now convicted of. One of FaÃ¯d's most recent prison supervisors said he was never in conflict with guards, but that ""we must always be wary"". ""In the corner of his mind, he never lost the idea of escaping. Behind all his manners - he is very polite - he always hid his game,"" his supervisor said.

No break for Kit Kat in trademark case,"Have a break for a quick lunch? NestlÃ© believes it owns the shape of four-finger bars Even if it looks like a Kit Kat, it might not be. The European Court of Justice has thrown out an appeal by the chocolate bar's maker, NestlÃ©, which argued that it owns the shape of the teatime treat. NestlÃ© has spent more than a decade fighting to trademark the four-fingered wafer shape - something that rival Cadbury had fought hard against. But Wednesday's judgement found that a previous court had been right to annul the decision by Europe's trademark group. That could bring an end to the snack's protected European status - and a saga that has proved expensive for both sides. It also takes the pressure off identical treats like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj - pronounced ""quick lunch"" and which has been around for 80 years - and opens the door to own-brand imitations at your local supermarket. British and US readers may not even have heard of Kvikk Lunsj. Norwegians, though, have national pride in the snack, and its long-running image as a meal on the go for healthy Scandinavian hikers. Its chocolate has a different flavour from the Kit Kat, similar to parent company Mondelez's Milka brand. Taste-testing fromthe Guardian newspaper last year concluded that Kvikk Lunsj was, in fact, the superior product,external. The Norwegian bar has been made since 1937, a mere two years after Kit Kat - originally called Rowntree's chocolate crisp - hit the market in 1935. For 65 years, the two crispy treats lived together in harmony - until NestlÃ© went on the offensive. In 2002, the global chocolate giant applied for a trademark in Europe for Kit Kat. There was no issue with the bar itself, embossed with the Kit Kat logo. But it also applied for the trademark for the shape of a Kit Kat - or ""four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base"" as a top EU legal adviser put it. A real Kit Kat has logos - but what about the shape on the left, from NestlÃ©'s application? After four years of back-and-forth, the EU trademark granted NestlÃ© the shape as a trademark. The makers of Kvikk Lunsj, Mondelez, also owns brands including Cadbury, Milka, Oreo, and Toblerone - and Cadbury took issue with NestlÃ©'s new trademark. Mondelez also makes the Leo bar - another four-fingered chocolate treat. In 2007, the court battle began in earnest, see-sawing from one side to the other during appeal after appeal. Can the KitKat shape be a trademark? The battle to stop people from copying shapes Wednesday's ruling threw out NestlÃ©'s appeal, telling the EU trademark office it has to ""reconsider"" its decision - essentially annulling Kit Kat's claim. The case was about whether the brand had become distinctive enough to deserve its trademark - that its shape alone was how people recognise the snack. In 2016, a lower EU court decided that NestlÃ© had to prove a Kit Kat was recognisable in every EU country - and no evidence had been provided for Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal. And none of the parties involved - Mondelez, NestlÃ©, or the European trademark office - were happy about that. Nothing in common on the wrapper - it's what's inside that counts NestlÃ© and the EU's trademark office appealed against the 2016 decision. If proof of distinctiveness had to be shown for every single member state, they argued, no company could ever reach that high standard. Mondelez, meanwhile, argued that it was wrong to conclude that Kit Kat had ""distinctive character"" anywhere - including countries like the UK, Germany and France. The European court threw out all those objections. The result is that the EU's top court has now declared that it's not enough to prove that a product has become iconic in ""a significant part"" of the EU - it has to be proven across all the markets of the bloc, not just some. NestlÃ© said that Wednesday's judgement was ""not the end of the case"" and that it believed the EU trademark office will side with the company anyway. ""We think the evidence proves that the familiar shape of our iconic four-finger Kit Kat is distinctive enough to be registered as an EU trademark,"" a spokesman said. John Coldham, partner at the UK law firm Gowling WLG, said that rather than cancelling the trademark the court decided it should never have been awarded at all on the basis of the evidence. That means the decision heads back to the EU trademark office. ""Assuming the EU Intellectual Property Office does not have evidence that the shape is distinctive across the EU, I would expect it to remove the mark from the register now,"" Mr Coldham said. ""It is open to NestlÃ© to apply again, and to put stronger evidence in, so this may well not be the end of the road,"" he added. ""No-one is saying it is impossible to get a trade mark for the Kit Kat shape - just that there needs to be evidence that the shape is distinctive of Kit Kat in every part of the EU."" So the Kit Kat is set to lose its EU trademark - for now. But there is still a fight to be fought. European status aside, chocolate is serious business for trademark lawyers on a country-by-country basis. NestlÃ© had been looking for Europe-wide protection for the Kit Kat shape. But the trademark still exists on national level in some countries, including France, Germany, Spain and Italy. When the UK considered it, however, a lengthy court case ended in a 16,000-word ruling that Kit Kat had ""no inherent distinctiveness"". Cadbury, meanwhile, lost its own trademark battle when it tried to register a shade of purple. And, back in 2006, a case involving gold chocolate bunnies asked similar questions to the Kit Kat saga. Lindt reportedly suggested its rival change their gold wrapper to bronze, and ban the red ribbon Swiss chocolatier Lindt applied for a trademark for its Easter bunnies with a red ribbon, which are iconic in many countries - but not all. In Germany, the Riegelein company also made gold-wrapped bunnies, and the case made it to both European and German courts - where Lindt eventually lost. And while Mondelez won the argument that you can't trademark the shape of a Kit Kat, it's sure you can trademark a Toblerone - which it owns. Toblerone to revert to original shape Toblerone's shape was registered in 1998 - but was only put to the test last year, when British retailer Poundland designed an off-brand version. Featuring two rows of triangular bumps rather than one, Poundland argued that its copycat wasn't a trademark infringement - especially since Toblerone had changed the shape of their UK product to reduce weight. That disagreement was settled out of court. Nestle foiled in KitKat trademark fight The battle to stop people from copying shapes Can the KitKat shape be a trademark?

MP on perverting course of justice charge,"Fiona Onasanya was elected as the MP for Peterborough in 2017 A Labour MP has been charged with perverting the course of justice over allegedly lying about who was behind the wheel of a speeding vehicle. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 12 July charged with the offence. The 34-year-old faces two counts of perverting the course of justice. Her brother Festus Onasanya, 33, faces three counts of the same offence. They are both due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 August. Mr Onasanya, of Cambridge, is jointly charged with his sister on the two counts she faces relating to incidents on 24 July 2017 and 23 August 2017. The charges allege they intended to pervert the course of justice by driving a vehicle in excess of the speed limit, falsely informing the investigating authorities that a third party had been the driver and enabling them, as a consequence, to avoid such prosecution and punishment. During the July incident, Ms Onasanya is alleged to have been driving - and during the August incident, her brother is alleged to have been driving. The single count that Mr Onasanya faces relates to an incident on 17 June 2017. The BBC has contacted the office of Ms Onasanya, who won her seat in 2017. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing case."" Ms Onasanya, who was a solicitor before being elected to Parliament, is a Labour whip, meaning she is responsible for party discipline. She won the Peterborough seat with a majority of just 607 votes, ousting Tory Stewart Jackson. Mr Jackson then took up a role as David Davis's chief of staff until the then Brexit secretary quit earlier this month.

Lawmaker quits after Baron Cohen ridicule,"Spencer (left) called the Baron Cohen show a ""ridiculously ugly episode"" A Georgia lawmaker ridiculed for dropping his trousers and using racial slurs on Sacha Baron Cohen's Who Is America? show has said he will resign. Republican state representative Jason Spencer had initially refused to quit after the show aired on Sunday. Baron Cohen's show dupes public figures with fake interviews. Mr Spencer is coaxed into an ""anti-terrorism training class"", using the n-word to ward off a kidnapper and baring his buttocks to scare off terrorists. ""If you want to win, you show some skin,"" Baron Cohen, disguised as an anti-terrorism expert, had urged him. Baron Cohen series airs on Channel 4 The office of the Speaker of Georgia's House of Representatives told the Washington Post,externalthat Mr Spencer had submitted his resignation, effective from 31 July. The lawmaker had faced mounting calls to quit, with the Speaker, David Ralston, among them. He told CNN Mr Spencer's actions and language were ""reprehensible"", adding: ""Georgia is better than this."" In the episode, Baron Cohen invents the ""Israeli anti-terrorism expert"" Col Erran Morad,external, and convinces Mr Spencer to: Bare his buttocks and chase Baron Cohen shouting ""USA!"" Mr Spencer is told terrorists do not want to be touched by other men's buttocks because they are afraid of homosexuality Shout the ""n-word"" loudly and repeatedly to attract attention and ward off a kidnapper. Baron Cohen then says: ""Are you crazy? The 'n-word' is noonie! Not this word. This word is disgusting"" Impersonate a Chinese tourist while placing a selfie-stick under the garment of a burqa-clad person to take a picture to ensure the person is not a terrorist (Mr Spencer backed legislation in 2016 to ban Muslim women from wearing burqas in public) Mr Spencer had initially refused to quit over what he called a ""ridiculously ugly episode"". The four-term representative was defeated in the Republican primary for his seat in May, but had intended to serve his remaining five months in office. He said in a statement Baron Cohen had taken ""advantage of my paralysing fear that my family would be attacked"". ""My fears were so heightened at that time, I was not thinking clearly nor could I appreciate what I was agreeing to when I participated in his 'class',"" he said. Mr Spencer apologised to ""my family, friends, and the people of my district"", adding: ""I deeply regret the language I used at (Baron Cohen's) request."" The Baron Cohen series airs on Showtime in the US and Channel 4 in the UK. Other duped ""guests"" include former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and former US vice-president Dick Cheney. Mrs Palin pre-empted the airing saying on Facebook: ""I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick 'humour' of the British 'comedian' Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime."" Mr Cheney apparently agrees to autograph a ""waterboard kit"". Years before US presidentDonald Trumpentered the world of politics, he was interviewed by Ali G, Baron Cohen's Staines rapper. The famous interview saw his character try to pitch a business idea involving an ""ice cream glove"" to the entrepreneur As part of a sketch for Channel 4's 11 O'Clock Show in 1998, Ali G got UK Conservative politicianRhodes Boysonto say that children should be ""caned"" at school, Baron Cohen was criticised for playing on Mr Boyson's weakness as the politician had previously appeared on Have I Got News For You, apparently without realising it was a satirical comedy show In an interview with former Conservative politicianNeil Hamiltonin 2000, Ali G offered Mr Hamilton some ""cannabis"", which he accepted and smoked, creating minor controversy in the British media In 2004, an episode of Da Ali G Show saw Borat interview Republican candidate for US Congress,James Broadwater. Borat's questions led Mr Broadwater to say Jews would go to hell if they did not follow Christianity In the 2009 film of the same name, his character Bruno interviewed Republican presidential candidateRon Pauland in the scene tried and failed to seduce the Texas congressman into making a sex tape with Bruno, a gay Austrian TV host Duped Palin calls Baron Cohen 'sick' Baron Cohen series for Channel 4 LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Tape reveals Trump discussing model payoff,"From left: Michael Cohen, Karen McDougal, Donald Trump A recording of a conversation in which President Donald Trump and his lawyer discuss a payoff over an alleged affair with a model has been broadcast by CNN. Mr Trump and Michael Cohen discuss buying the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story. The audiotape was recorded in September 2016, two months before the election. The affair allegedly dates to 2006. Mr Trump's current lawyer Rudy Giuliani says no money was paid, and the tape does not show evidence of any crime. Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' The tape obtained by CNN,externalwas one of a number reportedly discovered during an FBI raid on Mr Cohen's property earlier this year in New York. Mr Giuliani said Mr Cohen had recorded the McDougal conversation at Trump Tower in New York using a hidden device. Mr Trump has criticised Mr Cohen on Twitter, saying: ""What kind of a lawyer would tape a client?"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The conversation jumps around, there are other voices and some of the audio is muffled. Mr Trump and Mr Cohen, who no longer works for the president, appear to be discussing buying the rights to Ms McDougal's story from the parent company of the National Enquirer. The former Playboy model had sold her story to the Enquirer in the run-up to the election. Mr Cohen says: ""I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David."" Who is Michael Cohen? This could be a reference to Mr Trump's friend, David Pecker, president of American Media Inc, the National Enquirer's parent company. Mr Trump says later: ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?"" Ms McDougal reportedly received $150,000 (Â£115,000) from the Enquirer for her story. Mr Cohen once famously vowed he would take a bullet for the president Mr Cohen starts to mention financing and Mr Trump asks: ""What financing?"" Mr Cohen says: ""We'll have to pay"". The next section is pivotal. Mr Trump is heard saying ""pay with cash"" but it is not clear if he is suggesting to do so or not do so. Mr Cohen's response is clear: ""No, no, no"". Mr Trump is then heard saying ""cheque"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews, Washington In April, Donald Trump tweeted that Michael Cohen is a ""fine person"" who he has ""always liked and respected"", adding that he didn't see him ever turning on his former boss. The president might be having second thoughts now that Mr Cohen has made public his recording of a controversial conversation first leaked to the press last week. ""We were not going to let Michael become a punching bag,"" Lanny Davis, Mr Cohen's new lawyer, said in explaining the move. Instead, Mr Cohen is throwing the punches, raising suspicions that this may be the first blow in an escalating fight with the president. There are, Mr Davis says, ""a lot of other tapes"". And given Mr Cohen's business and legal work for Mr Trump over the course of a decade, there's no telling what surprises might be in store. Mr Cohen telegraphed this latest turn of events by selecting Mr Davis as his attorney. The long-time Washington operative is a former Democratic congressional candidate, member of the Democratic National Committee and lawyer for President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial. Mr Davis is the kind of man you want if you're preparing for warâ¦ against Republicans. The Department of Justice is looking into alleged hush money paid to women who claim they had a relationship with Mr Trump. It is a potential problem for Mr Trump because undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. At the very least, the tape suggests Mr Trump was aware that discussions were taking place to buy the rights to Ms McDougal's story. When previously questioned about Ms McDougal, President Trump had denied the affair and said he had no knowledge of any payment. Mr Giuliani told Associated Press news agency that he had had the tape enhanced and it clearly shows the president saying ""don't pay with cash"". He told AP: ""The president wanted to do it the right way. If you wanted to hide something, you would not do it by corporation or cheque."" Mr Giuliani said no payment was made in the end although he did not know why that was the case. A former Playboy model who says she had a 10-month relationship with Mr Trump starting in 2006. He was already then married to Melania and was the host of TV show The Apprentice. She sold her story to the National Enquirer, signing a $150,000 agreement that gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair. The Enquirer did not publish her kiss-and-tell, and she says she was tricked. Mr Trump has denied any affair took place. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said this week ""the president maintains he's done nothing wrong"". A former Trump stalwart, Mr Cohen once famously vowed he would take a bullet for the president. But things changed after the FBI raided his office and home in April. About a dozen audio recordings were seized and passed to federal prosecutors. Mr Cohen told ABC News this month that his loyalty to his family and country came before his old boss. This video can not be played Was Trump's Stormy Daniels payment legal? His comments stoked speculation that he might co-operate with investigators against Mr Trump, although there has been no confirmation so far that he has done so. Mr Cohen is reportedly under investigation for possible bank and tax fraud, as well as potential violation of election law, though he has so far not been charged with anything. This relates to another woman who claims an affair with Mr Trump, Stormy Daniels, also in 2006. Mr Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, has typically represented Democrats over the years In May, President Trump admitted he had reimbursed Mr Cohen for a payment he made to hush up her claims. Mr Trump had previously denied all knowledge of the $130,000 payment as part of a non-disclosure agreement.

Swede halts Afghan man's deportation,"Elin Ersson refused to sit until the Afghan was taken off the flight A stunt by a Swedish activist to stop the deportation of an Afghan refugee has been widely hailed on social media. University student Elin Ersson had booked the same flight as the Afghan and refused to sit down unless he was taken off the plane on Monday. She streamed her protest live on Facebook, showing a tense standoff with other passengers and airline crew. Reactions have been largely supportive of her action, although some people are accusing her of grandstanding. The video has since been widely shared and received almost two million views. Ms Ersson explains to the other passengers and the viewers of Facebook that she does not agree with Swedish deportation policy, which classifies Afghanistan as a safe country and sends rejected asylum seekers back. She says Afghanistan was a country where the man ""will most likely get killed"" and explains that ""I am doing what I can to save a person's life"". ""As long as a person is standing up the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation and then I will comply with the rules here."" The video shows how first the airline crew and then several other passengers urge her to sit down and to stop filming. As the standoff continues, she says several people in the plane also stood up, some in support, others to see what was going on. Her actions eventually had both her and the 52-year-old Afghan being taken off the plane. EU divided amid migration row The man had been escorted on board by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. ""Asylum cases are decided by the immigration office,"" press officer Ulf Mossberg told the BBC. ""If they make a decision that someone will be deported they hand the person to the national border police. The police then can ask us to perform that transportation. ""What happened on this flight was that the pilot of the plane decided that our personnel and the Afghan man were not allowed to fulfil the flight."" Media reports suggest the refugee is likely to be deported later and that the activist might face legal consequences over her actions. Plane passengers are obliged to follow the captain's orders. Migrant boats continue to try to make it across the Mediterranean Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya The deportation of migrants remains controversial across Europe.

Soher apparent overdose on Tuesdayis a heart-wrenching twist for the 25-year-old and all those who had followed her on her rough journey from Disney star to troubled pop icon. The pressures of being a teen star, a dysfunctional relationship with her father and bullying all contributed to the issues that have threatened to drag her under at various points in her career, those documentaries revealed. Stars come out to support Demi Lovato Demi Lovato: 'How She's Helped Me' The singer said her problems with food and suicidal thoughts began even before her big break on TV show Barney & Friends when she was 10 years old. At the age of 12, kids in her class signed a petition encouraging her to kill herself. The pressures were exacerbated when she found stardom in Disney Channel hits Camp Rock and Sonny with a Chance, before launching a pop career. ""I felt the pressure increase when the fame started to creep into my life,"" she said in the latest documentary. ""I started to feel pressure to look a certain way, to sing music that people would like rather than sing music that I would like. ""There was more pressure to succeed... I was a perfectionist and I really wanted to be the best of the best. It didn't let up at all. It just mounted more and more."" Lovato (right) with her former Disney co-star Selena Gomez in 2008 She first tried cocaine at the age of 17 when she was working on the Disney Channel. ""I felt out of control with the coke the first time,"" she said. ""My dad was an addict and an alcoholic and I guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol because it fulfilled him and he chose that over a family."" The first public admission that anything was wrong came in 2010 when she dropped out of the Camp Rock 2 tour with the Jonas Brothers and went into rehab for what were described at the time as ""emotional and physical issues she has dealt with for some time"". The breaking point had come when she and her backing dancers trashed their hotel one night after drinking and smoking weed. Lovato was also taking Adderall, an addictive prescription stimulant - and she punched a backing dancer who told her parents and manager she was using the drug. ""I lived fast and I was going to die young,"" she said in 2016. ""I didn't think I would make it to 21."" At the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards in 2015 After checking into treatment, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When she came out, she continued using drugs like cocaine and Xanax. ""I wasn't working my program,"" she said. ""I wasn't ready to get sober. ""I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night - nobody knew... I was either craving drugs or on drugs... I was not easy to work with."" In the documentary, she revealed she would even fake drug tests by handing over other people's urine, and on one occasion was taken to hospital after a suicide attempt. It was only when she hit such lows that she made a concerted effort to get clean. She was an X Factor judge alongside LA Reid, Britney Spears and Simon Cowell When she was a judge on the US X Factor in 2012 and '13, viewers had no idea she was living in a ""sober apartment"" - a place to live and get help with recovery. She had room-mates, no phone and had to do chores. That sobriety lasted for six years, she said. In her documentary, she revealed that although she stayed off drugs and alcohol, she has never managed to ""fully conquer"" her bulimia. She said: ""Food is still the biggest challenge in my life and it controls... I don't want to give it the power to say it controls my every thought, but it's something that I'm constantly thinking about. ""Body image, what I'm going to eat next, what I wish I could be eating, what I wish I didn't eat. It's just constant. I get envious towards people that don't struggle with an eating disorder just because I feel like my life would be so much easier."" She performed with Christina Aguilera (left) at the Billboard Music Awards in May Fans believed her life was going in the right direction - until June 2018, when she posted the song Sober. She sang: ""Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober any more/And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor/To the ones who never left me/We've been down this road before/I'm so sorry, I'm not sober any more."" Two weeks earlier,she had cancelled two showsof her UK tour. The 2017 documentary had ended on a predictably upbeat note, with her transformation at that point described as ""a miracle"". The documentary was titled Simply Complicated, and fans who have stuck by her know by now her story is rarely simple. But they will hope she can get back to a point where she can live with her demons, even if taming them has proved a painful struggle.

Heinz baked beans TV advert banned,"A TV advert for Heinz baked beans has been banned for comparing its nutritional value to a protein shake. The commercial, seen in February, shows a woman implying a bowl of baked beans has as much protein, fibre and fat as her partner's drink. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said its regulations do not allow claims that one food has ""as much"" of a nutrient or nutrients as another food. Heinz Foods said it was ""disappointed"" but would not run the ad again. Advertising watchdog to get tough on gender stereotypes Amazon adverts banned for 'misleading' customers over savings It is the second time the ASA has upheld a complaint against what is effectively the same advert. In the previous version, which was banned last year, the woman used the word ""same"" when replying to her partner's suggestion he was about to consume something high in protein and fibre but low in fat. That word was removed from the second version, but the ASA said the message had not changed. The agency said viewers would still understand the exchange to show baked beans were ""a tastier and more appetising, but nutritionally equivalent, alternative to consuming a protein shake"". A Heinz spokesman said its advert ""simply aimed to be a memory jogger about the goodness of beans in a humorous way"".

"UK temperature record 'could be broken'As the heatwave continues, the Met Office says the previous high of 38.5C could be beaten by Friday.UK","This video can not be played BBC Weather forecast for the rest of the week - predicting highs of around 36C The UK's all-time temperature record could be broken by Friday as the hot and dry summer continues. Highs of up to 37C (99F) are forecast in southern, eastern and central England, but the Met Office says ""if conditions all come together"", the record of 38.5C (101F) could be beaten. That was set in Kent in August 2003. But much of England could experience thunderstorms and hail showers on Friday, bringing the risk of flash flooding.

Warning over suntan lotion application,"People are getting less than half the sun protection they expect from suntan lotions, according to research. But the problem isn't the lotion, it's our slapdash application of it, King's College London scientists say. In theory, using sun protection factor (SPF) 15 sunscreen should be enough to stop sun damage. But in reality, people need SPF 30 or 50 to be safe, say the study authors, who carried out experiments with volunteers in their lab. It comes astemperatures are set to reach 33C in Londonon Thursday afternoon amid reports of the heat placing a strain on some health services. Nick Scriven, president of the Society of Acute Medicine, said one doctor had told him their hospital had been busy at the weekend, with patients needing treatment for conditions linked to dehydration, including chest and urine infections. Kim Sunley, national officer at the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses had reported temperatures in excess of 30C on some hospital wards. She told the BBC: ""We know wards are reaching over 30C, nurses are feeling sick, dizzy, having problems with their concentration. ""And that then does have an impact on how they care for their patients, making decisions around drugs calculations and just generally doing a physical occupation."" Visits to the NHS Choices website for heat-related health advice so far this month are up nearly 450% compared to July last year. How does sunscreen work? Sun cream: 'It takes two to do it properly' Water-resistant sunscreen claims 'meaningless' Suntans on children 'are not healthy' Factor 50 lotion applied in the typical way would, at best, provide 40% of the expected protection, said Prof Anthony Young, whose team measured how much protection people got from wearing different amounts of suntan lotions with varying SPF strengths. Sunscreen needs to be applied thickly enough, which many of us fail to do. SPF ratings are based on the assumption that a 2mg blob will cover 1 sq cm of skin. That means you should apply at least six full teaspoons (36g) to cover the body of an average adult. More than half a teaspoon to: each arm the face, neck and ears More than one teaspoon to: each leg chest and abdomen back Areas such as the sides of the neck, temples and ears are commonly missed, so take extra care and apply liberally. It is also easy to forget to reapply sunscreen as often as necessary. The British Association of Dermatologists advises: Put it on 15 to 30 minutes before going out in the sun, to allow it to dry Top up again shortly after heading outdoors, to cover any missed patches and ensure you're wearing a sufficient layer Reapply at least every two hours and immediately after swimming or if it has rubbed off Some lotions say they are water resistant, meaning they retain some sun protection properties after immersion. However, up to 85% of a product can be removed by towel drying, so you should reapply after swimming, sweating, or any other vigorous or abrasive activity. Another important factor is the reflection of the Sun's rays, which can greatly increase the power of the radiation: snow by up to 85% increase, sand by up to 17% and water by up to 5%. Get out of the sun as soon as possible and head indoors or to a shady area Cool your skin with a cold bath or shower, wet sponge or cold flannel Use lotions containing aloe vera to soothe and moisturise the burned skin Drink plenty of fluids to cool down and prevent dehydration Take painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to relieve pain Cover up the affected areas of skin until it has fully healed Seek medical advice if you have blistering, chills, a fever or dizziness Source:NHS Choices,external People with fair skin that burns easily, many moles or freckles, red or fair hair and light-coloured eyes are most at risk of sun damage. Sunscreens should not be used to stay outside longer or just to avoid more reliable protective measures such as clothing and shade. Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ""This research demonstrates why it's so important to choose an SPF of 30 or more. ""It also shows why we shouldn't rely on sunscreen alone for sun protection, but we should also use clothing and shade."" Sizzling 76: Shorts, standpipes, sunglasses How long will it last?

UK temperature record 'could be broken',"This video can not be played BBC Weather forecast for the rest of the week - predicting highs of around 36C The UK's all-time temperature record could be broken by Friday as the hot and dry summer continues. Highs of up to 37C (99F) are forecast in southern, eastern and central England, but the Met Office says ""if conditions all come together"", the record of 38.5C (101F) could be beaten. That was set in Kent in August 2003. But much of England could experience thunderstorms and hail showers on Friday, bringing the risk of flash flooding. Some places could see as much as 30mm of rainfall in an hour and 60mm in three hours. Meanwhile, fire crews are urging people enjoying barbecues and other outdoor activities in dry areas to avoid ""careless and reckless"" behaviour that could start a blaze.

"Unhappy wife must stay married, court rules","Tini Owens has been refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal A woman who wants to divorce her husband on the grounds she is unhappy has lost her Supreme Court appeal. Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted the court to grant her a divorce from her husband of 40 years Hugh, who is refusing the split. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal, meaning she must remain married until 2020. Mrs Owens' solicitor said she was ""devastated"" by the decision and ""cannot move forward with her life"". Midlands Live: Hit-and-run killer could have jail term increased; MP's warning over acid attacks Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years. Following the ruling, the Ministry of Justice said: ""The current system of divorce creates unnecessary antagonism in an already difficult situation. ""We are already looking closely at possible reforms to the system."" The couple were married in 1978 and have two adult children. Mrs Owens said she had been contemplating a divorce since 2012, but did not leave the matrimonial home until February 2015. Hugh Owens has refused to agree to a divorce Shealleged the marriage had broken down irretrievablyand Mr Owens had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. Mr Owens, 80, has refused to agree to a divorce and denied Mrs Owens' allegations about his behaviour. He said if their marriage had irretrievably broken down it was because she'd had an affair, or because she was ""bored"". Supreme Court justices analysed rival legal arguments, which revolved around concepts of ""unreasonable"" behaviour and ""fault"", at a hearing in May and delivered a ruling on Wednesday. One, Lord Wilson, said justices had ruled against Mrs Owens ""with reluctance"" and it was a case for Parliament. Should it be easier to get a divorce? The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? A statement made by Mr Owens' solicitors said he should not be ""unfairly criticised for attempting to save his marriage"". ""Hugh Owens takes no pleasure from this process which has impacted on the private family life of him and his wife,"" the statement said. Simon Beccle, Mrs Owens' solicitor, said she had hoped the justices would make a decision which would be ""forward-thinking and fit with the current social mores"". Supreme Court president Lady Halesaid she found the case ""very troubling"" but it was not for judges to ""change the law"". The original judge who heard the case found the marriage had broken down, but that Mrs Owens' examples were ""flimsy and exaggerated"". The pair have been living separately since 2015, Mrs Owens in Hill Farm House (left) and Mr Owens in Manor House (right) The case has sparked a debate about whether divorce laws in England and Wales need to change. Caroline Elliott, a partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said: ""England and Wales currently lag far behind other countries with their divorce laws and there is a strong mood for reform, which includes the introduction of 'no-fault' divorces."" Rarely in the field of Supreme Court judgements has a ruling been given with such misgivings by so many. Lady Hale, the court's president, called it ""a very troubling case"". Lord Wilson and Lord Mance shared ""uneasy feelings"". Why? Because there is deep disquiet about a law that forces spouses to assign blame in order to get their divorce. Many believe blame only exacerbates the problems and conflicts inherent in what is already a difficult and stressful process. There have been calls for a move to a ""no-fault"" system for decades, like those that exist in the US, Australia and Scotland. A private members' bill has been introduced into Parliament by former family judge Baroness Butler-Sloss, seeking a review of the current law. However, there is little immediate chance of change in England and Wales. Mrs Owens' lawyers had suggested a ""modest shift"" of focus in interpretation of legislation was required. They argued she should not have had to prove Mr Owens' behaviour has been ""unreasonable"", only that she should not ""reasonably be expected"" to remain with him. Nigel Dyer QC, who led Mr Owens' legal team, disagreed and raised concerns about the introduction of divorce on ""demand"". One Supreme Court judge said she reached her conclusion with ""no enthusiasm whatsoever"" but that Parliament would have to decide whether to introduce ""no-fault"" divorce on demand. Another said Parliament had ""decreed"" that being in a ""wretchedly unhappy marriage"" was not a ground for divorce. When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion You have lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce You have lived apart for at least five years, even if your husband or wife disagrees Source: Gov.UK The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Unhappy wife seeks Supreme Court divorce Should it be easier to get a divorce?

Should it be easier to divorce?,"Tini Owens moved out of the family home in 2015 Tini Owens desperately wants to divorce her husband. She says she's been unhappy for many years and she feels locked in a loveless marriage. For her, after four decades together and with their children now grown up, it's time to formally end the relationship. But her husband, Hugh Owens, does not feel the same way. He says they still have a few years to enjoy together. He's fighting hard to stop her getting her way and has been successful so far. Their divorce battle goes to the highest court in the UK on Thursday. Five Supreme Court judges will decide whether to let Mrs Owens have her divorce - after lower courts decided she was not entitled to one. They will deliver their judgment later this year. For many family lawyers and judges, the case, although rare, is an example of why divorce laws in England and Wales are outdated and need to change. Even the UK's most senior judge, Baroness Hale - one of the Supreme Court judges overseeing the Owens case - has repeatedlycalled for the laws,externalto be overhauled, describing them as ""confusing"" and ""unjust"". Under current divorce law in England and Wales, a couple have to prove in court that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. At least one of five specific reasons must be shown: adultery unreasonable behaviour desertion after two years two years' separation (if both parties agree to the divorce) five years' separation (if one party does not agree to the divorce) Mrs Owens, who is in her 60s, cited 27 allegations about her husband's ""unreasonable behaviour"" - including that he was ""insensitive"" in his ""manner and tone"", she was ""constantly mistrusted"" and felt unloved. Hugh Owens, a retired businessman, opposes the divorce But a family law judge refused the divorce, saying her allegations were ""of the kind to be expected in marriage"". The Court of Appealagreed that ""in law""the marriage had not broken down. Mrs Owens filed for a divorce in 2015 after moving out of the family home in Broadway, Worcestershire. If her bid in the Supreme Court fails, she will have to wait until 2020 until she can divorce her husband. Her situation is seen as ""highly unusual"" because in most cases neither party contests the divorce and it is granted. It is therefore widely believed that the Owens's divorce would have been allowed by the court for the reasons Mrs Owens gave if Mr Owens, a retired businessman in his 70s, had not contested it. Even when both parties agree to get divorced, couples still have to cite one of the five reasons to prove to the court that their marriage is broken. The most common reasons used by couples are those that allow divorce proceedings to start straight away - adultery and unreasonable behaviour. Lawyers say people will often cite ""behaviour"" reasons in an amicable split as they do not want to wait for the two-year separation period to pass. And this is the one of the key issues - those calling for change insist the current system forces divorcing couples to assign blame in an already painful situation. Chris Sherwood, chief executive of counselling charity Relate, said ""blame needs to be taken out of the system"". ""It's not about making divorce any easier, it's about supporting people to get the outcome they want,"" he told BBC News. ""From our experience, when people are getting divorced it's something that's been long thought through."" He added: ""Having a system that has assigning blame at its heart can be very painful for the couple, but also the children of the relationship."" Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich 'Name the adulterer' says new divorce form Family lawyer Nigel Shepherd, former chair of Resolution - which has campaigned for 30 years for divorce laws to change - agrees. ""What strengthens marriage is people committing to it. But if it's over I don't think making people jump through hoops and making them blame each other helps to keep people together,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a matter of allowing people to come out of a marriage with more dignity, it's about making it more kinder, not easier."" He said people often do not want to wait for the two-year separation period due to financial reasons. ""You need a divorce in order for the court to make certain orders on finances - for example, an order for the sale of a house or an order for a pension share,"" he said. ""So a lot of people, when they decide they want to separate, in order to get on with things and to get those final things sorted out, you have to have the divorce... that's why most people can't afford to, or don't want to, wait for at least two years."" But some believe a ""no-fault"" divorce system would undermine the institution of marriage. Colin Hart, chairman of the Coalition for Marriage and director of the Christian Institute, says a ""pure no-fault"" system would lead to a ""race to the bottom"", with quicker divorces that would ""trivialise marriage"". ""Society has an interest in trying to keep marriages together and I think no-fault divorce is pushing that in the wrong direction,"" he said. But he says the current system is a ""mess"" and gives divorces too easily. He also believes judges and lawyers have undermined the system. ""You can go to some lawyers and they will frame up a divorce and they will say, 'this is how you make an allegation against your spouse',"" he said. ""The judiciary bears a lot of blame for giving divorces on a very trivial basis... the courts have done quite a lot to undermine the seriousness of the fault grounds,"" he added. He fears the Owens versus Owens case will further bolster the case for no-fault divorce. ""The judiciary love no-fault divorce,"" he said. ""The Supreme Court want to get no-fault divorce and I think they want to do that by creating a judgment that really undermines the current law and tries to say that the current situation is so bad that we need a complete no-fault system."" And he believes it is necessary for couples planning to break up to wait a lengthy period of time before their divorce is granted. He said this allows couples to change their minds and helps a person who does not agree to the divorce. ""If you don't want to get divorced, but you are being forced against your will to make all sorts of profound, life-changing arrangements, you should be given time to make those arrangements,"" he said. But Resolution, which represents about 6,500 family lawyers, says a six-month period is suitable for couples to decide. They suggest a system where one or both of the couple give ""a simple notification"" that the marriage has broken down and then six months later, if they still want the divorce, it would be granted. And, crucially, there would be no need to cite a reason. How long are you going to live?

"No break for Kit Kat in trademark caseAfter a 16-year saga, Europe tells NestlÃ© that it cannot own the design of four-finger bars.Europe","Have a break for a quick lunch? NestlÃ© believes it owns the shape of four-finger bars Even if it looks like a Kit Kat, it might not be. The European Court of Justice has thrown out an appeal by the chocolate bar's maker, NestlÃ©, which argued that it owns the shape of the teatime treat. NestlÃ© has spent more than a decade fighting to trademark the four-fingered wafer shape - something that rival Cadbury had fought hard against. But Wednesday's judgement found that a previous court had been right to annul the decision by Europe's trademark group. That could bring an end to the snack's protected European status - and a saga that has proved expensive for both sides. It also takes the pressure off identical treats like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj - pronounced ""quick lunch"" and which has been around for 80 years - and opens the door to own-brand imitations at your local supermarket. British and US readers may not even have heard of Kvikk Lunsj. Norwegians, though, have national pride in the snack, and its long-running image as a meal on the go for healthy Scandinavian hikers. Its chocolate has a different flavour from the Kit Kat, similar to parent company Mondelez's Milka brand. Taste-testing fromthe Guardian newspaper last year concluded that Kvikk Lunsj was, in fact, the superior product,external. The Norwegian bar has been made since 1937, a mere two years after Kit Kat - originally called Rowntree's chocolate crisp - hit the market in 1935. For 65 years, the two crispy treats lived together in harmony - until NestlÃ© went on the offensive. In 2002, the global chocolate giant applied for a trademark in Europe for Kit Kat. There was no issue with the bar itself, embossed with the Kit Kat logo. But it also applied for the trademark for the shape of a Kit Kat - or ""four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base"" as a top EU legal adviser put it. A real Kit Kat has logos - but what about the shape on the left, from NestlÃ©'s application? After four years of back-and-forth, the EU trademark granted NestlÃ© the shape as a trademark. The makers of Kvikk Lunsj, Mondelez, also owns brands including Cadbury, Milka, Oreo, and Toblerone - and Cadbury took issue with NestlÃ©'s new trademark. Mondelez also makes the Leo bar - another four-fingered chocolate treat. In 2007, the court battle began in earnest, see-sawing from one side to the other during appeal after appeal. Can the KitKat shape be a trademark? The battle to stop people from copying shapes Wednesday's ruling threw out NestlÃ©'s appeal, telling the EU trademark office it has to ""reconsider"" its decision - essentially annulling Kit Kat's claim. The case was about whether the brand had become distinctive enough to deserve its trademark - that its shape alone was how people recognise the snack. In 2016, a lower EU court decided that NestlÃ© had to prove a Kit Kat was recognisable in every EU country - and no evidence had been provided for Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal. And none of the parties involved - Mondelez, NestlÃ©, or the European trademark office - were happy about that. Nothing in common on the wrapper - it's what's inside that counts NestlÃ© and the EU's trademark office appealed against the 2016 decision. If proof of distinctiveness had to be shown for every single member state, they argued, no company could ever reach that high standard. Mondelez, meanwhile, argued that it was wrong to conclude that Kit Kat had ""distinctive character"" anywhere - including countries like the UK, Germany and France. The European court threw out all those objections. The result is that the EU's top court has now declared that it's not enough to prove that a product has become iconic in ""a significant part"" of the EU - it has to be proven across all the markets of the bloc, not just some. NestlÃ© said that Wednesday's judgement was ""not the end of the case"" and that it believed the EU trademark office will side with the company anyway. ""We think the evidence proves that the familiar shape of our iconic four-finger Kit Kat is distinctive enough to be registered as an EU trademark,"" a spokesman said. John Coldham, partner at the UK law firm Gowling WLG, said that rather than cancelling the trademark the court decided it should never have been awarded at all on the basis of the evidence. That means the decision heads back to the EU trademark office. ""Assuming the EU Intellectual Property Office does not have evidence that the shape is distinctive across the EU, I would expect it to remove the mark from the register now,"" Mr Coldham said. ""It is open to NestlÃ© to apply again, and to put stronger evidence in, so this may well not be the end of the road,"" he added. ""No-one is saying it is impossible to get a trade mark for the Kit Kat shape - just that there needs to be evidence that the shape is distinctive of Kit Kat in every part of the EU."" So the Kit Kat is set to lose its EU trademark - for now. But there is still a fight to be fought. European status aside, chocolate is serious business for trademark lawyers on a country-by-country basis. NestlÃ© had been looking for Europe-wide protection for the Kit Kat shape. But the trademark still exists on national level in some countries, including France, Germany, Spain and Italy. When the UK considered it, however, a lengthy court case ended in a 16,000-word ruling that Kit Kat had ""no inherent distinctiveness"". Cadbury, meanwhile, lost its own trademark battle when it tried to register a shade of purple. And, back in 2006, a case involving gold chocolate bunnies asked similar questions to the Kit Kat saga. Lindt reportedly suggested its rival change their gold wrapper to bronze, and ban the red ribbon Swiss chocolatier Lindt applied for a trademark for its Easter bunnies with a red ribbon, which are iconic in many countries - but not all. In Germany, the Riegelein company also made gold-wrapped bunnies, and the case made it to both European and German courts - where Lindt eventually lost. And while Mondelez won the argument that you can't trademark the shape of a Kit Kat, it's sure you can trademark a Toblerone - which it owns. Toblerone to revert to original shape Toblerone's shape was registered in 1998 - but was only put to the test last year, when British retailer Poundland designed an off-brand version. Featuring two rows of triangular bumps rather than one, Poundland argued that its copycat wasn't a trademark infringement - especially since Toblerone had changed the shape of their UK product to reduce weight. That disagreement was settled out of court. Nestle foiled in KitKat trademark fight The battle to stop people from copying shapes Can the KitKat shape be a trademark?

Liquid water 'lake' revealed on MarsResearchers believe they have found the first existing body of liquid water on the Red Planet.Science & Environment,"Researchers have found evidence of an existing body of liquid water on Mars. What they believe to be a lake sits under the planet's south polar ice cap, and is about 20km (12 miles) across. Previous research found possible signs ofintermittent liquid water flowingon the martian surface, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water on the planet in the present day. Lake beds like those explored by Nasa's Curiosity rover show water was present on the surface of Mars in the past. However, the planet's climate has since cooled due to its thin atmosphere, leaving most of its water locked up in ice. The result is exciting because scientists have long searched for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars, but these have come up empty or yielded ambiguous findings. It will also interest those studying the possibilities for life beyond Earth - though it does not yet raise the stakes in the search for biology. Read more about Mars exploration Science correspondent Jonathan Amos sees Europe's Red Planet rover taking shape The woman whose day job is flying to Mars All the BBC's coverage of Mars The discovery was made using Marsis, a radar instrument on board the European Space Agency's (Esa) Mars Express orbiter. The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars ""It's probably not a very large lake,"" said Prof Roberto Orosei from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, who led the study. Marsis wasn't able to determine how thick the layer of water might be, but the research team estimate that it is a minimum of one metre. ""This really qualifies this as a body of water. A lake, not some kind of meltwater filling some space between rock and ice, as happens in certain glaciers on Earth,"" Prof Orosei added. Artists' impression: Mars Express probing the planet's surface. Marsis radar results above. Radar instruments like Marsis examine the surface and immediate subsurface of the planet by sending out a signal and examining what is bounced back. The continuous white line at the top of the radar results above marks the beginning of the South Polar Layered Deposit; a filo pastry-like accumulation of water ice and dust. Beneath this, researchers spotted something unusual 1.5km under the ice. ""In light blue you can see where the reflections from the bottom are stronger than surface reflection. This is something that is to us the tell tale sign of the presence of water,"" says Prof Orosei. Artists' impression: Marsis data shows an area of high reflectivity (dark blue) which is thought to be water Nothing definitive. Yet. Dr Manish Patel from the Open University explained: ""We have long since known that the surface of Mars is inhospitable to life as we know it, so the search for life on Mars is now in the subsurface. ""This is where we get sufficient protection from harmful radiation, and the pressure and temperature rise to more favourable levels. Most importantly, this allows liquid water, essential for life."" This principle of following the water is key to astrobiology - the study of potential life beyond Earth. So while the findings suggest water is present, they don't confirm anything further. ""We are not closer to actually detecting life,"" Dr Patel told BBC News, ""but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars. It is like a treasure map - except in this case, there will be lots of 'X's marking the spots."" Astrobiologists study extreme environments like salt lakes on Earth to understand how life might survive on Mars The water's temperature and chemistry could also pose a problem for any potential martian organisms. In order to remain liquid in such cold conditions (the research team estimate between -10 and -30 Celsius where it meets the ice above), the water likely has a great many salts dissolved in it. ""It's plausible that the water may be an extremely cold, concentrated brine, which would be pretty challenging for life,"" explained Dr Claire Cousins, an astrobiologist from the University of St Andrews, UK. While its existence provides a tantalising prospect for those interested in the possibility of past or present life on Mars, the lake's characteristics must first be verified by further research. ""What needs to be done now,"" explained Dr Matt Balme from the Open University, ""is for the measurements to be repeated elsewhere to look for similar signals, and, if possible, for all other explanation to be examined and - hopefully - ruled out. ""Maybe this could even be the trigger for an ambitious new Mars mission to drill into this buried water-pocket - like has been done for sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica on Earth,"" he added. The area has been compared to Lake Vostok, which lies 4km beneath the Antarctic ice Scientists havepreviously claimed to find bacterial lifein the buried depths of Antarctica's Lake Vostok, but drilling on Mars would make for an ambitious project indeed. ""Getting there and acquiring the final evidence that this is indeed a lake will not be an easy task,"" said Prof Orosei. ""It will require flying a robot there which is capable of drilling through 1.5km of ice. This will certainly require some technological developments that at the moment are not available.""

Desperate search for missing in Greek fire,"This video can not be played Wildfires cause devastation in Greece Greek authorities are looking for dozens of people missing after the deadly wildfires near Athens. At least 80 people have died, and a search continues for survivors who fled the blaze, including those who escaped to sea by boat. The fire is thought to have been the deadliest on record in Greece. One father, who is desperately looking for his nine-year-old twin daughters, said he had seen them on TV being rescued by a fishing boat. Yiannis Philippopoulos has not heard from the girls, Sophia and Vasiliki or from their grandparents, who they were with on the day. ""We went to the hospitals and police and then the fire brigade said the last resort would be to look for them in the mortuary,"" he told Greek media. After visiting the mortuary and providing DNA, Mr Philippopoulos and his wife saw a TV report, showing two girls who resembled their daughters being rescued. Allow Twitter content?

High winds of up to 100km/h (60mph) spread the fire on Monday, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the water as they tried to escape the flames.

Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced, "" Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said. The mayor of Rafina, Evangelos Bournous, told the BBC that the dead could exceed 100. Fire brigade officials say that some of the missing may have died. Bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas said. In pictures: Wildfire devastation 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts Among those killed as the fires swept Eastern Attica were a Belgian tourist, and a Polish woman and her son. A British man and woman were treated in hospital for their burns. More than 70 people were still being treated in hospital on Wednesday, and 10 were in a serious condition, Greek reports said. Others have been evacuated to temporary accommodation. Residents have been told to abandon their homes Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning, and a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services have been mobilised. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, while Spain, Turkey, and Cyprus have also offered assistance. The government in Athens as well as emergency services have faced claims that their response to Monday's emergency was too slow. A Supreme Court prosecutor has ordered a probe into the cause of the fire, amid allegations that there was no evacuation plan in place. Rescuers continue their search of the area The seaside resort of Mati is popular with foreign tourists and locals, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Greek reports suggested that 1,500 homes had been damaged and many had been destroyed. Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica. Officials have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes. Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Five places that have just broken heat records ""Fifteen fires were started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,"" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to ""detect any suspicious activity"". Greece's last major fire disaster was in 2007, when 77 people were killed in the southern Peloponnese peninsula. Wildfires are a major concern across Europe this summer. Sweden has also battled fires the length of the country, while Latvian authorities suspect arson was behind a major peat and forest fire in Valdgale County that burned for days. The serious nature of such fires and their wide geographical spread has led to speculation that climate change may be the cause. While no individual weather event can be linked to climate change,a general correlation does exist between warmer global temperatures and the dry conditionsthat can spark several dangerous fires at once.

ITV defends Love Island as profits rise,"The first islanders on the latest series included an air hostess, an A&E doctor and Danny Dyer's daughter ITV has defended the advertising around its Love Island reality TV programme. Love Island and the football World Cup are among the programmes that have helped boost profits at the broadcaster in the first half of the year. Carolyn McCall, chief executive, told BBC One Breakfast that a ""tiny number"" of adverts were ""not quite right"". The head of NHS England has raised concerns about seeing trailers for cosmetic breast surgery during the ITV2 show. ""We take that very, very, seriously and actually there were a tiny number of ads that I would have thought the juxtaposition was not quite right,"" Ms McCall said. The adverts were seen on the ITV Hub and not on the main channel, she said, adding  that ITV was looking at the situation and would take its own action. The company also took its ""duty of care"" to its contestants on the show very seriously, she added.The broadcasting regulator has received complaints over scenes in which contestants were distressed. Less controversial advertisers such as Superdrug have cited the show as a reason for the rise in its profits. At ITV profits to the end of June rose to Â£265m from Â£259m, while revenues increased by 8% to Â£1.5bn. Advertising sales rose 2%, with 48% growth in online, but ITV said economic uncertainty remained a factor. ITV said it had ""a strong slate of new and returning programmes"" for the rest of the year, including X Factor and, I'm A Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out of Here. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms McCall said the broadcaster had seen its best share of first-half viewing since 2009. ""The World Cup is a great thing but we can't rely on it,"" added Ms McCall, who was appointed to the role a year ago and took charge in January. ""It is important to bear in mind that before the World Cup and Love Island, which have been extraordinary for ITV, we had been doing very, very well on our viewing."" ITV's coverage of England's semi-final against Croatia in the World Cup attracted a peak of 26.6m viewers and the match average of 24.3m was bigger than the audiences for the opening and closing ceremonies of the London Olympics in 2012. Love Island has been sold to seven other countries and ITV is about to announce another ""big"" market for the show, McCall added. ""Love Island is a phenomena which has got legs that will be commercially fantastic for ITV,"" she said. She is embarking on a ""strategic refresh"", which includes upgrading ITV's online Hub service, and launching a Netflix-style streaming business. ITV is currently in talks with a number of parties regarding the latter, but did not indicate who they were. ITV was also boosted by the World Cup, which began in mid-June Ms McCall said its market research showed that viewers would pay for another subscription service, particularly if it has ""distinctive and quality British content"". This would be in addition to its broadcast business and its studios operation, which sells programmes. ""The market is clearly changing and to reflect this we have developed a clear vision and initiatives to drive growth to ensure ITV remains a structurally sound business,"" the company said. Advertising is forecast to be flat in the third quarter and up 1% for the nine months to the end of September.  The company said the ""uncertain economic outlook"" was holding back advertising in areas such as retail, airlines and holidays. The company pointed to ""strong double digit"" revenue growth in its online operations. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said that ITV was ""serious about the threat from the likes of Netflix and Amazon, but will it come at the expense of ad revenues?"" In late afternoon trading, ITV's shares were up 1% at 172p. Should Love Island surgery ads be banned?

High winds of up to 100km/h (60mph) spread the fire on Monday, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the water as they tried to escape the flames. On Tuesday, the bodies of 26 adults and children who apparently died embracing each other were found on a cliff top. This video can not be played Katerina Pantelidis: ""I jumped from the flames"" ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced, "" Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said. The mayor of Rafina, Evangelos Bournous, told the BBC that the dead could exceed 100. Fire brigade officials say that some of the missing may have died. Bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas said. In pictures: Wildfire devastation 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts Among those killed as the fires swept Eastern Attica were a Belgian tourist, and a Polish woman and her son. A British man and woman were treated in hospital for their burns. More than 70 people were still being treated in hospital on Wednesday, and 10 were in a serious condition, Greek reports said. Others have been evacuated to temporary accommodation. Residents have been told to abandon their homes Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning, and a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services have been mobilised. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, while Spain, Turkey, and Cyprus have also offered assistance. The government in Athens as well as emergency services have faced claims that their response to Monday's emergency was too slow. A Supreme Court prosecutor has ordered a probe into the cause of the fire, amid allegations that there was no evacuation plan in place. Rescuers continue their search of the area The seaside resort of Mati is popular with foreign tourists and locals, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Greek reports suggested that 1,500 homes had been damaged and many had been destroyed. Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica. Officials have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes. Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Five places that have just broken heat records ""Fifteen fires were started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,"" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to ""detect any suspicious activity"". Greece's last major fire disaster was in 2007, when 77 people were killed in the southern Peloponnese peninsula. Wildfires are a major concern across Europe this summer. Sweden has also battled fires the length of the country, while Latvian authorities suspect arson was behind a major peat and forest fire in Valdgale County that burned for days. The serious nature of such fires and their wide geographical spread has led to speculation that climate change may be the cause. While no individual weather event can be linked to climate change,a general correlation does exist between warmer global temperatures and the dry conditionsthat can spark several dangerous fires at once.

Doctor 'would have been quizzed' for rape,"Dr Kenneth Milner ran the hospital for nearly 40 years A doctor would have been interviewed for rape and child cruelty over claims a ""truth drug"" was used to carry out abuse at a hospital, had he been alive. Dr Kenneth Milner ran Aston Hall psychiatric hospital in Derbyshire from 1947 to the 1970s, which former patients described as ""pure hell"". A report by police found 65 children were allegedly drugged to a zombie-like state, stripped and abused. Police said there would have been ""sufficient evidence"" to pursue a case. The vast majority of the allegations were made against Dr Milner, who died in 1975, and police said no inference should be drawn from the report other than the doctor would be questioned if he were here today. Other staff members accused of physical abuse have either been eliminated from the inquiry, have died or were unable to be identified. This video can not be played Aston Hall victims talk of 'truth drug' doctor abuse The Derbyshire force, under the direction of the area's safeguarding children's board, started an investigation in February 2016 after concerns were raised about the hospital which closed in the 1990s. Allegations first came to light in 2011 then 2014 and 2015. No allegations of sexual abuse were identified in 2011 by police. Then in July 2014 an individual made an allegation of rape followed by another person alleging abuse at the hospital in September of that year. A deserted Aston Hall hospital pictured in 2008, posted on the Project Mayhem website In July 2015 another person came forward and said she was injected, gassed and woke up feeling sore between her legs while at the hospital. Some children, who were sent to the hospital between the 1950s and 1970s, also claimed they were put in straitjackets. Home sent girls to drug scandal hospital What went on at the hospital that 'experimented' on child patients? Girl 'experimented on' at hospital As well as the sexual abuse, the report found claims of patients being hit while trying to resist treatment, one having her head repeatedly forced under water, and another having her hair repeatedly pulled to force her to take medication. Aston Hall was opened in the 1920s for those deemed to have mental health problems. It could cater for about 100 children of both sexes, but took adults as well. Allegations centred on the use of sodium amytal as part of ""narcoanalysis,external"" - the uncovering of repressed traumatic memories. Sodium amytal, a so-called truth serum, was originally used on traumatised soldiers But stories emerged, in part via social media, of children being isolated, stripped and abused sexually, physically and mentally. Other stories from East Midlands Police collated 115 witness statements, recorded 77 crimes - including 33 instances of physical abuse and 40 sexual - and heard from 65 alleged victims. Stephen Edwards, from law firm Bond Turner, which is representing 47 patients sent to the hospital in the 1960s and 1970s, said the ""horrific treatment"" had ""undoubtedly caused permanent, damaging effects"". ""Every doctor should have to demonstrate their accountability in treating patients, especially those as vulnerable as children,"" he said. This video can not be played 'I was injected with drugs and abused at a mental health hospital as a teenager in the 1960s' After trying to take his own life Jason Stubbings, from Cornwall, was sent to Aston Hall in the 1960s, aged 14, where he said he was injected with drugs and abused. He said he remembers being injected with what he now knows is sodium amytal, also known as the truth drug, as well as another drug which is still unknown to him. Mr Stubbings said he was then taken back to a memory where his brother was beating him with a garden cane and it felt like he was being hit at the time. When he woke up, he found his hands had been tied and he had marks on his body. Mr Stubbings also remembers looking out the window once and seeing ""a guy in the exercise yard in a straightjacket screaming"" and thinking he did not know if he was ever going to get out of there. ""It said on the administration form 'a slight timid boy', and they did that to me,"" he added. No evidence of a conspiracy to supply children for abuse was found at Aston Hall The report said there were consistent allegations of drugs being given to restrained children, with limited or no records being taken. Current medical opinion was these methods were not acceptable, even by the standards of the day, it added. But officers said the length of time since the alleged crimes had proven a major issue - to the extent they had been unable to find out whether some members of staff were still alive. The report said: ""Having regard to these difficulties and the scale of the alleged physical and sexual abuse that has emerged in the evidence; we do not consider that it would be either practicable or appropriate for us to attempt to reach firm conclusions on each specific allegation. Many stories about abuse at Aston Hall came out through social media ""There would have been sufficient evidence to justify interviewing Dr Milner under caution in relation to a number of potential offences."" The report said the offences would have namely been ""rape, indecent assault contrary to the Sexual Offences Act 1956, Child Cruelty and Assault contrary to Children and Young Persons Act 1933 and Offences Against the Person act 1861 respectively"". While it noted children were sent to Aston Hall from a variety of homes, the report found no evidence of a conspiracy to supply children for abuse. Barbara O'Hare, who claims she was abused by Dr Milner in the 1970s, told the BBC the report was positive. ""It gives recognition to what happened to me and others at the hospital and I'm very grateful to the police,"" she said. Derbyshire Safeguarding Children board said the treatment of children had radically changed and if a similar situation occurred today, there were clear routes for them to raise concerns. At least 30 former patients who have submitted a claim for compensation to the Department for Health through a solicitor. Other claims are also believed to have been submitted. A spokesman for the department has said the matter was under investigation. An NSPCC spokesman said the report was ""truly harrowing reading and shines a light on the decades of sickening abuse"".

Time for a break in Kit Kat trademark case,"Have a break for a quick lunch? NestlÃ© believes it owns the shape of four-finger bars Even if it looks like a Kit Kat, it might not be. The European Court of Justice has thrown out an appeal by the chocolate bar's maker, NestlÃ©, which argued that it owns the shape of the teatime treat. NestlÃ© has spent more than a decade fighting to trademark the four-fingered wafer shape - something that rival Cadbury had fought hard against. But Wednesday's judgement found that a previous court had been right to annul the decision by Europe's trademark group. That could bring an end to the snack's protected European status - and a saga that has proved expensive for both sides. It also takes the pressure off identical treats like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj - pronounced ""quick lunch"" and which has been around for 80 years - and opens the door to own-brand imitations at your local supermarket. British and US readers may not even have heard of Kvikk Lunsj. Norwegians, though, have national pride in the snack, and its long-running image as a meal on the go for healthy Scandinavian hikers. Its chocolate has a different flavour from the Kit Kat, similar to parent company Mondelez's Milka brand. Taste-testing fromthe Guardian newspaper last year concluded that Kvikk Lunsj was, in fact, the superior product,external. The Norwegian bar has been made since 1937, a mere two years after Kit Kat - originally called Rowntree's chocolate crisp - hit the market in 1935. For 65 years, the two crispy treats lived together in harmony - until NestlÃ© went on the offensive. In 2002, the global chocolate giant applied for a trademark in Europe for Kit Kat. There was no issue with the bar itself, embossed with the Kit Kat logo. But it also applied for the trademark for the shape of a Kit Kat - or ""four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base"" as a top EU legal adviser put it. A real Kit Kat has logos - but what about the shape on the left, from NestlÃ©'s application? After four years of back-and-forth, the EU trademark granted NestlÃ© the shape as a trademark. The makers of Kvikk Lunsj, Mondelez, also owns brands including Cadbury, Milka, Oreo, and Toblerone - and Cadbury took issue with NestlÃ©'s new trademark. Mondelez also makes the Leo bar - another four-fingered chocolate treat. In 2007, the court battle began in earnest, see-sawing from one side to the other during appeal after appeal. Can the KitKat shape be a trademark? The battle to stop people from copying shapes Wednesday's ruling threw out NestlÃ©'s appeal, telling the EU trademark office it has to ""reconsider"" its decision - essentially annulling Kit Kat's claim. The case was about whether the brand had become distinctive enough to deserve its trademark - that its shape alone was how people recognise the snack. In 2016, a lower EU court decided that NestlÃ© had to prove a Kit Kat was recognisable in every EU country - and no evidence had been provided for Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal. And none of the parties involved - Mondelez, NestlÃ©, or the European trademark office - were happy about that. Nothing in common on the wrapper - it's what's inside that counts NestlÃ© and the EU's trademark office appealed against the 2016 decision. If proof of distinctiveness had to be shown for every single member state, they argued, no company could ever reach that high standard. Mondelez, meanwhile, argued that it was wrong to conclude that Kit Kat had ""distinctive character"" anywhere - including countries like the UK, Germany and France. The European court threw out all those objections. The result is that the EU's top court has now declared that it's not enough to prove that a product has become iconic in ""a significant part"" of the EU - it has to be proven across all the markets of the bloc, not just some. NestlÃ© said that Wednesday's judgement was ""not the end of the case"" and that it believed the EU trademark office will side with the company anyway. ""We think the evidence proves that the familiar shape of our iconic four-finger Kit Kat is distinctive enough to be registered as an EU trademark,"" a spokesman said. John Coldham, partner at the UK law firm Gowling WLG, said that rather than cancelling the trademark the court decided it should never have been awarded at all on the basis of the evidence. That means the decision heads back to the EU trademark office. ""Assuming the EU Intellectual Property Office does not have evidence that the shape is distinctive across the EU, I would expect it to remove the mark from the register now,"" Mr Coldham said. ""It is open to NestlÃ© to apply again, and to put stronger evidence in, so this may well not be the end of the road,"" he added. ""No-one is saying it is impossible to get a trade mark for the Kit Kat shape - just that there needs to be evidence that the shape is distinctive of Kit Kat in every part of the EU."" So the Kit Kat is set to lose its EU trademark - for now. But there is still a fight to be fought. European status aside, chocolate is serious business for trademark lawyers on a country-by-country basis. NestlÃ© had been looking for Europe-wide protection for the Kit Kat shape. But the trademark still exists on national level in some countries, including France, Germany, Spain and Italy. When the UK considered it, however, a lengthy court case ended in a 16,000-word ruling that Kit Kat had ""no inherent distinctiveness"". Cadbury, meanwhile, lost its own trademark battle when it tried to register a shade of purple. And, back in 2006, a case involving gold chocolate bunnies asked similar questions to the Kit Kat saga. Lindt reportedly suggested its rival change their gold wrapper to bronze, and ban the red ribbon Swiss chocolatier Lindt applied for a trademark for its Easter bunnies with a red ribbon, which are iconic in many countries - but not all. In Germany, the Riegelein company also made gold-wrapped bunnies, and the case made it to both European and German courts - where Lindt eventually lost. And while Mondelez won the argument that you can't trademark the shape of a Kit Kat, it's sure you can trademark a Toblerone - which it owns. Toblerone to revert to original shape Toblerone's shape was registered in 1998 - but was only put to the test last year, when British retailer Poundland designed an off-brand version. Featuring two rows of triangular bumps rather than one, Poundland argued that its copycat wasn't a trademark infringement - especially since Toblerone had changed the shape of their UK product to reduce weight. That disagreement was settled out of court. Nestle foiled in KitKat trademark fight The battle to stop people from copying shapes Can the KitKat shape be a trademark?

New evidence reveals shipwreck's secrets,"The Rooswijk is being excavated by a team of international divers Crew members of a ship which sank off the Kent coast more than 275 years ago have been identified. Researchers used archive documents to name 19 of the 237 shipmen who were on board the Dutch ship the Rooswijk.

Swede halts Afghan man's deportationThe activist gets praise for disruption on a plane that stopped the migrant being sent home.Europe,"Elin Ersson refused to sit until the Afghan was taken off the flight A stunt by a Swedish activist to stop the deportation of an Afghan refugee has been widely hailed on social media. University student Elin Ersson had booked the same flight as the Afghan and refused to sit down unless he was taken off the plane on Monday. She streamed her protest live on Facebook, showing a tense standoff with other passengers and airline crew. Reactions have been largely supportive of her action, although some people are accusing her of grandstanding. The video has since been widely shared and received almost two million views. Ms Ersson explains to the other passengers and the viewers of Facebook that she does not agree with Swedish deportation policy, which classifies Afghanistan as a safe country and sends rejected asylum seekers back. She says Afghanistan was a country where the man ""will most likely get killed"" and explains that ""I am doing what I can to save a person's life"". ""As long as a person is standing up the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation and then I will comply with the rules here."" The video shows how first the airline crew and then several other passengers urge her to sit down and to stop filming. As the standoff continues, she says several people in the plane also stood up, some in support, others to see what was going on. Her actions eventually had both her and the 52-year-old Afghan being taken off the plane. EU divided amid migration row The man had been escorted on board by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. ""Asylum cases are decided by the immigration office,"" press officer Ulf Mossberg told the BBC. ""If they make a decision that someone will be deported they hand the person to the national border police. The police then can ask us to perform that transportation. ""What happened on this flight was that the pilot of the plane decided that our personnel and the Afghan man were not allowed to fulfil the flight."" Media reports suggest the refugee is likely to be deported later and that the activist might face legal consequences over her actions. Plane passengers are obliged to follow the captain's orders. Migrant boats continue to try to make it across the Mediterranean Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya The deportation of migrants remains controversial across Europe.

Dozens dead in Syria suicide attacks,"Images of the aftermath of the attacks were broadcast by state media At least 215 people have died in a series of apparently co-ordinated attacks in south-western Syria, local officials and a monitoring group say. Several suicide bombings struck in and around the government-held city of Suweida - the main city in the province - on Wednesday. The Islamic State group (IS) said it carried out the attacks. Pro-government forces were later reported to be engaged in gun battles with IS militants east of the city. The Syrian government, backed by Russia, recently launched a campaign to retake the remaining rebel-held areas across the south of the country. Wednesday's wave of attacks was the deadliest on government-held territory in months, correspondents say. The unstoppable momentum of Assadâs war Why is there a war in Syria? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported a string of suicide blasts in Suweida, south of the capital Damascus, and in villages to the north and east. It said militants also stormed homes in the villages and killed the occupants. It said at least 221 people had been killed, 127 of them civilians. ""It's the bloodiest death toll in Suweida province since the start of the war [in 2011],"" observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP news agency. The Suweida health authority told pro-government radio station Sham FM that 215 people had been killed and 180 injured. This video can not be played IS has lost lots of territory but has not been defeated State news agency Sana earlier reported one suicide attack at a market in Suweida and said security forces had killed two other attackers before they could blow themselves up. Militants also attacked three villages north-east of the city, it said. State TV also said government forces were ""targeting positions of the Daesh [IS] terrorist group"" in countryside to the east of Suweida. Suweida governor Amer al-Eshi told state-run Ikhbariyah TV that the city was now ""secure and calm"". Over the past year, IS has lost most of the land it once held across Syria and neighbouring Iraq. The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts At the peak of its power, around 10 million people lived in IS-controlled areas, but the US military said earlier this year that the jihadist group had been ousted from 98% of its former territory. In Syria, the group is still present in small pockets in the southern provinces of Suweida and Deraa, as well as parts of the country's east. The Syrian military, backed by Russian forces, recently launched an operation to drive rebels from their remaining strongholds in the south-west. On Wednesday, Russia-backed government forces were also reported to be bombarding pockets of IS-held territory in Deraa, west of Suweida. At least 270,000 people have fled their homes in the region as fighting continues, the UN says. On Sunday,Israel allowed the evacuation of hundreds of White Helmets civil defence workerswho were trapped in a war zone in southern Syria. The Syrian government condemned the move, describing it as a ""criminal operation"" by Israel and others. Why has the Syrian war lasted 12 years? Assadâs momentum No, IS has not been defeated.

Wife loses Supreme Court divorce fight,"Tini Owens has been refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal A woman who wants to divorce her husband on the grounds she is unhappy has lost her Supreme Court appeal. Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted the court to grant her a divorce from her husband of 40 years Hugh, who is refusing the split. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal, meaning she must remain married until 2020. Mrs Owens' solicitor said she was ""devastated"" by the decision and ""cannot move forward with her life"". Midlands Live: Hit-and-run killer could have jail term increased; MP's warning over acid attacks Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years. Following the ruling, the Ministry of Justice said: ""The current system of divorce creates unnecessary antagonism in an already difficult situation. ""We are already looking closely at possible reforms to the system."" The couple were married in 1978 and have two adult children. Mrs Owens said she had been contemplating a divorce since 2012, but did not leave the matrimonial home until February 2015. Hugh Owens has refused to agree to a divorce Shealleged the marriage had broken down irretrievablyand Mr Owens had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. Mr Owens, 80, has refused to agree to a divorce and denied Mrs Owens' allegations about his behaviour. He said if their marriage had irretrievably broken down it was because she'd had an affair, or because she was ""bored"". Supreme Court justices analysed rival legal arguments, which revolved around concepts of ""unreasonable"" behaviour and ""fault"", at a hearing in May and delivered a ruling on Wednesday. One, Lord Wilson, said justices had ruled against Mrs Owens ""with reluctance"" and it was a case for Parliament. Should it be easier to get a divorce? The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? A statement made by Mr Owens' solicitors said he should not be ""unfairly criticised for attempting to save his marriage"". ""Hugh Owens takes no pleasure from this process which has impacted on the private family life of him and his wife,"" the statement said. Simon Beccle, Mrs Owens' solicitor, said she had hoped the justices would make a decision which would be ""forward-thinking and fit with the current social mores"". Supreme Court president Lady Halesaid she found the case ""very troubling"" but it was not for judges to ""change the law"". The original judge who heard the case found the marriage had broken down, but that Mrs Owens' examples were ""flimsy and exaggerated"". The pair have been living separately since 2015, Mrs Owens in Hill Farm House (left) and Mr Owens in Manor House (right) The case has sparked a debate about whether divorce laws in England and Wales need to change. Caroline Elliott, a partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said: ""England and Wales currently lag far behind other countries with their divorce laws and there is a strong mood for reform, which includes the introduction of 'no-fault' divorces."" Rarely in the field of Supreme Court judgements has a ruling been given with such misgivings by so many. Lady Hale, the court's president, called it ""a very troubling case"". Lord Wilson and Lord Mance shared ""uneasy feelings"". Why? Because there is deep disquiet about a law that forces spouses to assign blame in order to get their divorce. Many believe blame only exacerbates the problems and conflicts inherent in what is already a difficult and stressful process. There have been calls for a move to a ""no-fault"" system for decades, like those that exist in the US, Australia and Scotland. A private members' bill has been introduced into Parliament by former family judge Baroness Butler-Sloss, seeking a review of the current law. However, there is little immediate chance of change in England and Wales. Mrs Owens' lawyers had suggested a ""modest shift"" of focus in interpretation of legislation was required. They argued she should not have had to prove Mr Owens' behaviour has been ""unreasonable"", only that she should not ""reasonably be expected"" to remain with him. Nigel Dyer QC, who led Mr Owens' legal team, disagreed and raised concerns about the introduction of divorce on ""demand"". One Supreme Court judge said she reached her conclusion with ""no enthusiasm whatsoever"" but that Parliament would have to decide whether to introduce ""no-fault"" divorce on demand. Another said Parliament had ""decreed"" that being in a ""wretchedly unhappy marriage"" was not a ground for divorce. When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion You have lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce You have lived apart for at least five years, even if your husband or wife disagrees Source: Gov.UK The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Unhappy wife seeks Supreme Court divorce Should it be easier to get a divorce?

Briton in hospital after Greek fires,"This video can not be played Wildfires cause devastation in Greece A British man is being treated for burns in hospital after being caught up in the wildfires in Greece. At least 77 people have died as a result of the blaze, which began near the capital, Athens, on Monday. A Foreign Office spokesman said its staff in Greece were ""assisting a British man and his family following his hospitalisation"". The government has advised UK citizens needing assistance in Greece tocall the British Embassy in Athens.,external Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning as thesearch for survivors continues.

Ronan Grant, 19, from Manchester, was unharmed by the fire but was in Athens with two friends when it began. ""We looked up and we saw the sky was grey and red, almost as if there was a border between being stuck in [the fire] and reality,"" he told the BBC. ""All the locals were coming out, we thought it was a natural happening or something."" He added that ""nobody had any idea what was going on"" until Tuesday.

She said she felt ""very grateful"" to have survived. ""When I was in the house and the fire was going over I thought 'I'm not going to make it, this is the end'. But prayers were answered and I managed,"" she said. Greece's prime minister has declared a state of emergency in Attica On Monday night, hundreds of firefighters battled the flames, which were fanned by winds of up to 100km/h (60mph). Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who managed to reach harbours or beaches. Rescuers are now searching houses, cars and the coastline for survivors and victims of the fires, amid fears the death toll will rise. There is no formal count of the missing. The fire brigade has received dozens of calls and has been unable to verify the exact number. Relatives of those reported missing have posted photographs,externalof more than 30 people online in the hope of tracing their whereabouts. The seaside resort of Mati, in Attica, is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Despite the disaster, life in central Athens is continuing largely as normal, Mr Ronan said, but described the mood in the city as ""surreal"". ""We've been hearing sirens and stuff but people just seem to get on with their day-to-day lives,"" he said. ""We feel a bit detached from it.""

Should it be easier to get a divorce?,"Tini Owens moved out of the family home in 2015 Tini Owens desperately wants to divorce her husband. She says she's been unhappy for many years and she feels locked in a loveless marriage. For her, after four decades together and with their children now grown up, it's time to formally end the relationship. But her husband, Hugh Owens, does not feel the same way. He says they still have a few years to enjoy together. He's fighting hard to stop her getting her way and has been successful so far. Their divorce battle goes to the highest court in the UK on Thursday. Five Supreme Court judges will decide whether to let Mrs Owens have her divorce - after lower courts decided she was not entitled to one. They will deliver their judgment later this year. For many family lawyers and judges, the case, although rare, is an example of why divorce laws in England and Wales are outdated and need to change. Even the UK's most senior judge, Baroness Hale - one of the Supreme Court judges overseeing the Owens case - has repeatedlycalled for the laws,externalto be overhauled, describing them as ""confusing"" and ""unjust"". Under current divorce law in England and Wales, a couple have to prove in court that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. At least one of five specific reasons must be shown: adultery unreasonable behaviour desertion after two years two years' separation (if both parties agree to the divorce) five years' separation (if one party does not agree to the divorce) Mrs Owens, who is in her 60s, cited 27 allegations about her husband's ""unreasonable behaviour"" - including that he was ""insensitive"" in his ""manner and tone"", she was ""constantly mistrusted"" and felt unloved. Hugh Owens, a retired businessman, opposes the divorce But a family law judge refused the divorce, saying her allegations were ""of the kind to be expected in marriage"". The Court of Appealagreed that ""in law""the marriage had not broken down. Mrs Owens filed for a divorce in 2015 after moving out of the family home in Broadway, Worcestershire. If her bid in the Supreme Court fails, she will have to wait until 2020 until she can divorce her husband. Her situation is seen as ""highly unusual"" because in most cases neither party contests the divorce and it is granted. It is therefore widely believed that the Owens's divorce would have been allowed by the court for the reasons Mrs Owens gave if Mr Owens, a retired businessman in his 70s, had not contested it. Even when both parties agree to get divorced, couples still have to cite one of the five reasons to prove to the court that their marriage is broken. The most common reasons used by couples are those that allow divorce proceedings to start straight away - adultery and unreasonable behaviour. Lawyers say people will often cite ""behaviour"" reasons in an amicable split as they do not want to wait for the two-year separation period to pass. And this is the one of the key issues - those calling for change insist the current system forces divorcing couples to assign blame in an already painful situation. Chris Sherwood, chief executive of counselling charity Relate, said ""blame needs to be taken out of the system"". ""It's not about making divorce any easier, it's about supporting people to get the outcome they want,"" he told BBC News. ""From our experience, when people are getting divorced it's something that's been long thought through."" He added: ""Having a system that has assigning blame at its heart can be very painful for the couple, but also the children of the relationship."" Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich 'Name the adulterer' says new divorce form Family lawyer Nigel Shepherd, former chair of Resolution - which has campaigned for 30 years for divorce laws to change - agrees. ""What strengthens marriage is people committing to it. But if it's over I don't think making people jump through hoops and making them blame each other helps to keep people together,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a matter of allowing people to come out of a marriage with more dignity, it's about making it more kinder, not easier."" He said people often do not want to wait for the two-year separation period due to financial reasons. ""You need a divorce in order for the court to make certain orders on finances - for example, an order for the sale of a house or an order for a pension share,"" he said. ""So a lot of people, when they decide they want to separate, in order to get on with things and to get those final things sorted out, you have to have the divorce... that's why most people can't afford to, or don't want to, wait for at least two years."" But some believe a ""no-fault"" divorce system would undermine the institution of marriage. Colin Hart, chairman of the Coalition for Marriage and director of the Christian Institute, says a ""pure no-fault"" system would lead to a ""race to the bottom"", with quicker divorces that would ""trivialise marriage"". ""Society has an interest in trying to keep marriages together and I think no-fault divorce is pushing that in the wrong direction,"" he said. But he says the current system is a ""mess"" and gives divorces too easily. He also believes judges and lawyers have undermined the system. ""You can go to some lawyers and they will frame up a divorce and they will say, 'this is how you make an allegation against your spouse',"" he said. ""The judiciary bears a lot of blame for giving divorces on a very trivial basis... the courts have done quite a lot to undermine the seriousness of the fault grounds,"" he added. He fears the Owens versus Owens case will further bolster the case for no-fault divorce. ""The judiciary love no-fault divorce,"" he said. ""The Supreme Court want to get no-fault divorce and I think they want to do that by creating a judgment that really undermines the current law and tries to say that the current situation is so bad that we need a complete no-fault system."" And he believes it is necessary for couples planning to break up to wait a lengthy period of time before their divorce is granted. He said this allows couples to change their minds and helps a person who does not agree to the divorce. ""If you don't want to get divorced, but you are being forced against your will to make all sorts of profound, life-changing arrangements, you should be given time to make those arrangements,"" he said. But Resolution, which represents about 6,500 family lawyers, says a six-month period is suitable for couples to decide. They suggest a system where one or both of the couple give ""a simple notification"" that the marriage has broken down and then six months later, if they still want the divorce, it would be granted.

The photos that explain the world's wildfires,"24 July: Firefighters and volunteers try to extinguish flames during a wildfire at the Greek village of Kineta Wildfires have been sweeping through coastal towns east of the Greek capital, Athens. Dozens of people - including families with children - have died as they tried to escape the flames. But fires are also raging in Sweden, as far north as the Arctic Circle, and have caused huge damage in countries including Portugal, the UK and the US in recent months. So what is happening to cause these infernos and how can we tackle them? Fires can occur naturally in woodland or brush, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, the vast majority of wildfires - as many as 90% worldwide - are started by humans, according to experts. The cause could be barbecue charcoal, a discarded cigarette or even arson. As long as there is fuel and oxygen available, the flames can take hold easily. A strong wind blows embers in California Greece had an unusually dry winter and spring this year, leaving grass and scrubland particularly flammable, says Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). As well as a lack of rainfall, wind also determines how devastating the fire will be, depending on its strength and direction. ""Burning embers can travel quite far and start new fires that could spread for kilometres if they are big enough,"" says Smith. Wildfires kill dozens on Greek coast In pictures: Wildfires devastate Greek region How wildfires start and how to stop them 23 July: Dry grass burns as fire crews tackle the flames in Greece Surface fires - burning on a forest floor, for instance - tend to spread slowly and can be more easily controlled. In fact some surface fires can be good, says Cathelijne Stoof, a wild land fire expert based in the Netherlands. ""It helps plants regenerate,"" she adds. ""The problem is when the flames can climb up low level branches and get to the tops of the trees. That's when you can't stop it."" 15 July: Due to the dry weather, about 80 wildfires have been burning in Sweden The most dangerous part of a blaze is called the head fire, explains Thomas Smith. It is driven forward by the wind and is very difficult to fight directly because it has long flame lengths. Moorland fire out after three weeks What the moorland fire means for wildlife 17 July: This aerial view provided by the European Space Agency shows smoke billowing from several fires between the west coast of Norway to central Sweden. Head fires burn with blacker smoke But it is not just wood and grass that quickly become fuel for wildfires. Nearby homes and vehicles will combust because of the materials they contain, such as plastics and rubber. In Greece, cars in the road caught fire before the surrounding verdant trees because they were more flammable. And they did not need to be directly licked by the flames to do so. ""It comes down to the amount of energy given off by the flames,"" says Smith. ""The cars could be tens of metres away and still be close enough to ignite."" 24 July: Burned cars are seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati near Athens Sadly, people are often killed by wildfires as they attempt to escape. Many of the victims in Greece were trapped in traffic jams as people tried to flee as fast as possible, according to forest risk management expert Alexander Held. But this could have been avoided with better evacuation plans in place, he says. Fine fuel such as dry shrubs should be cleared away from roadsides and houses to stop flames getting close, he adds. ""This was a bomb waiting to explode."" 23 July: The contents of a home, including dry wooden beams, go up in flames in Greece Heat and flames are the most immediate dangers people face in a wildfire. However, smoke can also be harmful if you have an existing condition such as asthma or lung disease, or are exposed for weeks or months. 23 July: A road block is set up as smoke fills the air near Athens Although smoke from burning vegetation is toxic, it will usually disappear quickly. Fumes produced by burning plastic or asbestos inside homes are much more hazardous. 25 March: Ruins of a house are out of bounds after a bushfire in Tathra, Australia As well as changing climates, the differing land use over the centuries has led to more wildfires in some places around the world, according to experts. ""There used to be small agricultural fields across Southern Europe and people would manage the land,"" says Cathelijne Stoof. ""But in the 20th Century people moved away and the land became overgrown. So when you do have a fire it spreads much more easily."" In the case of the huge fire near Saddleworth Moor in North West England, it was not just the vegetation that caught fire. At its peak, the fire on Saddleworth Moor covered an area of 7 sq miles (18 sq km) and burned for three weeks ""This fire definitely did get into the soil,"" says Dr Thomas Smith. The moorland is made up of peat soil, which is carbon-rich and needs little oxygen to burn, he explains. ""The fire gets underground and smoulders away.... It makes it much more difficult to put out."" 28 June: Firefighters tackle a wildfire with beaters on Winter Hill near Bolton, UK Firefighters have a range of techniques to try to tackle a blaze by depriving it of oxygen or fuel. They need to have the right training to know which one will work the best. In the recent UK wildfires, they used beaters and water hoses to extinguish the flames. Dropping water and fire retardant containing fertiliser from planes and helicopters may also slow the spread of flames. 7 December 2017: A plane drops fire retardant near a home near Los Alamos Road in Murrieta, California, last December Experts say one of the most effective methods of tackling wildfires is building firebreaks by clearing vegetation. But this is ""dirty and hard work"", says Alexander Held, and not an option that is always popular in public opinion. ""You can send a lot of helicopters and planes but without crews on the ground you won't put it out,"" he insists. Cathelijne Stoof agrees on the importance of creating firebreaks: in some places firefighters will create controlled fires to draw the energy out of the blaze they are battling. And she says fire prevention and land management should be ""sexier"" than it is now. 21 July: Firefighters create a firebreak in the Stanislaus National Forest, near Yosemite National Park, California Teams with the right training can understand fire behaviour and choose the best way to respond, she says. But fire also behaves very unpredictably. ""It's dangerous. So I very much respect the people that put everything on the line to save others."" 1 July: A fire service vehicle is surrounded by flames as the Pawnee wildfire jumps across a road in California Images subject to copyright Wildfires kill dozens on Greek coast What the moorland fire means for wildlife How wildfires start and how to stop them Â© 2025 BBC.

The blame game: Divorcing in the UK,"Divorce lawyer dramaThe Splitcomes to a conclusion on Tuesday while, in the real world, a couple await the verdict in what has been described asthe most significant divorce case of the century. Throughout the UK there is one legal ground for divorce: the ""irretrievable breakdown"" of a marriage. And there are three main reasons you can give to show a marriage has irretrievably broken down: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Separation The first two are about attributing blame. In the case of separation, a couple have to prove only that they have been living apart (and that can include living in the same house provided they are not sharing a bed or living as a couple) for a certain period of time. In England and Wales, it's two years where both the parties agree and five years if one of the couple does not consent to the divorce. Desertion can also be grounds for divorce in England and Wales, if the party has been abandoned for more than two years without agreement or good reason. In Scotland, the waiting period is shorter - one year if both agree and two years if they don't. For the ""fault-based"" grounds, the process can take more like three-to-six months. Separation is sometimes referred to as ""no-fault divorce"" because it doesn't involve ascribing blame to any one party. Couples cannot use adultery as a ground for divorce if they lived together as a couple for six months after the infidelity was known about. And because adultery is classified in law as extra-marital sex between a man and a woman, this reason cannot be used by same-sex couples - they would have to rely on the ""unreasonable behaviour"" argument instead. The figures presented in these charts all relate to opposite-sex couples. Since gay marriage was legalised in 2014, there has been a small number of same-sex couples divorcing (22 in 2015 and 112 in 2016, out of a total of 11,000 same-sex marriages). Many lawyers argue that the UK should move to an entirely ""no fault"" system where instead of having to give one of these reasons, couples could just notify the courts that they wish to divorce and start the process that way. They say that in England and Wales in particular, the waiting time for ""no fault"" divorce - for those couples who rely on separation as their reason - is too long. Law professor Liz Trinder says in Scotland, where there are shorter waiting times for ""no fault"" divorces, just 6% of divorcing couples rely on the fault-based grounds of adultery or unreasonable behaviour. In England and Wales, it's 60%. She believes the long waiting times for a divorce on grounds of separation can encourage couples to attribute blame, to speed matters up, but this makes divorce proceedings more acrimonious. And during the period of separation, it's often difficult for couples to sort out their finances - selling the family home, for example. Shesurveyed about 1,000 divorced people,externaland found 43% who had been identified as being at fault by their spouse disagreed with the reasons cited for the marriage breakdown. She says the judicial system doesn't have time to question the allegations or demand any real proof, meaning accusations go unquestioned, even if the accused denies they have behaved unreasonably or had an affair. ""There's a lot of manipulation of the system and it undermines confidence in the whole thing,"" she says. Some are concerned that speeding up the process could rob people of valuable thinking time in which they might decide not to go through with it. But Professor Trinder says: ""People take a long time to decide before they get to file for divorce. They will already have been thinking about it for a long time."" Family lawyer Kate Landells says fault-based divorce is an ""artificial construct that you have to go through just to start the process"". She says it ""creates an antagonistic start to what is already a really sad time"", although she adds that attributing responsibility can be ""emotionally useful"", especially for the party who feels they've been wronged. ""But it's often not as clear-cut as that,"" she says. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated in 2012 that42% of marriages in England and Wales would end in divorce,external. That's the latest estimate we have of the likelihood of married people getting divorced over the course of their lifetime. But the divorce rate in each individual year is much lower, and has continued to fall since that estimate was produced - from 10.1% of marriages in 2012 to 8.5% in 2015. Fewer of us are getting divorced now,external, and part of that fall is down to fewer people getting married. There are growing numbers, both of single people and of couples living together without tying the knot. However, the divorce rate has also gone down. So it looks like those of us who do choose to marry are more likely to go the distance now than 20 years ago.

ITV profits rise helped by Love Island,"The first islanders on the latest series included an air hostess, an A&E doctor and Danny Dyer's daughter ITV has defended the advertising around its Love Island reality TV programme. Love Island and the football World Cup are among the programmes that have helped boost profits at the broadcaster in the first half of the year. Carolyn McCall, chief executive, told BBC One Breakfast that a ""tiny number"" of adverts were ""not quite right"". The head of NHS England has raised concerns about seeing trailers for cosmetic breast surgery during the ITV2 show. ""We take that very, very, seriously and actually there were a tiny number of ads that I would have thought the juxtaposition was not quite right,"" Ms McCall said. The adverts were seen on the ITV Hub and not on the main channel, she said, adding  that ITV was looking at the situation and would take its own action. The company also took its ""duty of care"" to its contestants on the show very seriously, she added.The broadcasting regulator has received complaints over scenes in which contestants were distressed. Less controversial advertisers such as Superdrug have cited the show as a reason for the rise in its profits. At ITV profits to the end of June rose to Â£265m from Â£259m, while revenues increased by 8% to Â£1.5bn. Advertising sales rose 2%, with 48% growth in online, but ITV said economic uncertainty remained a factor. ITV said it had ""a strong slate of new and returning programmes"" for the rest of the year, including X Factor and, I'm A Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out of Here. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms McCall said the broadcaster had seen its best share of first-half viewing since 2009. ""The World Cup is a great thing but we can't rely on it,"" added Ms McCall, who was appointed to the role a year ago and took charge in January. ""It is important to bear in mind that before the World Cup and Love Island, which have been extraordinary for ITV, we had been doing very, very well on our viewing."" ITV's coverage of England's semi-final against Croatia in the World Cup attracted a peak of 26.6m viewers and the match average of 24.3m was bigger than the audiences for the opening and closing ceremonies of the London Olympics in 2012. Love Island has been sold to seven other countries and ITV is about to announce another ""big"" market for the show, McCall added. ""Love Island is a phenomena which has got legs that will be commercially fantastic for ITV,"" she said. She is embarking on a ""strategic refresh"", which includes upgrading ITV's online Hub service, and launching a Netflix-style streaming business. ITV is currently in talks with a number of parties regarding the latter, but did not indicate who they were. ITV was also boosted by the World Cup, which began in mid-June Ms McCall said its market research showed that viewers would pay for another subscription service, particularly if it has ""distinctive and quality British content"". This would be in addition to its broadcast business and its studios operation, which sells programmes. ""The market is clearly changing and to reflect this we have developed a clear vision and initiatives to drive growth to ensure ITV remains a structurally sound business,"" the company said. Advertising is forecast to be flat in the third quarter and up 1% for the nine months to the end of September.  The company said the ""uncertain economic outlook"" was holding back advertising in areas such as retail, airlines and holidays. The company pointed to ""strong double digit"" revenue growth in its online operations. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said that ITV was ""serious about the threat from the likes of Netflix and Amazon, but will it come at the expense of ad revenues?""

British man in hospital after Greek fires,"This video can not be played Wildfires cause devastation in Greece A British man is being treated for burns in hospital after being caught up in the wildfires in Greece. At least 77 people have died as a result of the blaze, which began near the capital, Athens, on Monday. A Foreign Office spokesman said its staff in Greece were ""assisting a British man and his family following his hospitalisation"". The government has advised UK citizens needing assistance in Greece tocall the British Embassy in Athens.,external Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning as thesearch for survivors continues. Families left homeless as Greek village of Mati is destroyed In pictures: Wildfires devastate Greek region 'Hundreds went into the sea' The British man being treated in hospital has not been named. Ronan Grant, 19, from Manchester, was unharmed by the fire but was in Athens with two friends when it began. ""We looked up and we saw the sky was grey and red, almost as if there was a border between being stuck in [the fire] and reality,"" he told the BBC. ""All the locals were coming out, we thought it was a natural happening or something."" He added that ""nobody had any idea what was going on"" until Tuesday. This video can not be played Susan Margaret Stephos is being treated in hospital British expat Susan Margaret Stephos, 71, escaped from the fire in Mati and is now recovering in hospital from burns and smoke inhalation. She said she felt ""very grateful"" to have survived. ""When I was in the house and the fire was going over I thought 'I'm not going to make it, this is the end'. But prayers were answered and I managed,"" she said. Greece's prime minister has declared a state of emergency in Attica On Monday night, hundreds of firefighters battled the flames, which were fanned by winds of up to 100km/h (60mph). Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who managed to reach harbours or beaches. Rescuers are now searching houses, cars and the coastline for survivors and victims of the fires, amid fears the death toll will rise. There is no formal count of the missing. The fire brigade has received dozens of calls and has been unable to verify the exact number. Relatives of those reported missing have posted photographs,externalof more than 30 people online in the hope of tracing their whereabouts. The seaside resort of Mati, in Attica, is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Despite the disaster, life in central Athens is continuing largely as normal, Mr Ronan said, but described the mood in the city as ""surreal"". ""We've been hearing sirens and stuff but people just seem to get on with their day-to-day lives,"" he said. ""We feel a bit detached from it."" This video can not be played Katerina Pantelidis: ""I jumped from the flames"" Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica.

Family archive of first IVF baby unveiled,"This video can not be played Louise Brown's 40th birthday has been marked by a new museum exhibition in London A family archive about the world's first IVF baby, containing letters, gifts, photos and newspaper clippings, has been unveiled on her 40th birthday. Lesley Brown held the mementoes, including hospital appointment cards and correspondence, after the birth of her daughter Louise in July 1978. They were stored in a wardrobe at the family's Bristol home and only found following Mrs Brown's death in 2012. Louise Brown donated them to Bristol Archives which is displaying them. An archive of the correspondence has been created for public display Her mother and father, John, were the first couple to successfully undergo in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and their daughter was born at Oldham General Hospital on 25 July 1978. The family was sent hundreds of cards from well-wishers, as well as letters from women struggling to conceive. The city that stopped getting fat Beaver release a 'momentous occasion' New evidence reveals shipwreck's secrets Louise Brown, now herself a mother-of-two, said: ""My mum kept everything concerned with my birth from the appointment cards when she was trying for a baby right through to all the correspondence from journalists and people all over the world following my birth. ""Now that IVF is an established worldwide technique I thought it was important that people get a true view of how it all started from our family point of view."" John and Lesley Brown received hundreds of cards and letters after the birth of Louise Louise Brown said her mother would be ""amazed"" at how IVF had grown worldwide in 40 years Bristol Archives received a grant to catalogue and conserve it and parts of the Lesley Brown Collection will be displayed at the Science Museum in London and later at Bristol's M Shed museum from December. In one letter from December 1977, Dr Robert Edwards wrote: ""The early results on your blood and urine samples are very encouraging, and indicate that you might be in early pregnancy. So please take things quietly - no skiing, climbing, or anything too strenuous including Xmas shopping!"" Many other cards were simply addressed to ""Lesley and John Brown, parents of the world's first test tube baby"". More than 300,000 babies have been born from IVF treatment in the UK since Louise Brown The IVF birth success rate grew from 8% in 1991 to 21% in 2016 One in seven couples have trouble conceiving 16% of IVF pregnancies result in twins or more A woman's fertility tends to decline after the age of 35 and men experience a similar decline after the age of 40 Since 1991, the average age of women receiving IVF treatment has increased from 33.6 to 35.5 Sources: NHS, Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority IVF couples 'face social rationing' The NHS at 70: A timeline in pictures First 'test tube baby' welcomes research.

Web traffic reveals peak time for pizza,"Ancient human patterns of food foraging have moved online. Seven o'clock in the evening is a global sweet spot for wanting to order take-away food, says an international study of internet traffic. Academics have examined patterns of looking for food online, such as pizza or Chinese meals, across the UK, US, Canada, Australia and India. They found that a similar ""twin peaks"" pattern appeared in all countries - at 7pm in the evening and then at 2am. The study suggests ancient ""foraging"" behaviour has now switched online. This big data research from biologists at the University of Aberdeen, to be published by the Royal Society, has tracked how the search for food takes place online. The study looks at how ancient human patterns of hunger and foraging have moved into the internet era, using Google searches for take-away curries, Chinese meals and pizzas. The researchers found that despite big cultural differences, there was a remarkably consistent rhythm of people wanting to find food online at about 7pm. There was a second peak of search for food online at 2am, consistent across seasons and geographical locations, say researchers Nicolas Alvarado and Tyler Stevenson from the University of Aberdeen. It showed how human biology, such as wanting ""energy balance"" in terms of intake, had switched to the internet age. Dr Stevenson says this 2am peak might raise public health concerns about obesity, with eating food late at night being linked to weight gain. But he says the findings also show a new way of studying ""foraging behaviour"" and understanding human motivations about seeking food. ""All organisms have strategies to locate and consume nutrients and food necessary for survival,"" says Dr Stevenson. That primeval hunting instinct has now moved to late-night searching on the wide plains of the internet. Not so much hunting and gathering, as hunting and Googling.

A man blew himself up outside a polling station in Quetta, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. Preliminary, unofficial results suggest ex-cricket star Imran Khan's PTI party is in the lead as votes are counted. However, the rival party of disgraced former PM Nawaz Sharif, PML-N, has rejected the results amid allegations of vote rigging. The campaign has been overshadowed by concerns of fraud and violence, and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says there have been ""blatant"" attempts to manipulate the polls. There have also been delays in releasing the results. Baber Yaqoob, the secretary of the Electoral Commission, said this was due to technical errors, adding: ""There's no conspiracy."" ""The delay is being caused because the result transmission system has collapsed,"" Mr Yaqoob said. According to unofficial initial results, the PTI party is currently leading in 109 national assembly seats, while PML-N is ahead in about 67 seats, local media report. However, only votes from 34% of polling stations have so far been counted, Dawn newspaper says. The turnout has been estimated at between 50% and 55% out of 106 million registered voters, AFP reports. Why Pakistan's election matters Fears of 'creeping coup' in Pakistan Who are the 'angels' and the 'electables'? Several political groups have alleged that vote rigging is taking place in polling stations - something denied by election officials. Representatives from several parties say that their polling agents were expelled from polling stations during vote count and were denied certified copies of results - breaching election procedures. Analysts have also highlighted unusual delays in the announcement of unofficial results in dozens of constituencies, especially in the crucial province of Punjab which has been a stronghold of PML-N. Shehbaz Sharif, leader of the PML-N party and brother of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif, said the vote counting process was ""unbearable and unacceptable"" due to ""manifest and massive irregularities"". ""It's such a blatant rigging that everyone has started crying. Today what they have done has pushed Pakistan back 30 years,"" he said. Mr Khan has vowed to tackle corruption but his rivals accuse him of benefiting from alleged meddling by the military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half of its history. Mr Sharif, who won the last election, has been jailed for corruption after ascandal stemming from the Panama Papers leak. Despite tight security, with hundreds of thousands of troops and police officers deployed across the country, there have been violent attacks. In addition to the suicide attack in Quetta, in Balochistan province, one person died in a grenade attack in Khuzdar, and another died in a shooting between political rivals in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The Dawn newspaper also reported clashes,externalin Mardan, Rajanpur, Khipro and Kohistan. Viewpoint: Pakistan's dirtiest election in years An IS-claimed attack targeting a political rally earlier this month in nearby Mastung killed at least 149 people. A woman casts her vote at a polling station in Islamabad Pakistan has been ruled on and off by the military during its 71-year history. This election is significant because it will mark only the second time that one civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term. But the run-up to the vote has been controversial. Mr Sharif's PML-N complains of a targeted crackdown by the security establishment, with the alleged help of the courts, in favour of Imran Khan and his PTI party. On Sunday, a judge in the High Court of Islamabad appeared to support that allegation, saying that the military Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) organisation had been interfering in the judiciary. In a BBC interview on Monday, Mr Sharif's daughter Maryam Nawaz - who was jailed earlier this month with her father on corruption-related charges - criticised the military. ""When a prime minister refuses to put down his head and do their [the military's] bidding, they pull him down with four things; get a religious fatwa issued against him, call him a traitor, call him a friend of India, or call him corrupt. They use these things against every elected prime minister,"" she said. Several PML-N candidates also say they have been coerced to switch to the PTI. The Pakistani military denies interfering in politics. Imran Khan scents victory in Pakistan vote Independent media, meanwhile, say there have been blatant attempts to muzzle them. There are also concerns about the participation of militants on international terror blacklists in the election process. For all these reasons,the human rights commission has said there are ""ample grounds"" to question the legitimacy of the polls,external, ""with alarming implications for Pakistan's transition to an effective democracy"". By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Imran Khan is seen as the favourite of the military As voters queued up outside polling stations, the question on everyone's mind was whether Mr Khan will be the next prime minister. He entered politics in the late 1990s when memories of Pakistan's cricketers winning the World Cup were still fresh. But only in 2013 did his party emerge as a serious contender, with its leader touted as a harbinger of change, out to fight corruption. He lost by a wide margin, but has continued to lead what many see as a divisive campaign. In the constituency being contested by Mr Khan, a voter called Rauf told me he was voting for ""anyone who uplifts the country"". I asked who could do that, and he replied: ""It's easy to guess. See what those who have been in power have done to the country. They've destroyed it."" Mr Khan has staked his campaign on shaking up the political order and taking on Pakistan's entrenched political dynasties. This election is the closest he's ever got to being prime minister. Will that happen? Or will the PML-N stay the largest party after a sympathy wave by voters for the man he helped oust? The election is generally seen as a contest between the PML-N and the PTI. Nawaz Sharif - a 68-year-old three-time PM - made a dramatic return to Pakistan ahead of the vote to face a 10-year prison sentence. He was disqualified from office last year by the Supreme Court after the Panama Papers leak revealed his family's ownership of several luxury flats in London. His appeal hearing will not be held until after the vote. As he cast his vote in the Islamabad suburb of Bani Gala, Mr Khan, 65, told reporters it was ""time to defeat parties which kept this country hostage for years"". The cricket hero who could be Pakistan's next PM Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's three-time PM Bilawal Bhutto Zardari: Heir to a political dynasty The country's best-known opposition politician has denied colluding with the military. Analysts say he will have to make serious inroads in Punjab province - a PML-N stronghold - in order to win the vote. The party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,the historically liberal PPP, is widely expected to come third. It is now fronted by Ms Bhutto's son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a 29-year-old Oxford University graduate.

Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools',"There are worries that too many pupils are being removed from mainstream classes Too many pupils are being pushed out of mainstream classes in England and abandoned with an inadequate education, says a report from MPs. The education select committee warns of a ""Wild West"" approach to the education provided for pupils who have been excluded from school. There were also concerns about schools removing pupils to boost their position in league tables. Committee chair Robert Halfon warned of too many ""forgotten children"". He said schools showed a ""lack of moral accountability"" in what happened to pupils after they had been moved out of mainstream lessons. The report raises concerns about the excessive use of both formal and informal exclusions. It warned of so-called ""off-rolling"", in which difficult pupils were taken off a school's register and moved to another setting, such as a pupil referral unit or home education. The MPs were told that this could be driven by schools wanting to have better exam statistics in performance tables. But there were concerns that once pupils had been moved away from school, there was too little scrutiny of the quality of lessons. Mr Halfon warned that those losing out were often from families with greatest need, such as those in poverty, children in care and children with special educational needs. The committee is calling for a ""bill of rights"" for parents, giving them more information about their entitlements if pupils are removed from mainstream lessons. It also calls for more incentives for schools to keep supporting challenging pupils. There have been warnings about rising numbers of pupils being excluded from school. Ofsted has written to head teachers raisingconcerns about high levels of pupils being removed from secondary schools. Official figures published this month show a15% increase in permanent exclusions. The report from MPs suggested that as schools developed a ""zero tolerance"" approach to bad behaviour, more children were being excluded. ""We face the scandal of ever-increasing numbers of children being excluded and being left abandoned to a forgotten part of our education system which too often fails to deliver good outcomes for these young people,"" said Mr Halfon. ""Parents and pupils face a system which isn't designed for their needs, too often being left to a Wild West of exclusions,"" he said. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. said: ""These are the young people on the margins, who are at most risk of severely reduced life chances, and we all have a moral responsibility to look after them."" The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said the report confirms warnings that ""some schools are seeking to improve their overall exam results by removing some of their most vulnerable children from the school roll"". ""Sadly, this often includes a high number with special education needs and disabilities, who have no option but to go into inappropriate alternative provision or home education because they are seen as ""too difficult"" or ""too expensive"" to teach,"" she said. School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said: ""The number of children being excluded is lower than it was 10 years ago, but exclusions should only ever be used as a last resort. ""The rules are clear, that they should always be reasonable and justified. Where pupils are excluded, the quality of education they receive should be no different than mainstream settings. ""We are taking a range of actions to drive up the quality of alternative provision, and have launched an external review to look at how exclusions are used, and why certain groups are disproportionally affected,"" said the minister.

Mass breakout after Australia jail 'riot',"(L-R) Alan McDonald, Brendan Bartley and Darryl Councillor are back in custody Nine of 10 prisoners who escaped from an Australian jail on Tuesday have been recaptured, police say. The men had broken out of Greenough Regional Prison, 400km (250 miles) north of Perth, during what staff described as ""a riot"". It prompted police to send text messages to the public, warning them to treat the men as ""unpredictable"". Police said on Wednesday that only one prisoner, 35-year-old Bradley Silvester, remained at large. The 10 medium security inmates had used ladders to escape the jail during a disturbance late on Tuesday, prison officials said. ""[The disturbance] started with a cell fire and then there were a couple of other fires lit in the prison,"" Corrective Services CommissionerTony Hassall told The West Australian newspaper.,external ""They broke into some staff offices, got some equipment and used that to cause some damage."" He said inmates had also assaulted prison officers with unidentified equipment. According to the officers' union, three guards were attacked with chemical spray. ""Our members are describing the incident as a riot,"" union secretaryPaul Ledingham told the Australian Broadcasting Corp,external. ""Reports this morning are there is extensive, extensive damage within the prison."" More than 150 extra police officers were deployed to the region to help track down the escapees.

Police facial recognition use challenged,"A legal challenge against the use of automatic facial recognition technology by police has been launched by a civil liberties group. Automatic Facial Recognition uses CCTV or surveillance cameras to record and compare facial characteristics with images on police databases. Lawyers for Big Brother Watch argue the use of AFR breaches the rights of individuals under the Human Rights Act. The Metropolitan Police says the technology will help keep London safe. The system is being piloted in London, with three other forces - Humberside, South Wales, and Leicestershire - also trialling the technology. However, it has proved controversial, with one watchdog describing its use in public places as ""very intrusive"". Court documents, seen by the BBC, also claim the Home Office has failed in its duty to properly regulate AFR's use. Manufacturers of the systems say they can monitor multiple cameras in real time ""matching"" thousands of faces a minute with images already held by the police - often mugshots taken of suspects who have been taken into custody. However, Big Brother Watch says theMet's own research, published in May, shows that during trials only two genuine matches were made out of 104 system ""alerts"". The group also takes issue with the length of time the images gathered by AFR are held. Face recognition police tools 'staggeringly inaccurate' Can facial recognition fit with a fair society? Facial recognition database 'risks targeting innocent people' The Met piloted the system at Notting Hill Carnival in 2016 and 2017, at the Cenotaph on Memorial Sunday, and at Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford last month. Further trials are planned. The force says the technology is ""an extremely valuable tool"". Meanwhile, in South Wales,police used AFR at least 18 times between May 2017 and March 2018, according to court documents. Cameras in Cardiff city centre and at a demonstration at an ""arms fair"" were used to gather the images of members of the public. As of April this year AFR generated 2,451 alerts with only 234 proving accurate. Police officers stopped 31 people who had been incorrectly identified and asked them to prove their identity. Lawyers for Big Brother Watch argue the use of AFR breaches the rights of individuals under the Human Rights Act, including the right to privacy and freedom of expression. Silkie Carlo, director of the civil liberties group, said: ""When the police use facial recognition surveillance they subject thousands of people in the area to highly sensitive identity checks without consent."" ""We're hoping the court will intervene, so the lawless use of facial recognition can be stopped. It is crucial our public freedoms are protected,"" she added. However, it is likely that the Met and other police forces will welcome the opportunity to argue the case for AFR - and begin to put it on a solid legal footing alongside other unique characteristics stored on databases, such as fingerprints and DNA. It comes after the body that advises London Mayor Sadiq Khan on policing and ethics last week called on the Met to be more open about the use of AFR - and to set out where and when it will be used before undertaking any further pilots. Dr Suzanne Shale, who chairs the London Policing Ethics Panel said: ""We have made a series of key recommendations, which we think should be addressed before any further trials are carried out. ""We believe it is important facial recognition technology remains the subject of ethical scrutiny.""

Firms 'failing on sexual harassment',"Businesses, government and regulators are failing to tackle sexual harassment in the workplace, say MPs. The Parliamentary Women and Equalities Committee has published a five-point plan to deal with the problem. It followsa BBC surveythat found 53% of women and 20% of men said they had experienced sexual harassment at work. Chair of the committee, Maria Miller MP, said: ""Government, regulators and employers have been dodging their responsibilities for far too long."" ""There is considerable focus on other corporate governance issues like protecting people's personal data and preventing money laundering. ""It's time to put the same emphasis on tackling sexual harassment."" This video can not be played What is inappropriate workplace behaviour? Last year'sComRes poll for BBC Radio 5suggests of those who had been harassed one in 10 women had been sexually assaulted, more than a quarter had suffered harassment in the form of inappropriate jokes or ""banter"" and nearly one in seven had suffered inappropriate touching. It found that of the women who had been harassed, 63% said they didn't report it to anyone, and 79% of the male victims kept it to themselves. The Committee's report calls for: A duty on employers to prevent harassment A more active role for regulators Easier recourse to tribunals Clarification of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) Better data on sexual harassment The Committee heard evidence from experts on employment and law and also from Harvey Weinstein's former assistant, Zelda Perkins, who described the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) she had to sign after leaving the film company Miramax as ""morally lacking"". Harvey Weinstein's former assistant, Zelda Perkins gave evidence to the committee She told the committee: ""There cannot be a legal document that protects criminal behaviour,"" The report said that NDAs are used unethically by some employers and some members of the legal profession to silence victims of sexual harassment. Ms Miller said: ""NDAs have their place in settling complaints, but they must not be used to prevent or dissuade victims from reporting incidents as is clearly the case now. We expect proper regulation of NDAs and that any unethical practices lead to strong and appropriate sanctions."" TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Sexual harassment has a huge impact on women's lives and careers. The TUC supports making employers responsible for preventing sexual harassment. ""It's good to see the committee recommend long-overdue reforms to the tribunal system so that it works for victims of sexual harassment, and a new code of practice for employers too."" Ms Miller said that enforcement through tribunals was inadequate. She said: ""The burden falls unacceptably on the individual to hold harassers and employers to account when they will already hesitate to do so due to fear of victimisation.""

'A century' to close disadvantage gap,"Researchers suggested more support for pupil well-being It will take over a century for the poorest pupils to catch up with their classmates at GCSE level in England if things stay as they are, a study says. The Education Policy Institute report found little change since 2011 in what is known as the disadvantage gap. When English and maths GCSE results are compared, the gap between those on the pupil premium and others shrunk by 0.1 of a month to 18 months in 2016-17. In this study, the achievement gap is measured in months of achievement. The score for 2017 indicates children who have been eligible for the pupil premium - those whose families earn less than Â£16,000 or are on certain benefits - are about a year and a half behind their more financially stable peers in their achievements. EPI researchers found the gap between these two groups of pupils was already at 4.3 months in the early years and had grown to 9.4 months by the end of primary school. In secondary school, they based their study on GCSE results in English and maths, rather than a broader range of subjects, to mitigate against the effects of exam changes. They said this was a more reliable indicator of the gap in recent years as GCSE entry patterns had been changing and had the potential to distort the results. ""In order to assess whether the gap is now closing faster or slower than previously, we have created a projection of how long it will take the GCSE English and maths gap to close based on the most recent five years of data,"" the report says. ""To put the latest year's reduction in the GCSE English and maths gap into context using our projections, if the gap had continued to close at the same rate as it did in the five years to 2016, we would have expected it to close entirely by 2103. ""But the slowing down in the five years to 2017 means that we would now expect it to close in 2155 - setting us back over 50 years. ""Based on current trends, it would take well over 100 years for the disadvantage gap in English and maths to close."" To tackle the situation, the report calls for equal access to high quality nurseries and childcare, a quality and stable teaching work force and a new priority on pupil wellbeing. It also calls for ""early and sustained additional support for those who need it"". Children and Families Minister Nadhim Zahawi said closing the attainment gap to make sure every child fulfils their potential is a key priority for this government. ""In fact, the gap has closed by 3.2% in the last year alone - one of the highest reductions we've seen since 2011.

Facial recognition faces legal challenge,"A legal challenge against the use of automatic facial recognition technology by police has been launched by a civil liberties group. Automatic Facial Recognition uses CCTV or surveillance cameras to record and compare facial characteristics with images on police databases. Lawyers for Big Brother Watch argue the use of AFR breaches the rights of individuals under the Human Rights Act. The Metropolitan Police says the technology will help keep London safe. The system is being piloted in London, with three other forces - Humberside, South Wales, and Leicestershire - also trialling the technology. However, it has proved controversial, with one watchdog describing its use in public places as ""very intrusive"". Court documents, seen by the BBC, also claim the Home Office has failed in its duty to properly regulate AFR's use. Manufacturers of the systems say they can monitor multiple cameras in real time ""matching"" thousands of faces a minute with images already held by the police - often mugshots taken of suspects who have been taken into custody. However, Big Brother Watch says theMet's own research, published in May, shows that during trials only two genuine matches were made out of 104 system ""alerts"". The group also takes issue with the length of time the images gathered by AFR are held. Face recognition police tools 'staggeringly inaccurate' Can facial recognition fit with a fair society? Facial recognition database 'risks targeting innocent people' The Met piloted the system at Notting Hill Carnival in 2016 and 2017, at the Cenotaph on Memorial Sunday, and at Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford last month. Further trials are planned. The force says the technology is ""an extremely valuable tool"". Meanwhile, in South Wales,police used AFR at least 18 times between May 2017 and March 2018, according to court documents. Cameras in Cardiff city centre and at a demonstration at an ""arms fair"" were used to gather the images of members of the public. As of April this year AFR generated 2,451 alerts with only 234 proving accurate. Police officers stopped 31 people who had been incorrectly identified and asked them to prove their identity. Lawyers for Big Brother Watch argue the use of AFR breaches the rights of individuals under the Human Rights Act, including the right to privacy and freedom of expression. Silkie Carlo, director of the civil liberties group, said: ""When the police use facial recognition surveillance they subject thousands of people in the area to highly sensitive identity checks without consent."" ""We're hoping the court will intervene, so the lawless use of facial recognition can be stopped. It is crucial our public freedoms are protected,"" she added. However, it is likely that the Met and other police forces will welcome the opportunity to argue the case for AFR - and begin to put it on a solid legal footing alongside other unique characteristics stored on databases, such as fingerprints and DNA. It comes after the body that advises London Mayor Sadiq Khan on policing and ethics last week called on the Met to be more open about the use of AFR - and to set out where and when it will be used before undertaking any further pilots. Dr Suzanne Shale, who chairs the London Policing Ethics Panel said: ""We have made a series of key recommendations, which we think should be addressed before any further trials are carried out. ""We believe it is important facial recognition technology remains the subject of ethical scrutiny.""

Search for Greece wildfire survivors,"This video can not be played Wildfires cause devastation in Greece Greek authorities are looking for dozens of people missing after the deadly wildfires near Athens. At least 80 people have died, and a search continues for survivors who fled the blaze, including those who escaped to sea by boat. The fire is thought to have been the deadliest on record in Greece. One father, who is desperately looking for his nine-year-old twin daughters, said he had seen them on TV being rescued by a fishing boat. Yiannis Philippopoulos has not heard from the girls, Sophia and Vasiliki or from their grandparents, who they were with on the day. ""We went to the hospitals and police and then the fire brigade said the last resort would be to look for them in the mortuary,"" he told Greek media. After visiting the mortuary and providing DNA, Mr Philippopoulos and his wife saw a TV report, showing two girls who resembled their daughters being rescued. Allow Twitter content?

High winds of up to 100km/h (60mph) spread the fire on Monday, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the water as they tried to escape the flames. On Tuesday, the bodies of 26 adults and children who apparently died embracing each other were found on a cliff top. This video can not be played Katerina Pantelidis: ""I jumped from the flames"" ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced, "" Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said. The mayor of Rafina, Evangelos Bournous, told the BBC that the dead could exceed 100. Fire brigade officials say that some of the missing may have died. Bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas said. In pictures: Wildfire devastation 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts Among those killed as the fires swept Eastern Attica were a Belgian tourist, and a Polish woman and her son. A British man and woman were treated in hospital for their burns. More than 70 people were still being treated in hospital on Wednesday, and 10 were in a serious condition, Greek reports said. Others have been evacuated to temporary accommodation. Residents have been told to abandon their homes Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning, and a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services have been mobilised. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, while Spain, Turkey, and Cyprus have also offered assistance. The government in Athens as well as emergency services have faced claims that their response to Monday's emergency was too slow. A Supreme Court prosecutor has ordered a probe into the cause of the fire, amid allegations that there was no evacuation plan in place. Rescuers continue their search of the area The seaside resort of Mati is popular with foreign tourists and locals, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Greek reports suggested that 1,500 homes had been damaged and many had been destroyed. Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica. Officials have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes. Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Five places that have just broken heat records ""Fifteen fires were started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,"" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to ""detect any suspicious activity"". Greece's last major fire disaster was in 2007, when 77 people were killed in the southern Peloponnese peninsula. Wildfires are a major concern across Europe this summer. Sweden has also battled fires the length of the country, while Latvian authorities suspect arson was behind a major peat and forest fire in Valdgale County that burned for days. The serious nature of such fires and their wide geographical spread has led to speculation that climate change may be the cause. While no individual weather event can be linked to climate change,a general correlation does exist between warmer global temperatures and the dry conditionsthat can spark several dangerous fires at once.
