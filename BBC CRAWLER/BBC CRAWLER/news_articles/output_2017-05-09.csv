Why Three Girls is one of TV's toughest watches,"Maxine Peake as sexual health worker Sara Rowbotham in Three Girls ""It was a story that needed to be told,"" says Maxine Peake, emphatically. ""It's a story about a swathe of society that has been ignored and bullied."" The actress is referring toThree Girls, a new BBC One drama based on the true stories of victims of grooming and sexual abuse in Rochdale. Peake plays Sara Rowbotham, the sexual health worker who realised the girls were being abused and reported it to the authorities - and was repeatedly ignored. ""The powers that be weren't encouraging her, they were shutting doors, they were telling her to be quiet, they weren't interested,"" says Peake, who met the real-life Sara in preparation for the role. ""Nobody seemed interested in helping these girls who were in desperate situations. These were really vulnerable young women - the lack of care for them I found mind-blowing."" Three Girls: Ruby (Liv Hill), Holly (Molly Windsor, and Amber (Ria Zmitrowicz) As the title suggests, Three Girls focuses on the young victims who were groomed in Rochdale in the five years between 2008 and 2012, for whichnine men were convicted and sentenced. The judge at the time, Gerald Clifton, said the men - eight of Pakistani origin and one from Afghanistan - treated the girls ""as though they were worthless and beyond respect"". He said: ""One of the factors leading to that was the fact that they were not part of your community or religion. ""Some of you, when arrested, said it (the prosecution) was triggered by race. That is nonsense. What triggered this prosecution was your lust and greed."" The drama - which will be shown over three nights next week - has been made with the full co-operation of the victims and their families. It comes as ITV soap Coronation Street also has a runningstoryline about child groominginvolving 16-year-old Bethany Platt and a ""boyfriend"" in his mid-30s. Three Girls isn't an easy watch, although it is never prurient or sensational. Two episodes were shown at a press screening in London this week.  The mood afterwards was subdued. Holly (Molly Windsor) with her parents Jim (Paul Kaye) and Julie (Jill Halfpenny) The first episode follows schoolgirl Holly (an astonishing performance from Molly Windsor), recently moved to Rochdale with her family, who is is keen to make friends and fit in. It isn't long before she is hanging out with a group of girls at the back of a local kebab shop being given free food and endless bottles of vodka by older men. And then the demands for sex begin. One chilling line that sticks in the memory is when one victim describes how girls would be driven to a flat full of men who ""passed us around like a ball"". Writer Nicole Taylor started work on the project in December 2013 by getting to know the victims and their families so she could understand what had happened in detail. Lesley Sharp (right) plays detective Maggie Oliver who, with Sara Rowbotham, helps bring the case to court Speaking after the screening, Peake says that telling the story in a drama helps engage a bigger audience. ""Sometimes people can be slightly cautious about documentaries, maybe, so it's getting into more homes. ""This is still going on,"" she adds. ""It's not over, but steps have been made and things are getting better."" Executive producer Sue Hogg says she had become interested in making the drama after sheheard an interviewwith one of the victims after the trial. ""She was only 19 then, and she was so dignified and so strong in that interview - and then you begin to ask the questions 'why was this allowed to go on  for so long?' and 'why were the girls not listened to?'"" She hopes that the drama will help the public understand how grooming works and will help prevent future cases. Peake says that, despite the harrowing subject matter, acting in the drama was a ""positive experience"". ""It wasn't a depressing set to be on - it felt full of hope,"" she says. ""Being part of this story, you felt you were doing something that had hope for the next generation of girls that hopefully will be protected from this. ""And the girls who have been through it, and are now young women, will be able to move on with their lives."" This story was first published on 9 May 2017.

Gangster who ditched drugs for jihad,"Aine Davis converted to Islam in a doomed attempt to put the chaos of his life behind him Convicted of being a senior member of the self-styled Islamic State group, Aine Davis is part of a worryingly familiar trend: the petty criminal who embraced violent jihad. On the streets of west London he sold drugs and carried a gun. And on the same streets he converted to Islam, in a doomed attempt to put the chaos of his life behind him. But in the twisted version of Islam he embraced he kept faith in the gun. Briton guilty of being senior IS member His early adult years in Hammersmith saw a string of drugs convictions. Then in 2006, Davis was jailed for possessing a firearm after a police operation smashed a gang that supplied hundreds of weapons to the criminal underworld. Around this time Davis became a Muslim, took the Islamic name Hamza, and travelled across the Middle East. But trouble was never far behind. According to his wife, Amal El-Wahabi, he could not escape the influence of friends from the drug scene. We know this because El-Wahabi testified in her own trial in 2014, when she was convicted of funding her husband's terrorism. She was jailed for 28 months after tricking a friend into trying to smuggle thousands of euros to Davis, who went to Turkey in 2013. She told the Old Bailey that she had ignored her parents' concerns about Davis, whom she met at a west London mosque. It was at the mosque that Davis encountered another person whose life would become defined by extremism. That man was Mohammed Emwazi, who gained global notoriety as ""Jihadi John"", the masked man who carried out a series of grotesque beheadings of Western hostages. Britons Alan Henning (left) and David Haines were among the hostages killed by the IS cell nicknamed ""The Beatles"" Davis and Emwazi were part of a group of radicalised Muslims living in the capital. From 2012 they seized the chance to fight jihad in the vortex of violence that was engulfing Syria and Iraq. Once there, Davis and Emwazi wound up as trusted members of so-called Islamic State. With two other friends from home, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, they were allegedly put in charge of guarding hostages, who dubbed them ""The Beatles"" because of their English accents. Davis denied being a member of the group, insisting in court that stories of his involvement were false. He said he was not the head of that unit, adding: ""I am not ISIS. I went to Syria because there was oppression in my country."" One of the hostages who survived has described how, in basement rooms in a large house in northern Aleppo, the group of friends from London inflicted appalling acts of violence on their captives, who included journalists and aid workers. Detained for about six months, Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa was put in an orange jumpsuit, called Prisoner 43 and held in conditions designed as IS's version of the controversial US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. What followed was a vision of hell: mock executions, waterboarding, and widespread torture. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Espinosa likened ""The Beatles"" to ""a group of thugs with no knowledge of what is religion at all"". They used their faith ""to try to justify all type of common crimes that they were committing"". ""I mean if they were raping, they called it marriage. If they were stealing things they called it confiscation."" He said the guard they called George would often say: ""You don't know how I hate you,"" referring to people in the West. ""He really had this deep and profound hatred of the Western world,"" Mr Espionza said. Six of the 27 hostages held by ""The Beatles"" were killed by beheading, including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines, in an orgy of choreographed violence designed to shock the world. This video can not be played The group known as ""The Beatles"" beheaded IS hostages Mohammed Emwazi ""Jihadi John"" - whose real name was Mohammed Emwazi - regularly featured in IS propaganda Mohammed Emwazi, aka ""Jihadi John"", appeared in a number of IS videos in which hostages were beheaded. In November 2015, days after the arrest of Aine Davis, he was killed in a US drone strike. The then Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK and US had worked around the clock to track down the ""barbaric murderer [who] posed an ongoing and serious threat"". Alexanda Kotey The US State Department said Alexanda Kotey recruited several UK nationals to join IS Alexanda Kotey was identified as one of the kidnap gang by the US State Department, which claimed that ""Kotey likely engaged in the group's executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding"". It also stated that he was an IS recruiter ""responsible for recruiting several UK nationals to join the terrorist organisation"". It is understood that the 33-year-old is still in Syria, in IS territory. El Shafee Elsheikh is said by the US State Department to have earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"" El Shafee Elsheikh, the son of Sudanese refugees to the UK, went to Syria in 2012 - it is understood that he is still there, in IS territory. The US State Department said he ""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"". His father, Rashid Elsheikh, told the BBC he had seen no evidence that his son was one of ""The Beatles"". He added: "" I would like to repeat my condemnation of violence against any human being whatever the reason. ""My son and anybody else is responsible and accountable for his acts."" In November 2015, Aine Davis was being monitored as he slipped across the border from Syria to attend a meeting in Istanbul. Police followed him to a complex of luxury villas by the coast in the town of Silivri. He was arrested along with a group of other men, including three Britons. Deniz Solak, 33,  from east London, Jermaine Burke, 29, from High Wycombe and Mohammed Karwani, 40, from London all denied being members of Islamic State. Mr Solak was acquitted by the court in Silivri. The cases were recently dropped against Mr Karwani and Mr Burke and both will now be deported to the UK. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Karwani's father, Sayed Jan, said: ""There is no terrorism in my family."" He said his son ""good relationships with people. We are against Daesh [so-called Islamic State]."" He said his son went to work in Turkey as a teacher and added that he had another son who had been injured in a bomb explosion in Afghanistan while working as a translator for the US Army. No evidence was produced to show the four Britons had been planning a terror attack in Turkey, as was suggested in some press reports after their arrest. But the court heard Davis was a senior figure in the ranks of IS - and the judge agreed. He was found guilty of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years. The London street criminal turned international terrorist is back behind bars.

Could you save money on your energy bills?,"The Conservatives have released more details about their proposed cap on energy prices. They say that 17 million people will benefit - by saving Â£100 a year on their bills. But many in the industry think it is a bad idea, as it will reduce competition in what is supposed to be a free market. And while the majority of householders may benefit, at least in the short term, millions of people who are currently on cheaper deals could end up paying more. So, if the Tories win the election, how would their plan work? Even though there was pressure on suppliers not to raise bills, five of the big six have gone ahead with some large price increases this year. Among the more eye-catching increases, EDF will raise electricity prices by more than 18%, and Npower put up electricity prices by 15% in March. While the suppliers blamed an increase in wholesale and environmental costs, the regulator, Ofgem, said such sharp hikes were not justified. The cap would be an upper limit on what suppliers could charge. It would follow the model introduced for the 16% of households that use pre-payment meters. Since April, these customers have had their bills capped, according to where they live in the country. Ofgem would probably base the precise level of the cap on the cheapest standard variable tariffs in each part of the UK, taking into account a range of additional factors, including the variable costs for transporting energy there. In other words, the cap would vary in different parts of the country and be re-set every six months. About 17 million households would be affected. They consist of customers who are on standard variable tariffs, which are typically much more expensive than fixed-rate deals. Ofgem and consumer groups have repeatedly tried to persuade more people to switch to the cheaper deals, but with limited success. As a result, 66% of consumers remain on standard variable tariffs. The remaining 8.5 million customers who have switched to cheaper deals would not be affected by the cap immediately. However, if the industry has its profitability constrained by a cap on variable tariffs, it is likely that the very cheapest deals would disappear. Yes. There will still be cheaper deals on offer, but the concern is that the savings - compared with the most expensive tariffs - will be smaller than they are now. As the chart above clearly shows, there is some evidence that this is already happening. Since the middle of last year, the gap between the cheapest tariffs and the most expensive have been narrowing. SSE, for example, has raised its cheapest dual fuel deal by 37% since October last year, according to the comparison site Uswitch. However, consumer groups believe fewer people would switch supplier if there was cap - as there might be less incentive to do so. Prices are likely to rise for some, especially those on fixed-rate deals. For the majority, prices will be capped. But should wholesale costs rise, it's worth remembering that Ofgem will raise the level of the cap, so it is possible that all prices will rise anyway. Equally well, the level of the cap could fall, cutting bills for those on svts. The truth is that suppliers will try to adjust prices to maintain their profit margins. According to Lazarus Research, the profit margins of five of the big six suppliers rose to 5.6% last year - the largest since 2009. In February, shadow chancellor John McDonnellpromisedthat Labour would also introduce a cap on energy charges. However at this stage, we do not know how this would work. In the 2015 election, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, promised to freeze prices for a 20-month period.

Why were 101 Uzbeks killed in the Netherlands in 1942?,"They left their homes in Central Asia to fight against the German army. Then, dressed in rags, they were taken as prisoners to a concentration camp in the Netherlands. Few now alive remember the 101 mostly Uzbek men who were killed in a forest near Amersfoort in 1942 - and they may well have been forgotten entirely if it had not been for a curious Dutch journalist. Every spring hundreds of Dutch men and women, young and old, gather in a forest near the town of Amersfoort, near Utrecht. Here they light candles to commemorate 101 unknown Soviet soldiers who were shot dead by the Nazis at this very spot - and then forgotten for more than half a century. The story was rediscovered 18 years ago, when journalist Remco Reiding returned to the town after working in Russia for several years, and heard from a friend that there was a Soviet war cemetery nearby. ""I was surprised as I never heard of it before,"" Reiding says. ""I visited the place and started looking for archives and witnesses."" It turned out that 865 Soviet soldiers were buried there, all but 101 of them brought from other parts of the Netherlands or Germany. But the 101, all unnamed, had died in Amersfoort itself. They had been captured near Smolensk in the first weeks after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and transported to the German-occupied Netherlands for propaganda purposes. ""They handpicked the Asian-looking prisoners and wanted to exhibit them to the Dutch, who resisted Nazi ideas,"" says Reiding. ""They called themuntermenschen- inferior people - and hoped that once the Dutch saw what the Soviets looked like, they would join the Germans."" Camp Commander Karl Peter Berg was executed by firing squad in 1949 It was Dutch communists held in a concentration camp in Amersfoort whose opinion of the Soviet people the Germans were expecting to change. They had been held there with local Jews since August 1941, while all of them waited to be moved to other locations. But the plan didn't work. Now 91, Henk Broekhuizen, is one of the few remaining witnesses. He remembers, as a teenager, watching the Soviet prisoners arriving in the town. ""When I close my eyes I remember their faces,"" he says. ""Wrapped up in rags, they didn't even look like soldiers. You could only see their faces. ""The Nazis paraded them through the main street all the way from the train station to the camp. They were weak and small, their feet were covered in old cloths. Some of them could hardly walk and their friends helped them."" Some prisoners managed to make eye contact with the onlookers and used hand gestures to indicate that they were hungry. ""We brought some water and bread for them,"" says Broekhuizen. ""But the Nazis knocked it all from our hands. They didn't let us help them."" He never saw them again and heard nothing of what happened to them in the camp. But Reiding started gathering evidence from Dutch archives. One thing he discovered was that they were mainly Uzbeks. The camp authorities themselves were unaware of this, until an SS officer who spoke Russian arrived to interview them. The translator, Alscher, had picked up Russian in Poland Most were from Samarkand, says Reiding. ""Maybe some of them were Kazakh, Kyrgyz or Bashkir. But the majority were Uzbeks."" Reiding also learned that the Central Asians were treated worse than any of the camp's other prisoners. ""The first three days in the camp the Uzbeks are kept without food, outside, surrounded by barbed wire,"" says Reiding. ""A German film crew prepares to capture the moment when the 'barbaric sub-humans' fight over food - they need to film this scene for their propaganda. ""So the Nazis throw a loaf of bread to the hungry Uzbeks. ""To their surprise, one of them takes the bread and calmly divides it into equal pieces with a spoon. The others wait patiently. No-one fights. Then they share the evenly divided pieces of bread. The Nazis are disappointed."" Remco Reiding has traced the families of 200 of the 865 Soviet soldiers buried at Amersfoort But worse was to come for the prisoners. ""The Uzbeks were given half as much food as the others and if any other prisoner helped them the whole camp was left without food as punishment,"" says Bahodir Uzakov, an Uzbek historian based in nearby Gouda, who has also been researching the story of the Amersfoort camp. ""When they ate leftovers and potato skins the Nazis beat them for eating pigs' food."" From the confessions of camp guards and the recollections of prisoners he found in the archives - which formed the basis of his 2015 book, Child of the Field of Honour - Reiding also learned that the Uzbeks were constantly beaten and given the worst jobs, such as carrying heavy masonry, sand or logs in the cold. One of the most shocking stories he discovered is about the camp doctor, a Dutch man called Nikolaas Van Nieuwenhuysen. When two of the Uzbeks died, he forced other prisoners to behead them and boil their skulls until they were clean, Reiding says. Dr Nikolaas Van Nieuwenhuysen was sentenced after the war to 10 years in jail ""The doctor kept the skulls of two Uzbeks on his desk to study. How crazy!"" Starved and frail, the Uzbeks started eating rats, mice and plants. Twenty-four of them didn't survive the harsh winter of 1941, and the remaining 77 were no longer needed when they became too weak to work. So early one morning in April 1942, the Nazis told them they were being moved to southern France, where the warmer climate would suit them. In fact they were taken to a forest just outside the camp, where they were shot and buried in a mass grave. ""Some of them started weeping, some held hands together and faced their death. Those who tried to flee were chased by the soldiers and shot,"" says Reiding, quoting camp guards and drivers who witnessed the execution. Two rows of headstones inscribed ""Unknown Soviet Soldier"" in Russian mark the graves of the 101 Central Asians ""Imagine being 5,000km away from home - where the muezzin calls people to prayer, where the wind plays with the sand and dust on the market square and the streets are filled with the aroma of spices. You don't know their language and they don't know yours. And you never understand why these people treat you as if you were an animal."" There is little information that might help to identify these prisoners. The Nazis set fire to the camp archives before they fled in May 1945. There is only one photograph that shows faces - two men, neither of whom are named. Of nine portraits drawn in pencil by a Dutch prisoner, only two have names. ""The names are misspelt but they sound Uzbek,"" says Reiding. ""One is Kadiru Xatam and another says Muratov Zayer. So the first should be Kadirov, Hatam and the second is Muratov, Zair."" Hatam Kadirov and Zair Muratov I instantly recognise the Uzbek-sounding names and the Central Asian faces. The unibrows, gentle eyes and mixed-race features - these are all considered beautiful in my country. These are portraits of young men in their early twenties, or even younger. Probably their mothers had already begun looking for suitable brides and fathers had already bought a calf to rear for their wedding feast, when the war intervened. It occurs to me that some of my own relatives could be among them. Two of my great uncles and my wife's grandfather failed to return from the war. Sometimes I was told my uncles had married German women and decided to stay in Europe - a story my grandmothers invented to console themselves. In fact, a third of the 1.4 million Uzbeks who fought in the war did not return and at least 100,000 remain missing. Another drawing of Hatam Kadirov (left) and an unnamed prisoner, possibly also Zair Muratov There are many reasons why the 101 Uzbek soldiers buried in Amersfoort have never been identified - apart from the two whose names are known. One is the Cold War, which followed quickly after World War Two, and turned Western Europe and the USSR into ideological enemies. Another is Uzbekistan's decision to forget its Soviet past, after gaining independence in 1991. Veterans were no longer considered heroes. A monument to a family that adopted 14 war orphans was removed from a square in the centre of Tashkent - though the country's new president now says it will be returned. In short, looking for soldiers that went missing in the Soviet army several decades ago has not been a priority for the Uzbek government. The Uzbeks were moved from the mass grave to a cemetery, then moved again when a special cemetery for Soviet war dead was created But Reiding thinks he may be able to find the names in Uzbek archives. ""The documents of  those Soviet soldiers who didn't die or whose deaths were not known to the Soviet authorities were sent to the local KGB, and the identities of the 101 prisoners are probably kept in Uzbekistan,"" says Reiding. ""If I have access to them I can find some of the 101 Uzbeks."" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Poor quality jobs 'are bad for the economy',"This video can not be played Why bad work is bad for the economy The head of the government's review into zero-hours contracts and the less secure world of work has said that too many businesses still allow ""bad work"" to flourish. Ahead of a speech on Tuesday evening, Matthew Taylor told the BBC that workers should be ""engaged"" by employers and feel more in control of how they work. ""I think some business leaders understand completely the importance of good work and its link to productivity, but, as always, we have a long tail of businesses where there doesn't seem to be that understanding,"" he told me. Mr Taylor said that he was ""shocked"" at a new poll which suggests only 1-in-10 believe that all work is ""fair and decent"". Mr Taylor argued that it was ""unacceptable"" that so many people in work were classed as below the official poverty line. Arecent reportby the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that the number of people defined as suffering ""in-work poverty"" had risen by 1.1 million since 2010, to 3.8 million. Although overall poverty is down, the report said that high housing costs, low wage growth and cuts to benefits meant that more people were officially classed as below the poverty line (an income of 60% of median earnings) despite being in work. Less secure work in the ""gig-economy"" is also seen as a challenge to employment standards. Companies like Deliveroo and Uber have been criticised for controversial workplace practices, though many say that the companies offer good, flexible alternatives to 9-5 work and a better deal for consumers. ""I think bad work is unacceptable when so many people in work are in poverty,"" Mr Taylor told me. ""Bad work is clearly bad for our health and well-being, it leads to people dropping out of work. ""Bad work is bad for productivity, so it's bad for our economy. ""If we're going to introduce technology - robots, artificial intelligence - we need to do that in a way which thinks about the quality of people's work experience. ""Bad work just doesn't fit 2017. We want a world of engaged citizens, part of our communities. ""How can it be right that those same citizens who go to work for half their lives, don't get listened to, don't get involved, don't get engaged?"" Mr Taylor, who is head of the Royal Society for the Encouragements of the Arts (the RSA), said the new poll findings showed that the public were not convinced that all work was of the right quality. The RSA commissioned Populus to question more than 2,000 people. Fewer than 1-in-10 thought that ""all work was fair and decent"". And nearly 75% said that more should be done to improve the quality of work. ""Three quarters of people think that making work better should be a national priority,"" Mr Taylor said. ""It shows that nearly as many people think it is perfectly possible for all jobs to be fair and to be decent but actually, shockingly, only 1-in-10 think that is currently the state of affairs. ""So the public wants change, believes change is possible, but thinks we have got a long journey to go on."" As Iwrote yesterday, the changing world of work is rising up the political agenda. Theresa May made ""an economy that works for everyone"" the cornerstone of her ""offer"" to the voters after she became Prime Minister. The government has said that introducing the National Living Wage and lifting tax thresholds (the point at which we start paying tax on our income) has helped many poorer people in work. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for letting the problem of the ""quality"" of work become so acute. Labour has suggested it will ban zero-hours contracts and the Lib Dems have said that more transparency around what people are paid will help tackle the gap between higher and lower earners. Mr Taylor said his review, which will be delivered to Number 10 shortly after the election whoever becomes Prime Minister, will call for a mix of new tax rules and workplace regulations as well as the promotion of a ""new norm"" around how businesses treat their employees. ""There is an old fashioned view in some parts of business that good work is somehow anti-competitive - it isn't,"" Mr Taylor said. ""If you get people to work better, then they will be more productive and be better for your business. ""That is an argument we've still got to win.""

Will Russia's absence spoil Eurovision party in Ukraine?,"Playing with fire? Georgia's singer will take full advantage of Eurovision pyrotechnics in Tuesday's semi-final Performers from 42 countries strode down a long red carpet near Ukraine's parliament this week, as a curtain-raiser to this year's Eurovision Song Contest. But one nation, Russia, was missing. For the first time in Eurovision history, the host nation barred another country's singer. That is because in 2015, in violation of Ukrainian border rules, Russia's Julia Samoilova performed in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia a year earlier. This video can not be played Why this Russian singer won't be in Kiev this year Samoilova suffers from a neural muscular disorder and has used a wheelchair since childhood. ""When the rumours began I might not go, I was so sad,"" she told the BBC in Moscow. ""I thought, how come? This was my dream. When the final decision was taken I didn't believe it. But unfortunately, this is the reality."" Follow the BBC's Eurovision coverage here Crimea or bust- Steve Rosenberg's long journey to annexed peninsula Why Ukraine and Russia are facing off Jamala pushes boundaries on Crimea ""I think it's a stupid reaction,"" Russian MP Vitaly Milonov tells me. ""They're even afraid of such a small girl to enter Kiev."" Even before Ukraine's ban, Mr Milonov had called for a Russian boycott of Eurovision: ""Eurovision became a disgusting socialist nightmare for all these left-wing parties with all their bearded women, or men, with these anti-Christian positions. ""I am sure that most conservatives in the world will never attend this festival. Because this is a festival of Sodom and Gomorrah."" The theme of this year's contest is ""Celebrate diversity"" but that has fallen flat for Russia It is supposed to be a festival of peace and friendship but there is not much sign of either in relations between Kiev and Moscow. In eastern Ukraine, 10,000 people have been killed in three years of war: a war in which Russia is directly involved through its military support for separatist rebels. Crimea remains a source of tension and Eurovision is the latest battleground. ""Since 2014, we've had a law in Ukraine that punishes people who illegally cross our border when they visit Crimea,"" says Ukrainian MP Olha Chervakova. ""Did Russia know this? Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal."" The ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Eurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went ""against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values"". In an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow. Russia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise. Ukraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population. Russia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play. Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest. Recently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre. If this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song: ""I was just too late made aware of the song. ""If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent."" In a statement, the EBU said it would ""not comment on prank calls"". But these are high-profile Russian pranksters,who once fooled Elton Johninto thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more,"" one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. ""People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore."" Perhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine? Security is tight for this year's Eurovision and some fear that Russia will somehow make its presence felt Equating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas. ""Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West,"" believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. ""The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game."" In the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that ""we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot."" Security in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final. As for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea. Another political message from Moscow, to Kiev and to Europe. Russian singer Julia Samoilova has been denied a visa to perform in Kiev Born in April 1989 in Ukhta, Russia, Julia Samoilova suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, a neuromuscular disorder that causes muscle wastage She has been in a wheelchair since childhood A Russian X Factor finalist in 2013, she performed at the Sochi Winter Olympics opening ceremony in 2014 Russia rejects 'Eurovision via satellite' Russia out of tune with Ukraine's Eurovision show Ukraine bars Russian Eurovision singer BBC coverage of Eurovision Song Contest Eurovision Song Contest Kyiv 2017 LA firefighters to give update as wildfires destroy buildings and force thousands to flee Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

How did this remote French outpost vote?,"Pierre Fouchard (L) and Alex Bry (R) sitting atop Pierre's Peugeot overlooking Ãtang de Savoyard on Saint-Pierre island Last March, just weeks before announcing her candidacy for the 2017 French presidential election, far-right politician Marine Le Pen set foot onto a craggy, frostbitten island 10 miles off the coast of the Canadian province of Newfoundland & Labrador. How did Le Pen's ideas resonate on the islands so far from the French mainland? This was no foreign visit. The island of St Pierre, together with its larger but less populated neighbour Miquelon, is a remote outpost of France. It is the last French soil left in North America, and the oldest remaining French overseas territory in the world. Few French people visit, or have even really heard of St Pierre and Miquelon, and that was exactly the point that Marine Le Pen, then leader of the Front National party, was trying to make when she arrived. Under her leadership, she argued, the people of St Pierre and Miquelon would be forgotten no more. In the year since, the presidential election has been one of the most surprising in France's modern history, with far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon and mainstream-right candidate FranÃ§ois Fillon being eliminated in the first round of voting. French citizens were left to decide between Le Pen and a heretofore unelected 39-year-old banker, Emmanuel Macron. Five reasons why Macron won the French election Emmanuel Macron: What are his policies? Le Pen may have lost the vote for president, but her message resonated in St Pierre. Macron, on the other hand, has demonstrated little familiarity with life in this particular corner of France. Ãle aux Marins, part of the chain of islands comprising Saint-Pierre and Miquelon ""I will never vote for Macron,"" said Johann, a French fisherman and captain of the small scalloping vessel Emeline. As the Emeline zips through the Bay of Fortune en route to the St Pierre harbour, a couple of dolphins race by on the port side. ""We need something new,"" he adds. ""She - Le Pen - is not new either, but at least she is different, you know. Macron is the same."" Johann was born and raised in St Pierre. Although he and his fellow islanders number just 6,000, their votes held a special significance in French elections. St Pierre and Miquelon is the easternmost of France's western territories (the others being in the Caribbean and South America), which voted a day ahead of mainland France. Consequently, the very first votes to be cast in any French national election are those from St Pierre. In mainland France, the rise of Marine Le Pen and the far right generally spurred increasing concern around immigration and terrorism, along with dissatisfaction with the European Union. For Johann and his fellow fishermen, these concerns are quite literally a world away. They gauge politics by hunches and intuitions, and in that frame of mind, president-elect Emmanuel Macron seems like an elitist, someone who would be out of place on a scalloping vessel in the high Atlantic. St Pierre and Miquelon profile Saint-Pierre was founded as a fishing territory, but today fishing comprises only 3% of the economy. While the local government has made a huge effort to boost tourism, the high cost of getting to the islands means that they receive only 10,000 visitors a year. The bulk of economic activity comes from public spending and administrative work. In this context, it is easy to see why, among the fishing community at least, a change from the establishment would be most welcome. Election posters up in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon On Thursday evening before the election, one of the bars in the island was packed with young people. In typical French fashion, the life of the party was in the smoking section - and there were plenty of opinions on the election. One vocal group of friends in their late teens and early twenties had just ordered a round of shots. They were a diverse bunch, including two young women from France proper and one from Corsica. The women are all living in St Pierre because their parents have been sent there for work. The young men are all natives of the island, though with their black skinny jeans and fashionable haircuts, anyone of them could have been transported from a Parisian street corner. All but one supported far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon in the first round. It seems he won the youth of Saint-Pierre over with his leftward pivots and his use of YouTube and social media. Once MÃ©lenchon was out, the young voters declined to choose. Many young people in the bar had decided to cast a vote blanc, a blank ballot. The other half begrudgingly said they would vote for Macron. Is Le Pen dancing away the blues? The sense of disenchantment seemed to teeter between animated frustration and blasÃ© resignation. In the first round of voting, St Pierre and Miquelon strongly supported MÃ©lenchon, with 35.45% of the vote. St-Pierre and Miquelon But in St Pierre and Miquelon, Le Pen and Macron were neck-and-neck for second and third place, receiving 18.16% and 17.97%, respectively. In an island community with just under 5,000 eligible voters, the difference between 18.16% and 17.97% was a mere five votes. Alex Bry and Pierre Fouchard are cousins and best friends, but they are on the opposite ends of the political spectrum. They are both 19, and first-time voters. Fouchard was the only one of his friends who said he would vote Le Pen, a decision he made because of what he sees as a kind of unfairness that permeates French society. Bry argues frequently with Fouchard about politics, but they never allow it to reach the point of animosity. Bry saw Macron as France's last chance to maintain its commitment to the environment and human rights. But in spite of his strong progressive bent he had a hard time deciding whether or not he would actually vote for Macron. For him, the vote blanc remained an option until the last minute. He said he voted for Macron ""unwillingly"". Fouchard, on the other hand, voted for Le Pen despite expecting her to lose. Around 1:00am, as bar staff made their way around the tables to prepare to close, Bry and Fouchard ordered a final round of cocktails. They decided to finish the night with a boisterous rendition of a Newfoundland drinking song - two smartly dressed boys who speak European French singing in English about fighting Quebeckers for the territorial integrity of Labrador. A woman nearby leaned over and whispered: ""A lot of people here feel Canadian on the inside, even just a little."" St Pierre and Miquelon voters casting their ballots in the second round of the 2017 French election The polls opened on Saturday at the St Pierre town hall at 8:00 am. A rooster in the garden of one of the neighbouring houses crowed at precisely the moment town hall officials unlocked the doors. It was a polite and pleasant atmosphere, with none of the bitter disillusionment seen in the bar on Thursday night. The first person to vote in St Pierre was an elderly gentleman named GÃ©rard Dagort. In the end, Macron's victory was decisive, but voter turnout was the lowest in nearly 50 years and votes blancs were at a record high. When St Pierre's own numbers were released, they closely mirrored the overall French result, with 63.88% for Macron to 36.12% for Le Pen. It seems, then, that Marine Le Pen may have misjudged the impact of St Pierre and Miquelon's distance from France in her visit last year. Sure, there are hockey jerseys and pickup trucks on the island and anything from France has to come on a cargo ship from Canada. But when it comes to politics at least, the people of St Pierre and Miquelon are as close to France as ever. New French president to fight 'divisions' Will Macron mean Brexit blues or boost?

Andy Murray in Madrid Open action - radio and text,"Murray wins 6-4 6-3 in one hour and 23 minutes Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Get involved: Will an English manager win the Premier League? If so, who and why? #bbcsportsday. Tonight: BBC Radio 5 live 19:30 BST - Out of their League - Why has an English manager not won the Premier League? Jamie Lillywhite, Michael Emons and Luke Reddy And with news of that Andy Murray progress we will wrap up this extended Sportsday live service. Fear not though, there is another live starting soon. It's Champions League football as Monaco look to fight back from a couple of goals down after their semi-final first leg with Juventus. That live text will be rolling at 18:30 BST give or take. For now though, thanks for all the texts, tweets and love today. Sportsday will be waiting for you at 08:00 tomorrow. Peace. Murray 6-4 6-3 Copil So the Andy Murray charge towards the French Open, Wimbledon and beyond gets another small nudge forward. There will be bigger days though and for sure there will be bigger challenges. Perhaps most impressive there was how he just gritted things out. Far from sensational, he never looked in danger and didn't have to face a single break point. Murray 6-4 6-3 Copil Russell FullerBBC tennis correspondent in Madrid He signs the camera lense as Marius Copil leaves the court to applause. He's had a good few days but Andy Murray goes through.Â Nine unforced errors for Murray on the day. He can be well pleased with his day's work. He took one hour and 23 minutes to progress. Murray 6-4 6-3 Copil Andy Murray then, the floor is yours.Â A forehand winner down the line gives him control at 30-0, the masses in Madrid sit quietly as they await the final parts of the play. Marius Copil has brought bits and pieces today, he's made it mildly intersting and a flashing backhand from him reminds us he's still here, that's 30-15. But Murray brings up match point and takes it ruthlessly. He comes to the net, pats his beaten opponent on the tummy and that my friends is that. *Murray 7-6 5-3 Copil Marius Copil will serve then to prolong the pain here. Still, his outfit is superb and he even wore it against Roberto Bautista Agut in round two.Â He reaches 40-15 but then gets a slice of misfortune as a Murray backhand crashes into the tape before dropping over.Â Murray looks focused on getting this done in the next game as a long backhand had all the hallmarks of a man just waiting to get this game out of the way. Here we go then... Murray 7-6 5-2 Copil* Russell FullerBBC tennis correspondent in Madrid ""Murray could have himself a fairly straightforward passage into the third round now if he keeps his concentration."" WTA reporter Counrtney Nguyen adds:""Murray has locked it down, just six unforced errors so far."" Listen to live commentary, just click 'live coverage'. *Murray 7-6 4-2 Copil ""Murray hitting a few high, looping balls. Almost the boxing equivalent of the boxing jabs,"" says WTA reporter Courtney Nguyen. The tactic helps the world number one to deuce on the Marius Copil serve. We see the rally of the match, with Murray looking done on more than one occasion. He hustled to just lob a high ball back into the court whilst on the run and later hooked a ball back when stranded. It pays off as Copil eventually breaks and hits the net.Â Break point it is and Murray pounces again. Turn out the lights, this one is surely over. Courtney NguyenWTA reporter in Madrid You get the sense Copil can't do much more to hurt Murray. Murray seems to be spotting some patterns and movements which can now help him. Russell FullerBBC tennis correspondent in Madrid Murray is looking mildly threatening in the last few minutes. Like a runner timing his run and getting ready to pounce. Murray 7-6 3-2 Copil* That last Marius Copil smash hit four-time Grand Slam winner Manuel Santana in the head. The 78-year-old, the tournament director in Madrid, sees the funny side and he's all good. Santana won the French twice, the US Open and Wimbledon between 1961 and 1966. *Murray 7-6 2-2 Copil This could be a key moment as Marius Copil surrenders a 40-0 lead on his serve to fall to deuce. The man in yellow shows some guts though and holds on. He gets Murray on the run which leads to an easy smash put away. Elsewhere out on these courts Dominic Thiem - who beat Murray in the semi-finals of the Barcelona Open less than two weeks ago - took his first set 6-3 against Jared Donaldson. Pierre-Hugues Herbert won a first-set tie break againstÂ Lucas Pouille and it's 4-4 in the second. Croatian's Bora Coric is awaiting the winner of that match in round two. The winner of that encounter will then play the winner of Murray-Copil in round three. Murray 7-6 2-1 Copil* Marius Copil holds easily and takes the first point of Andy Murray's second service game in this set. The third ace of the match for Murray gets him back into things and there's an air of inevitability about the vibe around this court now. Those in attendance seem to be just waiting for Muzza to twist the knife a bit. At 30-30 he's on his second serve - touch of pressure - but Copil makes life easy with a wayward return. They trade powerful blows and Murray dollies one back a bit short, Copil will punish this... no. Into the net. Possibly the easiest shot of the rally yet it's the one that gets away. Murray 7-6 1-0 Copil* There's nothing I like more than a drop shot followed by an easy pass into an area of the court a player has forced his rival to vacate. That's the picture here as Murray drops one from deep beautifully and then just nudges the ball back over the net. It's the highlight of this service hold.Â The court is now covered in shade and Murray will hope the way he pinched that first set will have sucked the air out of Marius Copil, who prepares to serve.

Russell FullerBBC tennis correspondent in Madrid ""I think 'solid' is the word for that set."" *Murray 6-4 Copil Now would be a good time to find a first break of the match and like many top players, Andy Murray senses blood. He jostles for position at 15-15 and floats a forehand into the corner, prompting Copil to send a ball long. Pressure on the underdog and he feels it, a brilliant volley from deep in the court from Murray finds the target, passing Copil. Break point, set point and with a big fist pump Murray gets it done. A Copil return kicks up off the net, allowing Murray to get over a ball which bounces kindly and fizz it at his opponent who can only dribble it back into the net. Andy Murray had smiles two days back. As I've just said, definitely a parking ticket or something... app users may need to select the link to view the post below... Allow Instagram content?

Murray 5-4 Copil* Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique is in the stands taking this in as Andy Murray holds to 15. Still, not a smile to be seen from the world number one. I think someone handed him a parking ticket before he came out as he seems positively angry with life right now. *Murray 4-4 Copil ""Copil's looking a million dollars, having a great day out,"" says BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller on 5 live sports extra. We see the finest point of the day as Andy Murray races to the net to meet a drop shot, makes it and then has to adjust as the ball comes back his way quickly. He defends well and then guides a gorgeous forehand up the line, passing Marius Copil. Copil stands 6ft 4in and couldn't get near it. We reach 40-30 to Copil and he crushes a serve to take this scrap to 4-4. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Manga helps Syria refugee children to dream,"""The situation in Syria is terrible - so terrible that I think it stops kids from dreaming. But it's their dreams that one day will make Syria good again,"" says Obada Kassoumah. ""I wish I could just give them a little bit of hope and make them believe that yes, they can have dreams."" Obada is a Syrian student in Tokyo who, by a mixture of chance and determination, has become the translator of Japanese manga comics into Arabic. And by another twist of fate, many of these Arab editions of football saga Captain Tsubasa have been donated to aid agencies and are being handed out to Syrian refugee children across Europe and the Middle East. For Obada, the project started as an unexpected translation job but has become something very personal and important. As a student of Japanese at university in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Obada received a scholarship to go to Japan for an exchange programme. That was in 2012, and the unrest in the country had already started. Obada says its his duty to help his country The situation got worse and worse and often he would be stopped by the police in the street suspecting that as a young man he might be a rebel fighter. When the situation got too dangerous, his parents decided to send him to live with his aunt in Jordan until he could leave for Tokyo. It was almost already too late - it was only through personal connections that he managed to cross the border. Refugee children learn the hard way Why is there a war in Syria? Syria war: Why now, what happened, what next? When his scholarship ended a year later, he was able to stay in Japan by enrolling as a regular student, and picked up a part-time job translating Captain Tsubasa. ""I myself watched Captain Tsubasa as a kid on TV and I loved it,"" says 26-year old Obada. ""It's a story about a kid having a dream to become a professional football player and working hard to make that dream come true. ""And that's something beautiful, that's something you should make these kids see."" Captain Tsubasa is a story of young boy fighting for his dream Initially, adapting the books for the Arab market was a mere business decision by a Japanese publisher. But they were then approached by Prof Masanori Naito, a Middle East specialist at Doshisha University in Kyoto. Prof Naito had spent several years in Damascus as a doctoral student in the 1980s and was looking for ways to help people affected by the conflict. He suggested the publisher could donate some of the manga books to refugee kids. ""The tragedy of Syria,"" he says, ""is a very serious concern to me. Back then I worked in villages that are now held by the rebel forces."" The original copyright holders in Japan, Shueisha publishers, were immediately ready to fund the donations, he said. Through co-operation with a number of international NGOs and Unicef, the books are now being distributed to young Syrian children in camps across Europe, Turkey and the Middle East who have escaped the terror and trauma of the civil war ravaging their home country. ""It is very far from the reality they know,"" Prof Naito explains. ""But for kids it is very important to be able to escape from reality for a while. And these books can also give them some hope for their own future."" Manga he says, could even be ""a tool of soft power against despair and radicalisation"". One of the places where Captain Tsubasa now provides a small escape from reality is a refugee home in Berlin where just last week, the copies were handed out by German-Turkish NGO Wefa to around 60 refugees. For these Syrian refugees in Berlin, the manga might provide a break from reality ""It was really something quite unique and we got a completely different reaction from normal,"" Ismet Misirlioglu of Wefa told the BBC from Berlin. ""What the children usually get are of course clothes and food and so they were really surprised when we suddenly had Japanese manga books - in their own language,"" he says, laughing. ""And you really could tell that from their eyes!"" Wefa in Berlin is planning to give out more of the books in the coming weeks. Back in Tokyo, Obada Kassoumah is still at work putting ever more adventures of Captain Tsubada into Arabic. He is currently translating volume seven out of 37. For many of the young kids war is the only reality they know For him, going back to Syria is not an option. Instead, he will stay in Japan for now and finish his degree - he knows Syria will need his skills in the future and he hopes he can have a bigger impact if he works building links between the two countries. ""I have friends who are fighting with the government and other friends who are fighting with the rebels,"" he says with a heavy voice. ""We are all one family - and now they wish death to each other, trying to kill each other."" But he hopes his translations will put a smile on the face of a Syrian child somewhere, trying to forget the terror of the past. ""As a Syrian it's like my duty to help - and through this thing I can help. ""This way the children can - at least for a bit - forget all the bad memories they have from the war.""

Macron Leaks: the anatomy of a hack,"It's still unclear who hacked incoming French President Emmanuel Macron's emails. But what does the way they then spread across the internet tell us about the way hackers and political movements work in tandem? It was a huge story that broke in the very final hours of coverage of France's presidential election campaign. But whoever dumped the leaked Macron emails online, did not by themselves turn them into a global topic of discussion.  That job was left to a network of political activists, aided by bots and automated accounts, and then ultimately signal boosted by the Twitter account of WikiLeaks. BBC Trending has spoken to the main activist who took the data dump from a fringe message board to the mainstream - and we've pieced together the story of how the hack came to light. Emmanuel Macron promised his cheering supporters he would fight to heal France's divisions as he was elected France's youngest president Just before 19:00 BST on Friday 5 May, a huge trove of files appeared on the anonymous document sharing sitePastebin,external, under the title ""EMLEAKS"". They had first been posted on various threads on an online library site called archive.org. However, as these threads have since been deleted, it's not possible to gauge what time this first happened. The timing is crucial. It was just hours before the start of the pre-election news blackout within France, and so media outlets acted with extreme caution. However, a network of online actors moved quickly to spread the leaks. Those who monitor internet politics know all about ""/pol/"". It's the anarchic political discussion forum on the anonymous messaging board 4chan, and although frequented by video gamers and internet culture obsessives, it's also a favoured hangout for a number of political activists associated with extreme right-wing groups. By 19:35 on 5 May, a link to the Pastebin files appeared on /pol/. The only detail about the identity of posters on the forum is a flag signifying the country of their computer's registered IP address. However, these are easy to fake. The /pol/ forum is crucial to the story, because rumours of a data dump seem to have been circulating there for several days previously. On Wednesday 3 May, two days before the email leaks, a user on separate thread on the board posted a different set of documents - ones which suggested Macron had a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. There was vigorous debate on the board about whether the documents had been doctored. Macron's political movement, En Marche!, said they were fake andfiled a lawsuitover the online rumours. Those first documents were posted from a user who had a Latvian IP address. But it's likely they were faking their location. ""This user is probably not from Latvia, and used a proxy to hide their identity from 4chan,"" says Jules Darmanin, a reporter at BuzzFeed News France. That account is backed up by a later post by the user themselves, who said ""I am not in Latvia"". The poster boasted of using proxy servers - a mechanism by which users can mask or fake their location online. ""Seven proxies"" is also a reference to an old 4chan joke about the ease of hiding online: The user who dumped the Macron emails on Friday had a US flag included in their post on 4chan. But of course, they too could have been using a proxy. The man who popularised the data dump says he was expecting it and was poised to spread it. Fourteen minutes after the Friday leaks on 4chan, at 19:49 BST, Jack Posobiec, a journalist who writes for far-right Canadian outlet Rebel Media, posted a link to the thread to Twitter using the hashtag #MacronLeaks. He told BBC Trending that the user with the Latvian IP address, responsible for the first anti-Macron leak, had alerted him to the upcoming dump. ""The same poster of the financial documents said to stay tuned tomorrow for a bigger story - so I pretty much spent the next 24 hours hitting refresh on the site,"" he told us. How did Posobiec's tweet go viral so fast? It was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting, says Ben Nimmo at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, that the message was being boosted with the help of bots. ""A bot is a Twitter profile which does not have a single human operator behind it,"" Nimmo tells BBC Trending, ""For its profile picture it will have an image of someone else or a random picture like a mountain or a bird. it will be run by a computer programme, by an algorithm, which will essentially retweet everything from listed accounts or to retweet any tweets that mention certain words. So it is fully automated."" BBC Trending documentary:How The âGreat Meme Warâ Moved To France Visit theTrending Facebook page,external There were some fully automated accounts spreading the tag - but it wasn't just bots. Thousands of real people shared the tweet too. Several accounts that specialise in political messaging, in this case linked to the US ""alt-right"" movement, shared Posobiec's tweet. It's notable that this happened mostlyoutsideof France. Initially those sharing these messages were mostly English speakers, rather than French speakers. The biggest initial boost, however, came not with bots or alt-right activists, but in the form of the official WikiLeaks Twitter account, which shared the 4chan link in a cautiously worded post. The leaks then began being shared by well-known National Front accounts, this time in French. Around 47,000 tweets were posted in three hours and the hashtag #MacronLeaks began to trend in France. By Saturday morning, it had reached the worldwide trend list. Crucially, this meant the story was spreading, despite reporting restrictions in force in France. By this time, an informal and global network of political activists was working hard to spread the story. Conversations in private, English-speaking, pro-Le Pen groups on the messaging app Discord were discussing how to amplify Posobiec's hashtag and use internet-friendly memes to further discredit Macron. As the reporting restrictions approached and the hashtag reached full volume, politicians from both camps scrambled to respond. Florian Philippot, the vice president of Marine Le Pen's National Front, responded to the story at 22:40 BST (23:40 French time)by tweeting,external""Will #MacronLeaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?"" Sylvain Fort, a campaign spokesman for Emmanuel Macron, responded by calling Philippot's tweet ""vile"". ""Vile"" Five minutes before the restrictions were due to start, Macron's team released a press release condemning the leak, saying that they had been subject to a ""massive and coordinated piracy action"". 4chan's owner Hiroyuki Nisimura tweeted, attempting to distance his site from the leaks. It still remains unclear who is behind the leaks. But the Macron campaign said that some of the sites spreading the leaks were ""linked to Russian interests."" Similar allegations have been made in the past. In March 2017, David Grout, from cybersecurity firm FireEye, told BBC Trending that there appeared to be ""interest from Russian hacking group APT 28, also known as Fancy Bear, in influencing the French election."" After the latest leak, a number of cybersecurity firms have alsoattributed it,externalto the APT 28 group. The group has previously been accused of attacks on the Democratic National Committee during the US election. More from BBC Trending:Conversations with hacker Guccifer 2.0 The Russian government has not commented on these allegations. In the pastit's denied political meddling,externalof this sort, saying they have ""never interfered"" with a foreign election. The leak, and similar online activity, will continue to have political ramifications. So far, however, it seems not to have swayed most voters. On Sunday, France chose Macron as their next president, with 66% of the vote.

How would a cap on energy prices work?,"The Conservatives have released more details about their proposed cap on energy prices. They say that 17 million people will benefit - by saving Â£100 a year on their bills. But many in the industry think it is a bad idea, as it will reduce competition in what is supposed to be a free market. And while the majority of householders may benefit, at least in the short term, millions of people who are currently on cheaper deals could end up paying more. So, if the Tories win the election, how would their plan work? Even though there was pressure on suppliers not to raise bills, five of the big six have gone ahead with some large price increases this year. Among the more eye-catching increases, EDF will raise electricity prices by more than 18%, and Npower put up electricity prices by 15% in March. While the suppliers blamed an increase in wholesale and environmental costs, the regulator, Ofgem, said such sharp hikes were not justified. The cap would be an upper limit on what suppliers could charge. It would follow the model introduced for the 16% of households that use pre-payment meters. Since April, these customers have had their bills capped, according to where they live in the country. Ofgem would probably base the precise level of the cap on the cheapest standard variable tariffs in each part of the UK, taking into account a range of additional factors, including the variable costs for transporting energy there. In other words, the cap would vary in different parts of the country and be re-set every six months. About 17 million households would be affected. They consist of customers who are on standard variable tariffs, which are typically much more expensive than fixed-rate deals. Ofgem and consumer groups have repeatedly tried to persuade more people to switch to the cheaper deals, but with limited success. As a result, 66% of consumers remain on standard variable tariffs. The remaining 8.5 million customers who have switched to cheaper deals would not be affected by the cap immediately. However, if the industry has its profitability constrained by a cap on variable tariffs, it is likely that the very cheapest deals would disappear. Yes. There will still be cheaper deals on offer, but the concern is that the savings - compared with the most expensive tariffs - will be smaller than they are now. As the chart above clearly shows, there is some evidence that this is already happening. Since the middle of last year, the gap between the cheapest tariffs and the most expensive have been narrowing. SSE, for example, has raised its cheapest dual fuel deal by 37% since October last year, according to the comparison site Uswitch. However, consumer groups believe fewer people would switch supplier if there was cap - as there might be less incentive to do so. Prices are likely to rise for some, especially those on fixed-rate deals. For the majority, prices will be capped. But should wholesale costs rise, it's worth remembering that Ofgem will raise the level of the cap, so it is possible that all prices will rise anyway. Equally well, the level of the cap could fall, cutting bills for those on svts. The truth is that suppliers will try to adjust prices to maintain their profit margins. According to Lazarus Research, the profit margins of five of the big six suppliers rose to 5.6% last year - the largest since 2009. In February, shadow chancellor John McDonnellpromisedthat Labour would also introduce a cap on energy charges. However at this stage, we do not know how this would work. In the 2015 election, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, promised to freeze prices for a 20-month period.

Will an English manager ever win the Premier League?,"Only eight different managers have won the Premier League - none of them are English To mark 25 years since the last English manager won the top flight,a BBC Radio 5 live specialasks if an English manager will ever win the Premier League. More English managers have got their hands on the World Cup than the Premier League title. The media can be more guilty than most of thinking that football began with the Premier League's inaugural campaign in 1992-93, but, in this instance, it was the end of an era. This season's 25th instalment also marks a quarter of a century since Howard Wilkinson became the last Englishman to guide a club to become champions of England. His Leeds side pipped Alex Ferguson's Manchester United to win the title only two years after being promoted from the second tier. Since then, glory has been tasted by two Scots, a Frenchman, a Portuguese, a Chilean and, when Antonio Conte completes the job with Chelsea, four Italians. English managers are getting further away, too. In the first edition of the Premier League, 16 of the 22 bosses were from England. Now there are six. Last season, the top flight ended with only four clubs managed by Englishmen, and that includes Everton's caretakers. In 1993, Englishman Ron Atkinson was second with Aston Villa. The only other native to reach the top two is Kevin Keegan, and that was in 1996 (Brian Kidd's two-game spell in charge of second-placed Manchester City in 2013 hardly counts). Englishmen gradually vacated the top three, then the top four, five, six and seven. Last season was the first Premier League without an English boss finishing in the top half. To what extent have English managers been affected by the foreign money, owners and players that characterise the top flight? Should homegrown bosses look abroad in order to grow their knowledge and reputation? Can a manager find a way from the lower leagues to the summit of the domestic game? Most importantly, will an English manager ever win the Premier League? Howard Wilkinson (bottom left) celebrates winning the title with Leeds United If the 2017 Premier League belongs to the world - backed by money from across Europe, Asia and America, managed by bosses from 11 different countries, populated by players from countless others and supported by fans across the globe - then the 1992-93 version was as English as fish and chips on a wet day in Southport, albeit with a few tourists from the rest of the UK and Ireland. Of the 22 managers that ended the season, the six that weren't English were made up of four Scots, a Welshman and an Irishman. Bar Ossie Ardiles' spell in charge of Spurs, the Premier League remained entirely managed by Britons and Irishmen until 1996. Arsene Wenger's arrival at Arsenal in that year has long been described as a Frenchman bringing a revolution to English football - new attitudes to diet, training, alcohol and professionalism. Wenger did the Double in 1998, 12 months after Chelsea lifted the FA Cup to make Ruud Gullit the first manager from outside of the UK and Ireland to win one of English football's major trophies. Their success piqued attention throughout the Premier League - former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry said Wenger caused clubs to ""rethink the approach"" -  but that was not the only reason that eyes began to glance abroad. An expanded Champions League - England got two places in 1997 and three in 1999 - was one of the factors that contributed to Liverpool recruiting Gerard Houllier to work alongside existing manager Roy Evans in 1998. ""We wanted to bring someone in from overseas, we wanted to add that European dimension. That was a very deliberate decision,"" said Parry. ""We felt the game was internationalising and that you couldn't just survive with an island league. ""You had to be aware of what was happening across borders and be able to compete with the top European clubs. We felt we needed that European experience to add to a successful base."" When the time came to replace Houllier in 2004, sights were set higher. To win the Premier League, the Reds felt they needed a manager with championship-winning experience. By that time, though, the only managers in the English top flight to have won it were Wenger and Ferguson, neither of whom were ever likely to be available. Liverpool's appointment of Rafael Benitez, a man who won two Spanish titles with Valencia, would be replicated by the arrivals of serial winners Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, Roberto Mancini at Manchester City and, much later, Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. ""We had a very specific criteria that narrowed the selection,"" added Parry. ""Rafa seemed like a perfect fit."" ""It was nothing to do with a sexy image, it was how he and the world-class Spanish players he brought in could add value to the holy grail of winning the Premier League."" The arrival of managers from outside of the UK and Ireland began as a trickle, but is now a steady and self-replenishing stream. At the end of 2004-05 there were five bosses from overseas, seven by 2009-10 and 10 by '13-14. Earlier this season, that number peaked at 13. If the touchline is increasingly multi-national, it is nothing compared to the boardroom. What began with Norwegian investment at Wimbledon and Mohamed Al Fayed taking his Fulham to the top flight was followed by a mid-2000s avalanche of cash brought by the likes of Roman Abramovich and the Glazer family. Now, there are only four Premier League clubs that are not influenced by foreign money. ""The biggest single reason why there are more foreign managers is foreign ownership,"" said former England defender Phil Neville. ""A lot of these owners attach themselves to a particular agent who has foreign managers on their books and that agent will promote their own. ""In Europe, Spain and Italy in particular, they like to give opportunities to their own managers, rather than bringing someone in from outside."" To illustrate that point, there are eight non-German bosses in the Bundesliga, seven non-Spanish coaches in La Liga, seven non-French managers in Ligue 1 and only four non-Italians in charge of Serie A clubs. Barring a Leicester-style shock (delivered by an Italian), Premier League winners for the foreseeable future are likely to come from six clubs - Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Therefore, for an English manager to lift the title, he would have to be in charge of one of those clubs. And therein lies a problem. Neither United or Arsenal have had an English boss since 1986. Chelsea's last full-time English manager was in 1996, while City haven't looked at home since the Abu Dhabi United group took over. Liverpool's only English stewardship since Roy Evans left in 1998 was Roy Hodgson's six months at Anfield. These clubs have had plenty of success with bosses from the rest of UK and Ireland - Ferguson, George Graham, Kenny Dalglish - and taken chances on others - David Moyes and Brendan Rodgers. However, last season was the first that overseas bosses in the top flight outnumbered Britons and Irishmen. Of that top six, Spurs have had the most recent success with an English manager, with Harry Redknapp the last Englishman to finish inside the Premier League's top four in 2012. ""It's about getting the opportunity, but the lads don't get the chance,""said Redknapp.""They work their socks off to get their coaching badges, but when the top jobs come up they are never mentioned."" Still, it can be strongly argued that a Premier League owner, chairman or chief executive wanting the best for their club is right to look abroad. Parry's explanation of Liverpool's recruitment of Houllier and Benitez is logical - it is only natural that a club signing the very best players from all over the world would want to do the same when it comes to the manager. Can, then, English managers be considered to be among the best on the planet? ""The perception is that foreign coaches are better educated and it's harder to qualify overseas than it has been in England,"" said Parry. ""That perception has been a reality. Going back a decade or two, when English football had no requirements to be a manager, it was a fact of life that in Germany, Spain and Italy you had to have the qualifications or you couldn't coach. We were the last bastion of complete freedom - we were behind the curve in that sense. ""That was probably a setback, but I'd love to feel that we were catching up."" Redknapp, though, feels English bosses are not lacking in quality, but are up against it when it comes to image. Sam Allardyce may have had his tongue planted in his cheek when he said that he would be managing a top-four club if his name was""Allardici"",,externalbut the point still stands. Is the designer suit and manicured stubble of a continental boss more appealing than the duvet coat of his English counterpart? ""It's sexy to have a foreign manager,"" said Redknapp. ""Owners think he was so and so, or he played for him, he managed this club when, in reality, they are no better than what our lads are. ""It's my honest belief that if you put Sean Dyche in charge of a top six club, they will still be in the top six. If you put any of the top six managers down at Burnley, they won't do any better than what he's done."" Harry Redknapp took Tottenham to fourth in 2012, but Chelsea's Champions League win denied Spurs a place in Europe's top club competition And so English bosses face multiple barriers to obtaining managerial jobs at the biggest clubs in the land. Foreign managers are more attractive to foreign owners, are perceived to have greater knowledge of the European game and have often built a reputation through winning trophies in the biggest leagues on the continent. An English manager could (and maybe even should) come to the conclusion that the best way to make himself appealing to the biggest clubs in the Premier League is to leave these shores to manage, learn and, hopefully, win in Europe. But if English bosses are maligned at home, why should they be taken seriously abroad? ""I don't think English coaches are held in that high esteem abroad,"" said Neville. ""There's a stigma attached to the coaches that leave England to work abroad and there are not many opportunities."" Neville speaks from the bruising experience of assisting brother Gary in an unsuccessful spell in charge of Valencia, but he insists he will see the benefits if he decides to return to coaching. ""There's a different world out there,"" added the former Manchester United and Everton man. ""I have learned so much in the past 18 months, not just on the training field, but about the culture and myself. ""Watching, coaching, little things that will hopefully stand me in good stead for the rest of my coaching career."" The reality, though, is that a new English manager who does not have the benefit of 50 international caps is likely to begin his career in League One or League Two - if he is lucky. And Redknapp makes a strong point when he says that the only way for an English manager to reach the top flight is to win promotion from the Championship. The last manager of any nationality to be appointed to a Premier League club from a job in the Football League (not unemployed, promoted from within or taken from abroad) was Chris Hughton, who moved from Birmingham to Norwich in the summer of 2012. More than 50 bosses have been recruited by top-flight clubs since then. ""We need to make sure we promote and market the CVs of up-and-coming coaches,"" said League Managers' Association chief executive Richard Bevan. ""We need to make sure that the agents who are advising foreign owners are aware of our members."" One option open to those ending the most stellar playing careers is to take a job coaching in an academy and work upwards. Steven Gerrard, the new Liverpool Under-18s coach, may have come to the conclusion that he is much more likely to get a chance with the Reds first team by being taken from the Anfield system, rather than gambling on success in the lower leagues. Steven Gerrard will manage the Liverpool Under-18s from next season ""If you asked Steven Gerrard to become MK Dons manager, he doesn't know anything about League One football, or even the Championship,"" said Neville. ""He never played in it and maybe never watched a game. He'd be setting himself up for a fall. ""When I finished my career I wanted to go into management. I was an assistant for a couple of years, but wanted my own job. I thought I'd struggle to get a club, so wondered what another path could be, maybe at a youth team or an under-18 team. ""You see it a lot in Spain - we have Curro Torres, a former Spain international, at Valencia. He's had four seasons as the B team manager and now he's ready to go out on his own."" But for those who do not have the option of an academy job at a mega-club, the route to the top must start much further down the pyramid. Historically that has been no barrier to success - World Cup winner Sir Alf Ramsey's first job was with third-tier Ipswich Town, the same level at which Redknapp inherited Bournemouth. Eddie Howe famously kept the same club in the Football League despite a 17-point deduction, while Allardyce began as player-manager of Irish club Limerick. For David Artell, a 36-year-old who has guided Crewe to League Two safety since being given his first managerial gig in January, Howe gives inspiration that the mountain can still be scaled. ""Why should I think there's anything stopping me from making it to the top?"" he said. ""Maybe that's naivety, but I truly believe I will go as far as my work ethic, desire and commitment will take me. ""I don't think that will stop at a chairman's door because a Portuguese fella or a French fella is better than me. ""You can say opportunity is limited because of all the foreign managers in the Premier League, but don't blame them. You have to look at yourself first. Excellence can't just be picked up, you have go and seek it."" His optimism, ambition and bullishness is laudable, but tempered by the bleak words of Redknapp. ""I don't see a top-six club appointing an Englishman for a long time to come,"" he said. ""It's a long way down the line before an Englishman wins the Premier League. The top six from this season will be the top six again next year. They all have foreign managers. ""Hopefully it will change, but not in the near future.""

MacronLeaks: the anatomy of a hack,"It's still unclear who hacked incoming French President Emmanuel Macron's emails. But what does the way they then spread across the internet tell us about the way hackers and political movements work in tandem? It was a huge story that broke in the very final hours of coverage of France's presidential election campaign. But whoever dumped the leaked Macron emails online, did not by themselves turn them into a global topic of discussion.  That job was left to a network of political activists, aided by bots and automated accounts, and then ultimately signal boosted by the Twitter account of WikiLeaks. BBC Trending has spoken to the main activist who took the data dump from a fringe message board to the mainstream - and we've pieced together the story of how the hack came to light. Emmanuel Macron promised his cheering supporters he would fight to heal France's divisions as he was elected France's youngest president Just before 19:00 BST on Friday 5 May, a huge trove of files appeared on the anonymous document sharing sitePastebin,external, under the title ""EMLEAKS"".

By 19:35 on 5 May, a link to the Pastebin files appeared on /pol/. The only detail about the identity of posters on the forum is a flag signifying the country of their computer's registered IP address. However, these are easy to fake. The /pol/ forum is crucial to the story, because rumours of a data dump seem to have been circulating there for several days previously. On Wednesday 3 May, two days before the email leaks, a user on separate thread on the board posted a different set of documents - ones which suggested Macron had a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. There was vigorous debate on the board about whether the documents had been doctored. Macron's political movement, En Marche!, said they were fake andfiled a lawsuitover the online rumours. Those first documents were posted from a user who had a Latvian IP address. But it's likely they were faking their location. ""This user is probably not from Latvia, and used a proxy to hide their identity from 4chan,"" says Jules Darmanin, a reporter at BuzzFeed News France. That account is backed up by a later post by the user themselves, who said ""I am not in Latvia"". The poster boasted of using proxy servers - a mechanism by which users can mask or fake their location online. ""Seven proxies"" is also a reference to an old 4chan joke about the ease of hiding online: The user who dumped the Macron emails on Friday had a US flag included in their post on 4chan. But of course, they too could have been using a proxy. The man who popularised the data dump says he was expecting it and was poised to spread it. Fourteen minutes after the Friday leaks on 4chan, at 19:49 BST, Jack Posobiec, a journalist who writes for far-right Canadian outlet Rebel Media, posted a link to the thread to Twitter using the hashtag #MacronLeaks. He told BBC Trending that the user with the Latvian IP address, responsible for the first anti-Macron leak, had alerted him to the upcoming dump. ""The same poster of the financial documents said to stay tuned tomorrow for a bigger story - so I pretty much spent the next 24 hours hitting refresh on the site,"" he told us. How did Posobiec's tweet go viral so fast? It was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting, says Ben Nimmo at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, that the message was being boosted with the help of bots. ""A bot is a Twitter profile which does not have a single human operator behind it,"" Nimmo tells BBC Trending, ""For its profile picture it will have an image of someone else or a random picture like a mountain or a bird. it will be run by a computer programme, by an algorithm, which will essentially retweet everything from listed accounts or to retweet any tweets that mention certain words.

Who spread Macron's hacked emails?,"It's still unclear who hacked incoming French President Emmanuel Macron's emails. But what does the way they then spread across the internet tell us about the way hackers and political movements work in tandem? It was a huge story that broke in the very final hours of coverage of France's presidential election campaign. But whoever dumped the leaked Macron emails online, did not by themselves turn them into a global topic of discussion.  That job was left to a network of political activists, aided by bots and automated accounts, and then ultimately signal boosted by the Twitter account of WikiLeaks. BBC Trending has spoken to the main activist who took the data dump from a fringe message board to the mainstream - and we've pieced together the story of how the hack came to light. Emmanuel Macron promised his cheering supporters he would fight to heal France's divisions as he was elected France's youngest president Just before 19:00 BST on Friday 5 May, a huge trove of files appeared on the anonymous document sharing sitePastebin,external, under the title ""EMLEAKS"". They had first been posted on various threads on an online library site called archive.org. However, as these threads have since been deleted, it's not possible to gauge what time this first happened. The timing is crucial. It was just hours before the start of the pre-election news blackout within France, and so media outlets acted with extreme caution. However, a network of online actors moved quickly to spread the leaks. Those who monitor internet politics know all about ""/pol/"". It's the anarchic political discussion forum on the anonymous messaging board 4chan, and although frequented by video gamers and internet culture obsessives, it's also a favoured hangout for a number of political activists associated with extreme right-wing groups. By 19:35 on 5 May, a link to the Pastebin files appeared on /pol/. The only detail about the identity of posters on the forum is a flag signifying the country of their computer's registered IP address. However, these are easy to fake. The /pol/ forum is crucial to the story, because rumours of a data dump seem to have been circulating there for several days previously. On Wednesday 3 May, two days before the email leaks, a user on separate thread on the board posted a different set of documents - ones which suggested Macron had a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. There was vigorous debate on the board about whether the documents had been doctored. Macron's political movement, En Marche!, said they were fake andfiled a lawsuitover the online rumours. Those first documents were posted from a user who had a Latvian IP address. But it's likely they were faking their location. ""This user is probably not from Latvia, and used a proxy to hide their identity from 4chan,"" says Jules Darmanin, a reporter at BuzzFeed News France. That account is backed up by a later post by the user themselves, who said ""I am not in Latvia"". The poster boasted of using proxy servers - a mechanism by which users can mask or fake their location online. ""Seven proxies"" is also a reference to an old 4chan joke about the ease of hiding online: The user who dumped the Macron emails on Friday had a US flag included in their post on 4chan. But of course, they too could have been using a proxy. The man who popularised the data dump says he was expecting it and was poised to spread it. Fourteen minutes after the Friday leaks on 4chan, at 19:49 BST, Jack Posobiec, a journalist who writes for far-right Canadian outlet Rebel Media, posted a link to the thread to Twitter using the hashtag #MacronLeaks. He told BBC Trending that the user with the Latvian IP address, responsible for the first anti-Macron leak, had alerted him to the upcoming dump. ""The same poster of the financial documents said to stay tuned tomorrow for a bigger story - so I pretty much spent the next 24 hours hitting refresh on the site,"" he told us. How did Posobiec's tweet go viral so fast? It was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting, says Ben Nimmo at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, that the message was being boosted with the help of bots. ""A bot is a Twitter profile which does not have a single human operator behind it,"" Nimmo tells BBC Trending, ""For its profile picture it will have an image of someone else or a random picture like a mountain or a bird. it will be run by a computer programme, by an algorithm, which will essentially retweet everything from listed accounts or to retweet any tweets that mention certain words. So it is fully automated.""

Footage has also emerged of shadow chancellor John McDonnellÂ saying that Labour would scrap tuition fees as part of its national
education service. Speaking at a rally in Mansfield in April, Mr McDonnellÂ said:Â ""We believe - we've always believed as a movement - that education is a gift from one generation to another, it's not a commodity to be bought and sold. So we want to introduce, just as the Attlee government with Nye Bevan introduced the National Health Service, we want to introduce a national  education service, free at the point of need throughout life. That means ending the cuts in the schools at primary and second level, that means free childcare, it means free skills training whenever you need it  throughout life. And yes, it means scrapping tuition fees once and for all, so we don't burden our kids with debt in the future.""  The ECJ ruling could have implications for those affected by the UK's decision to leave the EU. The Scottish Greens say they will have a ""targeted"" campaign, with the focus on getting Patrick Harvie elected. Theresa May has told an audience at a factory
at Mansfield that a Conservative government after the election would not scrap
university tuition fees in England. Pressed over the issue
following reports that Labour may be planning to get rid of tuition fees, Mrs May said
the question for Labour was how they would pay for that pledge, warning that it
would ""wreck the economy"". She added: ""If you
wreck the economy you aren't able to support students, you aren't able to
support public services, you see businesses going under, you see jobs going.""  The Labour leader is in York Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking earlier, Jeremy Corbyn said this rate would still be lower than the 28% rate in 2010. However, that was the main rate of corporation tax in 2010, with the rate for small businesses set at 21%.The rate for both now currently stands at 19%,,externalwhile a 20% rate applies to UK oil extraction.

How much do the political parties know about you?,"From the campaign leaflet pushed through your letterbox, to the party message on social media, election material is increasingly targeted at individual voters. So, just how much do political parties know about you? You can expect to receive a lot of communications from political parties in the coming weeks, as they prepare for June's election. It's the same for everyone on your street, a place full of different characters - some with children, some younger, some older. There is likely to be just as much political difference among your neighbours, from the loyal party supporters to those changing their vote at each election. In other words, whether your constituency is described as a ""middle class suburban seat"", a ""traditional working class community"", or a ""Remain voting area"", there are still significant differences between individual voters. The election leaflets you receive may depend on what the parties know about you This matters a great deal to the parties and it's highly likely that friends and neighbours will receive very different campaign messages from the parties - even different ones from the same party. For several elections now, parties have been making use of many different sources of data to target information at voters. This use of big data has become very important to them for three key reasons. First, we voters have changed quite a bit. In fact, we've been changing quite a bit for the last 40 years. Traditional allegiances between voters and parties have declined rapidly and while there are still strong party loyalists, there are far fewer than there used to be. This means more voters are unsure as to how they'll cast their vote - a big opportunity for the parties, because winning the backing of these voters means they will not just be relying on their core support. As a consequence, parties have been targeting seats much more intently and with greater precision. The second reason is that while membership of many political parties has risen in recent years, they have generally had fewer volunteers that they can call on come election time. This means that technological developments such as using data to target voters have provided a useful alternative. Thirdly, parties have become more efficient. There is little point in seeking to convert voters who are committed to another party, or indeed strong supporters already on your side. Instead, parties are increasingly focused on the ""waverers"" and ""undecideds"" - the people whose votes are going to win elections. To do this, the parties go to great lengths to combine a whole range of data sources. First, they use their own canvass returns - information about voting intentions - collected on the doorstep and the telephone over the course of a few years. The most recent information collected from voters is now uploaded in real time. This tells the parties if the would-be voter is a committed supporter, ""waverer"" or ""undecided"". They then combine this with market research data, which tells them more about the individual - demographic characteristics such as age, sex, education level, income and family size. This is the information which has led parties to create key target groups at past elections - so-called ""Essex Man"" or ""school gate mums"", for example. In turn, these are then combined with further information the parties have gathered on the doorstep, from telephone calls and social media engagement. Tailored leaflets and other messages reflecting the voter's interests and concerns can soon follow. So, while a family with young children might receive a leaflet about what has been done for primary schools in the area, their retired neighbour may receive a different circular about what is being done to help pensioners. Facebook is increasingly important, offering the possibility of sending targeted messages to certain groups of voters and different messages to those with other concerns. Facebook - the secret election weapon Facebook publishes fake news ads BBC Election Bot So does it make any difference? The short answer is yes. This use of big data to target key voters and decide where to focus resources invariably leads to stronger electoral performances. This was well illustrated at the last general election, where all three of the main parties improved their performance as a result of their targeting strategies. All three parties ran their most intensive campaigns in the seats that mattered most. Indeed, had Labour and the Liberal Democrats not targeted voters so well,their resultswould have been even worse. Yet for all that, big data alone will not win elections. Over the last six elections, the one approach that works better than all others when persuading voters is face-to-face contact. Face-to-face contact - still the best way to connect with voters So, while the use of big data matters - and makes election messages more personal - it plays a supporting role to human contact, rather than replacing it. All of which makes this election a particularly interesting one. Campaign techniques which focus on big data usually begin long before polling day - maybe six or nine months before. But this snap election doesn't afford that luxury and there is a danger in bombarding voters with the same volume of communications in four weeks. So ironically, this election may prove to be more traditional - still informed by big data, but with a stronger focus on the human touch.

Would cash prizes make you more likely to vote?,"As the UK heads towards its third big national vote in three years, there are fears that people won't bother turning out - with apathy particularly strong amongthe young. It's a problem across Western democracies.  In last week's French presidential race, turn-outfell,external, and in the US last year, only slightly more than half of people eligible to vote cast a ballot for a presidential candidate. In Britain, turn-out has hovered at around 65% for the last two general elections, way down on figures from the previous century. To combat the problem, several US cities are experimenting with a controversial idea: offering cash prizes to the electorate, in a bid to lure them out to vote. In these schemes, people casting votes are added to a lottery, with big money prizes for a lucky few. Bridget Conroy Varnis, a 52-year-old voter from Philadelphia, picked up a cheque for $10,000 after voting in a local election. ""I was shaking, nervous, surprised, and I felt blessed too,"" she told us. She was presented with the award right there at the polling station. Camera bulbs flashed as a huge dummy cheque was handed over. Bridget Conroy Varnis after winning at the polling station Ray La Raja is a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, and one of the academics behind the idea. He says that as well as boosting turn-out, voter lotteries can help counter traditional problems with the system. The older, richer, whiter and more highly educated you are, the more likely you are to vote in the US, he explains. ""If you go to a system in which you rely heavily on individual resources such as education, money, proximity to voting booth, you're going to get systematic bias in who turns out."" A similar lottery - the first of its kind - was run in Los Angeles by Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Education Registration project. He was also troubled by the pattern that Ray La Raja highlights, and he wanted to encourage more people from Latino communities to vote. ""We called it 'Voteria' to rhyme with 'Loteria' because that's a big deal in the Mexican and Central American community here. We wanted the branding to catch on,"" he explains. The lucky winner got $25,000. The vote in question was for a local school board trustee, and indeed turn-out increased from 9% to 10%. The change wasn't dramatic, but as Gonzalez points out, the campaign had a minimal marketing campaign. An exit poll found that among voters who had heard of the scheme, around half said it was their reason for coming out to vote. In Britain,another trial was conducted,externalto see if a lottery could boost the number of people registered to vote - again with encouraging results. However, while lotteries have shown signs they can boost both turn-out and registration, many have questioned the ethics of using cash incentives to persuade people to vote. World Hacks is a new BBC team that aims to report on solutions being tried out, rather than focussing only on global problems. We meet the people fixing the world. Get the World Hacks podcast Check out our Facebook page,external Handing out money in return for voting is actually illegal in most US states, thanks to anti-bribery laws designed to prevent powerful interests from buying up votes. Voting lotteries appear to be a loophole, because they award random prizes rather than direct payments to each voter. But ultimately, it is still a legal grey area that needs to be tested state by state, and nation by nation. There are also suggestions that offering financial incentives can actually reduce participation in certain activities. In an experiment with blood donors, for example, offering payment in exchange for blood actually prompted some regular donors to stop taking part. Cash payments had turned what the donors saw as a civic duty into a financial transaction, which became far less appealing. And on the other hand you might encounter the opposite problem: attracting people who hadn't been voters before, but who didn't take the process of selection seriously. Barry Schwartz, a psychologist at Swarthmore College in the US, is sceptical about offering prizes for voting. There are no incentives clever enough to replace the basic idea of doing the right thing, he says. ""If you had 80% turnout, and half the people didn't know what they were voting for, you wouldn't think the problem had gone away. You've got the same problem,"" Schwartz argues. For Antonio Gonzalez, the president of the Southwest Voter Education Registration project, the process isn't quite so simple. Their big idea is that encouraging people to vote - even by offering material incentives - will encourage them to become more clued up about politics in the long term. And the alternative is the system we have now, where turnout is skewed in favour of people who are already more privileged members of society. A sort of ""dictatorship of the informed"", as Gonzalez puts it. Clearly, the idea is a controversial one. Voter lotteries have some way to go before being accepted as a practical, and ethical, solution to the problem of low voter turnout. But after their initial success, two more voter lotteries will take place in Philadelphia this year. And if - as is widely expected - huge swathes of young people fail to head to the polling booth at the UK's general election on 8 June, it could be an idea that begins to attract more attention.

How will history remember the 2015-17 Parliament?,"This video can not be played Prime Minister David Cameron says he will stand down In the tradition of the Good Parliament, the Long Parliament, the Addled Parliament and the Cavalier Parliament, will history remember the short, but eventful parliament of 2015-17? Probably as the Brexit Parliamentâ¦ its central event was the EU Referendum and its spectacular fallout - and there can be few moments in history when the political scene has transformed so convulsively and completely. Rewind, for a moment, to 9 May, 2015. David Cameron and George Osborne were all-conquering - they had sloughed off the constraints of coalition and headed the first Conservative majority government to take office since 1992. Labour and the Lib Dems were in disarray and faced leadership contests, and only the new phalanx of SNP MPs - now the third party in the Commons - looked confident and organised. What you need to know about the general election How much do political parties know about you? Why wasn't 2015 the 'Brexit election'? With a majority of just 12, the government had to tread carefully - especially on euro issues. There was no way the prime minister could resile from his manifesto commitment to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership and bring home new controls on immigration. But right from the start, Tory strategists knew that the party faced what might be a devastating civil war between its pro-EU and pro-Brexit wings. This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to ""build a better Britain"" This video can not be played Highlights of the arguments and campaigning ahead of the UK voting in the EU referendum The referendum result forced David Cameron to resign, and a brief, but vicious smack down followed. Several cabinet ministers who had looked set to remain in office for a decade were suddenly out on their ears. There was a little sniping from the dispossessed, but the Conservatives displayed their usual instinct for unity - an instinct summed up by the veteran pro-Remain former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, who told the Commons on 1 February: ""As a confirmed remainer and supporter of the EU, I do not want the next generation of Conservative MPs to have the blight of this argument dogging them, their associations, their members and their voters in the way it has dogged us. It has soured friendships, deepened bitterness and damaged relationships - I swore at a mate in the Tea Room, and I am sorry."" Theresa May's new government was forced by a court action to bring in a bill to begin the process of leaving the EU - the 133-word European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. It was passed, clean and un-amended by the Commons, but amended twice by the Lords, before they backed down when the Commons refused to accept the changes they had made. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn won the contest in the first round of voting, with 251,417 votes This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn after 2016 contest: Let's wipe that slate clean, from today, and get on with the work we have got to do as a party together For all the sound and fury, and baleful warnings that pro-Remain peers would ""block Brexit"" the government got the result it wanted on time and with no serious inconvenience along the way. Labour's internal troubles were obvious from the moment Jeremy Corbyn took officeâ¦. It was not just the doomed Owen Smith leadership challenge that laid bare the internal rivalries of the Labour right while actually strengthening the leader's hand. There were also the silent ranks of MPs behind him at PMQs, the constant churn through the shadow cabinet and front bench, the preference of many MPs for jobs on the committee corridor or big-city mayoralties - or even outside politics altogether. This video can not be played Angus Robertson asks the prime minister if he is ""running away"" from a previous pledge to take part in a TV debate There were splits on everything from economic policy to Brexit, but perhaps the most dramatic manifestation of all this came in the December 2015 Syria vote, when David Cameron sought Commons approval to join the military action against ISIS in Syria, which Jeremy Corbyn opposed, but his shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn (in what was probably THE speech of the Parliament) supported. The SNP meanwhile were enjoying their new status as the third party in the Commons - gleefully turfing the Lib Dems out of the offices they had enjoyed for decades, and making good use of their new prominence in debates and question times - with their Westminster leader, Angus Robertson emerging as the classiest performer at PMQs. In the 2015 Parliament, the SNP seemed to defy the normal laws of politics, running a focused, disciplined and very smart political operation, closely coordinated with their Holyrood leadership. The Westminster press corps never really penetrated their shell;  there was no hint of internal dissent or factional rivalry as they relentlessly used their new prominence to paint Westminster as corrupt and antiquated, and to push to make the case for independence at every opportunity, while taking pot-shots at Labour at every opportunity. Their natural allies, Plaid Cymru, did much the same, and were probably boosted by association. The Lib Dems began the Parliament decimated and demoralised - just barely visible on good days and missing from debates a lot of the time. Like generations of his predecessors, their new leader, Tim Farron, has had a rough ride in the Commons, but Brexit seems to have revived them somewhat, with Nick Clegg in particular shaking off his post-election melancholy. This video can not be played Douglas Carswell gets a one word answer when he asks David Cameron about his future. This video can not be played David Cameron is asked about the past progressive tense and modal verbs by Caroline Lucas. Perched uneasily next to them in the Commons benches were the Northern Ireland DUP, whose main role in the last Parliament was as the go-to source of extra votes when the government's narrow majority was under threat. They have enjoyed huge leverage since 2010, and have played their hand well. Then we had the one-person parties - Douglas Carswell (sometime of UKIP) and the Greens' Caroline Lucas. Being the only Commons voice for a party with national pretentions is a tough task. Ms Lucas has been an effective performer, and has managed to use the House as a platform to make her presence - and her party's - felt. She has been helped by Commons rules which require cross-party support for backbench debates, making her a sought-after ally for all kinds of campaigns. Mr Carswell has been more pre-occupied with the internal politics of his adopted party. How antiseptic that statement seems, set against the brutal party infighting which marked his sojourn in UKIP. But (see previous blogpost) he can leave Westminster having secured his ultimate political aim, and able to at least claim that his faction-fighting inside UKIP made the referendum victory possible. Of course the parties are just one dimension of Westminster life. The two years of the 2015-17 Parliament also saw an impressive flowering of the select committees, where cross-party working is the order of the day. At times they have exerted real leverage over governments - there was the health committee's push for a sugary drinks tax to tackle obesity, under the leadership of Dr Sarah Wollaston. There was the astounding sight of Prime Minister David Cameron having to publicly court the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Crispin Blunt, when he sought Commons approval to join the military action against ISIS in Syria. And there was a new trend to joint working, with several committees joining forces to address a series of issues which crossed departmental boundaries. There were joint inquiries into Supported Housing (Work and Pensions and Communities and Local Government); Mental Health in Schools (Education and Health); Improving Air Quality (Environment Food and Rural Affairs, Environmental Audit Committee, Health, and Transport Committees); Competitiveness (Education and Business), and, most spectacularly, there was the joint Work and Pensions and Business inquiry into the collapse of BHS. There was also cooperation between select committee chairs to push causes on which they agreed, most notably the close coordination between Sarah Wollaston, Clive Betts of the Communities and Local Government Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee chair, Meg Hillier, over funding for the NHS and social care. This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow announces that clerks in the House of Commons will no longer have to wear wigs This video can not be played The Speaker told the House of Commons that MPs should follow the example of Ken Clarke This video can not be played John Bercow says the Lib Dem leader may be ""irritating"" to some Conservative backbenchers The other continuing trend of the 2015 Parliament was more urgent questions and more emergency debates, as Speaker Bercow continued to facilitate MPs in jerking the chain of ministers. In this respect the Commons intakes of 2010 and 2015 hardly know they're born. The days when urgent questions were rarer than panda cubs, and emergency debates were merely a theoretical possibility, are long gone. A pro-active speaker has utterly changed the climate of the Commons, speeding up question times, so more voices are heard, and paying less regard to the rigid seniority system, which set the pecking order in debates. But John Bercow's term in the chair is now certainly closer to its end than its beginning. This has also been a more visibly emotional parliament. There was an early moment of tragedy when the former Lib Dem Leader Charles Kennedy - who lost his seat at the election - died suddenly at his home, Then came the brutal murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox, and the terror attack of March 2017. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tribute to Jo Cox: 'We have lost one of our best' Each of these events led to emotional occasions in the Commons, and produced a sense of a political community rallying round.  And beyond those moments, this was a Parliament where MPs talked openly about their experiences of stillbirth and infant death, depression, alcoholism and the suicide of a relative. Some of these speeches - from Antoinette Sandbach and Vicky Foxcroft, for example - had a shattering impact on the MPs in the chamber and the wider public. One of the biggest changes has been the growing audience for Parliament. A few centuries ago, it was illegal to report debates in the Commons - now there is a substantial and growing audience forBBC ParliamentandWestminster's own online service,externalwhich allows the public to watch not just the main chamber but committee and Westminster Hall proceedings, too. The 21st century audience does not have to rely on next-day reports of debates, and committee hearings, it can watch and comment in real time, replay and analyse every word and facial expression and rebroadcast its favourite moments. Some MPs are becoming adept at creating viral social media moments  - as when the SNP contingent began to hum the EU anthem ""Ode to Joy"" during the final votes on the bill to trigger Article 50, attracting a rebuke from deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle. If I have one prediction for the next parliament, it is that more MPs will realise that there is now a very big spectators' gallery out there - and more and more of them will start to play to it.

Reality Check: Could UKIP's immigration policy work?,"The claim:UKIP says it will reduce net migration into the UK to zero by introducing an ""Australian-style points-based system"". Reality Check verdict:UKIP has set itself a very ambitious target - but, depending on the strictness of the criteria, it could be achieved. Australia's system has led to a 3% net increase in the past year. The UKIP leader, Paul Nuttall, says his party would bring net migration down to zero. This would mean the number of people arriving into the country would be about the same as the number leaving. Mr Nuttall says one way of achieving this would be to introduce an Australian-style points-based system. Australia's points system was introduced in 1989. Applicants score points for youth, qualifications, and English-speaking ability if applying for a skilled job. Unless they are being sponsored by an employer, they must also be applying to work in one of the trades or professions set out in a list by the Australian government. And the numbers for each of these trades and professions are capped. Last year, Australia offered up to190,000 permanent migration places,externalandnet migration reached 182,165, an increase of 3% on the previous year,external. The UK already has a points system for non-EU migrants seeking skilled employment in the UK. It was introduced by the Labour Party, under Gordon Brown, back in 2008 and caps the total number on an annual basis at 20,700. There are other routes for coming to the UK that are not subject to an annual cap, such as students arriving to study and migrants who move for family reasons. Under UKIP's plans, unskilled and low-skilled labour would be banned for five years while skilled workers and students would need visas based on the points system. UKIP want 'one in, one out' migration Presently, EU migrants are allowed to work in the UK under the principle of freedom of movement. But once the UK leaves the EU and if free movement no longer applies, then its citizens would be subjected to the same rules as non-EU migrants. Depending on the strictness of the criteria, there is no reason in theory why the numbers could not fall to the levels UKIP wants. UKIP says it wants to implement its policy over the next five years, which would represent a very ambitious target given the current numbers. In thelast set of official statistics,external, produced by the Office of National Statistics, immigration was estimated to be 596,000 in the year up to September 2016 - made up of 268,000 EU citizens, 257,000 non-EU citizens and 71,000 British citizens. Some 323,000 people were thought to have left the UK, meaning that annual net migration stands at 273,000.
