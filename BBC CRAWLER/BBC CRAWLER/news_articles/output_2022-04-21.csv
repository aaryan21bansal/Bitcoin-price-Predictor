Bus drivers' strike deferred over pay offer,"Bus drivers will now be balloted on the new offer Members of the Unite and GMB bus driver trade unions have deferred industrial action over a pay offer from Translink. Unions said negotiations had led to a revised pay offer from employers and bus drivers will now be balloted on the new offer. But both unions have said they would not recommend the offer to members. Had the strike gone ahead, all Ulsterbus and Metro services would have been withdrawn for one week from 25 April. A Translink spokeswoman said the deferral was a ""positive step"". Unite's deputy regional secretary said it had put the offer to its members for consideration but would not recommend it. Davy Thompson told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that ""members have a decision to make based on their circumstances and not every member is in the same circumstance"". ""For some people, the deal that was there previously, they accepted it. They believed it suited their needs. But for the majority of others, they feel it didn't."" The strike action was due to take place as schools returned from Easter holidays Peter Macklin from GMB also confirmed that they would would not be making a recommendation of the offer. ""We don't believe it goes far enough but we are prepared to put it out to our memberships to let them decide, we are a member-led organisation so I think it's fair to let them have their say,"" he said. ""They have worked through the pandemic, they feel like they have been undervalued, unrecognised. ""They see millions being spent on new buses, the new hub and yet nothing being spent or very little being spent on those that are required to service them."" A Translink spokeswoman said: ""We have an agreement to defer the planned strike action commencing Monday, 25th April while the bus drivers are balloted on a revised pay offer following further negotiations. ""We welcome this positive step and thank the Unions for their commitment to working together in an effort to build back public transport as a sustainable and better future for all."" Unions had been calling for a 6% pay rise for bus workers across the region andhad claimed that Translink bosses refused to budge from their offer of 3%. Union 'wouldn't exempt special schools' from strike NI bus drivers to take strike action Last week, Translink said the company had made a pay offer of 3% ""plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a 7% increase in weekend and overtime rates along with two extra days holiday"". The unions have said about 85% of their members who voted supported taking the action.

Florida strips Disney of special status,"Florida lawmakers have voted to strip Walt Disney of its special self-governing status amid a political clash between the company and the governor. The status gave Disney powers to levy tax, build roads and control utilities on the lands of its theme park. The entertainment conglomerate did not respond to a request for comment. The move is widely seen as retribution for Disney's opposition to a bill that bars many primary-school classrooms from discussing sexual orientation. On Thursday, at the urging of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, the state House passed a bill that would rid the company of its near-total power over the special district where its theme park is based. It had already passed the Senate. Known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, it was created in a 1967 deal between the state and the Walt Disney Company. Governor DeSantis had previously made it clear he will sign the measure into law. Following the vote, Disney's special district will be dissolved on 1 June, 2023. Its special status had effectively allowed the company to operate as its own municipal government, with its own board of supervisors and fire department, and meant Disney could even build its own airport, or nuclear power plant if desired. It had given the entertainment giant freedom from almost all bureaucratic intervention for half a century and is thought to have saved it from tens of millions of dollars in taxes and fees. And it is part of why Disney chose to build its theme parks in Florida, where it has become the state's largest private employer, with some 80,000 jobs. But Disney's special relationship with the state of Florida came under threat over its response to a gender and sexuality education bill signed by Mr DeSantis last month. Formally called the Parental Rights in Education Law, it has been dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" law by critics. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics ""when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students"". The legislation also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Opponents say the law will isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters say it protects children from age-inappropriate content. Disney initially stayed tight-lipped on the bill, but reversed course amid pressure from employees to oppose the policy. After it became law, Disney promised to push for its repeal and fight similar bills across the US. In response, Mr DeSantis said the company, which has made Florida its home, had ""crossed the line"". Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in the US Congress said they would oppose renewing the company's copyright on Mickey Mouse in 2024 because of Disney's ""political and sexual agenda"". Analysis By Mat Morrison The political skies are cloudy in the Sunshine State, and it could be the smoke from the culture wars below. Governor Ron DeSantis is leading a charge, with a general's eagerness for combat and a politician's eye for opportunity. Florida-based Disney is only the latest target in his crosshairs, and the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill just one of a string of conservative laws with Tallahassee origins grabbing national headlines. There's also been the banning of maths textbooks that the state deemed inappropriate for the classroom. That came after a bill - supported by Mr DeSantis - that makes it easier for parents to challenge books and instructional materials they disapprove of. Supporters say it gives parents a great say in their children's education. Opponents say it's simply censorship. The governor has also weighed in on the battle over Twitter, vowing to take on the company's board of directors over their tussle with Elon Musk. According to Bloomberg, Florida's state pension fund holds roughly a million shares, which may help explain Mr DeSantis's interest. And to top it off, he recently signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exemptions for rape or incest. The flurry of bills aimed at exciting conservative voters boils down to one important date: 5 November, 2024 - the next US presidential election day. Read Mat's full analysis here.

Earl and Countess of Wessex postpone Grenada trip,"The Earl and Countess of Wessex leave for their seven-day trip on Friday The Grenada leg of the Earl and the Countess of Wessex's Caribbean tour has been postponed, a day before their week-long trip begins. The decision was made after talks with the island's government and governor general, Buckingham Palace said. Prince Edward and Sophie will still visit other islands on the tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were criticised for some parts of their recent Caribbean tour. A Buckingham Palace source said discussions were held with host nations to ensure the itinerary would meet the aims of the tour, which are to celebrate the islands and mark the Queen's 70-year reign. Within those discussions, Grenada - on the advice of Dame Cecile La Grenade, its governor general and the Queen's representative in the country - suggested a postponement. No further detail has yet been given about the reason for the delay. Prince Edward and Sophie hope to visit the island at a later date, the palace said. Their tour of three Caribbean nations - St Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda - will begin on Friday. The plan must have seemed straightforward - send members of the Queen's family to her Realms (the countries where she is Head of State) to celebrate their culture and futures in this, her Platinum year. Yes - Princess Anne had a controversy-free trip to Australia and Papua New Guinea earlier this month and next month Prince Charles will travel to Canada. But the negative headlines which buffeted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Caribbean tour last month will have concentrated Palace minds. Although no reason has been given for the postponement of the Earl and Countess of Wessex's trip to Grenada, the key word in the brief statement announcing the change of plan must be ""consultation"". In Belize, the protest that derailed the Cambridges' trip on its very first day was reportedly because local people felt they had not been consulted on the plans for the visit. Last year, Barbados removed the Queen as its head of state. Last month, welcoming Catherine and William to his country, the Jamaican prime minister made clear his wish to do the same. Politicians in Grenada have called for a referendum on whether to become a republic. The country's reparations committee - which is calling for compensation from Britain as a result of the slave trade - says it requested an audience with the royal couple. So maybe the reason Grenada was dropped is that it was felt a visit may be deemed too political and a risk from a PR perspective. As the Cambridges found out, tours that once may have provided picturesque photo opportunities can now be viewed as a reminder of darker times involving colonialism and slavery. The palace will be hoping enough ""consultation"" has been done to ensure the Earl and Countess receive a warm welcome on the islands that remain on the itinerary. In March, part ofPrince William and Catherine's Caribbean tourwas axed after opposition from locals. The pair had been due to visit a cacao farm in the foothills of the Maya Mountains but it was removed from the couple's schedule following reports of a protest opposing the royal trip. Other moments on their tourwere criticised as public relations missteps- for example a Land Rover trip that was described as having a colonial appearance, and the greeting of local children through a wire fence. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the Caribbean for their first overseas trip since the start of the pandemic Grenada gained independence from the UK in 1974 when Eric Gairy became the island's first prime minister. The National Democratic Congress, a liberal opposition party, has previously said it wouldput the question of whether the Queen should be head of state to a referendum,external. It also congratulated the prime minister of Barbados for having taken this step ahead ofthe island becoming a republic last year. Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? The press secretary for the prime minister's office in Grenada said there was amutual agreement between the parties to postpone the visit,external. During the upcoming tour, Prince Edward will conduct an investiture on behalf of the Queen and the couple will attend a service to mark the Platinum Jubilee. The couple are due to meet local communities, Commonwealth Games athletes, craftspeople and women in leadership roles during their trip.

Johnson and Indian PM to discuss defence and trade,"Boris Johnson met Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Delhi for the first time since last autumn Boris Johnson says India has agreed a ""massive push"" towards striking a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK. After meeting his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Delhi, the PM vowed to get an agreement ""done"" by Diwali in late October. Ahead of fresh negotiations next week, he said a deal could take UK-India trade to ""a whole new level"". Mr Johnson has previously signalled his target covers reaching an agreement in principle, not signing a full deal. Experts say any agreement with India this year is likely to be a precursor to a full agreement, with talks still at a relatively early stage. And Mr Johnson warned there would be ""tough asks"" from both sides. Whisky and visas could be in UK-India trade deal PM announces India deals as party debate continues Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine The meeting between the two leaders in India's capital came on the final day of Mr Johnson's two-day trip to the country, which has been delayed by Covid. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Johnson said India was ""an incredible rising power in Asia"" and deepening trade was a priority. In a signal that he could be flexible over an Indian demand for looser immigration rules for its nationals as part of a deal, Mr Johnson said Indian skills could help sectors such as IT. ""I'm not going to be dogmatic in refusing people with skill and talent in coming to the UK,"" he added. ""All I would say is we need to control it"". Britain is buying much more from India than it sells to India. That's because India tends to put up high trade barriers such as taxes on UK exports, known as tariffs. Foreign cars attract tariffs of up to 100%, for example. As a result, the UK currently sells less to India, with its vast population, than it does to Belgium. And it's getting worse: last year, the UK sold Â£4.7bn worth of goods to India and bought Â£8.4bn - that's the biggest gap between the UK and India's exports and imports that there's ever been. If you include services, the gap is even bigger. The top five goods imported from India were clothing, medicine, fabrics, industrial machinery and electrical goods, with metals and power generators going in the other direction. Read more Ahead of the meeting, Downing Street announced the UK planned to streamline its licensing rules for exporting military hardware to India. No 10 said the UK would support India to construct fighter jets, in an attempt to reduce the volume of weapons bought from Russia. There was a commitment to increase research into lowering the cost of ""green"" hydrogen power - part of the UK'srenewable energy plans. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Gujarat Biotechnology University on Thursday Mr Johnson also said he had raised the issue of India's relations with Russia during his meeting with Mr Modi. Along with other Western countries, the UK has been trying to persuade India to drop its neutral stance and join in condemning Moscow, which is its biggest arms supplier. Earlier this month, Indiacondemned killingsin the Ukrainian town of Bucha - the strongest statement it has made since Russia's invasion. But it stopped short of blaming Russia for the violence, and has not criticised Russia directly since its invasion in February. Mr Johnson said India had been ""very strong"" in its condemnation of the Bucha killings, and ""everybody understands and respects"" India's longstanding relationship with Russia. He said Mr Modi had ""intervened several times with Vladimir Putin to ask him what on earth he thinks he's doing"". ""What Indians want is peace, and the Russians out,"" he added.

"Mum, stepdad and teen guilty of murder of boy, 5","This video can not be played Police found Logan Mwangi's body in a river near his home - he was wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top A mother, stepfather and a teenage boy have been found guilty of murdering a five-year-old boy and dumping his body in a river. Angharad Williamson, 31, John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old, who cannot be named, killed Logan Mwangi in July 2021. Logan's body was found in the River Ogmore, close to his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. He died after sufferinga ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries. The prosecution said Logan's body was dumped in the River Ogmore on 31 July like ""fly-tipped rubbish"". How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Police officers found the schoolboy partially submerged in the water wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top just 250 metres from his home. The youngster had 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, including extensive bruising to the back of his head and tears in his liver and bowel, which experts said were so severe they were consistent with those seen in road traffic accidents. Experts also said the injuries could have only been caused by a ""brutal and sustained assault"" inflicted on Logan in the hours, or days, prior to his death, adding the injuries were ""consistent with child abuse"". Angharad Williamson and John Cole both claimed not to know how Logan came to have ""catastrophic"" injuries During the trial, jurors had heard howLogan was treated like a prisoner in the days before his death. On 20 July Logan tested positive for Covid-19 and the jury heard how he was shut in his bedroom with a baby gate barring him from leaving. Prosecutor Caroline Rees QC said Williamson and Cole made him face the wall when they took him food. The teenager had a ""desire for violence"" andpushed Logan down the stairs, breaking his arm. A support worker once heard him singing: ""I love to punch kids in the head, it's orgasmic."" The jury were also played extensive CCTV footage from nearby houses around the time of the incident, in it Cole and the teenager were seen at 02:43 BST on 31 July moving Logan's body to the nearby river where theydumped it. They were caught again as they came back to the house to pick up the dinosaur pyjama top Logan had been wearing to take to the river, which police found in a wooded area with a big cut in. Logan had been kept in his room with a baby gate over the doorway in the days before he died Williamson told the jury she was asleep all night, but CCTV showed the lights going on and off in Logan's room and the curtains being opened. There was also evidence showing she had used her phone at the time to watch videos on YouTube. The jury were also played afrantic 999 call from Williamsonrecorded hours later telling police her son was missing. They were also shown bodycam footage from police who arrived at the house shortly after, where Cole appeared to be comforting a distraught Williamson. All of this, the jury found, were lies. Five-year-old Logan Mwangi was described as a ""really sweet, happy-go-lucky child"" by a neighbour As Williamson was found guilty of murdering her son, she fell to the floor screaming ""no, no, no"". She struggled being led from the dock and shouted at Cole, calling him a liar and a murderer. The jury of seven women and five men took five hours to reach their verdicts after a trial lasting eight weeks at Cardiff Crown Court. Some jurors became upset as the verdicts were handed down. Cole had already pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, which Williamson and the boy denied, but both were found guilty. They will all be sentenced at a later date. Logan's body was found 250 metres away from the flat he shared with his family The five-year-old's body was found in the River Ogmore Mrs Justice Jefford thanked the jury for the ""exceptional public service"" and said they had ""listened to often very unpleasant and emotional evidence."" She said it was ""no less than Logan Mwangi deserved"".Â Mrs Justice Jefford said she would excuse them from undertaking jury service in the future because of the nature of the evidence they had listened to. Angharad Williamson, and her partner, John Cole, were charged with murder at Cardiff Crown Court Logan's father, Ben Mwangi, honoured his son outside court saying he ""was the most beautiful boy whose life has been tragically cut short"". ""The wonderful memories I have of my son will never be tarnished - they will forever be in my heart and my soul,"" he said. ""I loved him so much and somehow I have to live my life knowing I will never get to see him grow up into the wonderful man I knew he could be."" This video can not be played Logan Mwangi's dad said the world was colder and darker without his son Logan's school, Tondu Primary School, said the community ""remains deeply saddened by his loss"". ""Logan loved playing with his classmates, especially games like hide-and-seek or pretending to be superheroes. ""His favourite character was always Spider-Man, and he would display a keen and vivid imagination in his games. ""Ultimately, we remember Logan as being a bright, happy child who was caring and loving, and an absolute pleasure to teach."" Cwm Taf Morgannwg safeguarding board, which is responsible for the protection of children, said it has commissioned aChild Practice Review,externalin relation to this case. Agencies involved with Logan and his family will gather information to develop a timeline of significant events that took place prior to his death. It will take about six months to complete. Hundreds of toys, bears and flowers were left in Pandy Park after Logan's body was found The end of the trial may settle the question about who was responsible for Logan's murder, but there remain many questions about whether he could have been better protected. Medics were concerned by a broken arm nearly a year before his murder, so alerted safeguarding authorities. Later, a social worker was allocated to Logan's case. He was put on the Child Protection Register, but was removed a month before his death, suggesting he was no longer believed to be at risk of significant harm. Cole's violent history was known to social services as was the troubled, violent past of the teenager. A foster family the teenager stayed with told the court that he had threatened to kill Logan. Logan was checked on by a social worker, but wasn't seen because the family said he had Covid. Covid restrictions amplified the pressures on families and made it harder for social workers to make checks. But Logan was also telling his own story as best he could in a world where he had no power - the court heard he lost weight and his stammer got worse. It will be the job of a child practice review to examine in detail the actions of the authorities. The earliest this will report is in the autumn. Logan's mum: 'What have you done with my son?'

"Work from home to beat Putin, says EU","The EU is asking its citizens to drive less, turn down air conditioning and work from home three days a week, to reduce reliance on Russian energy. The measures, drawn up with the International Energy Agency, would save a typical household â¬450 (Â£375) a year. Buying energy from Russia helps to support its economy and finance the war in Ukraine. But Europe has said it cannot find alternative supplies, so it is asking citizens to adjust their lifestyles. The nine-point plan, entitled âPlaying My Partâ, urges citizens to drive less, by using public transport, or working from home three days a week. It also calls on citizens to: Heat their homes less in winter, and turn the air conditioning down in summer. Drive more slowly on highways, with the car air conditioning turned down, which uses less fuel Use the train instead of flying Travel by public transport, walk, or cycle It also calls on cities to promote car-free Sundays, as some already do. âFaced with the horrendous scenes of human suffering that weâve seen following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, people in Europe want to take action,â said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA. âThis guide has easy-to-follow steps that with little or no discomfort on our part can reduce the flow of money to Russiaâs military and help put us on a path to a cleaner and more sustainable planet.â The IEA calculates that if every citizen followed its recommendations, it could save 220 million barrels of oil every year, enough to fill 120 supertankers. It would also save 17bn cubic metres of gas, enough to heat nearly 20 million homes. In March, the EU announced a plan to make the bloc independent ofRussian energy imports by 2030. But the German energy minister Christian Lindner told the BBC on Wednesday it would be impossible tostop oil imports immediately. The report also recommends that citizens consider investing in home insulation, smart digital thermostats, and digital cars, which can all help to reduce fossil fuel use. ""All these measures, they can be voluntary contributions,"" said Leonore Gewessler, Austria's environment minister. ""But they need political action to underpin them."" Austria has cut all fares on public transport to three euros per day, she said, and is introducing a programme to help low-income households replace old, inefficient appliances. Eamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister said by acting at a European level, it was easier to get the political messaging right. ""It is very difficult not to come across as someone who is telling the citizen what to do, or is being seen as a mean, Scrooge-like character,"" he said. EU countries are calling on citizens to walk, cycle or take public transport to reduce reliance on Russian oil Separately, the UK announced it was tightening sanctions on non-energy goods exported from Russia, including a ban on caviar, silver and wood products. The Department for International Trade said it was also ramping up taxes on some other exports from Russia and Belarus, covering goods worth a total of Â£130m. The products facing higher import duties include diamonds, rubber, pharmaceuticals, meat, coffee, tobacco and other products. International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said the UK was taking every opportunity to ""ratchet the pressure to isolate the Russian economy"". ""These further measures will tighten the screws, shutting down lucrative avenues of funding for Putin's war machine,"" she said.

'Blood and fear everywhere' after deadly IS blast,"The Seh Dokan mosque stands in a busy area of Mazar-i-Sharif, a city in northern Afghanistan Dozens of people have been killed or injured in four explosions across Afghanistan on Thursday, local officials and journalists have said. The first explosion tore through a Shia Muslim mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif. At least 31 people were killed, and 87 were wounded, the BBC has been told. The Islamic State group (IS) admitted carrying out the attack. The Taliban say they have defeated the IS but the group remains a serious security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers. The attack on the Mazar-i-Sharif mosque was carried out using a remotely detonated booby-trapped bag when the building was packed with worshippers, the Sunni Muslim IS jihadists said. The group called the attack part of an ongoing global campaign to ""avenge"" the deaths of its former leader and spokesman. Ahmad Zia Zindani, spokesman for the provincial public health department, told AFP news agency that ""blood and fear are everywhere,"" and that ""people were screaming"" while seeking news of their relatives at the local hospital. IS has also claimed another of Thursday's attacks - a blast which saw a vehicle blown up near a police station in Kunduz, leaving four dead and 18 injured. The BBC has also received reports of a Taliban vehicle being hit by a roadside mine in eastern Nangarhar province, killing four Taliban members and wounding a fifth. A fourth blast was caused by a mine planted in the Niaz Beyk area of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, and wounded two children. Thursday's bloodshed comes days aftertwo bomb blasts at Abdul Rahim Shahid high schoolin a mostly Shia area of the Afghan capital, Kabul. At least six people were killed and more than 20 wounded, officials said. Local reports and witnesses say the explosion in Mazar-i-Sharif happened at Seh Dokan, one of the biggest mosques used locally by the Hazara minority group. The number of casualties remains fluid at this stage and liable to change. Afghanistan's Hazara community is often targeted by Sunni militant groups, including IS. The blast is said to have happened while worshippers were preparing to perform prayers. Images shared on social media, which the BBC has not verified, showed the site littered with broken glass and victims being carried. One Mazar-i-Sharif woman told news agency Reuters she had been shopping at a nearby market when she heard a large explosion near the mosque. ""The glass of the shops was broken and it was very crowded and everyone started to run,"" she said, asking for her name not to be used. Richard Bennett, the United Nation's Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan on human rights, condemned the attacks. ""Today more explosions rocks Afghanistan [...] and again the Hazara community is a victim. Systematic targeted attacks on crowded schools and mosques calls for immediate investigation, accountability and end to human rights violations,"" he wrote on Twitter.

"Mum, stepdad and teen guilty of murder of boy, 5The body of Logan, five, a ""really sweet, happy-go-lucky child"" was found in a river.Wales","This video can not be played Police found Logan Mwangi's body in a river near his home - he was wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top A mother, stepfather and a teenage boy have been found guilty of murdering a five-year-old boy and dumping his body in a river. Angharad Williamson, 31, John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old, who cannot be named, killed Logan Mwangi in July 2021. Logan's body was found in the River Ogmore, close to his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. He died after sufferinga ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries. The prosecution said Logan's body was dumped in the River Ogmore on 31 July like ""fly-tipped rubbish"". How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Police officers found the schoolboy partially submerged in the water wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top just 250 metres from his home. The youngster had 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, including extensive bruising to the back of his head and tears in his liver and bowel, which experts said were so severe they were consistent with those seen in road traffic accidents. Experts also said the injuries could have only been caused by a ""brutal and sustained assault"" inflicted on Logan in the hours, or days, prior to his death, adding the injuries were ""consistent with child abuse"". Angharad Williamson and John Cole both claimed not to know how Logan came to have ""catastrophic"" injuries During the trial, jurors had heard howLogan was treated like a prisoner in the days before his death. On 20 July Logan tested positive for Covid-19 and the jury heard how he was shut in his bedroom with a baby gate barring him from leaving. Prosecutor Caroline Rees QC said Williamson and Cole made him face the wall when they took him food. The teenager had a ""desire for violence"" andpushed Logan down the stairs, breaking his arm. A support worker once heard him singing: ""I love to punch kids in the head, it's orgasmic."" The jury were also played extensive CCTV footage from nearby houses around the time of the incident, in it Cole and the teenager were seen at 02:43 BST on 31 July moving Logan's body to the nearby river where theydumped it. They were caught again as they came back to the house to pick up the dinosaur pyjama top Logan had been wearing to take to the river, which police found in a wooded area with a big cut in. Logan had been kept in his room with a baby gate over the doorway in the days before he died Williamson told the jury she was asleep all night, but CCTV showed the lights going on and off in Logan's room and the curtains being opened. There was also evidence showing she had used her phone at the time to watch videos on YouTube. The jury were also played afrantic 999 call from Williamsonrecorded hours later telling police her son was missing. They were also shown bodycam footage from police who arrived at the house shortly after, where Cole appeared to be comforting a distraught Williamson. All of this, the jury found, were lies. Five-year-old Logan Mwangi was described as a ""really sweet, happy-go-lucky child"" by a neighbour As Williamson was found guilty of murdering her son, she fell to the floor screaming ""no, no, no"". She struggled being led from the dock and shouted at Cole, calling him a liar and a murderer. The jury of seven women and five men took five hours to reach their verdicts after a trial lasting eight weeks at Cardiff Crown Court. Some jurors became upset as the verdicts were handed down. Cole had already pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, which Williamson and the boy denied, but both were found guilty. They will all be sentenced at a later date. Logan's body was found 250 metres away from the flat he shared with his family The five-year-old's body was found in the River Ogmore Mrs Justice Jefford thanked the jury for the ""exceptional public service"" and said they had ""listened to often very unpleasant and emotional evidence."" She said it was ""no less than Logan Mwangi deserved"".Â Mrs Justice Jefford said she would excuse them from undertaking jury service in the future because of the nature of the evidence they had listened to. Angharad Williamson, and her partner, John Cole, were charged with murder at Cardiff Crown Court Logan's father, Ben Mwangi, honoured his son outside court saying he ""was the most beautiful boy whose life has been tragically cut short"". ""The wonderful memories I have of my son will never be tarnished - they will forever be in my heart and my soul,"" he said. ""I loved him so much and somehow I have to live my life knowing I will never get to see him grow up into the wonderful man I knew he could be."" This video can not be played Logan Mwangi's dad said the world was colder and darker without his son Logan's school, Tondu Primary School, said the community ""remains deeply saddened by his loss"". ""Logan loved playing with his classmates, especially games like hide-and-seek or pretending to be superheroes. ""His favourite character was always Spider-Man, and he would display a keen and vivid imagination in his games. ""Ultimately, we remember Logan as being a bright, happy child who was caring and loving, and an absolute pleasure to teach."" Cwm Taf Morgannwg safeguarding board, which is responsible for the protection of children, said it has commissioned aChild Practice Review,externalin relation to this case. Agencies involved with Logan and his family will gather information to develop a timeline of significant events that took place prior to his death. It will take about six months to complete. Hundreds of toys, bears and flowers were left in Pandy Park after Logan's body was found The end of the trial may settle the question about who was responsible for Logan's murder, but there remain many questions about whether he could have been better protected. Medics were concerned by a broken arm nearly a year before his murder, so alerted safeguarding authorities. Later, a social worker was allocated to Logan's case. He was put on the Child Protection Register, but was removed a month before his death, suggesting he was no longer believed to be at risk of significant harm. Cole's violent history was known to social services as was the troubled, violent past of the teenager. A foster family the teenager stayed with told the court that he had threatened to kill Logan. Logan was checked on by a social worker, but wasn't seen because the family said he had Covid. Covid restrictions amplified the pressures on families and made it harder for social workers to make checks. But Logan was also telling his own story as best he could in a world where he had no power - the court heard he lost weight and his stammer got worse. It will be the job of a child practice review to examine in detail the actions of the authorities. The earliest this will report is in the autumn. Logan's mum: 'What have you done with my son?'

Florida strips Disney of special statusGovernor Ron DeSantis has taken aim at Disney over its opposition to the so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill.,"Florida lawmakers have voted to strip Walt Disney of its special self-governing status amid a political clash between the company and the governor. The status gave Disney powers to levy tax, build roads and control utilities on the lands of its theme park. The entertainment conglomerate did not respond to a request for comment. The move is widely seen as retribution for Disney's opposition to a bill that bars many primary-school classrooms from discussing sexual orientation. On Thursday, at the urging of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, the state House passed a bill that would rid the company of its near-total power over the special district where its theme park is based. It had already passed the Senate. Known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, it was created in a 1967 deal between the state and the Walt Disney Company. Governor DeSantis had previously made it clear he will sign the measure into law. Following the vote, Disney's special district will be dissolved on 1 June, 2023. Its special status had effectively allowed the company to operate as its own municipal government, with its own board of supervisors and fire department, and meant Disney could even build its own airport, or nuclear power plant if desired. It had given the entertainment giant freedom from almost all bureaucratic intervention for half a century and is thought to have saved it from tens of millions of dollars in taxes and fees. And it is part of why Disney chose to build its theme parks in Florida, where it has become the state's largest private employer, with some 80,000 jobs. But Disney's special relationship with the state of Florida came under threat over its response to a gender and sexuality education bill signed by Mr DeSantis last month. Formally called the Parental Rights in Education Law, it has been dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" law by critics. It prohibits any instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity between kindergarten and third grade - when students are roughly between five and nine years old. It also calls on school districts to avoid LGBT topics ""when not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students"". The legislation also extends to student support services, including counselling, and grants parents the power to sue schools directly if they believe an educator has broken the law. Opponents say the law will isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters say it protects children from age-inappropriate content. Disney initially stayed tight-lipped on the bill, but reversed course amid pressure from employees to oppose the policy. After it became law, Disney promised to push for its repeal and fight similar bills across the US. In response, Mr DeSantis said the company, which has made Florida its home, had ""crossed the line"". Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in the US Congress said they would oppose renewing the company's copyright on Mickey Mouse in 2024 because of Disney's ""political and sexual agenda"". Analysis By Mat Morrison The political skies are cloudy in the Sunshine State, and it could be the smoke from the culture wars below. Governor Ron DeSantis is leading a charge, with a general's eagerness for combat and a politician's eye for opportunity. Florida-based Disney is only the latest target in his crosshairs, and the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill just one of a string of conservative laws with Tallahassee origins grabbing national headlines. There's also been the banning of maths textbooks that the state deemed inappropriate for the classroom. That came after a bill - supported by Mr DeSantis - that makes it easier for parents to challenge books and instructional materials they disapprove of. Supporters say it gives parents a great say in their children's education. Opponents say it's simply censorship. The governor has also weighed in on the battle over Twitter, vowing to take on the company's board of directors over their tussle with Elon Musk. According to Bloomberg, Florida's state pension fund holds roughly a million shares, which may help explain Mr DeSantis's interest. And to top it off, he recently signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exemptions for rape or incest. The flurry of bills aimed at exciting conservative voters boils down to one important date: 5 November, 2024 - the next US presidential election day. Read Mat's full analysis here.

Tory donorâs âlinkâ to sanctioned oligarchâs firm,"Lubov Chernukhin, nee Golubeva A major Conservative Party donor was listed as a director of a company secretly owned by a Russian oligarch close to President Putin. The BBC has seen a document dated 2006 and signed ""Lubov Golubeva"", the maiden name of Lubov Chernukhin, a Tory donor. Mrs Chernukhin says she ""does not recall consenting in writing"" to being a director of Suleiman Kerimov's firm. Mr Kerimov, now sanctioned, previously denied any connection with Mrs Chernukhin. Papers seen by the BBC appear to show that Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, was appointed a director of offshore company Radlett Estates Limited, in 2005 - following its acquisition of a substantial property, 1 Radlett Place, in north London. Another firm - Swiru Holding AG - was the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates. The directors of Radlett Estates were Swiss businessman Alexander Studhalter and Suleiman Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Studhalter was accused in a French courtof being a so-called ""straw man"", or proxy, for Mr Kerimov - involved in hiding the oligarch's wealth. Radlett Estates had planned to demolish the building and construct a new 3,500 sq-ft (325 sq-m) home. According to architects' plans, there was to be a cinema, a health spa and gym, indoor swimming pool, a map room, six bedrooms and a ""6 car motorised garage and large staff quarters"". Mr Kerimov and his wife were not listed as directors of Radlett Estates and their names were not on the planning documents seen by the BBC. But one designer's website identified the clients as ""Mr and Mrs K"". The signature ""Lubov Golubeva"" appears on a Radlett Estates board meeting document from 2006. It records her resignation from the company. Radlett Estates Ltd 2006 document showing ""Lubov Golubeva"" signature In 2007, Ms Golubeva married Vladimir Chernukhin - a multimillionaire businessman who had served under President Putin as a junior minister, but later fled Russia. The same year, she started giving money to the Conservative Party - initially in Â£5,000 donations under her maiden name. As time went on, the donations - in her married name - became much bigger. She would end up becoming one of the Tory party's most influential donors - having given more than Â£2.1m. The discovery of the evidence suggesting a business connection between Mrs Chernukhin and Mr Kerimov follows questions in Parliament about her and her links to Russia. This was despite Mrs Chernukhin's condemnation of ""Russian military aggression in Ukraine"" where she called for ""the strongest possible sanctions against Putin's regime and its enablers"". Earlier this month, the BBC - as part of the Pandora Papers Russia project with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and global partners -revealed how Suleiman Kerimov has been hiding his wealth. Vladimir Chernukhin Lubov Chernukhin's husband Vladimir was in the Russian government between 2000 and 2002. He was then appointed chairman of a state bank by Mr Putin, but left Russia after being dismissed by the president in 2004. But in a 2018 court case, his wife confirmed that Mr Chernukhin had maintained ""excellent"" relationships with ""prominent members of the Russian establishment"". Mr Chernukhin said he arrived in the UK with a fortune of $300m (Â£230m) and started building a ""real estate empire"". Both he and his wife are now UK citizens - which means she is entitled to donate to a political party. In February, she was reported to be a member of a small ""advisory board"" of major donors with access to senior party members, including the prime minister. In 2019, she paid Â£135,000 to attend a ladies' night dinner attended by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, and then-Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, who is now foreign secretary with responsibility for sanctions against Russia.

In 2020, the BBC revealed howMr Chernukhin had been secretly funded with $8mby a company linked to Mr Kerimov four years previously - before Mr Kerimov was first sanctioned by the US. At that time, her lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from Mr Kerimov or any company related to him"" and her ""donations to the Conservative Party have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence"". Lawyers for Mr Kerimov said he had had ""no dealings whatsoever"" with Mrs Chernukhin. Suleiman Kerimov Suleiman Kerimov was among a dozen billionaires called to stand alongside President Putin as Russia's tanks rolled into Ukraine in February. The businessman has been estimated to be worth more than $14bn. Mr Kerimov has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 - and since March by the EU and UK. The EU described him as ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Mr Putin. In 2017, Mr Kerimov was arrested in France over his alleged role in laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case related to French properties which investigators believed were owned by Mr Kerimov - his ownership hidden by Alexander Studhalter acting as a proxy for the oligarch. Mr Studhalter denies being the ""straw man"" for Mr Kerimov and says he was the real owner of the properties through a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG. But - according to secret French Court of Appeal records seen by the BBC - bank documents showed Mr Studhalter was holding shares in Swiru Holding on behalf of Mr Kerimov and his nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Hidden wealth of one of Putinâs 'inner circle' revealed A simple guide to the Pandora Papers FinCEN Files: All you need to know about the documents leak Mr Kerimov and Mr Studhalter did not respond to our questions about the ownership of 1 Radlett Place, which was sold to another offshore company in 2012 for Â£36.5m. Mr and Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never been a director of Radlett"". She had, they said, been approached in relation to the ""Radlett Project"" in her capacity as a director of another business called Capital Construction Development Limited - a company then owned by her husband - and ""asked to submit a pitch"". The project did not proceed, they said. The BBC has seen conflicting evidence of Mrs Chernukhin's relationship with Radlett Estates Limited. An email in December 2009 quoted a representative of Swiru Holding - the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates - as saying they could not find ""any evidence"" in their files that ""Mr or Ms Golubov [sic] have been appointedd [sic], nor any Resolutions or Resignation/Acceptance letters."" And documents show representatives of Swiru repeatedly submitted corporate documents to Radlett's registered agent - its administrator in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) - which contained no mention of Lubov Golubeva. But a number of leaked registers of directors - including from three of the agent's offices in Switzerland, the BVI and Cyprus - show Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, listed as a director. Radlett Estates Ltd document showing Ms Lubov Golubeva listed as a director Asked about those documents, and the one showing Lubov Golubeva's resignation in 2006, lawyers for the Chernukhins said ""Mrs Chernukhin does not recall consenting in writing to being a director of Radlett Estates Limited"" and questioned whether the documents were ""forgeries and/or may have been manipulated"". Anti-money laundering expert Tom Keatinge at the think tank Rusi, told us it was possible the signature was a forgery - but unlikely. ""Documents show she was present at a meeting where her continued directorship was being discussed. And indeed at that meeting she resigned as a director so I think it stretches the imagination to suggest her identity was stolen."" Rachel Davies of Transparency International says the BBCs investigation underlines why the system of political donations has to be more transparent. ""Any politician or political party ought to have a clear understanding of the nature of their benefactor. That means conducting due diligence over those who sponsor their activities, not just looking at whether the funds they receive are lawful but ensuring they're exercising good judgement in receiving them in the first place."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said, ""if a British citizen is able to vote in an election for a political party, they also have the democratic right to donate to a political party. All donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.""

$50bn wiped off Netflixâs value as subscribers quit,"One of Netflix most popular series, Bridgerton, launched its second series last month Shares in Netflix have slumped by 35% after it revealed a sharp drop in subscribers and warned millions more are set to quit the streaming service. It wiped more than $50bn off the firm's market value as experts warned it faced a struggle to get back on track. Netflix faces intense competition from streaming rivals, but was also hit after it raised prices and left Russia. Yet some cast doubt on its plans to boost growth, which include bringing in a free ad-supported service. It also plans to crack down on password sharing, estimating that more than 100 million non-paying households watch the service this way. In a sign of the unease, one of America's best known investors, William Ackman, ditched his $1.1bn investment in Netflix on Wednesday, taking a loss of more than $400m. Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown Antiques stolen during filming of The Crown His hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management had bought the shares just three months ago. In a brief statement, Mr Ackman said that while Netflix's plans to change its business model made sense, investing in the company felt too risky. ""While Netflix's business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company's future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,"" he wrote. In a trading update on Tuesday, Netflix said its total number of subscribers had fallen by 200,000 in the first three months of 2022, falling well short of its target. It also said some two million more were likely to quit the service in the three months to July. Some analysts warned that, after period of turbo-charged expansion during the pandemic, the streaming giant has run out of easy ways to grow. Squeezed consumers are cutting back on streaming services to save money, while some feel there is too much content to choose from amid an avalanche of competition from rivals such as Disney and Amazon. ""Netflix's wider problem, along with the rest of the sector is that consumers don't have unlimited funds, and that one or two subscriptions is usually enough,"" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. ""Once you move above that something has to give in a cost-of-living crisis, and while Netflix is still the market leader, it doesn't have the deeper pockets of Apple, Amazon or Disney, which makes it much more vulnerable to a margin squeeze."" But Julian Aquilina, senior TV analyst at the media research firm Enders Analysis, said it was wrong to write the firm off. ""The streaming market is maturing and the high expectations people had about Netflix are being reset. ""But I think it will remain the market leader, it has such a commanding position. If people are going to ditch a subscription, Netflix won't be the first one they choose."" He added that the firm had just put up its prices ""which always leads to a drop in subscribers, but also means it's making more revenue per customer"". Netflix remains the world's leading streaming service with more than 220 million subscribers. It is increasingly producing its own content and shows such as the Crown, Bridgerton and Squid Game have been global hits. The firm had enjoyed uninterrupted quarterly growth in subscribers since October 2011 but on Tuesday it admitted it was losing customers to rivals, while struggling to expand due to password sharing. It also said a decision to raise prices in key markets had cost it 600,000 subscribers in North America alone, while its exit from Russia over Ukraine lost it 700,000. Despite the challenges, revenue grew by $7.8bn (Â£6bn) in the first three months of the year, up 9.8% compared with the same period last year. That marked a slowdown from earlier quarters, while profits fell more than 6% to roughly $1.6bn. Netflix's shares plunged 35% on Wednesday, and fell a further 3.5% on Thursday.

Dozens dead and injured in four Afghan blasts,"The Seh Dokan mosque stands in a busy area of Mazar-i-Sharif, a city in northern Afghanistan Dozens of people have been killed or injured in four explosions across Afghanistan on Thursday, local officials and journalists have said. The first explosion tore through a Shia Muslim mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif. At least 31 people were killed, and 87 were wounded, the BBC has been told. The Islamic State group (IS) admitted carrying out the attack. The Taliban say they have defeated the IS but the group remains a serious security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers. The attack on the Mazar-i-Sharif mosque was carried out using a remotely detonated booby-trapped bag when the building was packed with worshippers, the Sunni Muslim IS jihadists said. The group called the attack part of an ongoing global campaign to ""avenge"" the deaths of its former leader and spokesman. Ahmad Zia Zindani, spokesman for the provincial public health department, told AFP news agency that ""blood and fear are everywhere,"" and that ""people were screaming"" while seeking news of their relatives at the local hospital. IS has also claimed another of Thursday's attacks - a blast which saw a vehicle blown up near a police station in Kunduz, leaving four dead and 18 injured. The BBC has also received reports of a Taliban vehicle being hit by a roadside mine in eastern Nangarhar province, killing four Taliban members and wounding a fifth. A fourth blast was caused by a mine planted in the Niaz Beyk area of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, and wounded two children. Thursday's bloodshed comes days aftertwo bomb blasts at Abdul Rahim Shahid high schoolin a mostly Shia area of the Afghan capital, Kabul. At least six people were killed and more than 20 wounded, officials said. Local reports and witnesses say the explosion in Mazar-i-Sharif happened at Seh Dokan, one of the biggest mosques used locally by the Hazara minority group. The number of casualties remains fluid at this stage and liable to change. Afghanistan's Hazara community is often targeted by Sunni militant groups, including IS. The blast is said to have happened while worshippers were preparing to perform prayers. Images shared on social media, which the BBC has not verified, showed the site littered with broken glass and victims being carried. One Mazar-i-Sharif woman told news agency Reuters she had been shopping at a nearby market when she heard a large explosion near the mosque. ""The glass of the shops was broken and it was very crowded and everyone started to run,"" she said, asking for her name not to be used. Richard Bennett, the United Nation's Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan on human rights, condemned the attacks. ""Today more explosions rocks Afghanistan [...] and again the Hazara community is a victim. Systematic targeted attacks on crowded schools and mosques calls for immediate investigation, accountability and end to human rights violations,"" he wrote on Twitter.

KitKat maker Nestle warns of further price rises,"Swiss food giant Nestle has warned that it will continue to raise the prices of its products because of the rising costs of food. The maker of KitKats and Nesquik increased prices by more than 5% in the first three months of the year. The price rise helped Nestle to report sales growth of 7.6% in the period. As costs rise, Nestle boss Mark Schneider said ""further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year"" will be required. ""We stepped up pricing in a responsible manner and saw sustained consumer demand,"" Mr Schneider added. Food prices worldwide are at their highest since records began 60 years ago, according to the UN Food price index. KitKat and Durex makers warn of price rises Prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years In the UK,the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 yearsas energy, fuel and food prices continue to soar and increase the squeeze on household budgets. Analysts said Nestle's price rise of 5.2% helped its sales to increase by more than expected. ""Hiking prices to keep things moving in the right direction in the wake of input cost inflation certainly won't be a course of action management want to have to take,"" said Matt Britzman, an analyst at  Hargreaves Lansdown. ""But nonetheless, it's the position Nestle finds itself in and doesn't look likely to go away anytime soon,"" he added. Last month, Nestle said it would only sell essentials such as baby formula and medical nutrition products in Russia. It suspended sales of brands such as KitKat and Nesquik and stopped investment in the country as a growing number of Western brands halted operations in Russia in protest at the war.

Hamilton and Williams among Chelsea bid investorsLewis Hamilton and Serena Williams are among the investors backing Sir Martin Broughton's bid to buy Chelsea.BBC Sport,"Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams Lewis Hamiltonand Serena Williams are among the investors backing Sir Martin Broughton's bid to buy Chelsea. The Broughton consortium is one of three groups in the running to purchase the Premier League club for Â£2.5bn. As first reported by Sky, seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton - an Arsenal fan - and 23-time Grand Slam tennis champion Williams have pledged investment into the bid. World Athletics president and Chelsea fan Lord Coe is also behind the bid. The Blues are operating under a special licence from the UK government after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned. Abramovich put the club up for sale before he was sanctioned for his alleged links to Russian president Vladimir Putin following the invasion of Ukraine. BBC Sport understands that Hamilton and Williams have been involved with the Broughton consortium's bid from the start. They would have no say on footballing decisions. Other investors in the Broughton-led bid include the Rogers family, who are based in Canada and own media and telecoms company Rogers Communications, chair of the Houston 2026 World Cup bid committee John Arnold, and the Tsai family from Taiwan, which owns two baseball teams. The Broughton bid is already backed by Crystal Palace co-owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer, with additional funds from investment banker Michael Klein and Lord Coe. The group faces competition to buy Chelsea from consortiums led by Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly and co-owner of the Boston Celtics Stephen Pagliuca. Three bidders remain - but who is best placed? American investment firm Raine Group has been tasked with selling Chelsea and the UK government is expected to issue a new licence, allowing the club to be sold once a preferred buyer has been identified. Any sale must be signed off by the bidder passing the Premier League's owners' and directors' test.

"Breaking|Breaking newsMum, stepdad and teenager guilty of boy's murderThe body of Logan, five, a ""really sweet, happy-go-lucky child"" was found in a bag next to a river.Wales","This video can not be played Police found Logan Mwangi's body in a river near his home - he was wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top A mother, stepfather and a teenage boy have been found guilty of murdering a five-year-old boy and dumping his body in a river. Angharad Williamson, 31, John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old, who cannot be named, killed Logan Mwangi in July 2021. Logan's body was found in the River Ogmore, close to his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. He died after sufferinga ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries. The prosecution said Logan's body was dumped in the River Ogmore on 31 July like ""fly-tipped rubbish"". How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Police officers found the schoolboy partially submerged in the water wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top just 250 metres from his home. The youngster had 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, including extensive bruising to the back of his head and tears in his liver and bowel, which experts said were so severe they were consistent with those seen in road traffic accidents. Experts also said the injuries could have only been caused by a ""brutal and sustained assault"" inflicted on Logan in the hours, or days, prior to his death, adding the injuries were ""consistent with child abuse"". Angharad Williamson and John Cole both claimed not to know how Logan came to have ""catastrophic"" injuries During the trial, jurors had heard howLogan was treated like a prisoner in the days before his death. On 20 July Logan tested positive for Covid-19 and the jury heard how he was shut in his bedroom with a baby gate barring him from leaving. Prosecutor Caroline Rees QC said Williamson and Cole made him face the wall when they took him food. The teenager had a ""desire for violence"" andpushed Logan down the stairs, breaking his arm. A support worker once heard him singing: ""I love to punch kids in the head, it's orgasmic."" The jury were also played extensive CCTV footage from nearby houses around the time of the incident, in it Cole and the teenager were seen at 02:43 BST on 31 July moving Logan's body to the nearby river where theydumped it. They were caught again as they came back to the house to pick up the dinosaur pyjama top Logan had been wearing to take to the river, which police found in a wooded area with a big cut in. Logan had been kept in his room with a baby gate over the doorway in the days before he died Williamson told the jury she was asleep all night, but CCTV showed the lights going on and off in Logan's room and the curtains being opened. There was also evidence showing she had used her phone at the time to watch videos on YouTube. The jury were also played afrantic 999 call from Williamsonrecorded hours later telling police her son was missing. They were also shown bodycam footage from police who arrived at the house shortly after, where Cole appeared to be comforting a distraught Williamson. All of this, the jury found, were lies. Five-year-old Logan Mwangi was described as a ""really sweet, happy-go-lucky child"" by a neighbour As Williamson was found guilty of murdering her son, she fell to the floor screaming ""no, no, no"". She struggled being led from the dock and shouted at Cole, calling him a liar and a murderer. The jury of seven women and five men took five hours to reach their verdicts after a trial lasting eight weeks at Cardiff Crown Court. Some jurors became upset as the verdicts were handed down. Cole had already pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, which Williamson and the boy denied, but both were found guilty. They will all be sentenced at a later date. Logan's body was found 250 metres away from the flat he shared with his family The five-year-old's body was found in the River Ogmore Mrs Justice Jefford thanked the jury for the ""exceptional public service"" and said they had ""listened to often very unpleasant and emotional evidence."" She said it was ""no less than Logan Mwangi deserved"".Â Mrs Justice Jefford said she would excuse them from undertaking jury service in the future because of the nature of the evidence they had listened to. Angharad Williamson, and her partner, John Cole, were charged with murder at Cardiff Crown Court Logan's father, Ben Mwangi, honoured his son outside court saying he ""was the most beautiful boy whose life has been tragically cut short"". ""The wonderful memories I have of my son will never be tarnished - they will forever be in my heart and my soul,"" he said. ""I loved him so much and somehow I have to live my life knowing I will never get to see him grow up into the wonderful man I knew he could be."" This video can not be played Logan Mwangi's dad said the world was colder and darker without his son Logan's school, Tondu Primary School, said the community ""remains deeply saddened by his loss"". ""Logan loved playing with his classmates, especially games like hide-and-seek or pretending to be superheroes. ""His favourite character was always Spider-Man, and he would display a keen and vivid imagination in his games. ""Ultimately, we remember Logan as being a bright, happy child who was caring and loving, and an absolute pleasure to teach."" Cwm Taf Morgannwg safeguarding board, which is responsible for the protection of children, said it has commissioned aChild Practice Review,externalin relation to this case. Agencies involved with Logan and his family will gather information to develop a timeline of significant events that took place prior to his death. It will take about six months to complete. Hundreds of toys, bears and flowers were left in Pandy Park after Logan's body was found The end of the trial may settle the question about who was responsible for Logan's murder, but there remain many questions about whether he could have been better protected. Medics were concerned by a broken arm nearly a year before his murder, so alerted safeguarding authorities. Later, a social worker was allocated to Logan's case. He was put on the Child Protection Register, but was removed a month before his death, suggesting he was no longer believed to be at risk of significant harm. Cole's violent history was known to social services as was the troubled, violent past of the teenager. A foster family the teenager stayed with told the court that he had threatened to kill Logan. Logan was checked on by a social worker, but wasn't seen because the family said he had Covid. Covid restrictions amplified the pressures on families and made it harder for social workers to make checks. But Logan was also telling his own story as best he could in a world where he had no power - the court heard he lost weight and his stammer got worse. It will be the job of a child practice review to examine in detail the actions of the authorities. The earliest this will report is in the autumn. Logan's mum: 'What have you done with my son?'

Tory donorâs âlinkâ to sanctioned oligarchâs firmA major donor was listed as a director of a firm secretly owned by a Russian oligarch close to Putin.UK Politics,"Lubov Chernukhin, nee Golubeva A major Conservative Party donor was listed as a director of a company secretly owned by a Russian oligarch close to President Putin. The BBC has seen a document dated 2006 and signed ""Lubov Golubeva"", the maiden name of Lubov Chernukhin, a Tory donor. Mrs Chernukhin says she ""does not recall consenting in writing"" to being a director of Suleiman Kerimov's firm. Mr Kerimov, now sanctioned, previously denied any connection with Mrs Chernukhin. Papers seen by the BBC appear to show that Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, was appointed a director of offshore company Radlett Estates Limited, in 2005 - following its acquisition of a substantial property, 1 Radlett Place, in north London. Another firm - Swiru Holding AG - was the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates. The directors of Radlett Estates were Swiss businessman Alexander Studhalter and Suleiman Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Studhalter was accused in a French courtof being a so-called ""straw man"", or proxy, for Mr Kerimov - involved in hiding the oligarch's wealth. Radlett Estates had planned to demolish the building and construct a new 3,500 sq-ft (325 sq-m) home. According to architects' plans, there was to be a cinema, a health spa and gym, indoor swimming pool, a map room, six bedrooms and a ""6 car motorised garage and large staff quarters"". Mr Kerimov and his wife were not listed as directors of Radlett Estates and their names were not on the planning documents seen by the BBC. But one designer's website identified the clients as ""Mr and Mrs K"". The signature ""Lubov Golubeva"" appears on a Radlett Estates board meeting document from 2006. It records her resignation from the company. Radlett Estates Ltd 2006 document showing ""Lubov Golubeva"" signature In 2007, Ms Golubeva married Vladimir Chernukhin - a multimillionaire businessman who had served under President Putin as a junior minister, but later fled Russia. The same year, she started giving money to the Conservative Party - initially in Â£5,000 donations under her maiden name. As time went on, the donations - in her married name - became much bigger. She would end up becoming one of the Tory party's most influential donors - having given more than Â£2.1m. The discovery of the evidence suggesting a business connection between Mrs Chernukhin and Mr Kerimov follows questions in Parliament about her and her links to Russia. This was despite Mrs Chernukhin's condemnation of ""Russian military aggression in Ukraine"" where she called for ""the strongest possible sanctions against Putin's regime and its enablers"". Earlier this month, the BBC - as part of the Pandora Papers Russia project with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and global partners -revealed how Suleiman Kerimov has been hiding his wealth. Vladimir Chernukhin Lubov Chernukhin's husband Vladimir was in the Russian government between 2000 and 2002. He was then appointed chairman of a state bank by Mr Putin, but left Russia after being dismissed by the president in 2004. But in a 2018 court case, his wife confirmed that Mr Chernukhin had maintained ""excellent"" relationships with ""prominent members of the Russian establishment"". Mr Chernukhin said he arrived in the UK with a fortune of $300m (Â£230m) and started building a ""real estate empire"". Both he and his wife are now UK citizens - which means she is entitled to donate to a political party. In February, she was reported to be a member of a small ""advisory board"" of major donors with access to senior party members, including the prime minister. In 2019, she paid Â£135,000 to attend a ladies' night dinner attended by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, and then-Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, who is now foreign secretary with responsibility for sanctions against Russia.

In 2020, the BBC revealed howMr Chernukhin had been secretly funded with $8mby a company linked to Mr Kerimov four years previously - before Mr Kerimov was first sanctioned by the US. At that time, her lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from Mr Kerimov or any company related to him"" and her ""donations to the Conservative Party have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence"". Lawyers for Mr Kerimov said he had had ""no dealings whatsoever"" with Mrs Chernukhin. Suleiman Kerimov Suleiman Kerimov was among a dozen billionaires called to stand alongside President Putin as Russia's tanks rolled into Ukraine in February. The businessman has been estimated to be worth more than $14bn. Mr Kerimov has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 - and since March by the EU and UK. The EU described him as ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Mr Putin. In 2017, Mr Kerimov was arrested in France over his alleged role in laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case related to French properties which investigators believed were owned by Mr Kerimov - his ownership hidden by Alexander Studhalter acting as a proxy for the oligarch. Mr Studhalter denies being the ""straw man"" for Mr Kerimov and says he was the real owner of the properties through a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG. But - according to secret French Court of Appeal records seen by the BBC - bank documents showed Mr Studhalter was holding shares in Swiru Holding on behalf of Mr Kerimov and his nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Hidden wealth of one of Putinâs 'inner circle' revealed A simple guide to the Pandora Papers FinCEN Files: All you need to know about the documents leak Mr Kerimov and Mr Studhalter did not respond to our questions about the ownership of 1 Radlett Place, which was sold to another offshore company in 2012 for Â£36.5m. Mr and Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never been a director of Radlett"". She had, they said, been approached in relation to the ""Radlett Project"" in her capacity as a director of another business called Capital Construction Development Limited - a company then owned by her husband - and ""asked to submit a pitch"". The project did not proceed, they said. The BBC has seen conflicting evidence of Mrs Chernukhin's relationship with Radlett Estates Limited. An email in December 2009 quoted a representative of Swiru Holding - the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates - as saying they could not find ""any evidence"" in their files that ""Mr or Ms Golubov [sic] have been appointedd [sic], nor any Resolutions or Resignation/Acceptance letters."" And documents show representatives of Swiru repeatedly submitted corporate documents to Radlett's registered agent - its administrator in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) - which contained no mention of Lubov Golubeva. But a number of leaked registers of directors - including from three of the agent's offices in Switzerland, the BVI and Cyprus - show Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, listed as a director. Radlett Estates Ltd document showing Ms Lubov Golubeva listed as a director Asked about those documents, and the one showing Lubov Golubeva's resignation in 2006, lawyers for the Chernukhins said ""Mrs Chernukhin does not recall consenting in writing to being a director of Radlett Estates Limited"" and questioned whether the documents were ""forgeries and/or may have been manipulated"". Anti-money laundering expert Tom Keatinge at the think tank Rusi, told us it was possible the signature was a forgery - but unlikely. ""Documents show she was present at a meeting where her continued directorship was being discussed. And indeed at that meeting she resigned as a director so I think it stretches the imagination to suggest her identity was stolen."" Rachel Davies of Transparency International says the BBCs investigation underlines why the system of political donations has to be more transparent. ""Any politician or political party ought to have a clear understanding of the nature of their benefactor. That means conducting due diligence over those who sponsor their activities, not just looking at whether the funds they receive are lawful but ensuring they're exercising good judgement in receiving them in the first place."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said, ""if a British citizen is able to vote in an election for a political party, they also have the democratic right to donate to a political party. All donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.""

A$AP Rocky arrested in connection with shootingThe rapper was taken into custody at Los Angeles airport as he returned from a holiday with Rihanna.Entertainment & Arts,"The star's lawyer confirmed he had been arrested, but declined to make any further comments The rapper A$AP Rocky has been arrested in connection with a shooting last November, Los Angeles police have said. The star was taken into custody at Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday as he returned from a holiday with his girlfriend, Rihanna. Police had been investigating the star, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, for his potential involvement in a non-fatal shooting in Hollywood last year. He was released on bail of $550,000 (Â£421,000) shortly after his arrest.

"Seal off last Mariupol fighters, Putin tells forces","US President Joe Biden announces an additional $800m security assistance package for Ukraine Biden says the aid, including heavy artillery weapons, ammunition and tactical drones, will be sent ""directly to the frontlines of freedom"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia has rejected a proposal for a ceasefire this weekend - Moscow has not commented Vladimir Putin orders his troops not to storm the Azovstal steel plant, where the last group of Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol is holding out Instead, the president tells them to seal it up so even a ""fly"" cannot escape, and says Russia has control of the strategic port city Some civilians trapped for weeks in the wider south-eastern city have been able to leave, but far fewer than hoped Edited by Yvette Tan For technical reasons we are moving our live coverage. Please join us at this webpagefor all the latest. Russian state media reports that Russian forces have seized identifying information on all of Ukraine's special security services (SBU) personnel in the Kherson region. According to the Ria Novosti news agency, a cache of documents abandoned by SBU employees fleeing the region fell into the hands of Russian troops. The recovered documents contained names and photos, some of which were published in full by the outlet. Ria Novosti also alleges that the SBU includes special forces trained in sabotage and reconnaissance, and working for the government. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Toby LuckhurstReporting from Lviv It was a moment of defiance that summed up the spirit of a
nation â when defenders of a small Ukrainian island, ordered to surrender by
the Russian warship Moskva, told the vessel to go away (in more
colourful language than we can report here). Ukraine has now immortalised the moment with limited
edition commemorative postal stamps. Theyâve quickly become the must-have collectible across the country. Julia Aurora Ogorodnyk is a food writer in Lviv. She was in
her car when she heard on the radio that the first ones had been released. She
went to the post office first thing the next morning, and just in time - only
four were left. Julia shows off the stamps Knowing how popular they were proving, she had them stamped with the date, making them more valuable by showing they were part of the first batch released. âItâs more unique,â she said. That same day, reports emerged that the Moskva had sunk. âSo now itâs even more valuable!â she says. She doesnât plan to sell them, at least not yet â sheâll save them for herself, and might put them on display at home. âItâs a symbol of how a small person can resist huge forces â and make them regret it!â You can read morehereabout the Moskva warship and its encounter with the Snake Island soldiers. The Russians have left but the suburbs of Kyiv are still dangerous. Officers are working to clear towns of mines and shells left behind by Russian forces. And increasing numbers of people are checking into hospital after making contact with the unexploded munitions. This video can not be played Ukrainians injured or killed by unexploded ammunition The letter ""Z"" has become a staunchly pro-war symbol of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sported by politicians, athletes and others. BBC Russian reports that anti-war rock band DDT were set to perform at an auditorium in the central city of Tyumen, only to find ""a huge letter Z"" had been drawn inside the hall. The group's lead singer Yuri Shevchuk - who has spoken out against the war and Vladimir Putin several times - told a local journalist the group had refused to play at the site. He added that DDT had picked another site, without the letter Z, but had not been allowed to perform there either. Read more: Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war symbol? US Attorney General Merrick Garland has said American prosecutors are looking into evidence of potential war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine. At a news conference on Thursday, he said the US had been ""in contact with the Prosecutor General of Ukraine"", along with other international allies assisting in the effort. ""We are helping in the collection of evidence and the preservation of evidence relating to possible war crimes,"" said Garland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia has rejected a proposal for a ceasefire during Orthodox Easter, taking place on Sunday 24 April. Senior members of the clergy across the globe have been pressing the Russian Orthodox Church to condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Orthodox Church has not commented on the issue. In a video address, Zelensky said despite the rejected truce, he still harbours hopes for peace. The Kremlin has not confirmed the Ukrainian leader's claim. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments on the war in Ukraine: Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk apologised to residents of Mariupol for failed evacuation efforts from the besieged port city. In a Telegram post,external, she said ""everything is very complicated, chaotic, slow and, of course, dishonest"" from the Russian side. Ukrainian authorities have been trying to evacuate people from Mariupol throughout the conflict, and humanitarian efforts were often called off due to a lack of Russian cooperation, according to Ukraine. Vereshchuk said shelling near one of the evacuation collection points in the city forced Ukraine to close the humanitarian corridor to Zaporizhzhia. She added: ""we will not give up trying to get you out of there! Hold on!"". As we've been reporting, Ukraine hoped to evacuate 6,000 people on Wednesday but around 80 were able to make it to Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian officials estimate that 100,000 people are currently trapped in Mariupol. Some of the Mariupol residents arriving in Zaporizhzhia on Thursday Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down in early March The latest $800m (Â£612.5m) package for Ukraine includes ""dozens"" of howitzers - a type of artillery that fires shells at targets on high trajectories - as well as 144,000 rounds of ammunition and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. Other armaments sent so far include Switchblade drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky. In total, more than $3bn in military aid has been sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. ""Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well,"" Mr Biden said this week of US aid to Ukraine, in reference to the anti-tank weapon. Additionally, the Pentagon said on Thursday that it is giving Ukraine ""ghost drones"" - similar in capabilities to the Switchblade ""kamikaze drones"". A Pentagon official sid the weapons were ""rapidly developed by the Air Force in response specifically to Ukrainian requirements"". The range and specific capabilities of the ""ghost drones"", however, are not publicly known. The US has so far been reluctant to send Ukraine US-made tanks, arguing that Ukrainian troops aren't familiar with the vehicles. Similarly, while the US has so far committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, it has not directly sent aircraft to Ukraine and has described a plan to send Soviet-made Mig-29 jets from other countries - such as Poland - to Ukraine as untenable. Read more: What weapons has the US given Ukraine - and how much do they help? Russian forces have occupied 42 villages in the eastern Donetsk region today, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff has told national television. But the aide, Olena Symonenko. said Ukrainian forces might ""win them back tomorrow"". Russia is continuing its offensive in the Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk, attempting to expand its control within in the eastern regions. A US defence think tank said that Russian forces had made minor gains yesterday, taking parts of the key frontline towns of Rubizhne and Popasna. This video can not be played Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has told the BBC about the scale and the types of the crimes she and her team have been investigating since the Russian invasion began. She said there were some places they still could not visit because it was not safe, but that they have seen huge numbers of civilian deaths and evidence of torture and sexual crimes. A Ukrainian soldier guards a school in Borodyanka Addressing a forum of the World Bank and IMF remotely, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of threatening global food supplies with its invasion of Ukraine. Russia's blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea port cities has made it impossible for the country to export food supplies such as wheat, he said. Russia's war in Ukraine has seen food prices skyrocket in places that rely on grain exports from the country, such as Northern Africa. Zelensky added that Ukraine now needs approximately $7bn (Â£5.4bn) per month due to severe ""economic losses"" caused by the war. This is an increase from the $5bn Kyiv previously said was needed each month. He added that the ""Russian military are aimed at destroying all objects in Ukraine that can serve as an economic base for life. That includes railroad stations, food warehouses, [and] oil refineries."" So what does Putin's decision in Mariupol mean for the other theatres of conflict in Ukraine if the Donbas were to fall? It all depends on how the fight in the Donbas goes over the next two or three weeks, military expert Justin Crump says. ""That's why this period is so critical - based on that, you will either see a peace, a pause in conflict, or just a protracted ongoing war, and that depends on both sides of course,"" he says. Ultimately it will depend how well the Russians do against the Ukrainians there, he adds; it will define whether Putin settles for what he's got at that point, whether the Russians feel they've destroyed the heart of the Ukrainian military and showed Nato supplies aren't enough to hold them off - they can keep coming and take cities like Kharkiv. They still have 22 battlegroups north of Kyiv in Belarus, Crump says; they're being held there for a reason, Russia is keeping its options open for the rest of the country - but that could be very difficult if it loses a lot of forces in the Donbas, he adds. ""Mass burials of Mariupol residents killed by the Russian army"" aretaking place in a village nearby, the city council of the southern Ukrainian port says. In a statement, it says ""the occupiers are digging trenches about 30-metre (98ft) long and using dump lorries to bring the bodies"" to a site on the outskirts of the Manhush village, just to the west of the besieged city on the Sea of Azov coast. The Mariupol city council has posted an aerial photo purportedly showing the site, saying it ""is already twice as large as the nearby cemetery"". ""Almost 80 years ago, the Nazis shot dead 12,000 Mariupol residents in the village of Agrobaza. It is near Manhush. Not more than 13 km. History repeats itself again. Only instead of German fascists Russians have come,"" the statement says. The BBC has not independently verified the claim, and Russia has so far made no public comments on the issue. A photo by Mariupol's city council allegedly showing the site of mass grave (red square) near the city However, US technology company Maxar says that its recent high-resolution satellite imagery ""reveals the existence of a mass grave site on the north-western edge of Manhush, Ukraine (located approximately 20 km west of Mariupol) and adjacent to an existing village cemetery"". ""A review of our satellite images from mid-March through mid-April indicate that the expansion of the new set of graves began between 23-26 March, 2022, and has continued to expand over the past couple of weeks. ""The graves are aligned in four sections of linear rows (measuring approximately 85 metres per section) and contain more than 200 new graves,"" Maxar says. The American company has also posted a series of satellite images purportedly showing the expansion of a mass grave site near Mariupol. A satellite image of Maxar purportedly showing a mass grave site near Mariupol Paul AdamsDiplomatic Correspondent Western officials say they see some signs that Russia is addressing some of the problems that beset the early weeks of its invasion of Ukraine. The fact that they are trying to advance along a more narrow set of lines means that issues like command and control are better. But officials say the Russians are still operating in long convoys on single roads, which means they remain vulnerable to attack. Ukrainian troops, they say, âcontinue to fight in a very smart and very effective mannerâ. Some of the Russian lines of communication are still quite long (notably south from Kharkiv) and exposed to attack from the west. Officials say Vladimir Putin is âstill in a position to winâ, with a range of possible outcomes, none of which they expect to see happen quickly. The West is gearing up to sustain military support for Ukraine âthrough a prolonged period of conflictâ¦.perhaps much of the rest of this year"". A successful Russian campaign in the Donbas is possible and, in a worst case scenario, this could lead the Russians to revisit some of their pre-war objectives, such as Kyiv and Odesa. Officials say that Russian forces enjoy a roughly three to one advantage in numbers over the Ukrainian military, but much depends on how smartly Moscow uses those forces and what capabilities the Ukrainian defenders have - hence the push by the West to send even more advanced equipment. Russia still has large numbers of troops - between 5,000 and 10,000 - in the area around Mariupol, which means that there has been little or no movement on the southern side of Russiaâs expected pincer movement against Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. Officials say that if Putin wants to seal off Mariupol, this will not be a trivial task and will continue to limit the ability of those forces to take part in operations in the Donbas. Officials note that Russiaâs use of long-range Iskander missiles has slowed somewhat in the past week, suggesting Moscow has concerns about usage rates and the ability to restock. Aiden Aslin (pictured) and Shaun Pinner were both serving as marines in Ukraine's military We've heard todayfrom Russia's foreign ministry about the two British fightersreportedly captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine. ""Don't worry, the Russian side is taking care of them,"" said ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova in a message on Telegram. ""They are fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance, just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained."" Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28,were shown in two separate videos on Russian TV on Monday,asking to be exchanged with a pro-Russian politician held in Ukraine. It was not clear whether their requests were made under duress. Both had been living in Ukraine before it was invaded, have Ukrainian partners and had been serving as marines in Ukraine's military. Russia says they were taken prisoner in the southern city of Mariupol. Aslin's family said on Wednesday the video of him was""deeply distressing""and condemned ""Russian propaganda"". In comments addressed to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Zakharova said: ""Don't pretend to be worried. You have absolutely no interest in the fate of the British in trouble. They did not have fun with you at parties in Downing Street."" Three school buses filled with people escaping from the besieged southern city of Mariupol have arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia further west. Only 79 people were able to travel on the convoy because of the difficulties in setting up humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian officials said People crossed through territory held by Russian forces to get to safety There were emotional scenes as people met relatives and friends at a registration centre for internally displaced people in Zaporizhzhia The convoy was carrying people from Mariupol, Melitopol and surrounding towns under Russian control  If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments on the war in Ukraine:  Of the 71,800 Ukrainian refugees who have been granted visas, only 21,600 have actually arrived
in the UK, government figures show. This may be because some are still waiting for
their family membersâ applications to be approved, or they have decided to stay somewhere closer to Ukraine. The visas were issued under the Ukraine Family
Scheme - which Ukrainians with a family member in the UK can apply for - and
the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - which allows people already living
in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees known to them. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has been widely criticised because of delays, withHome
Secretary Priti Patel apologisingfor the âfrustratingâ lags in the scheme. Processing delays mean some Ukrainian refugees wait almost

It's not time for NZ to join Aukus pact - ArdernNew Zealand's PM tells the BBC in an exclusive interview she'll work with China where possible.,"This video can not be played One on one with Jacinda Ardern New Zealand has been aware for some time now of a ""growing assertiveness"" and a ""growing interest"" in its region - explicitly from China, according to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. But Ms Ardern also spoke of the need to work together with China, on areas of ""natural mutual interest"". Speaking to the BBC in an exclusive broadcast interview, she stood by what she called her country's ""mature relationship"" with Beijing, but still expressed her ""disappointment"" that the Solomon Islands had cemented a security deal with China,fuelling fears Beijing could set up a military base on the island. There is already an agreement signed by Pacific Island forum members called the ""Biketawa"" declaration, she said  - which sets an expectation these countries provide for their own security needs together as a region. ""One of the reasons we've expressed this disappointment [is]... Australia and New Zealand both have heeded the call of the Solomons for support during recent disruption,"" she said. ""And we've again highlighted that should any extended need exist, we are there to help and support. Soâ¦ what gap remains that requires such an agreement with China?"" Despite her reservations however, Ms Ardern rejected the ideathat it was time for New Zealand to join the US, UK, and Australia in the Aukus security allianceto help ward off China's influence in the region. ""Our call on Aukus is simply that yes, it is to our benefit when we have greater engagement,"" she said. ""We've asked the US to take an interest in the economic architecture of our region, it can't just be about defence and security arrangements,"" she said. The Solomon Islands has seen rioting and political unrest in recent months ""It should be about the wellbeing of the region as a whole. And you're starting to see a response from the US on that front."" New Zealand has been criticised for not taking a harder line on China. Ms Adern's administration's position has been that New Zealand will form its own bilateral relationship with China - which critics say is because of economic dependence. Most recently the government came under firefor agreeing to extradite Kyung Yup Kim, a New Zealand permanent resident accused of murdering a young woman in Shanghai in 2009. But Ms Ardern defended Wellington's relationship with Beijing. ""China is a very important trading partner for us, but it's also a mature relationship for us. Where there are areas we can work together, we will - but there will always be areas in which we will not necessarily agree and when those areas arise, we are very forthright and clear on our position."" One of the areas where New Zealand has been particularly vocal internationally has been the war in Ukraine. It has sent military and financial aid, and imposed sanctions on Russia. Ms Ardern says that's because small nations need to rely on the international order to be upheld, and that when the international order is threatened - it ""threatens everyone, including New Zealand"". But it isn't useful to turn this into a war of ideology, she said - refusing to frame it as a conflict between autocracies and democracies. ""Let's not be quick to create a binary situation between two differing schisms in the world. It is Russia, who has perpetrated this, it is Russia who must be spoken firmly against, and let's do everything we can diplomatically to ensure that that doesn't grow beyond Russia."" Separately the prime minister also defended New Zealand's Covid response, saying that it was the ""best possible health response"" at the time - given that New Zealand has had some of the lowest death rates amongst developed OECD economies. But Ms Ardern has been criticised by her political opponents - her policies have been called ""bumbling"" and her government has accused of being ""asleep at the wheel"" - for failing to move the country out of lockdown faster. New Zealand has had some of the tightest Covid restrictions in the world That's led in recent surveys to her lowest approval ratings since she was elected. Ms Ardern was non-plussed - saying that the lower ratings were perhaps a price she had to pay, to keep New Zealanders safe, ""to ultimately make sure that we've made the right decisions along the way, and that we can sleep at night"". Ms Ardern's leadership style has been the subject of much debate - her fans say she is the real deal, authentic and empathetic, just what a politician should and can be. Her critics however, say it's more talk than action, more style than substance - and that she struggles to manifest the commitments she's made to her people. Ms Ardern (right) told the BBC she didn't have a lot of time to plan a wedding... The New Zealand leader's response was characteristically straightforward. ""I'm just being myself,"" she said. ""I want to the best of my ability, model the traits that I consider important enough to teach my own daughterâ¦ like kindness, gratitude."" New Zealand to scrap some Covid vaccine mandates China deal in Pacific stokes Australian fears ""I would like to think that we can see a new range of leadership traits being modelled where kindness isn't seen as weakness, where empathy is actually how we understand our decisions impact on our people. And when we start to model those, I hope then that within the public, they see a little bit more of themselves."" And what about wedding bells? As a world leader grappling with the pandemic, she's had to put off her wedding because of her job. Ms Ardern is honest about the pressures of public life. ""Travelling again, doesn't mean there's a lot of time for wedding planning,"" she said. ""So, no set date. Just intention. And that's, I think, when you live together, have a child together - just intention is enough."" China deal in Pacific stokes Australian fears Is the Five Eyes alliance in trouble?

$50bn wiped off Netflixâs value as subscribers quitShares in the streaming service company slumped 35% as it warned of tough times ahead.BusinessComments,"One of Netflix most popular series, Bridgerton, launched its second series last month Shares in Netflix have slumped by 35% after it revealed a sharp drop in subscribers and warned millions more are set to quit the streaming service. It wiped more than $50bn off the firm's market value as experts warned it faced a struggle to get back on track. Netflix faces intense competition from streaming rivals, but was also hit after it raised prices and left Russia. Yet some cast doubt on its plans to boost growth, which include bringing in a free ad-supported service. It also plans to crack down on password sharing, estimating that more than 100 million non-paying households watch the service this way. In a sign of the unease, one of America's best known investors, William Ackman, ditched his $1.1bn investment in Netflix on Wednesday, taking a loss of more than $400m. Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown Antiques stolen during filming of The Crown His hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management had bought the shares just three months ago. In a brief statement, Mr Ackman said that while Netflix's plans to change its business model made sense, investing in the company felt too risky. ""While Netflix's business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company's future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,"" he wrote. In a trading update on Tuesday, Netflix said its total number of subscribers had fallen by 200,000 in the first three months of 2022, falling well short of its target. It also said some two million more were likely to quit the service in the three months to July. Some analysts warned that, after period of turbo-charged expansion during the pandemic, the streaming giant has run out of easy ways to grow. Squeezed consumers are cutting back on streaming services to save money, while some feel there is too much content to choose from amid an avalanche of competition from rivals such as Disney and Amazon. ""Netflix's wider problem, along with the rest of the sector is that consumers don't have unlimited funds, and that one or two subscriptions is usually enough,"" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. ""Once you move above that something has to give in a cost-of-living crisis, and while Netflix is still the market leader, it doesn't have the deeper pockets of Apple, Amazon or Disney, which makes it much more vulnerable to a margin squeeze."" But Julian Aquilina, senior TV analyst at the media research firm Enders Analysis, said it was wrong to write the firm off. ""The streaming market is maturing and the high expectations people had about Netflix are being reset. ""But I think it will remain the market leader, it has such a commanding position. If people are going to ditch a subscription, Netflix won't be the first one they choose."" He added that the firm had just put up its prices ""which always leads to a drop in subscribers, but also means it's making more revenue per customer"". Netflix remains the world's leading streaming service with more than 220 million subscribers. It is increasingly producing its own content and shows such as the Crown, Bridgerton and Squid Game have been global hits. The firm had enjoyed uninterrupted quarterly growth in subscribers since October 2011 but on Tuesday it admitted it was losing customers to rivals, while struggling to expand due to password sharing. It also said a decision to raise prices in key markets had cost it 600,000 subscribers in North America alone, while its exit from Russia over Ukraine lost it 700,000. Despite the challenges, revenue grew by $7.8bn (Â£6bn) in the first three months of the year, up 9.8% compared with the same period last year. That marked a slowdown from earlier quarters, while profits fell more than 6% to roughly $1.6bn. Netflix's shares plunged 35% on Wednesday, and fell a further 3.5% on Thursday.

Depp says ex-wife abused and demeaned him,"Johnny Depp has sought to paint ex-wife Amber Heard as a volatile spouse who abused and demeaned him. The actor, 58, has sued Ms Heard over an article she wrote saying she was a victim of domestic violence. Mr Depp has denied any abuse. Ms Heard, 35, has sued him in return, with a $100m (Â£76m) counterclaim. In his testimony, Mr Depp said he felt ""pure hatred"" from Ms Heard. Cross-examination from her lawyers began on Wednesday after two days of testimony. His testimony is set to resume into a third day on Thursday. After the romance of their first year together soured, the pair argued regularly, he said, with Ms Heard frequently issuing a ""sarcastic, demeaning, aggressive, violent, toxic spew"", and occasionally resorting to violence. ""It could begin with a slap,"" Mr Depp said. ""It could begin with throwing a TV remote at my head. It could be throwing a glass of wine in my face."" ""She has a need for conflict. She has a need for violence,"" he said. And in recordings of the former couple played to the jury on Wednesday, Ms Heard can be heard admitting she ""did start a physical fight"" with Mr Depp. Mr Depp also recalled a now-infamous incident between him and his former wife, in which he found ""human fecal matter"" on his side of the bed in the flat he shared with Ms Heard. ""It was so bizarre and so grotesque, that I could only laugh,"" he said. Ms Heard has denied that she or any of her friends left human excrement on the bed, testifying in Mr Depp's 2018 defamation trial in the UK that the idea was ""absolutely disgusting"". Jurors in the closely watched civil trial, which is taking place in Virginia, have heard two wildly different accounts of Mr Depp and Ms Heard's relationship. Lawyers for Ms Heard have so far worked to portray Mr Depp as a physically and sexually abusive partner prone to drug and alcohol binges. Mr Depp addressed his drug and alcohol use on Wednesday, saying he had become addicted to prescription opioids after receiving Roxycodone for a back injury. The actor testified that while detoxing from the drugs, Ms Heard withheld medication from him that would have relieved symptoms of withdrawal because she said it was not time for the next dose. The actor said he rolled on the floor, in tears, and begged. ""I hate saying this, having to admit this, but that was about the lowest point in my life."" As Johnny Depp settled down for day two on the witness stand there was only the briefest glance across the court towards where his ex-wife Amber Heard was sitting. Throughout it all she sat watching intently, occasionally writing a few notes as Mr Depp began to describe his views about their relationship - a relationship she says was violent and abusive. On day one of his testimony, his answers at the beginning had been marked by hesitations and long searches for the right words. The Johnny Depp of day two was immediately rather more fluent as he described how their marriage disintegrated and how he felt her behaviour had become controlling and belittling. It was, he said, an ""endless parade of insults and looking at me like I was a fool"". ""I was not allowed a voice."" The reason for the long description on the previous day of his problematic relationship with his mother now began to make sense. The criticisms from Ms Heard and his responses to it made him realise he was in a relationship with his ""mother"". There was a little smile as he reflected on what he had said. He also talked about celebrity and the impossibility of dealing with everything that was written about him. ""Your arms are too short to box with God,"" he said. His drinking was, he said, a means of dealing with the pain of the relationship. It was Ms Heard who would strike him, he claimed. He would retreat, booking extra rooms when they were travelling so he had a place to escape. As they rose for recess, he looked straight ahead. Ms Heard watched, her face giving nothing away. Her side of the story is yet to be told. Under cross-examination, Ms Heard's lawyer Ben Rottenborn had Mr Depp confirm that his name is not mentioned in the 2018 op-ed in question. ""I think that it's very easy to write a piece and put the finger on someone without saying their name,"" Mr Depp replied. ""There are sneaky ways of writing things."" The lawyer also asked why Mr Depp did not sue after Ms Heard accused him of assault in a restraining order two years earlier, in May 2016. ""I was advised by my attorney not to fight,"" Mr Depp said. Mr Rottenborn additionally introduced into evidence a divorce document the couple signed in August 2016 that stated: ""Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain."" The defamation trial is now into its second week. Earlier, the jury heard evidence presented by the celebrity ex-couple's former therapist, who described how Mr Depp and Ms Heard engaged in ""mutual abuse"", as well as from medical workers who treated Mr Depp as he was detoxing himself from opiates. Several high profile witnesses, including the entrepreneur Elon Musk and the actors James Franco and Paul Bettany, are to appear later in the trial, which is expected to last at least another month.

Please join us at this webpagefor all the latest. Russian state media reports that Russian forces have seized identifying information on all of Ukraine's special security services (SBU) personnel in the Kherson region. According to the Ria Novosti news agency, a cache of documents abandoned by SBU employees fleeing the region fell into the hands of Russian troops. The recovered documents contained names and photos, some of which were published in full by the outlet. Ria Novosti also alleges that the SBU includes special forces trained in sabotage and reconnaissance, and working for the government. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Toby LuckhurstReporting from Lviv It was a moment of defiance that summed up the spirit of a
nation â when defenders of a small Ukrainian island, ordered to surrender by
the Russian warship Moskva, told the vessel to go away (in more
colourful language than we can report here). Ukraine has now immortalised the moment with limited
edition commemorative postal stamps. Theyâve quickly become the must-have collectible across the country. Julia Aurora Ogorodnyk is a food writer in Lviv. She was in
her car when she heard on the radio that the first ones had been released. She
went to the post office first thing the next morning, and just in time - only
four were left. Julia shows off the stamps Knowing how popular they were proving, she had them stamped with the date, making them more valuable by showing they were part of the first batch released. âItâs more unique,â she said. That same day, reports emerged that the Moskva had sunk. âSo now itâs even more valuable!â she says. She doesnât plan to sell them, at least not yet â sheâll save them for herself, and might put them on display at home. âItâs a symbol of how a small person can resist huge forces â and make them regret it!â You can read morehereabout the Moskva warship and its encounter with the Snake Island soldiers.

BBC Russian reports that anti-war rock band DDT were set to perform at an auditorium in the central city of Tyumen, only to find ""a huge letter Z"" had been drawn inside the hall. The group's lead singer Yuri Shevchuk - who has spoken out against the war and Vladimir Putin several times - told a local journalist the group had refused to play at the site. He added that DDT had picked another site, without the letter Z, but had not been allowed to perform there either. Read more: Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war symbol? US Attorney General Merrick Garland has said American prosecutors are looking into evidence of potential war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine. At a news conference on Thursday, he said the US had been ""in contact with the Prosecutor General of Ukraine"", along with other international allies assisting in the effort. ""We are helping in the collection of evidence and the preservation of evidence relating to possible war crimes,"" said Garland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia has rejected a proposal for a ceasefire during Orthodox Easter, taking place on Sunday 24 April. Senior members of the clergy across the globe have been pressing the Russian Orthodox Church to condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Orthodox Church has not commented on the issue. In a video address, Zelensky said despite the rejected truce, he still harbours hopes for peace. The Kremlin has not confirmed the Ukrainian leader's claim. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments on the war in Ukraine: Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk apologised to residents of Mariupol for failed evacuation efforts from the besieged port city. In a Telegram post,external, she said ""everything is very complicated, chaotic, slow and, of course, dishonest"" from the Russian side. Ukrainian authorities have been trying to evacuate people from Mariupol throughout the conflict, and humanitarian efforts were often called off due to a lack of Russian cooperation, according to Ukraine. Vereshchuk said shelling near one of the evacuation collection points in the city forced Ukraine to close the humanitarian corridor to Zaporizhzhia. She added: ""we will not give up trying to get you out of there! Hold on!"". As we've been reporting, Ukraine hoped to evacuate 6,000 people on Wednesday but around 80 were able to make it to Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian officials estimate that 100,000 people are currently trapped in Mariupol. Some of the Mariupol residents arriving in Zaporizhzhia on Thursday Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down in early March The latest $800m (Â£612.5m) package for Ukraine includes ""dozens"" of howitzers - a type of artillery that fires shells at targets on high trajectories - as well as 144,000 rounds of ammunition and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. Other armaments sent so far include Switchblade drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky. In total, more than $3bn in military aid has been sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. ""Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well,"" Mr Biden said this week of US aid to Ukraine, in reference to the anti-tank weapon. Additionally, the Pentagon said on Thursday that it is giving Ukraine ""ghost drones"" - similar in capabilities to the Switchblade ""kamikaze drones"". A Pentagon official sid the weapons were ""rapidly developed by the Air Force in response specifically to Ukrainian requirements"". The range and specific capabilities of the ""ghost drones"", however, are not publicly known. The US has so far been reluctant to send Ukraine US-made tanks, arguing that Ukrainian troops aren't familiar with the vehicles. Similarly, while the US has so far committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, it has not directly sent aircraft to Ukraine and has described a plan to send Soviet-made Mig-29 jets from other countries - such as Poland - to Ukraine as untenable.

She said there were some places they still could not visit because it was not safe, but that they have seen huge numbers of civilian deaths and evidence of torture and sexual crimes. A Ukrainian soldier guards a school in Borodyanka Addressing a forum of the World Bank and IMF remotely, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of threatening global food supplies with its invasion of Ukraine. Russia's blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea port cities has made it impossible for the country to export food supplies such as wheat, he said. Russia's war in Ukraine has seen food prices skyrocket in places that rely on grain exports from the country, such as Northern Africa. Zelensky added that Ukraine now needs approximately $7bn (Â£5.4bn) per month due to severe ""economic losses"" caused by the war. This is an increase from the $5bn Kyiv previously said was needed each month. He added that the ""Russian military are aimed at destroying all objects in Ukraine that can serve as an economic base for life. That includes railroad stations, food warehouses, [and] oil refineries."" So what does Putin's decision in Mariupol mean for the other theatres of conflict in Ukraine if the Donbas were to fall? It all depends on how the fight in the Donbas goes over the next two or three weeks, military expert Justin Crump says. ""That's why this period is so critical - based on that, you will either see a peace, a pause in conflict, or just a protracted ongoing war, and that depends on both sides of course,"" he says. Ultimately it will depend how well the Russians do against the Ukrainians there, he adds; it will define whether Putin settles for what he's got at that point, whether the Russians feel they've destroyed the heart of the Ukrainian military and showed Nato supplies aren't enough to hold them off - they can keep coming and take cities like Kharkiv. They still have 22 battlegroups north of Kyiv in Belarus, Crump says; they're being held there for a reason, Russia is keeping its options open for the rest of the country - but that could be very difficult if it loses a lot of forces in the Donbas, he adds. ""Mass burials of Mariupol residents killed by the Russian army"" aretaking place in a village nearby, the city council of the southern Ukrainian port says. In a statement, it says ""the occupiers are digging trenches about 30-metre (98ft) long and using dump lorries to bring the bodies"" to a site on the outskirts of the Manhush village, just to the west of the besieged city on the Sea of Azov coast. The Mariupol city council has posted an aerial photo purportedly showing the site, saying it ""is already twice as large as the nearby cemetery"". ""Almost 80 years ago, the Nazis shot dead 12,000 Mariupol residents in the village of Agrobaza. It is near Manhush. Not more than 13 km. History repeats itself again. Only instead of German fascists Russians have come,"" the statement says. The BBC has not independently verified the claim, and Russia has so far made no public comments on the issue. A photo by Mariupol's city council allegedly showing the site of mass grave (red square) near the city However, US technology company Maxar says that its recent high-resolution satellite imagery ""reveals the existence of a mass grave site on the north-western edge of Manhush, Ukraine (located approximately 20 km west of Mariupol) and adjacent to an existing village cemetery"". ""A review of our satellite images from mid-March through mid-April indicate that the expansion of the new set of graves began between 23-26 March, 2022, and has continued to expand over the past couple of weeks. ""The graves are aligned in four sections of linear rows (measuring approximately 85 metres per section) and contain more than 200 new graves,"" Maxar says. The American company has also posted a series of satellite images purportedly showing the expansion of a mass grave site near Mariupol. A satellite image of Maxar purportedly showing a mass grave site near Mariupol Paul AdamsDiplomatic Correspondent Western officials say they see some signs that Russia is addressing some of the problems that beset the early weeks of its invasion of Ukraine. The fact that they are trying to advance along a more narrow set of lines means that issues like command and control are better. But officials say the Russians are still operating in long convoys on single roads, which means they remain vulnerable to attack. Ukrainian troops, they say, âcontinue to fight in a very smart and very effective mannerâ. Some of the Russian lines of communication are still quite long (notably south from Kharkiv) and exposed to attack from the west. Officials say Vladimir Putin is âstill in a position to winâ, with a range of possible outcomes, none of which they expect to see happen quickly. The West is gearing up to sustain military support for Ukraine âthrough a prolonged period of conflictâ¦.perhaps much of the rest of this year"". A successful Russian campaign in the Donbas is possible and, in a worst case scenario, this could lead the Russians to revisit some of their pre-war objectives, such as Kyiv and Odesa. Officials say that Russian forces enjoy a roughly three to one advantage in numbers over the Ukrainian military, but much depends on how smartly Moscow uses those forces and what capabilities the Ukrainian defenders have - hence the push by the West to send even more advanced equipment. Russia still has large numbers of troops - between 5,000 and 10,000 - in the area around Mariupol, which means that there has been little or no movement on the southern side of Russiaâs expected pincer movement against Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. Officials say that if Putin wants to seal off Mariupol, this will not be a trivial task and will continue to limit the ability of those forces to take part in operations in the Donbas. Officials note that Russiaâs use of long-range Iskander missiles has slowed somewhat in the past week, suggesting Moscow has concerns about usage rates and the ability to restock. Aiden Aslin (pictured) and Shaun Pinner were both serving as marines in Ukraine's military We've heard todayfrom Russia's foreign ministry about the two British fightersreportedly captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine. ""Don't worry, the Russian side is taking care of them,"" said ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova in a message on Telegram. ""They are fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance, just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained."" Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28,were shown in two separate videos on Russian TV on Monday,asking to be exchanged with a pro-Russian politician held in Ukraine. It was not clear whether their requests were made under duress. Both had been living in Ukraine before it was invaded, have Ukrainian partners and had been serving as marines in Ukraine's military. Russia says they were taken prisoner in the southern city of Mariupol. Aslin's family said on Wednesday the video of him was""deeply distressing""and condemned ""Russian propaganda"". In comments addressed to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Zakharova said: ""Don't pretend to be worried. You have absolutely no interest in the fate of the British in trouble. They did not have fun with you at parties in Downing Street."" Three school buses filled with people escaping from the besieged southern city of Mariupol have arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia further west. Only 79 people were able to travel on the convoy because of the difficulties in setting up humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian officials said People crossed through territory held by Russian forces to get to safety There were emotional scenes as people met relatives and friends at a registration centre for internally displaced people in Zaporizhzhia The convoy was carrying people from Mariupol, Melitopol and surrounding towns under Russian control  If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments on the war in Ukraine:  Of the 71,800 Ukrainian refugees who have been granted visas, only 21,600 have actually arrived
in the UK, government figures show. This may be because some are still waiting for
their family membersâ applications to be approved, or they have decided to stay somewhere closer to Ukraine. The visas were issued under the Ukraine Family
Scheme - which Ukrainians with a family member in the UK can apply for - and
the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - which allows people already living
in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees known to them. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has been widely criticised because of delays, withHome
Secretary Priti Patel apologisingfor the âfrustratingâ lags in the scheme. Processing delays mean some Ukrainian refugees wait almost
three weeks for their visas to be approved. In an email to those registered in the scheme, the government acknowledged the âunacceptableâ delays and explained they were now ""working to accelerate the award of visas
under Homes for Ukraine"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Mariupol fighters' relatives tell of bitter prideIn maps: Ukraine repels Russian advances in Donbas,"Olena's cousin is fighting in Mariupol Olena Nikulina pauses, her eyes welling up. ""I was thinking what would happen if I would receive a message that Maks has died, what would I do?"", she says. ""And I just started crying in the middle of the street because I don't have any answer to that."" We are sitting in the office of her volunteer centre in Kyiv, where boxes of supplies - food, medical kits and armoured vests - are being gathered to be sent off to Ukrainian forces on the eastern front: the epicentre of the Russian offensive. Her sense of purpose is twofold: her nation and her family, with her 26-year-old cousin Maksim, or Maks for short, fighting in Mariupol. The boy she grew up with, whom she describes as a kind and respectful engineering student, is one of the last remaining Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steel plant in the city, somehow withstanding the ferocious firepower of one of the world's biggest armies. Perhaps a couple of thousand soldiers and civilians are there, in the Cold War-era network of bunkers and tunnels, where food, water and time are running out. For more than a month she had no word from him but spoke to him briefly this week. ""He never told us about the real conditions, probably he didn't want to upset us"", she says. ""But they have very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers."" Growing up in Sumy, north-eastern Ukraine, Maks's mother - Olena's aunt - wanted him to join the army, calling it ""a school of life for men"". When he was called to fight in Mariupol, she was initially relieved, thinking the city, a little further along the coast from the occupied territories of the Donbas, would be spared the worst. But Russia is determined to establish a land corridor through eastern Ukraine to Crimea - and that would have to run through Mariupol. And so Russian forces have besieged it for some seven weeks. Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky said tens of thousands may have died in the city. This video can not be played Watch: Olena Nikulina says her cousin has become ""a true hero of Ukraine"" ""I feel terrible about him being there"", says Olena, struggling to hold back her tears. ""First of all, I feel very sorry about not speaking to him as much as I could while we still had a connection. It felt terrible when my aunt sent me a message at 06:00 to say that Maks' friend was probably dead and she's so worried about him."" I ask of the pride she must feel towards the boy who used to drive her in his car - and became a Ukrainian fighter who refused Russia's demands to surrender. ""I would have never imagined my cousin to become a true hero of Ukraine and of Mariupol"", she replies with a smile. ""It's obviously a very bitter sense of pride in the sense that he's in a life-threatening situation. I dream of the day he will return and I will be able to tell this to him."" On the shelves in the volunteer centre are spoils of war: Russian soldiers' equipment, downed missiles and fragments of a Russian fighter jet that the Ukrainians proudly exhibit as symbols of an invasion that has so far not gone Moscow's way. But the Kremlin will surely be determined that the eastern offensive does not repeat the mistakes of the west, from where Russian troops have now retreated. Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought likely to want a tangible gain by 9 May - the annual commemoration of Victory Day against Nazi Germany - and Mariupol could serve him that. That's a fear shared by another relative, Vladimir Vasilyuk, whose 23-year-old son Danilo is also fighting in the Azovstal plant. They're still in regular contact. ""The boys are lacking ammunition"", Vladimir says, ""but they don't want to leave because they're protecting the civilians - they don't want to abandon them."" Russian service equipment on show at the volunteer centre His composed, almost impassive look begins to break as he talks more of his only child, lowering his eyes with a sharp intake of breath. ""I don't sleep at night"", he admits. ""If I had a chance to go there, I would. I don't think the city is worth the loss of his life. But the boys made their choice. ""Maybe it's my fault that he joined the army, because I always took him to training and I prepared him for it"", he adds. ""His main goal was always to make our country better."" We stand beneath a monument in Kyiv covered up by sandbags spray painted in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. The bells of the golden-domed St Michael's Church chime five. ""I am sure we will see each other again"", Vladimir says, ""it's a matter of time. But if I could pass a message to him now it would be that I love him and I'm waiting for him.""

Women wear less make-up since the pandemic,"Charlie uses fewer cosmetics than she used to ""Before, you wouldn't have caught me picking up a pint of milk without my face on,"" says Charlie, who works for a training business. But then the pandemic struck and now she just doesn't wear as much as she used to, even to work. ""I was stuck at home furloughed with two kids, my husband was away, so I spent a lot of time outside without make-up on, and realised no one cares,"" she explains. Charlie feels the pandemic has given her the confidence to embrace a more natural look. And it seems she's not alone. The use of cosmetics was already declining before 2020, but a survey of 10,000 British women by market research firm Kantar has revealed big changes to post-lockdown beauty routines. Make-up purchases and frequency of wearing products has dropped steeply in the last two years, by almost a third, it suggests. Colleagues of Charlie's at Rhino Safety, on the outskirts of Sandbach in Cheshire, agree. Director Cate Walter admits she splurges on getting her nails and eyebrows done. But her daily regime is minimal; a bit of blusher and maybe mascara for a day in the office. ""I just don't want to look ill,"" she jokes. Although the business has a relaxed feel, Cate says she has definitely noticed a change since staff started working remotely. ""You do not need to spend as much time on your appearance, especially as you're potentially only seen from the waist up anyway,"" she says, adding that being fully made-up is not something she, nor many clients, expect. ""I'm not going to expect you to be in a full face of make-up and a suit when you're essentially sat at your kitchen table,"" she says. Kantar surveyed 300,000 women worldwide, as well as looking at spending data, and found that British women have made the biggest change in their grooming habits in recent years. Cate Walter says she doesn't expect staff to wear a lot of make-up especially if they are working from home ""Manufacturers are going to struggle and they're really going to have to work harder to get our money from us,"" said Kantar analyst Maya Zawislak. Their research shows a 19% fall in make-up sales since 2019, but the pandemic is only part of the story. Ms Zawislak adds that a looming cost-of-living crisis could also affect what consumers buy. The cosmetics industry is struggling on two fronts. As the squeeze on all our budgets really starts to bite people are looking for ways to cut their spending. But the pandemic has also given some women the self-confidence to try going make-up free, or to let their hair go grey. Skin care products have not seen the same decline as cosmetics though, as we've moisturised with enthusiasm after all the anti-bac gel. And self-care has become an important buzz word in these difficult times. Overall it seems people are reluctant to spend on what might be seen as frivolous, but happier to splurge on something that feels like it's doing them good. Historically, economists would say that lipstick sales thrive during difficult economic times. Typically, this little luxury might have been a way for cash-strapped consumers to treat themselves. But this time the use of masks and remote working has seen the sale of red lip products fall by 40%. The boss of Boots in the UK, Sebastian James, told the BBC his chain had seen the same trend. ""Over the pandemic we saw a lot less colour cosmetics in our trade, lipsticks and so on, and a lot more spend on self care , so skin care, haircare, and particularly what we call expert skin care,"" he told the Today programme. ""Certainly year-on-year we're well up in [our beauty sales] but definitely people are buying different stuff."" Pandemic fashion: 'From sequins to sweatpants' 'My closed hair salons cost me Â£1,000 a day' On the other hand, rather than just buying less, some people have switched to different products. ""I probably buy less now, but maybe higher-end price products,"" says Charlie's colleague, Julie Hopwood. Julie uses a tinted moisturiser plus a bit of eye-shadow. ""I think eyes did become more important when we were all wearing masks,"" she explains, adding that she has felt inspired to try new things, watching tutorials online during lockdown. Both Julie and Charlie spend about half an hour getting ready for work and maybe an hour at the weekend. Changes to their morning routine mean they can spend time going to the gym or with family instead. The relaxation of what we wear to work started long before the pandemic for many sectors. But it appears to have accelerated during the pandemic, so much so that last monththe Office for National Statistics removed men's suitsfrom their ""typical"" basket of consumer goods. The question for the cosmetic industry, and for related areas such as workwear, is whether these new habits will stay or fade as fashions and behaviours shift. Sarah Finn, for one, hopes they stick. ""I used to be the odd one out, because I didn't wear make-up,"" she says. ""I get up, get showered and I'm out of the door."" Now, no-one else seems to be wearing make-up either, says Sarah, and possibly, like her, they'll decide they'd rather keep the morning lie-in.

Tory donorâs âlinkâ to sanctioned oligarchâs business,"Lubov Chernukhin, nee Golubeva A major Conservative Party donor was listed as a director of a company secretly owned by a Russian oligarch close to President Putin. The BBC has seen a document dated 2006 and signed ""Lubov Golubeva"", the maiden name of Lubov Chernukhin, a Tory donor. Mrs Chernukhin says she ""does not recall consenting in writing"" to being a director of Suleiman Kerimov's firm. Mr Kerimov, now sanctioned, previously denied any connection with Mrs Chernukhin. Papers seen by the BBC appear to show that Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, was appointed a director of offshore company Radlett Estates Limited, in 2005 - following its acquisition of a substantial property, 1 Radlett Place, in north London. Another firm - Swiru Holding AG - was the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates. The directors of Radlett Estates were Swiss businessman Alexander Studhalter and Suleiman Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Studhalter was accused in a French courtof being a so-called ""straw man"", or proxy, for Mr Kerimov - involved in hiding the oligarch's wealth. Radlett Estates had planned to demolish the building and construct a new 3,500 sq-ft (325 sq-m) home. According to architects' plans, there was to be a cinema, a health spa and gym, indoor swimming pool, a map room, six bedrooms and a ""6 car motorised garage and large staff quarters"". Mr Kerimov and his wife were not listed as directors of Radlett Estates and their names were not on the planning documents seen by the BBC. But one designer's website identified the clients as ""Mr and Mrs K"". The signature ""Lubov Golubeva"" appears on a Radlett Estates board meeting document from 2006. It records her resignation from the company. Radlett Estates Ltd 2006 document showing ""Lubov Golubeva"" signature In 2007, Ms Golubeva married Vladimir Chernukhin - a multimillionaire businessman who had served under President Putin as a junior minister, but later fled Russia. The same year, she started giving money to the Conservative Party - initially in Â£5,000 donations under her maiden name. As time went on, the donations - in her married name - became much bigger. She would end up becoming one of the Tory party's most influential donors - having given more than Â£2.1m. The discovery of the evidence suggesting a business connection between Mrs Chernukhin and Mr Kerimov follows questions in Parliament about her and her links to Russia. This was despite Mrs Chernukhin's condemnation of ""Russian military aggression in Ukraine"" where she called for ""the strongest possible sanctions against Putin's regime and its enablers"". Earlier this month, the BBC - as part of the Pandora Papers Russia project with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and global partners -revealed how Suleiman Kerimov has been hiding his wealth. Vladimir Chernukhin Lubov Chernukhin's husband Vladimir was in the Russian government between 2000 and 2002. He was then appointed chairman of a state bank by Mr Putin, but left Russia after being dismissed by the president in 2004. But in a 2018 court case, his wife confirmed that Mr Chernukhin had maintained ""excellent"" relationships with ""prominent members of the Russian establishment"". Mr Chernukhin said he arrived in the UK with a fortune of $300m (Â£230m) and started building a ""real estate empire"". Both he and his wife are now UK citizens - which means she is entitled to donate to a political party. In February, she was reported to be a member of a small ""advisory board"" of major donors with access to senior party members, including the prime minister. In 2019, she paid Â£135,000 to attend a ladies' night dinner attended by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, and then-Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, who is now foreign secretary with responsibility for sanctions against Russia.

In 2020, the BBC revealed howMr Chernukhin had been secretly funded with $8mby a company linked to Mr Kerimov four years previously - before Mr Kerimov was first sanctioned by the US. At that time, her lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from Mr Kerimov or any company related to him"" and her ""donations to the Conservative Party have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence"". Lawyers for Mr Kerimov said he had had ""no dealings whatsoever"" with Mrs Chernukhin. Suleiman Kerimov Suleiman Kerimov was among a dozen billionaires called to stand alongside President Putin as Russia's tanks rolled into Ukraine in February. The businessman has been estimated to be worth more than $14bn. Mr Kerimov has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 - and since March by the EU and UK. The EU described him as ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Mr Putin. In 2017, Mr Kerimov was arrested in France over his alleged role in laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case related to French properties which investigators believed were owned by Mr Kerimov - his ownership hidden by Alexander Studhalter acting as a proxy for the oligarch. Mr Studhalter denies being the ""straw man"" for Mr Kerimov and says he was the real owner of the properties through a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG. But - according to secret French Court of Appeal records seen by the BBC - bank documents showed Mr Studhalter was holding shares in Swiru Holding on behalf of Mr Kerimov and his nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Hidden wealth of one of Putinâs 'inner circle' revealed A simple guide to the Pandora Papers FinCEN Files: All you need to know about the documents leak Mr Kerimov and Mr Studhalter did not respond to our questions about the ownership of 1 Radlett Place, which was sold to another offshore company in 2012 for Â£36.5m. Mr and Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never been a director of Radlett"". She had, they said, been approached in relation to the ""Radlett Project"" in her capacity as a director of another business called Capital Construction Development Limited - a company then owned by her husband - and ""asked to submit a pitch"". The project did not proceed, they said. The BBC has seen conflicting evidence of Mrs Chernukhin's relationship with Radlett Estates Limited. An email in December 2009 quoted a representative of Swiru Holding - the sole shareholder of Radlett Estates - as saying they could not find ""any evidence"" in their files that ""Mr or Ms Golubov [sic] have been appointedd [sic], nor any Resolutions or Resignation/Acceptance letters."" And documents show representatives of Swiru repeatedly submitted corporate documents to Radlett's registered agent - its administrator in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) - which contained no mention of Lubov Golubeva. But a number of leaked registers of directors - including from three of the agent's offices in Switzerland, the BVI and Cyprus - show Mrs Chernukhin, then Lubov Golubeva, listed as a director. Radlett Estates Ltd document showing Ms Lubov Golubeva listed as a director Asked about those documents, and the one showing Lubov Golubeva's resignation in 2006, lawyers for the Chernukhins said ""Mrs Chernukhin does not recall consenting in writing to being a director of Radlett Estates Limited"" and questioned whether the documents were ""forgeries and/or may have been manipulated"". Anti-money laundering expert Tom Keatinge at the think tank Rusi, told us it was possible the signature was a forgery - but unlikely. ""Documents show she was present at a meeting where her continued directorship was being discussed. And indeed at that meeting she resigned as a director so I think it stretches the imagination to suggest her identity was stolen."" Rachel Davies of Transparency International says the BBCs investigation underlines why the system of political donations has to be more transparent. ""Any politician or political party ought to have a clear understanding of the nature of their benefactor. That means conducting due diligence over those who sponsor their activities, not just looking at whether the funds they receive are lawful but ensuring they're exercising good judgement in receiving them in the first place."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said, ""if a British citizen is able to vote in an election for a political party, they also have the democratic right to donate to a political party. All donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.""

Depp faces questioning in case against ex-wife,"Johnny Depp has sought to paint ex-wife Amber Heard as a volatile spouse who abused and demeaned him. The actor, 58, has sued Ms Heard over an article she wrote saying she was a victim of domestic violence. Mr Depp has denied any abuse. Ms Heard, 35, has sued him in return, with a $100m (Â£76m) counterclaim. In his testimony, Mr Depp said he felt ""pure hatred"" from Ms Heard. Cross-examination from her lawyers began on Wednesday after two days of testimony. His testimony is set to resume into a third day on Thursday. After the romance of their first year together soured, the pair argued regularly, he said, with Ms Heard frequently issuing a ""sarcastic, demeaning, aggressive, violent, toxic spew"", and occasionally resorting to violence. ""It could begin with a slap,"" Mr Depp said. ""It could begin with throwing a TV remote at my head. It could be throwing a glass of wine in my face."" ""She has a need for conflict. She has a need for violence,"" he said. And in recordings of the former couple played to the jury on Wednesday, Ms Heard can be heard admitting she ""did start a physical fight"" with Mr Depp. Mr Depp also recalled a now-infamous incident between him and his former wife, in which he found ""human fecal matter"" on his side of the bed in the flat he shared with Ms Heard. ""It was so bizarre and so grotesque, that I could only laugh,"" he said. Ms Heard has denied that she or any of her friends left human excrement on the bed, testifying in Mr Depp's 2018 defamation trial in the UK that the idea was ""absolutely disgusting"". Jurors in the closely watched civil trial, which is taking place in Virginia, have heard two wildly different accounts of Mr Depp and Ms Heard's relationship. Lawyers for Ms Heard have so far worked to portray Mr Depp as a physically and sexually abusive partner prone to drug and alcohol binges. Mr Depp addressed his drug and alcohol use on Wednesday, saying he had become addicted to prescription opioids after receiving Roxycodone for a back injury. The actor testified that while detoxing from the drugs, Ms Heard withheld medication from him that would have relieved symptoms of withdrawal because she said it was not time for the next dose. The actor said he rolled on the floor, in tears, and begged. ""I hate saying this, having to admit this, but that was about the lowest point in my life."" As Johnny Depp settled down for day two on the witness stand there was only the briefest glance across the court towards where his ex-wife Amber Heard was sitting. Throughout it all she sat watching intently, occasionally writing a few notes as Mr Depp began to describe his views about their relationship - a relationship she says was violent and abusive. On day one of his testimony, his answers at the beginning had been marked by hesitations and long searches for the right words. The Johnny Depp of day two was immediately rather more fluent as he described how their marriage disintegrated and how he felt her behaviour had become controlling and belittling. It was, he said, an ""endless parade of insults and looking at me like I was a fool"". ""I was not allowed a voice."" The reason for the long description on the previous day of his problematic relationship with his mother now began to make sense. The criticisms from Ms Heard and his responses to it made him realise he was in a relationship with his ""mother"". There was a little smile as he reflected on what he had said. He also talked about celebrity and the impossibility of dealing with everything that was written about him. ""Your arms are too short to box with God,"" he said. His drinking was, he said, a means of dealing with the pain of the relationship. It was Ms Heard who would strike him, he claimed. He would retreat, booking extra rooms when they were travelling so he had a place to escape. As they rose for recess, he looked straight ahead. Ms Heard watched, her face giving nothing away. Her side of the story is yet to be told. Under cross-examination, Ms Heard's lawyer Ben Rottenborn had Mr Depp confirm that his name is not mentioned in the 2018 op-ed in question. ""I think that it's very easy to write a piece and put the finger on someone without saying their name,"" Mr Depp replied. ""There are sneaky ways of writing things."" The lawyer also asked why Mr Depp did not sue after Ms Heard accused him of assault in a restraining order two years earlier, in May 2016. ""I was advised by my attorney not to fight,"" Mr Depp said. Mr Rottenborn additionally introduced into evidence a divorce document the couple signed in August 2016 that stated: ""Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain."" The defamation trial is now into its second week. Earlier, the jury heard evidence presented by the celebrity ex-couple's former therapist, who described how Mr Depp and Ms Heard engaged in ""mutual abuse"", as well as from medical workers who treated Mr Depp as he was detoxing himself from opiates. Several high profile witnesses, including the entrepreneur Elon Musk and the actors James Franco and Paul Bettany, are to appear later in the trial, which is expected to last at least another month.

Lockdowns boosted trend for less make-up - survey,"Charlie uses fewer cosmetics than she used to ""Before, you wouldn't have caught me picking up a pint of milk without my face on,"" says Charlie, who works for a training business. But then the pandemic struck and now she just doesn't wear as much as she used to, even to work. ""I was stuck at home furloughed with two kids, my husband was away, so I spent a lot of time outside without make-up on, and realised no one cares,"" she explains. Charlie feels the pandemic has given her the confidence to embrace a more natural look. And it seems she's not alone. The use of cosmetics was already declining before 2020, but a survey of 10,000 British women by market research firm Kantar has revealed big changes to post-lockdown beauty routines. Make-up purchases and frequency of wearing products has dropped steeply in the last two years, by almost a third, it suggests. Colleagues of Charlie's at Rhino Safety, on the outskirts of Sandbach in Cheshire, agree. Director Cate Walter admits she splurges on getting her nails and eyebrows done. But her daily regime is minimal; a bit of blusher and maybe mascara for a day in the office. ""I just don't want to look ill,"" she jokes. Although the business has a relaxed feel, Cate says she has definitely noticed a change since staff started working remotely. ""You do not need to spend as much time on your appearance, especially as you're potentially only seen from the waist up anyway,"" she says, adding that being fully made-up is not something she, nor many clients, expect. ""I'm not going to expect you to be in a full face of make-up and a suit when you're essentially sat at your kitchen table,"" she says. Kantar surveyed 300,000 women worldwide, as well as looking at spending data, and found that British women have made the biggest change in their grooming habits in recent years. Cate Walter says she doesn't expect staff to wear a lot of make-up especially if they are working from home ""Manufacturers are going to struggle and they're really going to have to work harder to get our money from us,"" said Kantar analyst Maya Zawislak. Their research shows a 19% fall in make-up sales since 2019, but the pandemic is only part of the story. Ms Zawislak adds that a looming cost-of-living crisis could also affect what consumers buy. The cosmetics industry is struggling on two fronts. As the squeeze on all our budgets really starts to bite people are looking for ways to cut their spending. But the pandemic has also given some women the self-confidence to try going make-up free, or to let their hair go grey. Skin care products have not seen the same decline as cosmetics though, as we've moisturised with enthusiasm after all the anti-bac gel. And self-care has become an important buzz word in these difficult times. Overall it seems people are reluctant to spend on what might be seen as frivolous, but happier to splurge on something that feels like it's doing them good. Historically, economists would say that lipstick sales thrive during difficult economic times. Typically, this little luxury might have been a way for cash-strapped consumers to treat themselves. But this time the use of masks and remote working has seen the sale of red lip products fall by 40%. The boss of Boots in the UK, Sebastian James, told the BBC his chain had seen the same trend. ""Over the pandemic we saw a lot less colour cosmetics in our trade, lipsticks and so on, and a lot more spend on self care , so skin care, haircare, and particularly what we call expert skin care,"" he told the Today programme. ""Certainly year-on-year we're well up in [our beauty sales] but definitely people are buying different stuff."" Pandemic fashion: 'From sequins to sweatpants' 'My closed hair salons cost me Â£1,000 a day' On the other hand, rather than just buying less, some people have switched to different products. ""I probably buy less now, but maybe higher-end price products,"" says Charlie's colleague, Julie Hopwood. Julie uses a tinted moisturiser plus a bit of eye-shadow. ""I think eyes did become more important when we were all wearing masks,"" she explains, adding that she has felt inspired to try new things, watching tutorials online during lockdown. Both Julie and Charlie spend about half an hour getting ready for work and maybe an hour at the weekend. Changes to their morning routine mean they can spend time going to the gym or with family instead. The relaxation of what we wear to work started long before the pandemic for many sectors. But it appears to have accelerated during the pandemic, so much so that last monththe Office for National Statistics removed men's suitsfrom their ""typical"" basket of consumer goods. The question for the cosmetic industry, and for related areas such as workwear, is whether these new habits will stay or fade as fashions and behaviours shift. Sarah Finn, for one, hopes they stick. ""I used to be the odd one out, because I didn't wear make-up,"" she says. ""I get up, get showered and I'm out of the door."" Now, no-one else seems to be wearing make-up either, says Sarah, and possibly, like her, they'll decide they'd rather keep the morning lie-in.
