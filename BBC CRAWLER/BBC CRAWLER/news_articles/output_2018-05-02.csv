MPs vote against Windrush disclosures,"MPs have voted against an opposition motion calling on the government to disclose papers on Windrush migrants. Labour had hoped to force the government to release documents about its immigration policy relating to people who came to the UK from Commonwealth countries. They arrived between the late 1940s and 1970s but some have been threatened with deportation in recent years. The government won the vote by 316 votes to 221. Of Labour's 258 MPs, 180 voted in favour, while 306 Conservative MPs opposed the motion. Boxer's dad 'caught in Windrush scandal' Who are the Windrush generation? Home Office review into Windrush failings New home secretary Javid's Windrush vow Labour wanted the government to be made to hand over evidence, including emails and text messages, for scrutiny by MPs on the Home Affairs Committee. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott described the vote as ""an opportunity for the Tories to start to right the wrongs they have done to the Windrush generation"". She accused Theresa May of ordering her MPs to ""vote to cover up the truth of her involvement"". Ms Abbot said many people felt ""all roads lead back to the prime minister"", with Mrs May having previously been home secretary at the time the government brought in changes to immigration rules in 2014. The prime minister has announced that an upcoming review will have full access to the information. This video can not be played What was life like for first-generation Windrush migrants? Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government's review would have ""independent oversight and challenge"" and aimed to understand how members of the Windrush generation ""came to be entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants"". He added that complying with the motion would have seen officials taken away from helping and supporting people affected by Windrush cases. Many Windrush migrants who came to the UK as children have no formal documentation, which has also led to them being refused jobs or healthcare in recent years. People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parents' passports without their own ID documents.

Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives',"This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter Up to 270 women in England may have died because they did not receive invitations to a final routine breast cancer screening, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says. Speaking in the Commons, he said 450,000 women aged 68-71 had failed to get invitations since 2009. Mr Hunt has announced an independent review and apologised ""wholeheartedly"" to the women and their families. He said oversight of the NHS screening programme had ""not been good enough"". Mr Hunt told the Commons that computer modelling suggested between 135 and 270 women may have had their lives shortened. GPs' leaders said they were ""shocked"" to learn of the error and said the implications for GPs would potentially be ""significant"". Of the 450,000 women affected, 309,000 are still alive and in their 70s. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Mr Hunt said: ""For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence."" He said a computer algorithm failure was to blame, which meant, in some cases, women approaching their 71st birthday were not sent an invitation for a final breast scan as they should have been. Variation in the way that local services sent out invitations may also have been a factor, he said. Breast cancer screening is currently offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in England. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening - scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment. Any woman who wants a mammogram will get one within six months, Mr Hunt said. Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May The health secretary said it was a priority to make sure additional scans did not cause any delays in the screening programme for other women. Public Health England discovered the problem after analysing data and has apologised to the women affected. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at PHE, said: ""They and their families' wellbeing is our top priority and we are very sorry for these faults in the system."" Mr Hunt told MPs in the Commons: ""Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says ""there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened"" He apologised ""wholeheartedly and unreservedly"" for the suffering caused. And he added: ""We also need to get to the bottom of precisely how many people were affected, why it happened and most importantly how we can prevent it from ever happening again."" Women in Scotland are not affected by the error because it has a different IT system. Wales and Northern Ireland have similar systems to England but Mr Hunt said there was no reason to believe they were affected. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the independent review and urged women affected not to panic. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the RCGP, said: ""The priority should not be to establish blame, but to put measures in place to invite those women affected for screening, where appropriate; to ensure there are enough resources in the system to cope with any additional demand that might follow as a result; and to take steps to ensure this never happens again."" Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK's director of policy and public affairs, said the breast screening error was ""very concerning"". She added: ""It's worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast see your GP straight away."" All women in this age group registered with a GP are invited for screening every three years - around 2.5 million people. This is because the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age. After 70, women can still have screening if they choose to by contacting their GP.

"Bercow claims 'concerning', says No 10","This video can not be played John Bercow's former private secretary tells Newsnight the Speaker bullied him Allegations of bullying against Speaker John Bercow are ""concerning"" and should be properly investigated, the prime minister's spokesman has said. Mr Bercow's former private secretaryAngus Sinclair claims that the Speaker shouted and swore at him, and attempted to physically intimidate him. The No 10 spokesman said it was a matter for Parliament to decide how to investigate the claims. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said there was ""no substance"" to the allegations. Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Bercow said: ""I have a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff, five of whom have served me for a collective total of over 40 years. ""I am also happy to confirm that the great majority of people who have left my service have done so on perfectly amicable terms."" Mr Sinclair toldNewsnightthat he faced angry outbursts from Mr Bercow whilst working for him in 2009-10 - all of which Mr Bercow denies. He claims the Speaker would undermine him in front of other staff, mimic him, and, on one occasion, Mr Bercow smashed a phone on his desk. This video can not be played John Bercow is asked in the Commons about bullying allegations against him The PM's spokesman said there were a number of ways an investigation could move forward. He said the House authorities - the employers of parliamentary staff - could consider the best way for an investigation to be carried out, or the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner could investigate a named MP alleged to have breached the code of conduct. The spokesman also said that the chair of an existing inquiry into allegations of bullying and harassment in Westminster, Dame Laura Cox, ""may wish to consider"" the allegations in the terms of reference for her inquiry. Leader of the House and Tory MP Andrea Leadsom also said it was up to Dame Cox to decide if her independent inquiry needs to be expanded to allow for investigations into individuals to take place. ""I'm sure she will be looking very carefully at how best to respond to these latest developments,"" she added. ""I am determined to stamp out all forms of bullying and harassment in Parliament, and separate to these allegations, I encourage any member of House staff who has experienced mistreatment to provide their confidential testimony to Dame Laura Cox."" Mr Sinclair said he was paid Â£86,250 in 2010 when he was given a ""compulsory early retirement"" by Commons authorities, as part of a deal that required him to sign a non-disclosure agreement. This is not conventional for people retiring from the House. Breaching the terms of the agreement by speaking to Newsnight, he said: ""I thought to myself, it's in the public interest to know why I left. ""Yes, it breaks that non-disclosure agreement, but it's the truth. There was bullying."" Mr Bercow in the chamber. His current private secretary is at the Speaker's left hand side. Mr Sinclair - who spent 30 years in the Royal Navy before joining the House of Commons in 2005 as private secretary to then-speaker Michael Martin - told Newsnight that Mr Bercow was prone to ""over-the-top anger."" He added: ""I'm not sure he was completely in control of it. The arms would wave around"". Newsnight has spoken to other members of House staff, who have corroborated this account. Other officials have described Mr Sinclair being undermined in meetings and being held responsible for things that were beyond his power. John Bercow in 2010. Angus Sinclair is on the right, with blue, white and purple ribbons on his chest But some politicians have come to Mr Bercow's defence. Labour peer Lord Hain said the ""attack"" on the Speaker was motivated by those ""resisting his essential parliamentary reforms"". Labour MP Barry Sheerman also defended Mr Bercow, saying he had been the ""best reforming Speaker for 100 years"", and it was only a ""small group"" of parliamentary officials ""hated"" his modernising efforts.

The Dame Cox inquiry into the treatment of the apolitical staff who run the House was launched after a previous investigation by Newsnight. The programme reported House of Commons managers were informed in 2011 that Kate Emms - Mr Sinclair's successor - had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after less than a year working for Mr Bercow. The Speaker has categorically denied bullying Ms Emms. However, the current parameters of the inquiry are not geared to look into individual cases or reopen past complaints, but the overall culture in Westminster. Asked by the chair of the Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, whether he believed his staff should be allowed to speak out about alleged wrong-doing, Mr Bercow told the Commons they should. He said that any agreements signed by current or former staff of his would not constrain them from talking to Dame Cox's inquiry ""freely and confidentially"", adding: ""I hope that they will do so.""

MoD admits civilian death in IS fight,"The civilian died after a strike by an RAF Reaper drone An RAF strike on the Islamic State group has caused a civilian casualty, the Ministry of Defence has admitted for the first time. It says a Reaper drone fired on an IS vehicle in eastern Syria on 26 March this year, ""unintentionally"" killing a civilian on a motorbike when he crossed the target area at the last minute. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the incident was ""deeply regrettable"". The RAF has carried out more than 1,600 strikes against IS in Syria and Iraq. RAF 'may have killed civilians' in Iraq The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and chartss How many bombs has the UK dropped in 2017? Can civilian deaths be avoided in RAF strikes on IS? The MoD says it has done ""everything possible"" to minimise the risk to civilians. The UK is second to the US in the number of airstrikes it conducted for acoalition,externalof 75 countries formed in 2014 to defeat IS. In a written ministerial statement, the defence secretary said the assessment of the civilian death was made after ""routine and detailed post-strike analysis"". Mr Williamson said: ""These events serve to remind us of the consequences of conflict and of the heavy price that the people of Syria have paid. ""It reminds us that when we undertake military action, we must do so knowing that it can never be completely without risk."" He added the incident would ""not weaken"" the UK's resolve to defeat IS. Cockpit footage of an RAF air strike on an IS artillery position in Mosul in 2017 In a statement issued after the attack,external, the MoD had said the Reaper drone ""tracked a group of terrorists in a vehicle in the Syrian Euphrates valley... and successfully destroyed it and its occupants with a precision Hellfire missile attack"". Up until now, the MoD said it had seen ""no evidence"" that its strikes had caused civilian casualties. But on Monday aBBC investigation suggested other civilians may have been killedas a result of RAF air strikes. A source inside the coalition fighting IS highlighted a strike on 9 January last year in Mosul, Iraq, when an RAF Tornado fired a Brimstone missile on what was described as a ""lorry bomb"" in eastern Mosul. It caused a large secondary explosion and the source said he believed two civilians were ""almost certainly"" killed. The BBC has also discovered evidence that some RAF bombs have malfunctioned and strayed off target, potentially leading to civilian deaths.

Tesla reported a loss of $709.6m, or $4.19 per share,
for the first quarter ended 31 March, compared with a loss of
$330.3m, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier. Tesla said it produced 2,270 Model 3s per week in the last
week of April, up from 2,250 in the second week of the month. Damian Collins (pictured centre), who chairs the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport select committee, tells the BBC: ""We've got to make sure that this is not an attempt to run and hide - that these companies aren't closing down to try and avoid being rigorously investigated for the allegations that have been made against them about the way they've used data, the ethics and the legality of their practices. ""Those investigations have to continue. We have to know what happened. It's very easy to close down companies and for the people behind those companies to re-emerge elsewhere with their data and their contacts intact."" UK privacy watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office has said it will ""monitor closely any successor companies"" to the firm involved in the Facebook data scandal. A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said: ""The ICO has
been investigating the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica as part of a wider
investigation into the use of personal data and analytics by political
campaigns, social media companies and others. ""We will be examining closely the details of the announcements of the winding
down of Cambridge Analytica and the status of its parent company. ""The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to
pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where
companies may no longer be operating.
 ""We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to
audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded."" There's some interesting reports going round Twitter linking some of the people connected to Cambridge Analytica to a company that was set up in August 2017 called Emerdata. Companies House records,externalshow that Alexander Nix, the former chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, became a director on 23 January. Cambridge Analytica, the firm
embroiled in a controversy over its handling of Facebook
data, should not escape scrutiny through its decision to shut
down, Damian Collins, chairman of parliament's Digital,
Culture, Media and Sport Committee, says. ""They are party to very serious investigations and those
investigations cannot be impeded by the closure of these
companies,"" he says. ""I think it's absolutely vital that the closure of these
companies is not used as an excuse to try and limit or restrict
the ability of the authorities to investigate what they were
doing."" An empty space where the Cambridge Analytica sign used to be at its London offices. Cambridge Analytica's move to close comes in the wake of rising legal costs in the Facebook investigation and the loss of clients following revelations about the firm in March. The firm was created around 2013 initially with a
focus on US elections, with $15m in backing from
billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by
future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York
Times reported. Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as providing consumer
research, targeted advertising and other data-related services
to both political and corporate clients. After 2016 Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix went to more
clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The
company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of
consumers and voters which was a ""secret sauce"" it used to sway
them more effectively than traditional advertising could. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica closing down will not affect its investigation into what happened in relation to the data scandal. ""This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" said a spokesman. ""We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities."" Cambridge Analytica, the firm behind the Facebook data-sharing scandal, has said adverse media coverage led it to close. ""Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,"" it said. ""Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. ""As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business."" Political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, the firm at the centre of the Facebook data-sharing scandal, is shutting down, it says. The firm was accused of improperly using data on behalf of political clients. According to Facebook, data about up to 87 million of its members was harvested by an app and then passed onto the political consultancy. The social network declined to comment on the latest development. Read more here. US Federal Reserve The Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady, as expected, and said it expects inflation to ""run near"" its 2% target over the medium term. The US central bank made the decision at the end of its two-day meeting in Washington. The Fed is expected to raise rates to curb inflation, which has been minimal in recent years but showed signs of increasing in recent months. In its release, the bank noted that its inflation target is ""symmetric"". Greg McBride, chief
financial analyst of Bankrate.com, said that gives policymakers some ""wiggle room"" to maintain a gradual policy, even if inflation exceeds its target. Wall Street shares jumped after the release.

Trump loses another Russia probe lawyer,"President Donald Trump's lawyer for the probe into alleged collusion between his election team and Russia has left, in the case's latest legal shake-up. Ty Cobb will be replaced by Emmet Flood, an attorney who defended ex-President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings 20 years ago. The White House press secretary told the BBC that Mr Cobb had been considering retirement for some time. Mr Trump and Russia have repeatedly denied suggestions of collusion. However, a former aide to Mr Trump's presidential campaign has told CNN the Department of Justice inquiry is ""really focused on Russia collusion"". Michael Caputo told the cable network he was interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators on Wednesday. ""They know more about the Trump campaign than anyone who ever worked there,"" Mr Caputo said. A guide to US legalese Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Key questions in the affair answered Since Mr Trump declared last month that he was ""VERY happy"" with his lawyers, the team has been overhauled. Mr Flood, a Republican lawyer, is tipped to take a more combative approach to the Mueller investigation. Emmet Flood is replacing Ty Cobb as the White House Lawyer under Donald Trump Mr Cobb, who joined the White House team last August, was said to have been advising Mr Trump to co-operate fully with the Mueller investigation. He had reportedly urged the president to allow himself to be interviewed by Mr Mueller in order to hurry along the inquiry that is overhanging his presidency. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told the BBC that Mr Cobb has been discussing retirement for several weeks and he has done ""a terrific job"". Mr Cobb's departure emerged just hours after he told ABC News that Mr Trump facing Mr Mueller was ""certainly not off the table"". Mr Trump's previous lead lawyer on the case, John Dowd, quit in March, reportedly because he felt his client was ignoring his legal counsel. Allow Twitter content?

Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has joined Mr Trump's legal team to negotiate the terms of engagement for an interview of the president by the special counsel. Mr Giuliani told the Washington Post on Wednesday such an interview would last no more than three hours under a narrow set of questions. Several prominent law firms have reportedly declined to take Mr Trump's case. Earlier this month it was reported the president has hired a husband-and-wife legal team, Jane and Martin Raskin, who run a law practice in a suburb of Miami, Florida. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington If negotiations between Donald Trump's legal team and the special counsel's office have been a delicate dance, Robert Mueller just stomped on his counterpart's toes. A subpoena to force the president before a grand jury could start an explosive legal battle that eventually reaches the US Supreme Court. Mr Trump and his lawyers may argue that a president can't be compelled to answer such wide-ranging questions. The president has reportedly cooled on the idea of willingly meeting the special counsel - a result of his feeling that the Mueller team is out to get him. There have been hints that his legal advisers are torn on the matter. John Dowd, who resigned in March as the president's top personal lawyer, was said to be against an interview. Others, including recent arrival Rudy Giuliani, appear more open to co-operation. This may explain this week's spate of revelations. Possible Mueller questions, as compiled by the president's lawyers, were splashed across front page yesterday. The subpoena threat is today's news. Mr Mueller's team remains tight-lipped, but the evolving strategies of the president's side are playing out nearly in full view - and they may be inclined to turn this dance into a rumble. What isMueller's latest move? On Tuesday, it emerged that Mr Mueller has suggested he could compel Mr Trump to testify. The special counsel raised the possibility of issuing a court order during talks with the president's lawyers in March. This video can not be played US Deputy Attorney General rails against 'threats' A list of possible questions has been publishedin the New York Times. It covers the president's motivations in dismissing former FBI director James Comey last May and his campaign's contacts with Russia. What does the special counsel do? Who's who in Russia-Trump inquiry? The US president himself has said he is willing to speak to Mr Mueller, but US media report his enthusiasm has cooled after the offices of his personal attorney were raided. If a subpoena were issued, Mr Trump's lawyers could fight it in court, or he could refuse to answer questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment, a constitutional protection against potential self-incrimination.

Tesla says it is on track despite losses,"Tesla boss Elon Musk declined to answer a question about orders for the Model 3 car Tesla said it will be profitable in the second half of 2018 - but only if it can make 5,000 Model 3 cars every week. Reaching that goal is in doubt given the electric car maker produced just 2,270 in the last week of April. Tesla is striving to produce more cars as questions mount about its financial situation. The company posted a record quarterly loss of almost $710m (Â£523m) for the three months to March - more than double the same period last year. Revenues jumped 26% to $3.4bn, but it continued to burn through cash. Tesla said it would cut capital spending this year to less than $3bn as it focuses on ""near-term needs"". Elon Musk's firm also told investors that it will deliver more of its expensive luxury models in the second half of the year. Tesla's manufacturing challenges persist, however. It suspended Model 3 production in mid-April in a planned shutdown and expects a total of 10 days of downtime this quarter. Elon Musk: Just walk out of bad meetings SpaceX and Tesla alive 'by skin of their teeth' The company is trying to improve its manufacturing process of the Model 3, its newest car aimed at the mass market. ""We made a mistake by adding too much automation too quickly,"" Tesla told investors on Wednesday. Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA, said the results were ""mixed"", noting the decline in the firm's available cash. On a call with financial analysts, the strain over the firm's finances was apparent. Mr Musk refused to answer a question about the number of Model 3 reservations, and cut short an exchange about Tesla's spending plans. ""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" he said, moving to take questions from a private shareholder and owner of a finance-focused YouTube channel rather than an institutional analyst. Mr Musk also criticised media coverage of accidents involving driverless cars, saying reports gave a misleading impression about the safety of such vehicles. Tesla shares, which had declined slightly at the start of the call, fell about 5% in after-hours trading in New York. Mr Musk said investors should be focused on the long-term and dismissed concerns about rapid stock movements. ""If people are concerned about volatility, they should definitely not buy our stock,"" he said. Despite its heavy losses the company is worth about $51bn - roughly as much as General Motors, America's biggest car maker. Jamie Albertine, an analyst at Consumer Edge, said in a note: ""Steady, a word not often used in describing Tesla, is becoming more of a reality as management continues to chip away at its 5,000 units per week Model 3 production goal."" He estimated the company would hit that target in the second half of 2018. Is Tesla heading for trouble?

Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives'Hundreds of women in England may have died prematurely after failing to receive breast scan invitations.7h7 hours agoHealth,"This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter Up to 270 women in England may have died because they did not receive invitations to a final routine breast cancer screening, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says. Speaking in the Commons, he said 450,000 women aged 68-71 had failed to get invitations since 2009. Mr Hunt has announced an independent review and apologised ""wholeheartedly"" to the women and their families. He said oversight of the NHS screening programme had ""not been good enough"". Mr Hunt told the Commons that computer modelling suggested between 135 and 270 women may have had their lives shortened. GPs' leaders said they were ""shocked"" to learn of the error and said the implications for GPs would potentially be ""significant"". Of the 450,000 women affected, 309,000 are still alive and in their 70s. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Mr Hunt said: ""For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence."" He said a computer algorithm failure was to blame, which meant, in some cases, women approaching their 71st birthday were not sent an invitation for a final breast scan as they should have been. Variation in the way that local services sent out invitations may also have been a factor, he said. Breast cancer screening is currently offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in England. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening - scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment. Any woman who wants a mammogram will get one within six months, Mr Hunt said. Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May The health secretary said it was a priority to make sure additional scans did not cause any delays in the screening programme for other women. Public Health England discovered the problem after analysing data and has apologised to the women affected. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at PHE, said: ""They and their families' wellbeing is our top priority and we are very sorry for these faults in the system."" Mr Hunt told MPs in the Commons: ""Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says ""there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened"" He apologised ""wholeheartedly and unreservedly"" for the suffering caused. And he added: ""We also need to get to the bottom of precisely how many people were affected, why it happened and most importantly how we can prevent it from ever happening again."" Women in Scotland are not affected by the error because it has a different IT system. Wales and Northern Ireland have similar systems to England but Mr Hunt said there was no reason to believe they were affected. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the independent review and urged women affected not to panic. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the RCGP, said: ""The priority should not be to establish blame, but to put measures in place to invite those women affected for screening, where appropriate; to ensure there are enough resources in the system to cope with any additional demand that might follow as a result; and to take steps to ensure this never happens again."" Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK's director of policy and public affairs, said the breast screening error was ""very concerning"". She added: ""It's worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast see your GP straight away."" All women in this age group registered with a GP are invited for screening every three years - around 2.5 million people. This is because the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age. After 70, women can still have screening if they choose to by contacting their GP.

MPs vote against Windrush disclosuresMPs vote against an opposition motion calling on the Home Office to reveal papers on Windrush migrants.1han hour agoUK Politics,"MPs have voted against an opposition motion calling on the government to disclose papers on Windrush migrants. Labour had hoped to force the government to release documents about its immigration policy relating to people who came to the UK from Commonwealth countries. They arrived between the late 1940s and 1970s but some have been threatened with deportation in recent years. The government won the vote by 316 votes to 221. Of Labour's 258 MPs, 180 voted in favour, while 306 Conservative MPs opposed the motion. Boxer's dad 'caught in Windrush scandal' Who are the Windrush generation? Home Office review into Windrush failings New home secretary Javid's Windrush vow Labour wanted the government to be made to hand over evidence, including emails and text messages, for scrutiny by MPs on the Home Affairs Committee. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott described the vote as ""an opportunity for the Tories to start to right the wrongs they have done to the Windrush generation"". She accused Theresa May of ordering her MPs to ""vote to cover up the truth of her involvement"". Ms Abbot said many people felt ""all roads lead back to the prime minister"", with Mrs May having previously been home secretary at the time the government brought in changes to immigration rules in 2014. The prime minister has announced that an upcoming review will have full access to the information. This video can not be played What was life like for first-generation Windrush migrants? Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government's review would have ""independent oversight and challenge"" and aimed to understand how members of the Windrush generation ""came to be entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants"". He added that complying with the motion would have seen officials taken away from helping and supporting people affected by Windrush cases. Many Windrush migrants who came to the UK as children have no formal documentation, which has also led to them being refused jobs or healthcare in recent years. People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parents' passports without their own ID documents.

Man wrote 'bully' on murdered boss's forehead,"David Browning denied murdering Jillian Howell but admitted manslaughter A man who stabbed his boss to death and wrote ""bully"" on her forehead has been found guilty of her murder. David Browning, 52, admitted killing Jillian Howell on 26 October but claimed it was manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The jury at Hove Crown Court was told Browning went for dinner at her Brighton home and reacted with ""anger and violence"" when she rejected him. Judge Christine Laing said he would be sentenced to life in prison. ""I need time to consider the minimum prison term he must serve before he can apply for parole,"" she said. ""It starts at a minimum of 25 years because he was carrying a knife to the scene of the crime, but I will also consider other factors."" Browning claimed he and Jillian Howell clashed at work but then became friends as he confided in her The married father of two from Seaford, East Sussex, formed an intense attachment to his boss in the payroll department at the University of Brighton, and confided in her about his emotional problems, the jury heard. Prosecutor Alan Gardner said Browning became ""possessive, controlling and jealous"" and planned the killing for months. He applied for a firearms licence, bought a shotgun and knife, hired a van, and took a change of clothes to the crime scene. Jillian Howell with close friend Sean McDonald at Wembley Ms Howell told friends she felt manipulated when Browning demanded she must ""never leave"" her job or get a boyfriend and should be ""concentrating on him"", the jury heard. Browning also wrote a ""vitriolic"" letter for her close friend Sean McDonald, which turned out to be part of a failed attempt to implicate him in the murder. The jury was told Samaritans volunteer Ms Howell had urged Browning to get professional help after he confided in her about his depression and suicidal thoughts. On his way to visit Ms Howell before stabbing her, Browning had posted suicide letters, the court was told. Mr Gardner said: ""On 26 October last year, he discovered she didn't have the same feelings as him. She rejected him and Mr Browning reacted with anger and violence."" The jury was shown an image that was uploaded to Browning's Facebook page Jillian Howell was stabbed after sharing a curry she cooked at her home for Browning Browning described the moment when - after sharing a curry - he stabbed her in the back as she bent down to tie a shoelace. He told the court Ms Howell had grabbed the knife and screamed ""you bastard"", to which he replied: ""I'm sorry Jill, this is what mental health does to you."" After stabbing her, Browning put his shotgun to his throat, but could not pull the trigger, Sussex Police said. He then called Samaritans to talk about what had happened. Browning put the shotgun to his throat after killing Ms Howell but could not pull the trigger, police said Mr Gardner said: ""He offered, we know, no explanation for why he did it, only to say 'it must have been my depressive illness'."" He described Browning as a spurned admirer who is ""deeply self-centred, selfish, a man with a vindictive streak"". In a statement, Ms Howell's family said: ""Jill was a gentle and kind soul. She had an aura of calm and peace with a warm heart and an infectious smile. ""Jill's death was shocking and incomprehensible and we are still struggling to accept and make sense of it."" Browning will be sentenced on Thursday.

Men arrested at Starbucks settle for $1,"Rashon Nelson (L) and Donte Robinson (R) will each receive $1 and a promise from the city to set up a youth programme Two black men who were arrested at a Starbucks cafe by Philadelphia police last month have reached a financial settlement with the city. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will each receive a symbolic $1 and a promise from officials to set up a programme for young entrepreneurs. The arrest of the men, who had not yet ordered and were waiting for a friend, kicked off a row over racial profiling. Starbucks announced days later it would require employee anti-bias training. This video can not be played Watch the arrest of two black men at Starbucks - and the protests that followed The settlement, which was confirmed to BBC News by a spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenny, includes a vow from the city to contribute $200,000 (Â£147,000) to the new programme. The grant money will go towards creating a pilot programme ""for city public high school students with aspirations of becoming entrepreneurs, as envisioned by Robinson and Nelson, who will not receive any money from the grant"", the city announced in a press release. The 12 April arrest led to protests at Starbucks cafes around the country, while other customers shared claims of racial profiling by company staff. The arrest was captured on mobile phone video and showed the men being led away in handcuffs after a manager had accused them of trespassing and causing a disturbance. Starbucks shuts US cafes for race training 'This is an America thing, not Starbucks' Starbucks 'sorry' over black men arrest The two longtime friends, both 23, had just sat down at the coffee chain's downtown location for a meeting to discuss a possible real estate deal. After spending hours in jail, they were released and no charges were filed. The Philadelphia chief of police later apologised for his handling of the arrest. Mayor Kenney said in a statement that he was ""pleased to have resolved the potential claims against the city in this productive manner"". ""This was an incident that evoked a lot of pain in our city,"" he continued. Starbucks race row leaves customers with a bitter aftertaste ""Rather than spending time, money, and resources to engage in a potentially adversarial process, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson approached the city and invited us to partner with them in an attempt to make something positive come of this. ""This agreement is the result of those conversations, and I look forward to seeing the fruits of this effort in the coming months and years."" This video can not be played Brandon Wardâs video of his encounter at a Starbucks has gone viral Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson came to Philadelphia to personally apologise to the two men. In a joint statement with Mr Nelson and Mr Robinson,external, Starbucks announced that it had reached a separate financial settlement with the men earlier this week. That confidential settlement ""will allow both sides to move forward and continue to talk and explore means of preventing similar occurrences at any Starbucks locations"", the statement said. Mr Johnson added that he wishes to ""thank Donte and Rashon for their willingness to reconcile"". Mr Nelson and Mr Robinson jointly said they appreciate the effort to foster communication, and add ""we will be measured by our action not words"". As part of the settlement both men have been offered university scholarships by Starbucks, and the opportunity to meet former US Attorney Eric Holder, who has been hired ""as part of the company's long-term diversity and equity efforts"".

'Toughest' abortion bill approved in US,"The struggle over abortion rights, always an impassioned affair in the US, has intensified since Donald Trump came into the White House The US state of Iowa has approved an abortion law banning most abortions once a foetal heartbeat is detected. Republican lawmakers passed the bill in back-to-back votes, sending it to the governor's desk to sign into law. If it comes into effect the bill will ban most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and rights groups say it will be the country's most restrictive. Critics argue it will make having an abortion illegal before most women even realise they are pregnant. Iowa's Republican Governor Kim Reynolds has not said if she will sign the bill. Last year, Iowa Republicans successfully banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The past and future of US abortion debate The so-called ""heartbeat"" bill would require any woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound to screen for a foetal heartbeat. If one is detected, she will be barred from obtaining a termination. Some exceptions have been introduced - in cases of rape and incest, where it has been reported to authorities, and to save the woman's life. ""We're in the majority for a reason and that includes advancing the pro-life cause,"" Republican Representative Shannon Lundgren toldthe Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,external. ""We are alive when our hearts start beating and our life is over when it stops,"" Dawn Pettengil, another Republican Representative from Iowa,told CBS News,external. Democratic Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell spoke against the legislation on the floor of the Iowa House of Representatives on Tuesday. ""All women, regardless of age, income or race, should be able to obtain reproductive health services, including abortion, free from political and economic barriers,"" Ms Wessel-Kroeschell said. Iowa's Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union groups have also spoken out against the bill. ""These extreme attempts to ban abortion fly in the face of both medical and legal standards, as well as common sense and public opinion among Iowans,"" said Erin Davison-Rippey, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's director of public affairsin an online statement released in February, when the bill was first introduced,external. ""So-called 'heartbeat protection' bills are actually bans on safe, legal abortion, and they threaten to set reproductive rights back by decades."" Elizabeth Nash, of the sexual and reproductive health policy group the Guttmacher Institute, told the BBC this was ""the most restrictive abortion ban in the country"". This video can not be played Why one woman decided to terminate her pregnancy - and defends Planned Parenthood This video can not be played Jeanne Mancini organises March for Life, a major anti-abortion rally in the US She and Iowa Democrats have suggested the bill is intentionally unconstitutional. If Ms Reynolds signs the bill into law, it will likely be challenged in court for possibly violating Roe v Wade, the US Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion in 1973. The ruling states some women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a foetus is viable. No, in fact some Republican lawmakers welcomed the challenge. ""I would love for the United States Supreme Court to look at this bill and have this as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" Republican Senator Jake Chapman said. This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi A string of US states have enacted abortion bans or stringent restrictions over recent decades only to have them overturned by the courts, prompting some conservatives to take aim at the landmark ruling. ""We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v Wade,"" Republican state Senator Rick Bertrand acknowledged. How US abortion debate got to this point Iowa is among a number of states, including Mississippi and Kentucky, that have triggered court challenges by imposing tight restrictions on abortion. President Donald Trump supports an abortion ban and has indicated that this is a priority, and Republicans are seizing the opportunity that creates, say commentators.

TSB boss to give up Â£2m bonus amid IT mess,"This video can not be played TSB chief executive Paul Pester grilled by MPs TSB chief executive Paul Pester will give up his ""integration bonus"" of Â£2m following the IT fiasco at the bank. However, his full pay and bonus package will not be decided until the end of 2018, the Treasury Committee has heard. He told the committee that the bank had received 40,000 complaints after millions of customer accounts were moved to a new computer system. MPs heard that no date could be set for the end of the fiasco, which has already lasted nearly two weeks. ""If there is one decision in my life that I could change it was the decision to go ahead with the migration. Clearly that was a terrible decision for our bank, for our customers and for me personally,"" Mr Pester said. Mr Pester argued that the migration of billions of customer records was successful ""to the penny"". The underlying engine of the bank was working well, he said, and most customers could log in normally, although there was an immediate angry reaction from those customers who could not make payments or get into the system. He said that he could be trusted to carry on the work of the bank, and MPs heard that he would not be quitting. ""They should trust me because I will ensure I will bring TSB out of the problems we're in. I have promised customers they will not be out of pocket,"" he said. ""[The buck] stops with me. Of course I take absolute responsibility for what has happened to TSB customers."" Mr Pester gave evidence alongside TSB chairman Richard Meddings, and Miquel Montes, chief operating officer at TSB's Spanish owner, Sabadell, who also sits on the TSB board. During evidence, the TSB bosses said: The IT work was not rushed through owing to financial incentives Tests before the switch were ""misleading"" as they did not foresee the problems with the system's capacity A law firm has been called in to carry out an independent review of the saga Waiting times on phones was ""very, very poor"" Mr Pester said that the ""accessibility"" problems for customers would ""not be simple to fix"". He admitted that only just over half of complaints had been ""acknowledged"". Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, said: ""What we are hearing is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problems that are being faced."" The timing of the TSB disruption has been particularly bad for Lorna McHale, who will be marrying Ben Connolly on Saturday. The couple have their savings for the wedding in a TSB account which they have been unable to access. The happy couple are unhappy with TSB ""We had no idea how much money was in there as we got bits and bobs for the wedding,"" said Ms McHale. The 26-year-old had to spend the morning before a dress fitting in a branch, which also had IT issues, but did not like the idea of taking out a large sum in cash. She said she had to ""ring to grovel"" with suppliers for their wedding, including the DJ, the wedding car provider, and those doing her hair and make-up, all of which were small businesses. She still cannot access online banking, as the bank's records are now using an old mobile number to which they sent the access code. The bank phoned her when she was in a meeting, and when she called back, the wait was going to be so long that she got cut off. ""I am stressed and disappointed. It is one thing that I really did not need right now,"" said the bride-to-be. ""I want to know what they are going to do to prevent it from happening again, and how they are going to compensate people for the undue stress."" Her case was raised during the Treasury Committee hearing and TSB chairman Mr Meddings said she would receive full compensation, which would include redress for stress. The compensation would be devised by accountancy firm Deloitte. TSB shut down services for two days from the evening of Friday 20 April to move customer data from former owner Lloyds to a new IT system managed by Sabadell. As soon as the new system was switched on during Sunday evening, customers reported seeing other people's account details alongside a range of other difficulties. Access to accounts via online banking and the bank's app was patchy in the following days, while those who did manage to get into their accounts encountered some extraordinary errors.

In a letter to MPs,external, Mr Pester also revealed the extent of ""widespread"" failures of technology in the branch network. Problems were still experienced in 40% of branches by last Friday. Frustrated customers also faced average waits of up to an hour for those telephoning the bank. Last Thursday, experts from computing giant IBM were called in to try to help solve the crisis.

Prof Hawking's multiverse finale,"This video can not be played The BBC's Pallab Ghosh explains how Prof Stephen Hawking's final paper resolved a cosmic conundrum Prof Stephen Hawking's final research paper suggests that our Universe may be one of many similar to our own. The theory resolves a cosmic paradox of the late physicist's own making. It also points a way forward for astronomers to find evidence of the existence of parallel universes. The study was submitted to theJournal of High-Energy Physics,external10 days before Prof Hawking died. In the 1980s, the Cambridge scientist, along with US physicist James Hartle developed a new idea about the beginning of the Universe. This resolved a difficulty with Einstein's theory that suggested that the Universe began nearly 14 billion years ago but said nothing about how it began. Instead, the Hartle-Hawking idea used a different theory called quantum mechanics to explain how the Universe arose from nothingness. The idea tied up one loose end but created another - an infinite number some might say. As physicists analysed the idea it emerged that it carried with it the implication that the Big Bang would create not just one universe - but an endless supply. Artwork: The Big Bang may have created many universes Some, according to the Hartle-Hawking theory, would be very like our own, perhaps have Earth-like planets, societies, even individuals similar to the ones in our Universe. Other universes would be subtly different - perhaps with Earth-like planets where dinosaurs were not wiped out. And there would be universes completely unlike our own, with no Earths, perhaps no stars and galaxies and different laws of physics. It sounds far-fetched, but the equations in this theory make such scenarios theoretically possible. A crisis arises because if there are infinite types of universes with infinite variations in their laws of physics then the theory cannot predict what kind of universe we should find ourselves in. Prof Hawking joined forces with Prof Thomas Hertog at KU Leuven in Belgium, who is funded by the European Research Council to try to resolve this paradox. ""Neither Stephen nor I were happy with that scenario,"" he told BBC News. ""It suggests that the multiverse emerged randomly and that we can't say very much more about that. We said to each other: 'Maybe we have to live with it'. But we didn't want to give up."" Prof Hawking's final paper may help researchers discover evidence of parallel universes Prof Hawking's final paper is the fruit of 20 years' work with Prof Hertog. It has solved the puzzle by drawing on new mathematical techniques developed to study another esoteric branch of physics called string theory. These techniques enable researchers to view physics theories in a different way. And the novel assessment of the Hartle-Hawking theory in the new paper has restored order to a hitherto chaotic multiverse. The new Hawking-Hertog assessment indicates that there can only be universes that have the same laws of physics as our own. That conjecture means that our Universe is typical and so observations we make from our viewpoint will be meaningful in developing our ideas of how other universes emerged. Mind-bending as these ideas are, they will be of real help to physicists as they develop a more complete theory of how the Universe came into being, according to Prof Hertog. ""The laws of physics that we test in our labs did not exist forever. They crystallised after the Big Bang when the universe expanded and cooled. The kind of laws that emerge depends very much on the physical conditions at the Big Bang. By studying these we aim to get a deeper understanding of where our physical theories come from, how they arise, and whether they are unique."" One tantalising implication of the findings, according to Prof Hertog, is that it might help researchers detect the presence of other universes by studying the microwave radiation left over from the Big Bang - though he says that he does not think it will be possible to hop from one universe to another.

MoD admits civilian death in IS fightRAF drone strike hit a man on a motorbike when he crossed a target area in Syria at the last minute.5h5 hours agoUK,"The civilian died after a strike by an RAF Reaper drone An RAF strike on the Islamic State group has caused a civilian casualty, the Ministry of Defence has admitted for the first time. It says a Reaper drone fired on an IS vehicle in eastern Syria on 26 March this year, ""unintentionally"" killing a civilian on a motorbike when he crossed the target area at the last minute. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the incident was ""deeply regrettable"". The RAF has carried out more than 1,600 strikes against IS in Syria and Iraq. RAF 'may have killed civilians' in Iraq The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and chartss How many bombs has the UK dropped in 2017? Can civilian deaths be avoided in RAF strikes on IS? The MoD says it has done ""everything possible"" to minimise the risk to civilians. The UK is second to the US in the number of airstrikes it conducted for acoalition,externalof 75 countries formed in 2014 to defeat IS. In a written ministerial statement, the defence secretary said the assessment of the civilian death was made after ""routine and detailed post-strike analysis"". Mr Williamson said: ""These events serve to remind us of the consequences of conflict and of the heavy price that the people of Syria have paid. ""It reminds us that when we undertake military action, we must do so knowing that it can never be completely without risk."" He added the incident would ""not weaken"" the UK's resolve to defeat IS. Cockpit footage of an RAF air strike on an IS artillery position in Mosul in 2017 In a statement issued after the attack,external, the MoD had said the Reaper drone ""tracked a group of terrorists in a vehicle in the Syrian Euphrates valley... and successfully destroyed it and its occupants with a precision Hellfire missile attack"". Up until now, the MoD said it had seen ""no evidence"" that its strikes had caused civilian casualties. But on Monday aBBC investigation suggested other civilians may have been killedas a result of RAF air strikes. A source inside the coalition fighting IS highlighted a strike on 9 January last year in Mosul, Iraq, when an RAF Tornado fired a Brimstone missile on what was described as a ""lorry bomb"" in eastern Mosul. It caused a large secondary explosion and the source said he believed two civilians were ""almost certainly"" killed. The BBC has also discovered evidence that some RAF bombs have malfunctioned and strayed off target, potentially leading to civilian deaths.

"'Toughest' abortion bill approved in USThe Iowa bill, said to be the strictest in the US, bans abortions once a heartbeat is detected.1han hour agoUS & Canada","The struggle over abortion rights, always an impassioned affair in the US, has intensified since Donald Trump came into the White House The US state of Iowa has approved an abortion law banning most abortions once a foetal heartbeat is detected. Republican lawmakers passed the bill in back-to-back votes, sending it to the governor's desk to sign into law. If it comes into effect the bill will ban most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and rights groups say it will be the country's most restrictive. Critics argue it will make having an abortion illegal before most women even realise they are pregnant. Iowa's Republican Governor Kim Reynolds has not said if she will sign the bill. Last year, Iowa Republicans successfully banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The past and future of US abortion debate The so-called ""heartbeat"" bill would require any woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound to screen for a foetal heartbeat. If one is detected, she will be barred from obtaining a termination. Some exceptions have been introduced - in cases of rape and incest, where it has been reported to authorities, and to save the woman's life. ""We're in the majority for a reason and that includes advancing the pro-life cause,"" Republican Representative Shannon Lundgren toldthe Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,external. ""We are alive when our hearts start beating and our life is over when it stops,"" Dawn Pettengil, another Republican Representative from Iowa,told CBS News,external. Democratic Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell spoke against the legislation on the floor of the Iowa House of Representatives on Tuesday. ""All women, regardless of age, income or race, should be able to obtain reproductive health services, including abortion, free from political and economic barriers,"" Ms Wessel-Kroeschell said. Iowa's Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union groups have also spoken out against the bill. ""These extreme attempts to ban abortion fly in the face of both medical and legal standards, as well as common sense and public opinion among Iowans,"" said Erin Davison-Rippey, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's director of public affairsin an online statement released in February, when the bill was first introduced,external. ""So-called 'heartbeat protection' bills are actually bans on safe, legal abortion, and they threaten to set reproductive rights back by decades."" Elizabeth Nash, of the sexual and reproductive health policy group the Guttmacher Institute, told the BBC this was ""the most restrictive abortion ban in the country"". This video can not be played Why one woman decided to terminate her pregnancy - and defends Planned Parenthood This video can not be played Jeanne Mancini organises March for Life, a major anti-abortion rally in the US She and Iowa Democrats have suggested the bill is intentionally unconstitutional. If Ms Reynolds signs the bill into law, it will likely be challenged in court for possibly violating Roe v Wade, the US Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion in 1973. The ruling states some women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a foetus is viable. No, in fact some Republican lawmakers welcomed the challenge. ""I would love for the United States Supreme Court to look at this bill and have this as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" Republican Senator Jake Chapman said. This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi A string of US states have enacted abortion bans or stringent restrictions over recent decades only to have them overturned by the courts, prompting some conservatives to take aim at the landmark ruling. ""We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v Wade,"" Republican state Senator Rick Bertrand acknowledged. How US abortion debate got to this point Iowa is among a number of states, including Mississippi and Kentucky, that have triggered court challenges by imposing tight restrictions on abortion. President Donald Trump supports an abortion ban and has indicated that this is a priority, and Republicans are seizing the opportunity that creates, say commentators.

Cambridge Analytica shutting down,"Cambridge Analytica's name has already been taken down from the wall of the London office it occupied Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy at the centre of the Facebook data-sharing scandal, is shutting down. The firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients. According to Facebook, data about up to 87 million of its members was harvested by a quiz app and then passed on to the political consultancy. The social network said its own probe into the matter would continue. ""This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" said a spokesman. ""We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities."" The company has been accused of using the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica In March, Channel 4 aired undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps. The UK-based company, which denies any wrongdoing, has an extensive record of working abroad on many election campaigns, including in Italy, Kenya and Nigeria. Clarence Mitchell, a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica, referred the BBC to astatement on the firm's website,external. ""Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,"" it said. ""Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. ""As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business."" Zuckerberg faces formal summons from MPs Was Facebook data's value 'literally nothing'? 'Facebook in PR crisis mode'' The statement added that its parent company SCL Elections was also commencing bankruptcy proceedings. Cambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended two months ago By the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, in California When the news of Cambridge Analytica's demise broke here at Facebook's F8 developer conference, it is safe to say few tears were shed. The scandal over data misuse has been a crisis not just for Facebook but for the thousands of external developers whose access to data has been curbed in response to the affair. But if they were tempted to celebrate there was a sting in the tail in the political consultancy's statement. It claimed that what it did was not only legal but was standard practice in the world of online advertising. That rang true to some people in this world and there may be more evidence of such practices as Facebook continues its audit of apps. Cambridge Analytica may be gone but as more stones are lifted there may be more unpleasant surprises to come about the use and misuse of personal data. The UK's Financial Times newspaper says it has spoken to another ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica, on condition of anonymity, who said they were sure the company would emerge ""in some other incarnation or guise"". The Observer journalist whose investigation first exposed the data privacy scandal,externalhas suggested that the public remain sceptical. Allow Twitter content?

Cambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended in March after the Channel 4 News footage was aired. Last month,Cambridge Analytica said it had only licensed 30 million records,externalbelonging to US citizens from the quiz app's creator Dr Aleksandr Kogan, and that they had not been used in the US presidential election. The firm added that it had since deleted all the information despite claims to the contrary by others. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has said the privacy scandal was a ""breach of trust"" One of Cambridge Analytica's major investors is the US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He is said to have put $15m (Â£11m) into the business, according to the Guardian. Mr Mercer, a former computer scientist, is also a major donor to the US Republican Party and helped support Donald Trump's election campaign. He has never given an interview about his political views and is not thought to have commented publicly about the data-harvesting scandal. Earlier on Wednesday, a cyber-security specialist presented evidence to the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Chris Vickery linked SCL and Cambridge Analytica to AggregateIQ,external- a Canadian data analytics firm, whichFacebook has also suspended from using its platform. He added that ""beyond a shadow of a doubt"" AggregateIQ had been involved in ""some form of collaboration or co-ordination"" between various pro-Brexit groups during the UK's EU referendum campaign. AIQ denies ever being part of Cambridge Analytica, its parent company SCL or accessing improperly obtained Facebook data.

Breast screening: What went wrong?,"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has announced an independent review into why 450,000 women in England failed to receive invitations for a final routine breast cancer screening between the ages of 68 and 71. So what went wrong with the NHS's screening programme? Breast screening aims to find cancer early by using an X-ray called a mammogram that can spot tumours when they're too small to see or feel. Around one-in-eight women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime, and if it's detected early treatment is more likely to be successful. As the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age, women in the UK from the age of 50 who are registered with a GP are automatically invited for a screening with a letter every three years up until their 71st birthday. Women can't ask for an appointment themselves until they turn 70, when screening requests can be made every three years. TheAgeX trial,externalhas been looking at offering screening to women as young as 47 and up to the age of 73 to see what risks and benefits there are to expanding the service for these women. In older women screening can pick up cancers that do not need to be treated. The NHS national breast screening programme invites more than 2.5 million women every year for a test, with about two million women taking up the offer. Mr Hunt told the Commons the problem was caused by a ""computer algorithm failure"", which led to some women not receiving their final breast screening when they were between the ages of 68 and 71. The problems happened between 2009 and the start of 2018. It is not currently known if anyone died as a result of the errors, but Mr Hunt said it was estimated that between 135 and 270 women may have had their life shortened. Public Health England spotted the issue in January during an analysis of data from the Age X trial. For the trial, women in some parts of England were put into two groups - one that got screening services beyond the normal cut-off ages and a control group that had screening invites at the standard ages. The BBC understands an error led to women in the control group wrongly being offered screenings up until their 70th birthday, rather than their 71st. This led to a bigger review that found a number of other issues, including some local services not inviting everyone for a final screen in the three years before their 71st birthday. Mr Hunt said further analysis found there had been issues with how people's ages were programmed into the IT system. The health secretary said the errors came to light after an upgrade to the breast screening invitation IT system. The issues were escalated to ministers in March by PHE following an urgent clinical review, and the government was told the error should not be made public to ensure existing screening services were not overwhelmed. The problems were fixed in April, the health secretary said. Scotland has a different system, and Wales and Northern Ireland have similar ones but do not seem to be affected, Mr Hunt said. Of those who were affected, 309,000 are estimated to be alive. Mr Hunt said the NHS intended to contact these women if they were still living in the UK and registered with a GP by the end of May, with the first 65,000 letters going out this week.

A process will be set up to establish if the missed scan was a likely cause of death and whether compensation should be paid, Mr Hunt said. The independent review into the ""serious failure"" will look at how many people were affected, why that failure happened and how it can be prevented from happening again. But beyond this, Mr Hunt said it will also examine why systems did not detect the problem sooner, whether there were warnings that should have been noticed earlier, and if ministers should have been informed quicker. He also said it would look at what patient safety lessons could be learned.

"'Toughest' abortion bill approved in USThe Iowa bill, said to be strictest in the US, bans abortions once a heartbeat is detected.1han hour agoUS & Canada","The struggle over abortion rights, always an impassioned affair in the US, has intensified since Donald Trump came into the White House The US state of Iowa has approved an abortion law banning most abortions once a foetal heartbeat is detected. Republican lawmakers passed the bill in back-to-back votes, sending it to the governor's desk to sign into law. If it comes into effect the bill will ban most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and rights groups say it will be the country's most restrictive. Critics argue it will make having an abortion illegal before most women even realise they are pregnant. Iowa's Republican Governor Kim Reynolds has not said if she will sign the bill. Last year, Iowa Republicans successfully banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The past and future of US abortion debate The so-called ""heartbeat"" bill would require any woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound to screen for a foetal heartbeat. If one is detected, she will be barred from obtaining a termination. Some exceptions have been introduced - in cases of rape and incest, where it has been reported to authorities, and to save the woman's life. ""We're in the majority for a reason and that includes advancing the pro-life cause,"" Republican Representative Shannon Lundgren toldthe Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,external. ""We are alive when our hearts start beating and our life is over when it stops,"" Dawn Pettengil, another Republican Representative from Iowa,told CBS News,external. Democratic Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell spoke against the legislation on the floor of the Iowa House of Representatives on Tuesday. ""All women, regardless of age, income or race, should be able to obtain reproductive health services, including abortion, free from political and economic barriers,"" Ms Wessel-Kroeschell said. Iowa's Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union groups have also spoken out against the bill. ""These extreme attempts to ban abortion fly in the face of both medical and legal standards, as well as common sense and public opinion among Iowans,"" said Erin Davison-Rippey, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's director of public affairsin an online statement released in February, when the bill was first introduced,external. ""So-called 'heartbeat protection' bills are actually bans on safe, legal abortion, and they threaten to set reproductive rights back by decades."" Elizabeth Nash, of the sexual and reproductive health policy group the Guttmacher Institute, told the BBC this was ""the most restrictive abortion ban in the country"". This video can not be played Why one woman decided to terminate her pregnancy - and defends Planned Parenthood This video can not be played Jeanne Mancini organises March for Life, a major anti-abortion rally in the US She and Iowa Democrats have suggested the bill is intentionally unconstitutional. If Ms Reynolds signs the bill into law, it will likely be challenged in court for possibly violating Roe v Wade, the US Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion in 1973. The ruling states some women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a foetus is viable. No, in fact some Republican lawmakers welcomed the challenge. ""I would love for the United States Supreme Court to look at this bill and have this as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" Republican Senator Jake Chapman said. This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi A string of US states have enacted abortion bans or stringent restrictions over recent decades only to have them overturned by the courts, prompting some conservatives to take aim at the landmark ruling. ""We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v Wade,"" Republican state Senator Rick Bertrand acknowledged. How US abortion debate got to this point Iowa is among a number of states, including Mississippi and Kentucky, that have triggered court challenges by imposing tight restrictions on abortion. President Donald Trump supports an abortion ban and has indicated that this is a priority, and Republicans are seizing the opportunity that creates, say commentators.

House of Fraser plans to close storesThe Chinese company that owns Hamleys will take control of the troubled department store chain.4h4 hours agoBusinessComments,"House of Fraser plans to close stores as new owners look to turn around the department store chain. The retailer said China's C.banner, which also owns Hamleys, is taking a 51% stake, shifting control from another Chinese firm, Nanjing Cenbest. House of Fraser intends to launch a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), under which it is likely to close some stores and renegotiate rents on others. It did not say how many stores are earmarked for closure. House of Fraser has 59 stores in the UK and Ireland, more than 6,000 employees and 11,500 concession staff. Frank Slevin, the chairman, said: ""There is a need to create a leaner business that better serves the rapidly changing behaviours of a customer base. ""House of Fraser's future will depend on creating the right portfolio of stores that are the right size and in the right location."" Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Six shops defying High Street downturn Five reasons Toys R Us failed C.banner, which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, is expected to raise about Â£70m by issuing new shares. The deal is expected to complete by the end of June and Nanjing Cenbest will continue to hold a significant minority stake. House of Fraser's new owner also owns Hamleys Under Nanjing Cenbest's ownership, there were plans for a big expansion of House of Fraser in China, but only one store materialised, in Nanjing itself. The chain expects to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. House of Fraser will hope to avoid the fate of department store chain BHS, which collapsed in 2016. More recently, several other big High Street names have struggled in the face of online competition, a decline in consumer confidence and rising overheads. Toys R Us and Maplin went into administration on the same day in February, while New Look and Carpetright have both entered into CVAs.

May requests 'revised' customs proposals,"Theresa May has asked officials to draw up ""revised proposals"" for post-Brexit customs arrangements after a key meeting with her most senior ministers. The Brexit sub committee met to try to agree on a new model to replace the UK's membership of the customs union. One of the government's preferred options - a ""customs partnership"" - has faced heavy criticism from Brexiteers. A succession of senior ministers challenged her over this plan in Wednesday's meeting. Reality Check: The government's customs options Mark D'Arcy: What do 10 Lords defeats mean? Two separate sources have told the BBC that a narrow majority of ministers expressed fears about the proposal - what some have described as ""killing"" it. But Downing Street denied this, saying the meeting acknowledged there were ""challenges"" to the existing proposals but that both the options put forward so far by the UK are still on the table. Mrs May has now asked for more work to be done on both options. Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs on Thursday that both options had merits and both had drawbacks ""which is why we are taking more time over them"". All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so that it can strike its own trade deals around the world, something it cannot do as a member. This means the UK and the EU will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at their border post-Brexit. The UK, which put forward two alternative proposals last year, has yet to confirm its favoured model. It is under pressure to make progress on the issue before next month's EU summit. Please upgrade your browser A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. The EU does not appear to be keen on either option. Earlier Mrs May told MPs there were ""a number of ways"" to deliver Britain's objectives on customs arrangements after Brexit. She says the final arrangement must avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - which is part of the EU - and that a customs border down the Irish Sea would be unacceptable. On the eve of the Brexit cabinet meeting, Brexiteers urged Mrs May to abandon the partnership option, presenting a 30-page dossier claiming it would make meaningful trade deals ""impossible"" to forge and render the UK's International Trade Department ""obsolete"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May therefore asked for more work to be done, and for revised proposals to be produced. Essentially, she told colleagues and officials to go away and come back with better ideas. You can make your own judgement on whether that is a good thing or not. But it does mean that as things stand, the UK government, nearly two years after the referendum, does not have an agreed position on how customs will work after Brexit that has the full backing of the cabinet - let alone Parliament - and let alone the country or the rest of the EU. That means too that the government is saying to Brussels, where demands are building for more detail: ""We're still not quite ready to talk."" Three separate sources have also told me that six ministers out of the 11 on the committee expressed fears about the viability of the customs partnership - yes, the ""unicorn"" proposal we've discussed here before. Those ministers included Gavin Williamson and Sajid Javid, who were both Remainers during the referendum, but neither of whom as things stand were ready to back what's thought to be the PM's preferred option.

Cabinet showdown over customs plan,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May is facing a demand from Conservative Brexiteers to drop one of the government's preferred post-Brexit customs options. A 30-page document passed to the BBC says a ""customs partnership"" would make meaningful trade deals ""impossible"" to forge and render the UK's International Trade Department ""obsolete"". It came ahead of a key meeting of senior ministers about Brexit. The committee discussed rival options to replace customs union membership. Afterwards, a source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a narrow majority of those at the meeting had said the customs partnership was not viable, and it was suggested it would not be taken back to full cabinet for further discussion. But Downing Street sources said the meeting agreed that this option and the proposal for a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement were still ""serious propositions"", although they acknowledged there were ""challenges that need to be addressed"". Theresa May is understood to have asked for ""revised proposals"", our correspondent added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at the UK/EU border post-Brexit and whether businesses will be hit with tariffs or not. The complicating factor is that the UK wants to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other countries rather than have to stick with deals struck for the EU customs union. A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Government sources say the situation is constantly evolving. It is possible another option could emerge combining elements of the first two. But any solution would aim to avoid the need for physical border checks on the island of Ireland. Wednesday's cabinet sub-committee meeting may not reach a final decision on the proposals - and don't forget, this is all about the UK agreeing its stance before more Brexit talks. The EU does not appear to be keen on either option. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said there were ""a number of ways"" to deliver Britain's objectives on customs arrangements after Brexit. Reality Check: The government's customs options Please upgrade your browser The BBC's economic editor Kamal Ahmed says he understandsChancellor Philip Hammond (pictured above) favours a customs partnership. Mr Hammond and other Remain-voting cabinet ministers, such as business secretary Greg Clark, are hoping to persuade the prime minister to keep it on the table when the 11-strong Brexit sub-committee meets later. Remain-voting Tory backbenches also want it to remain an option. One of them, Vicky Ford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it did not mean remaining in the EU ""by the back door"" as critics claim and could protect British business. Brexiteer cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson, Liam Fox (pictured above) and David Davis - and a group of Conservative backbenchers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose Tory Research Group produced the dossier sent to Mrs May. The Cabinet all signed up to the two customs optionswhen they were announced last year,externalbut some are now thought to be worried that the customs partnership idea would mean a slide towards remaining in the customs union. Backbench Tory Brexiteers fear the scheme would be expensive and complex to operate, and could mean the UK is indefinitely trapped within the EU's customs arrangements - and unable to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other nations around the world. Mr Rees-Mogg said it would not only be ""unworkable"", it would the same as staying in the EU and was the ""single market by another name"". Housing minister Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 5 Live's Anna Foster the ""streamlined"" customs option was ""winning the argument"" in government as it was ""the one that's been tried and tested the most"". According to the Press Association, Downing Street has been privately warned that a customs partnership could collapse the government, as committed Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches regard it as unacceptable. A senior Conservative told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg ""the customs partnership is the breaking point"", suggesting that if No 10 doesn't do the Brexiteers' bidding, they could withhold their support. On Tuesday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Read Laura Kuenssberg's blog The MPs' dossier cautions against continued deliberations in government, saying that ""further delay is itself a decision"". It is the strongest warning yet from Tory Brexiteers to the PM, who have largely been supportive, in public, of her efforts to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU. Mr Rees-Mogg (pictured above) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""we are not in the business of making threats"". If it came to a confidence vote in the prime minister over the issue, the Tory MP said it was ""inconceivable"" that he would vote against her. Downing Street sources denied the document was an ultimatum, calling it part of the policy-making process. David Davis is preparing for the next round of talks with EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday that Brussels was ""pushing back"" against both proposals. The EU thinks the customs partnership proposal is very ambitious - to put it mildly - and has given the UK a list of questions about it, writes the BBC's Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming. What new burdens will be placed on customs officials in the EU27? How will the UK apply EU customs law if it's no longer in the club? How will the ""track and trace"" system work? The warning from Brussels about the UK government's other option, a ""highly streamlined"" customs deal, is that it doesn't fully solve the problem of avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which they say is about more than just tariffs. Hanging over it all is the issue of trust because the EU and UK are still arguing over 2bn euros (Â£1.76bn) of allegedly unpaid duties on Chinese shoes and textiles imported into Britain, and legal action looms. The EU's negotiators wonder whether the other side is about to change tack on a major issue, and they suggest that the upcoming political deal about the shape of the future relationship may have to be very vague if it's to find approval from a divided British government, parliament and public. Labour wants the UK to form a customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the prime minister is ""being held hostage by the extreme Brexiteers in her own party"". The party's shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said: ""Labour has been clear that the best way to protect jobs, the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland is by negotiating a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union after Brexit. ""However, the Tories appear more interested in issuing ultimatums and squabbling amongst themselves than acting in the national interest."" The Lib Dems, who back staying in the customs union and want a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said Mrs May was ""kicking the can down the road in a desperate attempt to hold the widening fissures of the Tory party together - it cannot and will not work"". SNP MP Tommy Sheppard accused the Scottish Conservative MPs who were among the group of Brexiteers warning Mrs May about a customs partnership of being ""British nationalists, who long for the return of days of Empire and for the time when the map of the world was mostly pink"".

Kanye said he was ""being attacked for presenting new ideas"" By Mark Savage, BBC music reporter Is Kanye West stoking controversy simply to sell records? Yes and no. The star returned to Twitter two weeks ago after almost a year away. That's pretty standard behaviour - lots of artists ""go dark"" on social media in the run-up to a new record, only to reappear in (what they hope is) a blaze of publicity when the release date draws near. But West is instinctively a provocateur. He started to go off-message, tweeting about his admiration of Donald Trump and right-wing commentators who ""challenge"" conventional thought. His subsequent statements online and on camera, including the extraordinary assertion that slavery might have been a ""choice"", have only stoked the controversy further. But if this is all a marketing ploy,as Forbes suggests,external, it's backfiring spectacularly. Because unless I'm mistaken, alienating your fanbase isn't a commonly accepted principle of advertising. All the same, West will use the controversy to fuel his music. After all, the song he released on Saturday, Ye Vs The People, which sees fellow rap star TI challenging his views, was apparently recorded just 48 hours earlier. So he's reacting and creating in addition to provoking and promoting, which makes this a curiously compelling moment in music. ""I think he's trying to take people on a journey,"" said US radio host Ebro Darden, after speaking to West last week. ""What I've expressed to him is that he better hurry up and get to his destination."" Since Kanye made the comments suggesting slavery was a ""choice"", a meme has developed on social media mocking the rapper's remarks. The hashtag #IfSlaveryWasAChoice became the top trending topic in the US just hours after the TMZ broadcast. Many have used the hashtag to create fictitious scenarios, where enslaved African Americans were working on plantations out of their own free will. US entrepreneur Luke Lawal imagined a scenario where the cotton pickers have their Mac computer out in the field and are selecting their playlist for the day. Allow Twitter content?

"Men arrested at Starbucks settle for $1The two black men will each receive $1 and $200,000 for a youth employment programme, officials say.13m13 minutes agoUS & Canada","Rashon Nelson (L) and Donte Robinson (R) will each receive $1 and a promise from the city to set up a youth programme Two black men who were arrested at a Starbucks cafe by Philadelphia police last month have reached a financial settlement with the city. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will each receive a symbolic $1 and a promise from officials to set up a programme for young entrepreneurs. The arrest of the men, who had not yet ordered and were waiting for a friend, kicked off a row over racial profiling. Starbucks announced days later it would require employee anti-bias training. This video can not be played Watch the arrest of two black men at Starbucks - and the protests that followed The settlement, which was confirmed to BBC News by a spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenny, includes a vow from the city to contribute $200,000 (Â£147,000) to the new programme. The grant money will go towards creating a pilot programme ""for city public high school students with aspirations of becoming entrepreneurs, as envisioned by Robinson and Nelson, who will not receive any money from the grant"", the city announced in a press release. The 12 April arrest led to protests at Starbucks cafes around the country, while other customers shared claims of racial profiling by company staff. The arrest was captured on mobile phone video and showed the men being led away in handcuffs after a manager had accused them of trespassing and causing a disturbance. Starbucks shuts US cafes for race training 'This is an America thing, not Starbucks' Starbucks 'sorry' over black men arrest The two longtime friends, both 23, had just sat down at the coffee chain's downtown location for a meeting to discuss a possible real estate deal. After spending hours in jail, they were released and no charges were filed. The Philadelphia chief of police later apologised for his handling of the arrest. Mayor Kenney said in a statement that he was ""pleased to have resolved the potential claims against the city in this productive manner"". ""This was an incident that evoked a lot of pain in our city,"" he continued. Starbucks race row leaves customers with a bitter aftertaste ""Rather than spending time, money, and resources to engage in a potentially adversarial process, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson approached the city and invited us to partner with them in an attempt to make something positive come of this. ""This agreement is the result of those conversations, and I look forward to seeing the fruits of this effort in the coming months and years."" This video can not be played Brandon Wardâs video of his encounter at a Starbucks has gone viral Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson came to Philadelphia to personally apologise to the two men. In a joint statement with Mr Nelson and Mr Robinson,external, Starbucks announced that it had reached a separate financial settlement with the men earlier this week. That confidential settlement ""will allow both sides to move forward and continue to talk and explore means of preventing similar occurrences at any Starbucks locations"", the statement said. Mr Johnson added that he wishes to ""thank Donte and Rashon for their willingness to reconcile"". Mr Nelson and Mr Robinson jointly said they appreciate the effort to foster communication, and add ""we will be measured by our action not words"". As part of the settlement both men have been offered university scholarships by Starbucks, and the opportunity to meet former US Attorney Eric Holder, who has been hired ""as part of the company's long-term diversity and equity efforts"".

George Michael fans asked to move tributesSupporters have created memorial gardens outside his homes in Goring and Highgate.2h2 hours agoOxford,"Tributes have been left at George Michael's properties since his death in 2016 The family of George Michael have requested that fans take down tributes left outside the singer's two homes. The pop star was found dead at his riverside house in Goring, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day 2016. Supporters have created memorial gardens outside his home in the village and at Highgate, north London. In astatement on his official website,external, members of his family said he ""would not want to disturb or change the quiet neighbourhoods he so loved"". They asked fans of the singer to pick up their tributes, which include flowers and framed pictures of the singer, by 27 May. A makeshift memorial has been made outside Mr Michael's home in Highgate, north London The statement, written by Mr Michael's sisters Mel and Yioda, father Jack and friend David Austin, said they were ""touched by your many tributes celebrating and remembering"" him. ""However, we feel we cannot expect our Highgate and Goring neighbours to continue to accept as normality, the memorials so personal to you all, to remain as and where they are any longer.""

'Extreme' abortion bill approved in US,"The struggle over abortion rights, always an impassioned affair in the US, has intensified since Donald Trump came into the White House The US state of Iowa has approved an abortion law banning most abortions once a foetal heartbeat is detected. Republican lawmakers passed the bill in back-to-back votes, sending it to the governor's desk to sign into law. If it comes into effect the bill will ban most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and rights groups say it will be the country's most restrictive. Critics argue it will make having an abortion illegal before most women even realise they are pregnant. Iowa's Republican Governor Kim Reynolds has not said if she will sign the bill. Last year, Iowa Republicans successfully banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The past and future of US abortion debate The so-called ""heartbeat"" bill would require any woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound to screen for a foetal heartbeat. If one is detected, she will be barred from obtaining a termination. Some exceptions have been introduced - in cases of rape and incest, where it has been reported to authorities, and to save the woman's life. ""We're in the majority for a reason and that includes advancing the pro-life cause,"" Republican Representative Shannon Lundgren toldthe Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,external. ""We are alive when our hearts start beating and our life is over when it stops,"" Dawn Pettengil, another Republican Representative from Iowa,told CBS News,external. Democratic Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell spoke against the legislation on the floor of the Iowa House of Representatives on Tuesday. ""All women, regardless of age, income or race, should be able to obtain reproductive health services, including abortion, free from political and economic barriers,"" Ms Wessel-Kroeschell said. Iowa's Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union groups have also spoken out against the bill. ""These extreme attempts to ban abortion fly in the face of both medical and legal standards, as well as common sense and public opinion among Iowans,"" said Erin Davison-Rippey, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's director of public affairsin an online statement released in February, when the bill was first introduced,external. ""So-called 'heartbeat protection' bills are actually bans on safe, legal abortion, and they threaten to set reproductive rights back by decades."" Elizabeth Nash, of the sexual and reproductive health policy group the Guttmacher Institute, told the BBC this was ""the most restrictive abortion ban in the country"". This video can not be played Why one woman decided to terminate her pregnancy - and defends Planned Parenthood This video can not be played Jeanne Mancini organises March for Life, a major anti-abortion rally in the US She and Iowa Democrats have suggested the bill is intentionally unconstitutional. If Ms Reynolds signs the bill into law, it will likely be challenged in court for possibly violating Roe v Wade, the US Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion in 1973. The ruling states some women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a foetus is viable. No, in fact some Republican lawmakers welcomed the challenge. ""I would love for the United States Supreme Court to look at this bill and have this as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" Republican Senator Jake Chapman said. This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi A string of US states have enacted abortion bans or stringent restrictions over recent decades only to have them overturned by the courts, prompting some conservatives to take aim at the landmark ruling. ""We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v Wade,"" Republican state Senator Rick Bertrand acknowledged. How US abortion debate got to this point Iowa is among a number of states, including Mississippi and Kentucky, that have triggered court challenges by imposing tight restrictions on abortion. President Donald Trump supports an abortion ban and has indicated that this is a priority, and Republicans are seizing the opportunity that creates, say commentators.

House of Fraser plans to close stores,"House of Fraser plans to close stores as new owners look to turn around the department store chain. The retailer said China's C.banner, which also owns Hamleys, is taking a 51% stake, shifting control from another Chinese firm, Nanjing Cenbest. House of Fraser intends to launch a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), under which it is likely to close some stores and renegotiate rents on others. It did not say how many stores are earmarked for closure. House of Fraser has 59 stores in the UK and Ireland, more than 6,000 employees and 11,500 concession staff. Frank Slevin, the chairman, said: ""There is a need to create a leaner business that better serves the rapidly changing behaviours of a customer base. ""House of Fraser's future will depend on creating the right portfolio of stores that are the right size and in the right location."" Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Six shops defying High Street downturn Five reasons Toys R Us failed C.banner, which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, is expected to raise about Â£70m by issuing new shares. The deal is expected to complete by the end of June and Nanjing Cenbest will continue to hold a significant minority stake. House of Fraser's new owner also owns Hamleys Under Nanjing Cenbest's ownership, there were plans for a big expansion of House of Fraser in China, but only one store materialised, in Nanjing itself. The chain expects to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. House of Fraser will hope to avoid the fate of department store chain BHS, which collapsed in 2016. More recently, several other big High Street names have struggled in the face of online competition, a decline in consumer confidence and rising overheads. Toys R Us and Maplin went into administration on the same day in February, while New Look and Carpetright have both entered into CVAs.

Breast screening: For and against,"More than two million women are screened each year in the UK for breast cancer Women invited for breast cancer screening in the UK are to be given more information about the potential harms of being tested, after an independent review has shown that for some it can do more harm than good. For every life saved, three women will have treatment for a cancer which would never have been fatal, evidence suggests. Miriam Pryke, from Marlow in Buckinghamshire, believes she was ""overtreated"" for her cancer and regrets having screening, while Diane Dally from Walton-on-Thames is extremely grateful that her tumour was spotted and removed. This video can not be played Miriam Pryke says she was ""over-treated"" and had unnecessary cancer surgery after screening ""I discovered at the time of my diagnosis that I may or may not ever develop cancer but I had not been informed of this possibility before I went for screening. ""One thing led to another and I was treated,"" a decision that Miriam says she deeply regrets. ""I would never have undergone it [screening] had I known I had been in that situation - if I had known I could face the possibility of mutilating surgery only to discover that I did not have cancer at all."" She said: ""I could not possibly know whether or not at that time I had further cancer beyond what the tests had already revealed and whether indeed the non-invasive cancer that had been diagnosed would progress or not. ""But it is done under duress. When you are under a diagnosis they tell you that they can't tell the extent of your disease or how quickly it will progress so you are under the threat of death at this point. ""It takes a very strong woman at that point to say I'm not going to do anything. ""My feet didn't touch the ground. ""I had to make my mind up."" Miriam had two breast operations to remove her cancer (removal of a quarter of her breast and then later a full mastectomy of the same breast) - a tumour that doctors say may never have gone on to cause her any problems. She sais that without the screening there was a chance that she would have later developed symptoms, had treatment and had the same outlook as she has now - but without the screening she might never have developed symptoms and so avoided treatment and unnecessary anxiety. Diane's cancer was spotted by routine screening. After further tests to confirm the diagnosis, doctors recommended a mastectomy, which Diane says she was relieved to have. ""I wanted to have a mastectomy and they were agreeing that I should have one. ""I could not have lived with a breast that had cancer in. I'm such an anxious person that I just could not live with that. ""In some ways I didn't have a choice because they said I did need a mastectomy, but even if they had said you don't need a mastectomy I would have gone ahead and a mastectomy. I even would have had a double mastectomy if they would do it. But they said the other one was fine and that's it."" ""I am thankful that I went and had the mastectomy. I have had nothing but really good support and was told each step of the way I was going what was happening.""

Breast screening: What happens now?,"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has announced an independent review into why 450,000 women in England failed to receive invitations for a final routine breast cancer screening between the ages of 68 and 71. So what went wrong with the NHS's screening programme? Breast screening aims to find cancer early by using an X-ray called a mammogram that can spot tumours when they're too small to see or feel. Around one-in-eight women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime, and if it's detected early treatment is more likely to be successful. As the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age, women in the UK from the age of 50 who are registered with a GP are automatically invited for a screening with a letter every three years up until their 71st birthday. Women can't ask for an appointment themselves until they turn 70, when screening requests can be made every three years. TheAgeX trial,externalhas been looking at offering screening to women as young as 47 and up to the age of 73 to see what risks and benefits there are to expanding the service for these women. In older women screening can pick up cancers that do not need to be treated. The NHS national breast screening programme invites more than 2.5 million women every year for a test, with about two million women taking up the offer. Mr Hunt told the Commons the problem was caused by a ""computer algorithm failure"", which led to some women not receiving their final breast screening when they were between the ages of 68 and 71. The problems happened between 2009 and the start of 2018. It is not currently known if anyone died as a result of the errors, but Mr Hunt said it was estimated that between 135 and 270 women may have had their life shortened. Public Health England spotted the issue in January during an analysis of data from the Age X trial. For the trial, women in some parts of England were put into two groups - one that got screening services beyond the normal cut-off ages and a control group that had screening invites at the standard ages. The BBC understands an error led to women in the control group wrongly being offered screenings up until their 70th birthday, rather than their 71st. This led to a bigger review that found a number of other issues, including some local services not inviting everyone for a final screen in the three years before their 71st birthday. Mr Hunt said further analysis found there had been issues with how people's ages were programmed into the IT system. The health secretary said the errors came to light after an upgrade to the breast screening invitation IT system. The issues were escalated to ministers in March by PHE following an urgent clinical review, and the government was told the error should not be made public to ensure existing screening services were not overwhelmed. The problems were fixed in April, the health secretary said. Scotland has a different system, and Wales and Northern Ireland have similar ones but do not seem to be affected, Mr Hunt said. Of those who were affected, 309,000 are estimated to be alive. Mr Hunt said the NHS intended to contact these women if they were still living in the UK and registered with a GP by the end of May, with the first 65,000 letters going out this week. Anyone who does not receive a letter this month is not likely to have been affected, he said. Those under the age of 72 will receive an appointment letter informing them of the time and date. Those over 72 will be offered access to a helpline to decide if it will be beneficial for them, as scans in older women can pick up cancers that do not require treatment. Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information Mr Hunt said ""best endeavours"" would be made to contact the next of kin of women who had missed a scan and subsequently died of breast cancer. A process will be set up to establish if the missed scan was a likely cause of death and whether compensation should be paid, Mr Hunt said. The independent review into the ""serious failure"" will look at how many people were affected, why that failure happened and how it can be prevented from happening again. But beyond this, Mr Hunt said it will also examine why systems did not detect the problem sooner, whether there were warnings that should have been noticed earlier, and if ministers should have been informed quicker. He also said it would look at what patient safety lessons could be learned. The review will be chaired by Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, and Professor Martin Gore, from the Royal Marsden Hospital - it is expected to report back in six months.

"'Extreme' abortion bill approved in USThe Iowa bill, thought to be among the strictest in US, bans abortions once a heartbeat is detected.7m8 minutes agoUS & Canada","The struggle over abortion rights, always an impassioned affair in the US, has intensified since Donald Trump came into the White House The US state of Iowa has approved an abortion law banning most abortions once a foetal heartbeat is detected. Republican lawmakers passed the bill in back-to-back votes, sending it to the governor's desk to sign into law. If it comes into effect the bill will ban most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and rights groups say it will be the country's most restrictive. Critics argue it will make having an abortion illegal before most women even realise they are pregnant. Iowa's Republican Governor Kim Reynolds has not said if she will sign the bill. Last year, Iowa Republicans successfully banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The past and future of US abortion debate The so-called ""heartbeat"" bill would require any woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound to screen for a foetal heartbeat. If one is detected, she will be barred from obtaining a termination. Some exceptions have been introduced - in cases of rape and incest, where it has been reported to authorities, and to save the woman's life. ""We're in the majority for a reason and that includes advancing the pro-life cause,"" Republican Representative Shannon Lundgren toldthe Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,external. ""We are alive when our hearts start beating and our life is over when it stops,"" Dawn Pettengil, another Republican Representative from Iowa,told CBS News,external. Democratic Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell spoke against the legislation on the floor of the Iowa House of Representatives on Tuesday. ""All women, regardless of age, income or race, should be able to obtain reproductive health services, including abortion, free from political and economic barriers,"" Ms Wessel-Kroeschell said. Iowa's Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union groups have also spoken out against the bill. ""These extreme attempts to ban abortion fly in the face of both medical and legal standards, as well as common sense and public opinion among Iowans,"" said Erin Davison-Rippey, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's director of public affairsin an online statement released in February, when the bill was first introduced,external. ""So-called 'heartbeat protection' bills are actually bans on safe, legal abortion, and they threaten to set reproductive rights back by decades."" Elizabeth Nash, of the sexual and reproductive health policy group the Guttmacher Institute, told the BBC this was ""the most restrictive abortion ban in the country"". This video can not be played Why one woman decided to terminate her pregnancy - and defends Planned Parenthood This video can not be played Jeanne Mancini organises March for Life, a major anti-abortion rally in the US She and Iowa Democrats have suggested the bill is intentionally unconstitutional. If Ms Reynolds signs the bill into law, it will likely be challenged in court for possibly violating Roe v Wade, the US Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion in 1973. The ruling states some women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a foetus is viable. No, in fact some Republican lawmakers welcomed the challenge. ""I would love for the United States Supreme Court to look at this bill and have this as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" Republican Senator Jake Chapman said. This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi A string of US states have enacted abortion bans or stringent restrictions over recent decades only to have them overturned by the courts, prompting some conservatives to take aim at the landmark ruling. ""We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v Wade,"" Republican state Senator Rick Bertrand acknowledged. How US abortion debate got to this point Iowa is among a number of states, including Mississippi and Kentucky, that have triggered court challenges by imposing tight restrictions on abortion. President Donald Trump supports an abortion ban and has indicated that this is a priority, and Republicans are seizing the opportunity that creates, say commentators.

"Hacker faces jail for stealing Just Eat dataGrant West, 26, stole data from the company's customers by sending bogus emails offering a voucher.","This video can not be played The moment a group of undercover police arrested Grant West on a train A computer hacker who sold the personal data of thousands of people on the dark web faces jail after admitting a string of offences. Police began investigating Grant West, 26, after he conned details from Just Eat customers in 2015. The personal data of around 165,000 people was compromised. Detectives later found he had 63,000 credit and debit card details - and seized more than Â£500,000 in bitcoins belonging to West. He admitted charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offences. West, from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, used ""phishing"" emails to extract customer data from various companies. Between July 2015 and December 2015 he targeted online food delivery firm Just Eat, using a scam in which customers received a bogus email offering a voucher in return for answering questions about the service. Grant West sent fake emails to customers offering vouchers The emails allowed West to harvest information - including customers' names, addresses and payment card details - in order to sell to other criminals. There is no suggestion that Just Eat's own computer systems were hacked or compromised. Detectives believe he targeted customers of just about every major online vendor, from ""Argos to Uber"", as part of his criminal enterprise, using millions of email addresses to indiscriminately trick people into revealing their financial information. Once he had a complete set of customer details he would sell them on via the now-defunct online dark web market Alpha Bay, with the user name ""courvoisier"". The details were sold as ""Fullz"" - a slang term on the dark web used to describe a full set of customer details that would allow others to defraud individual bank accounts and credit cards. West would ask Just Eat customers to answer questions about the service The courvoisier account sold details belonging to 9,627 people - many of whom lost significant amounts to other online fraudsters. Police say West made more than Â£180,000 from the scam. The proceeds from his business were converted into Bitcoins and stored in multiple accounts. The Just Eat phishing scam cost the firm more than Â£200,000 - but also gave specialist detectives from London's Metropolitan Police their first lead. West used his girlfriend's laptop and police traced the computer via a series of IP addresses, despite his best efforts to cover his digital tracks. As detectives moved in on West they realised that getting their hands on the laptop with his ""fingers on the keyboard"" was crucial. A team of covert officers tracked West and while he was using the computer in the first class carriage on a train from Rhyl to London officers pounced on him, seizing the unlocked computer. The arrest was captured on the train's CCTV. On the laptop they found the financial information of more than 100,000 people. The dark web page used by West Officers also raided West's home address and found an SD card with the details of 63,000 debit and credit cards, seven million email addresses with passwords, and the details of more than 500 companies - all the components required to commit mass online fraud. They also seized Â£25,000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis. As well as financial information, West also sold cannabis online - which he shipped to customers - and ""how to"" guides for fellow hackers. Police say West treated his fraudulent activity as a ""day job"", sometimes spending 18 hours a day hacking financial information and doing online deals. At first sight his lifestyle was simple - the family home was a caravan in a residential park - but West funded luxury holidays and goods with stolen credit card details. His former girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, from North Wales, also enjoyed the cash generated by the frauds. At one point using stolen details to buy a new bikini. She was sentenced on Wednesday to a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorised access of computer material. His Honour Judge Michael Gledhill QC told Ms Brookes that she was ""very fortunate indeed"" not to be jailed and said of her relationship with West that she had ""fallen into the arms of a villain and a rogue"". West used his girlfriend Rachael Brookes' laptop for his criminal activities West has no formal qualifications and, although he directed the frauds, investigators believe he was working with others. Bitcoin ""wallets"" belonging to West were emptied the day after he was arrested. At current prices those Bitcoins are estimated to be worth Â£1.5m. Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gallagher - who led the investigation - said police were ""uncovering the darkness and shady areas"" where criminals operate on the dark web, and were ""bringing them into the light"". ""There was a myth that Bitcoin in particular, and crypto-currencies more generally, was anonymous and it was also a myth that people can operate with impunity on the dark web and remain anonymous,"" he said. A spokesperson for Just Eat said ""We were made aware of a phishing scam which took place in 2015 and at the time took steps to mitigate thisâ¦ at no point were Just Eat systems compromised or breached. ""Protecting our brand and our customers from online fraud is of utmost importance to us."" West will be sentenced on 25 May.

George Michael fans asked to move tributesSupporters have created memorial gardens outside his homes in Goring and Highgate.3h3 hours agoOxford,"Tributes have been left at George Michael's properties since his death in 2016 The family of George Michael have requested that fans take down tributes left outside the singer's two homes. The pop star was found dead at his riverside house in Goring, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day 2016. Supporters have created memorial gardens outside his home in the village and at Highgate, north London. In astatement on his official website,external, members of his family said he ""would not want to disturb or change the quiet neighbourhoods he so loved"". They asked fans of the singer to pick up their tributes, which include flowers and framed pictures of the singer, by 27 May. A makeshift memorial has been made outside Mr Michael's home in Highgate, north London The statement, written by Mr Michael's sisters Mel and Yioda, father Jack and friend David Austin, said they were ""touched by your many tributes celebrating and remembering"" him. ""However, we feel we cannot expect our Highgate and Goring neighbours to continue to accept as normality, the memorials so personal to you all, to remain as and where they are any longer."" They asked that supporters, who call themselves 'lovelies', make a donation to charity as a tribute instead. WATCH: The wholesome rapper inspired by Eminem Critical window for learning a language When is it OK to do a 'power pose'? Annette McHail, who lays flowers near his Mill Cottage home in Goring every week, said the decision would ""put the house back how George would like it."" ""He was a private person and I can appreciate what the family are saying, it needs to go back to normal now."" Visitors have travelled from across the world to pay tribute to George Michael at his home in Goring, Oxfordshire. Mrs McHail added she would not leave any tributes in future. Mr Michael's next door neighbour, Diana Davies, said that ""a few"" local residents in Goring were unhappy about the memorial, but the visitors were ""very respectful"" and it was kept ""neat and tidy"". ""I don't see how you can stop it, people come from all over the world, and they will continue to leave things"". It is unclear how this will affect a celebration organised by fans for George Michael's birthday in June, when fans from around the world were expected to visit Goring and pay respects to the singer. On Twitter, Trista Stone said,external: ""It's tough. The family wants everything back to their normal... But there isn't a grave we, as fans can visit... Some need something more physical."" James Burton agreed,external: ""There ought to be a statue or permanent memorial where people can leave tributes without disturbing anyone."" Allow Twitter content?

Controversial biohacker is found dead,"Controversial bodyhacker Aaron Traywick has been found dead A biohacker who became infamous after apparently injecting himself with an untested herpes drug in front of an audience has been found dead. Aaron Traywick's body had been discovered in a spa room in Washington DC on Sunday, local police said. Vice News,externalreported that Traywick had been using a flotation therapy tank. The 28-year-old was chief executive of Ascendance Biomedical. He had skirted the law by self-medicating as well as encouraging others to do likewise. A police spokeswoman has said no evidence has been found to suggest foul play. Traywick had claimed his biohacking company had developed a DIY ""research compound"" that could cure HIV, Aids and herpes, but had no independent proof to back this up. Biohacking refers to people's efforts to alter their own biology by a variety of means including lifestyle and diet changes, surgery and the use of unlicensed therapies. The BBCchallenged Traywick over his behaviourwhen it interviewed him at the BodyHacking Con in Austin, Texas, in February. Traywick, who had herpes, had performed a stunt at the event, apparently injecting his company's unregulated product into his leg. Why I injected myself with an untested gene therapy On stage, he had referred to the product as a ""research compound"". But in conversation with the BBC he described it as a ""treatment"" - a claim that had the potential to attract the attention of the US Food and Drug Administration. This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Dave Lee met with Aaron Traywick during the BodyHacking Con Traywick told the BBC he had plans to take his work to Venezuela. When questioned whether it was ethical to encourage sick people to effectively act as guinea pigs, Traywick responded: ""The best we can do is we can say to these people, 'We know you don't have access to this medication.' ""They don't have any other options. ""All we know is that if it works they don't die."" Would you hack your own body? Biohacker fined for travel card implant Listen to BBC World Service's Business Daily on bio-hacking Traywick's work had also caused concern among other members of the body-hacking community.

'Patience exhausted' on restraint death,"This video can not be played Kadi Johnson said the family's confidence in the justice system had been shattered The sister of a man who died after being restrained by police three years ago said her ""patience has been exhausted"". Kadi Johnson was speaking at a press conference where Sheku Bayoh's family launched a civil action against Police Scotland for Â£1.85m. Mr Bayoh, 31, lost consciousness after being restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in May 2015. She said police investigations review commissioner Kate Frame should resign. Mrs Johnson said: ""It is three years now since our beloved brother was brutally taken away from us. ""We the family have kept an open mind and had faith in the justice system. But waiting for three years with no answers has been soul destroying. ""PIRC is not fit for purpose. From the start of their so called investigation the aim was to justify the actions of the police and to blame my brother Sheku for his own death. ""The head of PIRC (police investigations review commissioner Kate Frame) failed to approach this investigation openly and fairly. ""We've had enough and our confidence is shattered."" Aamer Anwar, solicitor for the Bayoh family, said the civil action against Police Scotland was unprecedented. Sheku Bayoh died in Kirkcaldy in May 2015 Mr Anwar said: ""There has never been a civil action, as far as I know, against the police for a death in custody. ""The family had hoped that by now the Lord Advocate would have made a decision whether he is going to criminally prosecute the police officers concerned or Police Scotland. Three years on and he still hasn't made his mind up. ""The family believe it would be very different if it had been members of the public involved. ""If it had been nine door stewards that had restrained a member of the public, used weapons and that individual dropped down dead, I suspect the Crown Office would not have taken three years to decide if it would end up in a court of law or not."" The family believe the police investigations review commissioner's investigation into the incident was fatally flawed. The family are suing on the grounds that Mr Bayoh's death could have been avoided. Collette Bell, Mr Bayoh's partner, said: ""It will be three years tomorrow since Sheku was taken from us in a brutal violent way. ""He was mistreated by those that were meant to serve and protect. ""We have always said if Sheku broke the law then the police had the right to act, they did not have the right to perform the role of judge, jury and executioner. ""He will not be forgotten. He will not stop being loved. Would you not continue to fight on?""

""At all stages throughout this independent investigation the PIRC has acted under the direction of the Lord Advocate who has ultimate responsibility for the investigation of deaths in Scotland. ""The PIRC conducted an extensive and detailed investigation into Mr Bayoh's death. ""More than 500 statements were obtained by PIRC investigators who also gathered evidence from a wide range of experts, including those suggested by the Bayoh family and their legal representatives, to give a greater understanding of events leading to Mr Bayoh's death. ""The Commissioner submitted a report to the Lord Advocate in August 2015. ""A further report containing evidence gathered from a number of expert witnesses was submitted in August 2016 and the PIRC has undertaken any additional enquiry requested by the COPFS (Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service)."" A Crown Office spokesman said: ""We recognise that this has been a difficult time for the family of Sheku Bayoh. The family, and their legal representative, have been kept informed of any significant developments and senior Crown Counsel along with Crown Office officials met recently with the family and will continue to do so where appropriate. ""This has been a complex and challenging investigation and while there is still some further work to do, considerable progress has been made in the last few months. ""It is not appropriate at this stage to commit to any timescales given the nature of the investigation.

'Rejected' man guilty of boss murder,"David Browning denied murdering Jillian Howell but admitted manslaughter A man who stabbed his boss to death and wrote ""bully"" on her forehead has been found guilty of her murder. David Browning, 52, admitted killing Jillian Howell on 26 October but claimed it was manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The jury at Hove Crown Court was told Browning went for dinner at her Brighton home and reacted with ""anger and violence"" when she rejected him. Judge Christine Laing said he would be sentenced to life in prison. ""I need time to consider the minimum prison term he must serve before he can apply for parole,"" she said. ""It starts at a minimum of 25 years because he was carrying a knife to the scene of the crime, but I will also consider other factors."" Browning claimed he and Jillian Howell clashed at work but then became friends as he confided in her The married father of two from Seaford, East Sussex, formed an intense attachment to his boss in the payroll department at the University of Brighton, and confided in her about his emotional problems, the jury heard. Prosecutor Alan Gardner said Browning became ""possessive, controlling and jealous"" and planned the killing for months. He applied for a firearms licence, bought a shotgun and knife, hired a van, and took a change of clothes to the crime scene. Jillian Howell with close friend Sean McDonald at Wembley Ms Howell told friends she felt manipulated when Browning demanded she must ""never leave"" her job or get a boyfriend and should be ""concentrating on him"", the jury heard. Browning also wrote a ""vitriolic"" letter for her close friend Sean McDonald, which turned out to be part of a failed attempt to implicate him in the murder. The jury was told Samaritans volunteer Ms Howell had urged Browning to get professional help after he confided in her about his depression and suicidal thoughts. On his way to visit Ms Howell before stabbing her, Browning had posted suicide letters, the court was told. Mr Gardner said: ""On 26 October last year, he discovered she didn't have the same feelings as him. She rejected him and Mr Browning reacted with anger and violence."" The jury was shown an image that was uploaded to Browning's Facebook page Jillian Howell was stabbed after sharing a curry she cooked at her home for Browning Browning described the moment when - after sharing a curry - he stabbed her in the back as she bent down to tie a shoelace. He told the court Ms Howell had grabbed the knife and screamed ""you bastard"", to which he replied: ""I'm sorry Jill, this is what mental health does to you."" After stabbing her, Browning put his shotgun to his throat, but could not pull the trigger, Sussex Police said. He then called Samaritans to talk about what had happened. Browning put the shotgun to his throat after killing Ms Howell but could not pull the trigger, police said Mr Gardner said: ""He offered, we know, no explanation for why he did it, only to say 'it must have been my depressive illness'."" He described Browning as a spurned admirer who is ""deeply self-centred, selfish, a man with a vindictive streak"". In a statement, Ms Howell's family said: ""Jill was a gentle and kind soul. She had an aura of calm and peace with a warm heart and an infectious smile. ""Jill's death was shocking and incomprehensible and we are still struggling to accept and make sense of it."" Browning will be sentenced on Thursday.

Acid accused 'prostitution secret' threat,"Mark Van Dongen was granted euthanasia 15 months after being attacked in Bristol A woman accused of throwing acid over her former partner threatened to tell his new girlfriend he had worked as a prostitute, a court has heard. Berlinah Wallace, 48, denies murder and applying a corrosive fluid to Mark van Dongen, 29, in Bristol in 2015. He ended his life in a Belgian euthanasia clinic 15 months later. Ms Wallace told Bristol Crown Court she had threatened to reveal his past because she was worried about how she would pay for her flat if he left. She said Mr van Dongen told her he had been a prostitute in the Netherlands, aged 15, after being kicked out of home. She told the court: ""I was saying, if he doesn't help me I'm going to tell about him."" The court heard Ms Wallace had bought the acid, on Mr van Dongen's advice, to cure smelly drains. When asked about searches on her web history about drinking sulphuric acid, she told the court: ""I was in and out of suicidal mode. I was thinking Mark wanted me to kill myself... so I just wanted to see what I have in the house and if somebody drinks it, what happens to them."" Berlinah Wallace said Mr van Dongen suggested she drank acid for depression The court heard Mr van Dongen had been racist and violent during their five-year relationship. Ms Wallace said they met on a dating website for people with HIV and, after his second visit to Bristol from the Netherlands, ""he never left"". Jurors heard, on one occasion, Mr van Dongen was arrested after he kicked Ms Wallace in the back and hit her in the head. She said, in another incident in the Netherlands, he pulled her out of the shower and pushed her naked into the street. Ms Wallace, originally from South Africa, said she attempted an overdose in August 2015 when Mr van Dongen returned to pack his things after he began seeing another woman. She said he dialled 999 but she was unable to swallow the pills - used to control her HIV - because they were too big. She told the jury that on 3 September 2015 she became upset after Mr van Dongen reported her to police ""saying I was stalking him when I was not"". Defence barrister Richard Smith said she was later admitted to Bristol Royal Infirmary, having taken an overdose. He said, despite being told not to contact Mr van Dongen, within five days the pair had met and were making phone calls to each other. Ms Wallace said she thought the substance she threw was water Earlier in the trial, Ms Wallace told the court she had mistakenly thought the corrosive fluid she threw at Mr van Dongen was water which he had handed to her in a cup in a bid to kill her. Mr van Dongen was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, ear and eye following the alleged attack on 23 September 2015. The trial continues.

'Staggering' clean-up of polluted river,"The technique separates out the orange metallic sludge, leaving clean water only to flow into the river A pilot scheme to clean rivers polluted by abandoned metal mines has delivered ""staggering"" results, environment officials have claimed. The new technology - thought to be a world-first - removed up to 99.5% of metals which impact water quality. The electrochemical technique separated a metallic sludge from mine discharges leaving clean water behind. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said it marked a potential ""step change"" in how the problem is handled. Metal mining in the UK peaked in the 18th and 19th centuries and though they have now all closed, their effect on the environment is still obvious. 'One in five rivers' in Wales polluted by sewage - WWF Microplastics are 'littering' riverbeds 'Flexible' approach to farm pollution favoured Wales has more than 1,300 abandoned metal mines, impacting more than 67 water bodies and in excess of 370 miles (600km) of river. Nine of the 10 worst affected catchments in the UK are in Wales. The innovative treatment plant has been tested on a stretch of the river Rheidol near Aberystwyth in Ceredigion. This video can not be played Peter Stanley said the big advantage was that the system did not take up much space The area is popular with tourists for its scenic reservoir, steam train and red kites, but it was once home to mines producing lead and zinc which now discharge highly acidic, orange water into the river. It is thought eight tonnes of metal, including zinc, chromium and cadmium, enter the Rheidol every year, spreading out over 11 miles (18km) of river, killing fish and other wildlife. Since the 1960s the polluted water has been collected in large pools in an attempt to filter out the metals, with limited success. More recently,treating it using a combination of compost, limestone and cockle shells has been more effective. However, scaling up this technique would require much more land than is available in the narrow, steep-sided valley, so NRW asked technology companies to come up with an innovative solution. The pilot scheme used a portable unit to extract the metallic sludge A portable treatment plant - the size of a car - is attached to a small generator. The system sucks in the dirty water discharged and uses a combination of electrolysis and ultrasound to clean it and correct its acidity. Swansea-based Power and Water is the company behind the technology. ""What we are able to do is to add a small amount of power on to an anode and cathode which slowly dissolve into the [contaminated water]. That allows for a chemical reaction where any contaminants are removed and the clean water can safely be discharged,"" said chief executive Gareth Morgan. The metallic sludge which sinks to the bottom of the tank can then also be removed safely.  In future it is hoped the sludge could potentially be sold and the metals extracted and re-used. ""I don't know how much more excited I could be,"" says Peter Stanley, a water and land contamination specialist at NRW The three-month trial - which cost approximately Â£90,000 - was funded by the Welsh Government. Peter Stanley, a water and land contamination specialist at NRW, said the big advantage of the system it had trialled was that only a ""small spatial footprint"" is needed. ""When we've filtered the samples we've been getting 99.5% removal of metals, which is quite staggering,"" he said. ""I don't know how much more excited I could be in relation to the results that have been shown here - it gives us a new tool in our armour to effect treatment at metal mines, particularly those in steep, challenging environments like this."" Power and Water said it had been granted an international patent for the technology which it hopes to install at other abandoned mines following the success of this trial. ""This week alone we've had interest from consultants working in Sumatra and Australia as well as enquiries about mines in England and Scotland too,"" said Mr Morgan. ""Not only are we looking to try and create a solution that is going to have a beneficial impact on these historical metal mines within Wales itself but the potential to export outside of the country is exciting as well."" The Welsh Government said it had given a further Â£3.3m to NRW to tackle metal mine pollution.

MoD admits civilian death in IS fightA man on a motorbike was hit when he crossed a target area in Syria at the last minute.4m5 minutes agoUK,"The civilian died after a strike by an RAF Reaper drone An RAF strike on the Islamic State group has caused a civilian casualty, the Ministry of Defence has admitted for the first time. It says a Reaper drone fired on an IS vehicle in eastern Syria on 26 March this year, ""unintentionally"" killing a civilian on a motorbike when he crossed the target area at the last minute. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the incident was ""deeply regrettable"". The RAF has carried out more than 1,600 strikes against IS in Syria and Iraq. RAF 'may have killed civilians' in Iraq The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and chartss How many bombs has the UK dropped in 2017? Can civilian deaths be avoided in RAF strikes on IS? The MoD says it has done ""everything possible"" to minimise the risk to civilians. The UK is second to the US in the number of airstrikes it conducted for acoalition,externalof 75 countries formed in 2014 to defeat IS. In a written ministerial statement, the defence secretary said the assessment of the civilian death was made after ""routine and detailed post-strike analysis"". Mr Williamson said: ""These events serve to remind us of the consequences of conflict and of the heavy price that the people of Syria have paid. ""It reminds us that when we undertake military action, we must do so knowing that it can never be completely without risk."" He added the incident would ""not weaken"" the UK's resolve to defeat IS. Cockpit footage of an RAF air strike on an IS artillery position in Mosul in 2017 In a statement issued after the attack,external, the MoD had said the Reaper drone ""tracked a group of terrorists in a vehicle in the Syrian Euphrates valley... and successfully destroyed it and its occupants with a precision Hellfire missile attack"". Up until now, the MoD said it had seen ""no evidence"" that its strikes had caused civilian casualties. But on Monday aBBC investigation suggested other civilians may have been killedas a result of RAF air strikes. A source inside the coalition fighting IS highlighted a strike on 9 January last year in Mosul, Iraq, when an RAF Tornado fired a Brimstone missile on what was described as a ""lorry bomb"" in eastern Mosul. It caused a large secondary explosion and the source said he believed two civilians were ""almost certainly"" killed. The BBC has also discovered evidence that some RAF bombs have malfunctioned and strayed off target, potentially leading to civilian deaths.

"Trump wrote own health letter, doctor saysA note on Donald Trump's ""astonishing"" health was dictated by Mr Trump, his ex-doctor says.1han hour agoUS & Canada","The letter signed by Mr Bornstein described Mr Trump's stamina as ""extraordinary"" Donald Trump's former doctor has said he did not write a 2015 letter declaring the then-Republican presidential candidate's ""astonishingly excellent"" health, US media report. ""[Mr Trump] dictated that whole letter,"" Harold Bornstein told CNN.,external The White House has not yet commented on the physician's allegation. Mr Bornstein also said that Mr Trump's bodyguard had carried out a ""raid"" on his offices in February 2017, removing all of Mr Trump's medical records. Trump's health: Three big ethics questions In an interview with CNN, Mr Bornstein said the 2015 letter suggesting that Mr Trump would be the ""healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency"" was not his professional assessment. ""[Mr Trump] dictated the letter and I would tell him what he couldn't put in there,"" he said. It is not clear why Mr Bornstein is making these allegations now. Allow Twitter content?

The letter's contents included statements on Mr Trump's physical strength and stamina, which were described as ""extraordinary"". His blood pressure and laboratory tests were described as ""astonishingly excellent"" and he was said to have lost 15 pounds (7kg) over the course of a year. It added that Mr Trump had no forms of cancer and had not had joint surgery. Quiz: Could you pass Trump's brain test? A few weeks ahead of its release, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Bornstein's medical report would show ""perfection"". ""I am fortunate to have been blessed with great genes,"" Mr Trump, who became the oldest president to be elected in US history, wrote on Facebook at the time. In January this year Mr Trump had a three-hour examination amid speculation over his mental health. This video can not be played Dr Jackson on President Trump: ""He has incredible genes"" His White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, said at the time: ""I have no concerns about his cognitive ability or neurological functions."" To Whom My Concern: I have been the personal physician of Mr Donald J. Trump since 1980. His previous physician was my father, Dr Jacob Bornstein. Over the past 39 years, I am pleased to report that Mr Trump has had no significant medical problems. Mr Trump has had a recent complete medical examination that showed only positive results. Actually, his blood pressure, 110/65, and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent. Over the past twelve months, he has lost at least fifteen pounds, Mr Trump takes 81 mg of aspirin daily and a low dose of a statin. His PSA test score is 0.15 (very low). His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary. Mr Trump has suffered no form of cancer, has never had a hip, knee or shoulder replacement or any other orthopaedic surgery. His only surgery was an appendectomy at age ten. His cardiovascular status is excellent. He has no history of ever using alcohol or tobacco products. If elected, Mr Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. The New York City-based physician said he was visited by one of Mr Trump's personal bodyguards and two other men at his office on 3 February 2017. ""They must have been here for 25 or 30 minutes, it created a lot of chaos,"" Mr Bornstein told NBC News, adding that the incident made him feel ""raped, frightened and sad"". He said the original and only copy of Mr Trump's medical charts, including lab reports, were taken by his aides. The incident took place shortly after The New York Times published a report in which Mr Bornstein said he had prescribed Mr Trump with Propecia, an anti-baldness drug.

Home Office review into Windrush failings,"The Home Office is to hold an internal review of its handling of the Windrush scandal, Theresa May has said. She told MPs it would have ""full access"" to all relevant documents, including policy papers and case files. Her announcement came as Labour prepares to try and force ministers to release all government papers relating to Windrush cases since 2010. Jeremy Corbyn said the crisis had been ""made in the Home Office"" under Theresa May's leadership. Live updates as MPs debate Windrush documents At Prime Minister's Questions, he asked Mrs May whether she ""felt a pang of guilt"" about the resignation of Amber Rudd over the issue earlier this week. The prime minister said the inquiry would seek to ""learn lessons"" from the treatment of Windrush families, some of whom have been detained and threatened with deportation after their right to remain in the UK was questioned. It will aim to complete its work before the summer recess in July. She said ""speed is of the essence"" and new home secretary Sajid Javid ""will be commissioning a full review of lessons learned, independent oversight and external challenge"". The review, she said, will have ""full access to all relevant information in the Home Office, including policy papers and casework decisions"". The Conservatives are expected to oppose a Labour motion which would see all relevant internal documents handed to the Commons Home Affairs Committee. The rarely-used procedure - called a ""motion for a return"" - involves asking the Queen to direct her ministers to provide the requested documents. Opening the debate in the Commons, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott asked Conservative MPs if they understood ""how voting against this motion will look to the Commonwealth and will look to the Windrush generation here"". She said she doubted Mr Javid's claim to be abandoning the ""hostile environment"" tag attached to the government's immigration policies, saying his predecessor Amber Rudd had been a ""human shield"" for its architect, Theresa May. She added: ""Unless and until the prime minister announces the abandonment of the form of hostile environment which she instituted and demonstrates that that be the case then we should all understand that the policy remains in place."" Mr Javid said the Labour motion would divert resources ""into a massive, open-ended fishing expedition"". He told MPs he would be regularly writing to the Home Affairs Select Committee with progress including a monthly report with the latest information on detentions and deportations. ""This review will seek to draw out how members of the Windrush generation came to be entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants, why that was not spotted sooner, and whether the right corrective measures are now in place,"" he said. Mr Javid also said ""members of the hard left"" had greeted his appointment with racist abuse, challenging Mr Corbyn to ""denounce them"". Ms Abbott said that ""everyone on this side of the House without exception condemns the names he has been called"".

House of LordsParliament The House of Lords adjourns and will return on 8 May, when peers will have their sixth and final day of report-stage debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill. What happened? House of CommonsParliament With the conclusion of the general debate, the Commons adjourns. The day started with Exiting the EU questions, of which many were tabled along the same lines: what is the progress of negotiations? David Davis insisted that progress had been made on the issues of citizens rights and financial arrangements. The government once again confirmed that they were seeking a special solution to the problem of the Northern Irish border. The Business statement followed, with some legislation to be wrapped up next week. The general debate raised issues over the ongoing row over immigration at the Home Office, NHS funding, young criminal barristers and workers' rights. The Commons is not sitting on Monday due to the May bank holiday, but will return on Tuesday at 2.30pm with Health and Social Care questions. Breast cancer screening statement House of LordsParliament Health Minister Lord O'Shaughnessy is repeating a statement given by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in the Commons yesterday. He announced an independent review into why 450,000 women in England failed to receive invitations for a final routine breast cancer screening between the ages of 68 and 71. Labour spokesperson Baroness Thornton says ""as a woman of my age, we absolutely rely on these tests"", adding: ""Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go unnoticed."" Lib Dem Baroness Maddock wants to know if the NHS has enough staff to process the screening backlog, stressing ""speed is of the essence"". Lord O'Shaughnessy replies that the government wants to work with other parties to get it right. He says questions over whether the failure could have been detected sooner must be answered by the review, and it must not affect ongoing screening processes. Breast cancer screening: what went wrong? General debate House of CommonsParliament Paul Maynard, government whip, says that an adjournment debate is taking place for ""one day off,"" and calls it ""a treat"". Mr Maynard says that the UK government has been clear on the rights of EU citizens arriving in the UK during the transition period. He says that the justice minister ""is working with the Bar Council"" to raise the issues faced by young criminal barristers, which Conservative MP Bob Stewart raised during his speech. He adds that ""humanity and dignity should be at the heart of everything we do,"" in replying to Chris Stephens' speech, where he raised concerns over the UK's immigration system and workers' rights. General debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Karin Smyth says that in the three weeks since Easter, the government ""has managed to have two scandals and a resignation"" - and she says she is looking forward to a ""quieter"" period over the bank holiday weekend. She agrees with Bob Stewart's speech, on the ""crisis"" at the criminal bar and underfunding of legal aid availability. She agrees with Chris Stephens that the government is confusing people about whether or not the public sector pay cap has been lifted or not. She raises concerns that the NHS is not planning enough for emergency situations. She states that it is one of the most ""undermanaged"" public services for its size in the world. ""We do have a concern now about the level of funding compared to the issues around safety,"" she says, before praising the ""marvellous work of NHS managers across the country"" Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon says that the UK will continue to cooperate on security with the EU after Brexit. ""This cooperation after we leave... sanctions will continue to be a multilateral tool, and we will continue to seek to impose them with others."" Lord Ahmad adds that it is in both the UK and EU's interest to discuss sanctions in future. ""Through the exchange of analysis and information this will allow us to combine our efforts on sanctions to the greatest effect,"" he says. Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament Responding on behalf of Labour, Lord Collins of Highbury, the party's foreign affairs spokesperson in the House thanks Baroness Verma and the committee for the ""excellent and timely report"". ""Sanctions are not in isolation of our foreign policy. They have to be an integral part of it,"" he says. He says that sanctions in isolation do not work - ""they are gesture politics"". He urges the government to ensure UK and EU co-operation continues after Brexit. A succession of senior ministers challenge Mrs May over one of the UK's preferred customs options. Peers have defeated the government 10 times during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill - but what does it mean for the government's Brexit plans? General debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Chris Stephens alleges that, while the prime minister has said that the public sector pay cap has been lifted, it still is being followed as workers are only to expect a 1% pay rise from their departments. He raises concerns that regulations for workers are under threat as there have been job losses in the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, as well as at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. He says that staff at ACAS are, ironically, wanting to strike themselves over work and pay. Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament Labour peer Lord Anderson of Swansea welcomes the ""highly timely report"". He warns that Russia ""must learn that there is conduct that will not be accepted and will have to pay a price"". The Labour peer disagrees with those who dismiss sanctions as ""gesture politics"". ""Sanctions are indeed biting in Russia,"" he says. General debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Bob Stewart raises concerns on how young criminal barristers are treated in terms of pay and conditions. He raises the case of a young woman who could only take five days of holiday a year, could take no sick days and worked late nights and even weekends. He says she had to represent two different clients often in the same day at different courts. ""She told me there was simply no breaks at all. But it was her vocation and the job she wanted to do in her life,"" he says. After all her expenses, she only earned Â£10,000 in London a year. ""If this continues, we simply will not have enough criminal law barristers,"" he warns. Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament The Lords is beginning a debate on a report from the EU Affairs sub-committee on post-Brexit sanctions policy. The report looked at the UK's current sanctions regime and options for designing an autonomous regime and collaborating with the EU and other international partners after Brexit. The report warns that the effectiveness of UK sanctions will be undermined unless the UK can quickly agree arrangements for future sanctions policy co-operation with the EU. It warns that without agreement, the UK could be left with the choice of imposing ineffective unilateral sanctions or aligning with EU sanctions it has no influence over. General debate House of CommonsParliament Moving the debate, Backbench Business Committee Chair Ian Mearns says that members of the EU negotiating team are expressing ""concern"" about the UK's ability to handle EU immigration cases after the Windrush scandal. He states the case of his constituent who has been refused benefits in the UK since a disabling accident. He says she is struggling to fill out the forms online, as the forms insist she puts down when her children came to the UK - but they were born in the UK. He says that the number of people who have died in work related accidents have reduced since Health and Safety legislation was introduced. He adds that he is concerned that the government wants to remove Health and Safety legislation in the UK. ""HSE are working under great pressure"" in order to carry out their role, he says. Oral questions House of LordsParliament UUP peer Lord Empey is now asking whether the government plans to introduce ID cards. There have been periodic calls for the return of identity cards ever since they were scrapped in the UK in 1952. The most recent - and serious - attempt to bring them back began after the 11 September attacks in the US in 2001, when the Labour government adopted a significantly tougher stance on security and immigration. ""This government has no plans to revisit this decision,"" says minister Baroness Manzoor. General debate House of CommonsParliament MPs move on to their adjournment debate. This is standard practice
before any break in Parliamentary time, as the Commons is not sitting on
Monday. Any matters can be raised during a general debate such as
this. MPs often use the opportunity to tell others about upcoming events in
their constituencies and to raise issues of genuine concern to their
communities. This debate will end at 5pm. Political editor, Evening Standard, tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Oral questions House of LordsParliament It's question time in the Lords - the chance for peers to question government ministers. Lib Dem Lord Bruce of Bennachie is asking whether the government plans to enable the establishment of a nationwide video relay service (VRS) for users of British and Irish sign language. Minister Baroness Buscombe says that it is important to recognise that help is available ""in a number of ways"". Labour spokesperson Baroness Sherlock asks whether the roll-out of VRS is delayed, or whether it will happen at all. ""I can reassure her that there is no question of us not considering this service for UC [Universal Credit] roll-out,"" replies the minister.

Call for change to breast screening,"A different approach could help determine the severity of breast cancer cells, the study said Almost one-third of women are at a higher risk of developing breast cancer and should be screened more than once every three years, a study says. The study analysed 53,467 women between 2009 and 2013. Scientists found 14,593 women had an ""above average"" risk of developing breast cancer. They hope the study will help prevent cases of  breast cancer through women being more aware of their own risk and adopting certain lifestyle changes. An above average risk was defined in the study as a 3.5% chance of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years. Women aged between 50 and 70 are currently offered a mammogram once every three years, to help identify cancer early, so treatment has a better chance of working. Lead researcher Prof Gareth Evans, at the University of Manchester, said greater prevention would not only save more women the ""awful"" actuality of being diagnosed, but would also save the NHS an ""enormous amount of money"". Scientists assessed a patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer through questionnaires assessing risk factors, such as family history and lifestyle, and collected genetic information from saliva. They also measured breast tissue density, which is an indicator of a patient's susceptibility to breast cancer, using mammograms and a visual assessment. Prof Evans said in an ""ideal world"", women could fill in an online questionnaire documenting their risk factors and then have their breast tissue density analysed by a mammogram. He said those at a greater risk could have more regular screening, to detect cancer early and stop it spreading. Certain lifestyle changes could also be adopted, such as exercising, which he said decreases risk by 30%, not putting on weight, or losing weight, and reducing alcohol intake. Prof Evans added: ""This would put women's destiny into their own hands."" Sincean independent review into the effectiveness of breast cancer screeningwas published in 2012, there has been much debate around the concept of ""over-diagnosis"". Over-diagnosis happens when screening correctly identifies a tumour but one that would never have caused harm. It means women undergo treatment which could be unnecessary, such as surgery, hormone therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and may suffer often considerable side-effects. Prof Michael Marmot, from University College London, said the study could help with this issue. He said women at a high risk of developing breast cancer would be more likely to show signs of a serious form of the disease, so the treatment could be more relevant. But he said a trial was now needed to see assess the significance of missing one or two years of screening in a cancer's development. He said: ""Would more regular screening lead to a rapid decrease in risk or would it take some time?"" Prof Evans said he will now be approaching the NHS to try to secure funding for a new approach. A spokeswoman for the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes said if ""evidence changed"", in relation to a change of approach, they were ""sure that would be a step that would be looked at"". The organisation had now expanded to give women at high risk more frequent screening, using information about their family history, which they had passed on to their doctors, the spokeswoman said.

Charity's breast cancer check-up call,"Latest figures show that 42% of women affected by breast cancer in Wales are aged between 65 and 84 Not enough women over 70 are aware they can continue being checked for breast cancer, a health charity has said. In the UK, women aged 50 to 70 are invited for a mammogram every three years - but they then must request one. A survey has found more than half (51%) of women over 70 do not know they can continue having the scan after receiving their final invitation. Breast Cancer Care said there is ""confusion"" about the current system and greater awareness is needed. Addie Mitchell, a clinical nurse specialist at the charity, said: ""It is crucial women know while routine invitations to screening stop at 70, this doesn't mean you're no longer at risk - as the biggest risk factors for breast cancer are being female and getting older."" ""So women must be armed with the information they need to make an informed choice about requesting screening appointments after the age of 70 if they wish to do so."" Opera singer Margaret Williams has called on women over the age of 70 to make sure they continue with breast cancer check ups Opera singer Margaret Williams was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and called it a ""shock"". She said: ""When I reached the age of 70 I thought 'I'm fairly safe now'."" ""If I had had a mammogram after the age of 70, probably the non invasive cancer that has been there for quite a long time, that would have been recognised."" In England, some breast screening centres are taking part in an age extension trial. The Welsh Government said its national screening programme was based on ""the best possible evidence"" and was reviewed regularly. A spokeswoman added: ""The results from the trial in England won't be known for a few years. ""The UK National Screening Committee will consider these findings when they'll be available and will advise all the screening programmes in the UK in line with that.""

"Home Office review into Windrush failingsThe inquiry will have ""full access"" to relevant documents, including policy papers and case files.","The Home Office is to hold an internal review of its handling of the Windrush scandal, Theresa May has said. She told MPs it would have ""full access"" to all relevant documents, including policy papers and case files. Her announcement came as Labour prepares to try and force ministers to release all government papers relating to Windrush cases since 2010. Jeremy Corbyn said the crisis had been ""made in the Home Office"" under Theresa May's leadership. Live updates as MPs debate Windrush documents At Prime Minister's Questions, he asked Mrs May whether she ""felt a pang of guilt"" about the resignation of Amber Rudd over the issue earlier this week. The prime minister said the inquiry would seek to ""learn lessons"" from the treatment of Windrush families, some of whom have been detained and threatened with deportation after their right to remain in the UK was questioned. It will aim to complete its work before the summer recess in July. She said ""speed is of the essence"" and new home secretary Sajid Javid ""will be commissioning a full review of lessons learned, independent oversight and external challenge"". The review, she said, will have ""full access to all relevant information in the Home Office, including policy papers and casework decisions"". The Conservatives are expected to oppose a Labour motion which would see all relevant internal documents handed to the Commons Home Affairs Committee. The rarely-used procedure - called a ""motion for a return"" - involves asking the Queen to direct her ministers to provide the requested documents. Opening the debate in the Commons, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott asked Conservative MPs if they understood ""how voting against this motion will look to the Commonwealth and will look to the Windrush generation here"". She said she doubted Mr Javid's claim to be abandoning the ""hostile environment"" tag attached to the government's immigration policies, saying his predecessor Amber Rudd had been a ""human shield"" for its architect, Theresa May. She added: ""Unless and until the prime minister announces the abandonment of the form of hostile environment which she instituted and demonstrates that that be the case then we should all understand that the policy remains in place."" Mr Javid said the Labour motion would divert resources ""into a massive, open-ended fishing expedition"". He told MPs he would be regularly writing to the Home Affairs Select Committee with progress including a monthly report with the latest information on detentions and deportations. ""This review will seek to draw out how members of the Windrush generation came to be entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants, why that was not spotted sooner, and whether the right corrective measures are now in place,"" he said. Mr Javid also said ""members of the hard left"" had greeted his appointment with racist abuse, challenging Mr Corbyn to ""denounce them"". Ms Abbott said that ""everyone on this side of the House without exception condemns the names he has been called"".

House of Fraser plans to close storesDepartment store chain announces turnaround plan and a new Chinese owner.11m12 minutes agoBusiness,"House of Fraser plans to close stores as new owners look to turn around the department store chain. The retailer said China's C.banner, which also owns Hamleys, is taking a 51% stake, shifting control from another Chinese firm, Nanjing Cenbest. House of Fraser intends to launch a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), under which it is likely to close some stores and renegotiate rents on others. It did not say how many stores are earmarked for closure. House of Fraser has 59 stores in the UK and Ireland, more than 6,000 employees and 11,500 concession staff. Frank Slevin, the chairman, said: ""There is a need to create a leaner business that better serves the rapidly changing behaviours of a customer base. ""House of Fraser's future will depend on creating the right portfolio of stores that are the right size and in the right location."" Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Six shops defying High Street downturn Five reasons Toys R Us failed C.banner, which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, is expected to raise about Â£70m by issuing new shares. The deal is expected to complete by the end of June and Nanjing Cenbest will continue to hold a significant minority stake. House of Fraser's new owner also owns Hamleys Under Nanjing Cenbest's ownership, there were plans for a big expansion of House of Fraser in China, but only one store materialised, in Nanjing itself. The chain expects to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. House of Fraser will hope to avoid the fate of department store chain BHS, which collapsed in 2016. More recently, several other big High Street names have struggled in the face of online competition, a decline in consumer confidence and rising overheads. Toys R Us and Maplin went into administration on the same day in February, while New Look and Carpetright have both entered into CVAs.

'Shocking' numbers work while ill,"Employers are seeing more staff turning up to work while ill, according to a report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). It surveyed more than 1,000 organisations this year and found that 86% had observed staff attending work while ill, or ""presenteeism"". The rise compares with a survey in 2010 when just 26% of employers observed the behaviour. The CIPD also found high numbers of staff willing to work while on holiday. The scale of the problem is ""shocking"" according to Rachel Suff, Senior Employment Relations Adviser at the CIPD who said ""people feel under even more pressure to work"". She said employers need to do more to tackle the issue. ""Too few organisations are discouraging unhealthy workplace practices and tackling stress, which is strongly linked to health conditions such as anxiety and depression,"" Ms Suff said.

Last year, the TUC described UK workers as ""mucus troopers"" after the Office for National Statistics said that sickness absence totalled 137 million working days in 2016, the equivalent of 4.3 days per worker and the lowest on record. When records began in 1993, the equivalent of 7.2 days were lost. There is no official definition for worker sickness. Employees are able to self-certify sickness for up to seven days. For longer periods, and statutory sick pay claims, a doctors note is needed. Some workplaces have their own specific rules. Emma Lowe has ulcerative colitis and says that, in a previous jobs, it was tough to make managers aware of the issues. ""I'd been having at least one day off a month due to my UC and I was told that I should 'grin and bear' the pain,"" she says. ""Unfortunately [my manager] didn't understand that on those days I was off sick, I couldn't even walk, let alone climb the stairs at work and be sat in an air-conditioned cyclone. ""My UC put me in hospital in 2010 and I was out sick for nearly two months. My manager at the time did not understand what UC was and had to Google it. Then he had to explain that I was genuinely sick to higher up."" Official guidance, published earlier this year, suggested that employers should give staff places to rest at work to help boost productivity. Public Health England,externalsaid that downtime at work can help employees switch off and get better quality sleep at night. Experts suggest that millions of pounds are lost owing to absenteeism, and presenteeism - when employees are at work but not operating at optimum levels. Some firms already encourage employees to have downtime at work. London-based money transfer service firm TransferWisehas a hammock and sauna on its premises, for example. And accountancy company PwC, as part of a training programme on resilience,tries to help its staff improve the quality of their sleep.

Warning over carrot-crazed kangaroo attacks,"Think twice before hugging for a selfie People have been warned not to feed kangaroos at a tourist spot in Australia following a string of attacks by the animals. Each week thousands of people visit the grounds of a hospital in Morisset, New South Wales, to see the wild kangaroos. But some tourists have been kicked, scratched and left with serious cuts by the hungry marsupials, whose favourite snack is carrots. Local MP Greg Piper says urgent action is needed to educate tourists. ""While kangaroos are cute, they are also capable of inflicting injury,"" Mr Piper told the BBC.

Man mauled by bear survives shark attack Quokka selfies: Is Instagram's welfare warning 'overkill'? How to survive a shark attack Zoo attacks and the people who survive them Mr Piper believes around 3,000 people are coming each week to Morisset. ""It's a spot where you're guaranteed to see kangaroos, so it's understandable that people come,"" he says. ""And I don't want to blame the tourists - it's really a matter of educating them better."" The tourists themselves are not the problem, it's the fact many want to feed the animals - and that's a bad idea. WARNING: Graphic images of injuries below For one thing it's not good for the kangaroos. They are grazing animals, and being fed by thousands of tourists each week changes their natural behaviour. They come to expect and eventually demand food. That's when they can become a danger to humans. ""People don't understand they are wild animals and have to be treated as such,"" warns Mr Piper. One of the visitors who was attacked was Anita Bielaszka. And like many other tourists she says she was entirely unaware of the potential dangers. Allow Facebook content?

""We didn't know that we shouldn't feed them,"" she told the BBC. ""Everyone does so we thought it's ok to do it. ""One of the big kangaroos attacked me and everyone get scared. People took their kids and ran away."" Ms Bielaszka escaped with a nasty scar on her leg. But pictures supplied by Mr Piper of some of the injuries from recent months leave little doubt that a kangaroo can do a lot of damage. ""A male kangaroo can disembowel someone,"" says Mr Piper. ""They don't set out to do it, but that's the nature of how they fight: they kick with their big hind legs."" But people shouldn't be frightened away. Coming close to them is usually safe - even petting a kangaroo can be OK, provided it approaches first. But Mr Piper says it's wise to steer clear of the big male kangaroos. ""The males ones are tall and very powerfully built to the top. They basically look like they work out."" Most importantly, don't feed the kangaroos - and certainly don't feed them processed food. Even vegetables are not right for the animals, and in Morisset, it's carrots that most tourists seem to be bringing. What might be seem like a healthy snack for humans is not necessarily a good lunch for a kangaroo. Carrots are high in sugar and can cause deadly diseases in the animals. Mr Piper wants better education for tourists, including more signs in multiple languages, to provide for their safety and the health of the kangaroos.

Cabinet showdown over customs planThe government is under pressure to drop one of its preferred options to manage trade after Brexit.2h2 hours agoUK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May is facing a demand from Conservative Brexiteers to drop one of the government's preferred post-Brexit customs options. A 30-page document passed to the BBC says a ""customs partnership"" would make meaningful trade deals ""impossible"" to forge and render the UK's International Trade Department ""obsolete"". It came ahead of a key meeting of senior ministers about Brexit. The committee discussed rival options to replace customs union membership. Afterwards, a source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a narrow majority of those at the meeting had said the customs partnership was not viable, and it was suggested it would not be taken back to full cabinet for further discussion. But Downing Street sources said the meeting agreed that this option and the proposal for a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement were still ""serious propositions"", although they acknowledged there were ""challenges that need to be addressed"". Theresa May is understood to have asked for ""revised proposals"", our correspondent added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at the UK/EU border post-Brexit and whether businesses will be hit with tariffs or not. The complicating factor is that the UK wants to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other countries rather than have to stick with deals struck for the EU customs union. A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Government sources say the situation is constantly evolving. It is possible another option could emerge combining elements of the first two. But any solution would aim to avoid the need for physical border checks on the island of Ireland. Wednesday's cabinet sub-committee meeting may not reach a final decision on the proposals - and don't forget, this is all about the UK agreeing its stance before more Brexit talks. The EU does not appear to be keen on either option. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said there were ""a number of ways"" to deliver Britain's objectives on customs arrangements after Brexit. Reality Check: The government's customs options Please upgrade your browser The BBC's economic editor Kamal Ahmed says he understandsChancellor Philip Hammond (pictured above) favours a customs partnership. Mr Hammond and other Remain-voting cabinet ministers, such as business secretary Greg Clark, are hoping to persuade the prime minister to keep it on the table when the 11-strong Brexit sub-committee meets later. Remain-voting Tory backbenches also want it to remain an option. One of them, Vicky Ford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it did not mean remaining in the EU ""by the back door"" as critics claim and could protect British business. Brexiteer cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson, Liam Fox (pictured above) and David Davis - and a group of Conservative backbenchers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose Tory Research Group produced the dossier sent to Mrs May. The Cabinet all signed up to the two customs optionswhen they were announced last year,externalbut some are now thought to be worried that the customs partnership idea would mean a slide towards remaining in the customs union. Backbench Tory Brexiteers fear the scheme would be expensive and complex to operate, and could mean the UK is indefinitely trapped within the EU's customs arrangements - and unable to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other nations around the world. Mr Rees-Mogg said it would not only be ""unworkable"", it would the same as staying in the EU and was the ""single market by another name"". Housing minister Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 5 Live's Anna Foster the ""streamlined"" customs option was ""winning the argument"" in government as it was ""the one that's been tried and tested the most"". According to the Press Association, Downing Street has been privately warned that a customs partnership could collapse the government, as committed Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches regard it as unacceptable. A senior Conservative told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg ""the customs partnership is the breaking point"", suggesting that if No 10 doesn't do the Brexiteers' bidding, they could withhold their support. On Tuesday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Read Laura Kuenssberg's blog The MPs' dossier cautions against continued deliberations in government, saying that ""further delay is itself a decision"". It is the strongest warning yet from Tory Brexiteers to the PM, who have largely been supportive, in public, of her efforts to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU. Mr Rees-Mogg (pictured above) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""we are not in the business of making threats"". If it came to a confidence vote in the prime minister over the issue, the Tory MP said it was ""inconceivable"" that he would vote against her. Downing Street sources denied the document was an ultimatum, calling it part of the policy-making process. David Davis is preparing for the next round of talks with EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday that Brussels was ""pushing back"" against both proposals. The EU thinks the customs partnership proposal is very ambitious - to put it mildly - and has given the UK a list of questions about it, writes the BBC's Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming. What new burdens will be placed on customs officials in the EU27? How will the UK apply EU customs law if it's no longer in the club? How will the ""track and trace"" system work? The warning from Brussels about the UK government's other option, a ""highly streamlined"" customs deal, is that it doesn't fully solve the problem of avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which they say is about more than just tariffs. Hanging over it all is the issue of trust because the EU and UK are still arguing over 2bn euros (Â£1.76bn) of allegedly unpaid duties on Chinese shoes and textiles imported into Britain, and legal action looms. The EU's negotiators wonder whether the other side is about to change tack on a major issue, and they suggest that the upcoming political deal about the shape of the future relationship may have to be very vague if it's to find approval from a divided British government, parliament and public. Labour wants the UK to form a customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the prime minister is ""being held hostage by the extreme Brexiteers in her own party"". The party's shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said: ""Labour has been clear that the best way to protect jobs, the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland is by negotiating a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union after Brexit. ""However, the Tories appear more interested in issuing ultimatums and squabbling amongst themselves than acting in the national interest."" The Lib Dems, who back staying in the customs union and want a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said Mrs May was ""kicking the can down the road in a desperate attempt to hold the widening fissures of the Tory party together - it cannot and will not work"". SNP MP Tommy Sheppard accused the Scottish Conservative MPs who were among the group of Brexiteers warning Mrs May about a customs partnership of being ""British nationalists, who long for the return of days of Empire and for the time when the map of the world was mostly pink"".

"Breast screening error 'affects 450,000 women'","This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter Up to 270 women in England may have died because they did not receive invitations to a final routine breast cancer screening, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says. Speaking in the Commons, he said 450,000 women aged 68-71 had failed to get invitations since 2009. Mr Hunt has announced an independent review and apologised ""wholeheartedly"" to the women and their families. He said oversight of the NHS screening programme had ""not been good enough"". Mr Hunt told the Commons that computer modelling suggested between 135 and 270 women may have had their lives shortened. GPs' leaders said they were ""shocked"" to learn of the error and said the implications for GPs would potentially be ""significant"". Of the 450,000 women affected, 309,000 are still alive and in their 70s. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Mr Hunt said: ""For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence."" He said a computer algorithm failure was to blame, which meant, in some cases, women approaching their 71st birthday were not sent an invitation for a final breast scan as they should have been. Variation in the way that local services sent out invitations may also have been a factor, he said. Breast cancer screening is currently offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in England. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening - scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment. Any woman who wants a mammogram will get one within six months, Mr Hunt said. Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May The health secretary said it was a priority to make sure additional scans did not cause any delays in the screening programme for other women. Public Health England discovered the problem after analysing data and has apologised to the women affected. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at PHE, said: ""They and their families' wellbeing is our top priority and we are very sorry for these faults in the system."" Mr Hunt told MPs in the Commons: ""Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says ""there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened"" He apologised ""wholeheartedly and unreservedly"" for the suffering caused. And he added: ""We also need to get to the bottom of precisely how many people were affected, why it happened and most importantly how we can prevent it from ever happening again."" Women in Scotland are not affected by the error because it has a different IT system. Wales and Northern Ireland have similar systems to England but Mr Hunt said there was no reason to believe they were affected. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the independent review and urged women affected not to panic. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the RCGP, said: ""The priority should not be to establish blame, but to put measures in place to invite those women affected for screening, where appropriate; to ensure there are enough resources in the system to cope with any additional demand that might follow as a result; and to take steps to ensure this never happens again."" Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK's director of policy and public affairs, said the breast screening error was ""very concerning"". She added: ""It's worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast see your GP straight away."" All women in this age group registered with a GP are invited for screening every three years - around 2.5 million people. This is because the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age. After 70, women can still have screening if they choose to by contacting their GP.

Grenade into customs debate,"As if it wasn't tense enough,30 pages of arguments against part of the government's policy have emerged, an ultimatum from senior Brexiteers who see this week's deliberations over customs arrangements as a ""breaking point"". It will hardly have been welcome in No 10's inboxes on Sunday afternoon, days before the Cabinet Brexit Committee was due to meet and also, worth noting, just days before the local elections, where the Tories are already expecting to do badly. The document, which I understand has been seen by Brexiteer Cabinet ministers, lobs a grenade into a meeting where it was already expected that some would urge Theresa May to drop one part of her plan. As I wrote last weekthere is deep scepticism even among some Remainers in Westminster about how viable the customs partnership is. Another source memorably remarked that the prime minister is more or less the ""last person left in Whitehall"" who believes it might work. UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? While No 10 knows very well that proposal has never been popular with Tory Brexiteers, on whose support the majority-less prime minister depends. Their calculations have always had to take in the likelihood of if and when the dozens of backbench Eurosceptics would rebel. But the leak of this document suggests the seriousness with which the powerful, if minority group, takes this issue. A senior Tory said ""the customs partnership is the breaking point"", suggesting that if No 10 doesn't do their bidding, they could withhold their support. Of course the stakes are high on all sides, tempers are hot, and it is not certain that they would deliver on those kinds of threats. ButTheresa May warned in her Mansion House Speechthat the UK won't get everything it wants in the EU negotiations. The time when she has to say that forcefully in negotiations with her own party may be coming fast. The question is whether that's feasible, one former minister said that Theresa May ""already isn't leading the party"". Another told me it's like ""the politicians have all gone missing"".

Hammond backs 'customs partnership',"Philip Hammond visits the Openreach training centre in Bradford Wednesday sees the next stage in the difficult process of the government agreeing its approach to trade with the European Union. Theresa May will host a meeting of her Brexit cabinet - the inner sanctum that attempts to thrash out the knottiest issues left on the table. One is the future customs relationship between the UK and EU. That will be a vital part of any future trade deal as the UK exports 50% of its goods to the EU. The government has said it wants to leave the EU single market and the customs union and at the same time retain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The big and highly complicated question is how? I am told that the chancellor will use the meeting tomorrow to argue in favour of a close ""customs partnership"" with the EU, or at least not rule it out at this early stage. Senior sources have told me that Philip Hammond sees advantages in the proposal that would mean the UK could set its own tariffs but would also be obliged to mirror European Union customs rules. He is likely to receive support from the business secretary, Greg Clark. The arrangement would mean the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for any other union member state. Businesses would claim back any tariff rebates from the government if the goods stayed in the UK. Although technically difficult - some say impossible - officials believe such a partnership could ""solve"" the Irish border question as there would be no hard customs border between the UK and the EU. It still leaves open the problem of what happens if there are substantive regulatory differences between the UK and the EU beyond tariff arrangements. Whitehall sources I have spoken to say a customs partnership would help the many British businesses that only export to the EU. It would also leave the UK free to sign trade deals with other countries, a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy. Sources said a fourth advantage is that it would be for the UK to sort out the very difficult technical and infrastructure issues alone as they would all fall on the British side of the border. Mr Hammond's position is likely to cause controversy within the Conservative Party. Brexit-backing MPs believe the partnership model may be used as a back door route to rejoining the customs union. ""Some of the people proposing it know such an immensely complicated - and untried - arrangement is guaranteed to end in chaotic failure,"" said David Jones, the former Brexit minister, last month. ""At which point they will conclude we have no choice but to rejoin the fully fledged customs union."" The second option put forward by the government - and to be discussed at Wednesday's Cabinet meeting - is called ""maximum facilitation"" or a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"". Under the ""maxfac"" model - supported by many pro-Brexit MPs - any customs checks needed at borders between the EU and the UK once Britain has left the EU would be as friction free as possible. Technology and trusted trader status licences would be used to smooth the flow of goods and services, its proponents argue. Its backers also say it would be a more definitive break with the EU and is more technically feasible as it would in part be operationally based on arrangements Britain already has with non-EU nations. Critics say it would not solve the Irish border question as there would still need to be tariff checks. Read more from Kamal Ahmed here The whole debate on Wednesday will ultimately be a rather surreal affair. Senior figures I have spoken to admit that both models are untried, possibly unworkable and it could take years to build either system. The EU is yet to be convinced that they are viable alternatives to its own ""backstop"" solution to the Irish border question - placing a customs border in the Irish Sea and approaching the whole island of Ireland as a single trading entity. Theresa May has said that the government would never agree to such a plan. What is clear is that there is still a very significant amount of work to be done if any customs policy is to be agreed by both the government and the EU, which wants there to be ""substantial progress"" by June. Without agreement, the conclusion of Britain's overall withdrawal deal - due to be signed in October or December - would be in jeopardy.

Cabinet showdown over customs planThe government is under pressure to drop one of its preferred options to manage trade after Brexit.,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May is facing a demand from Conservative Brexiteers to drop one of the government's preferred post-Brexit customs options. A 30-page document passed to the BBC says a ""customs partnership"" would make meaningful trade deals ""impossible"" to forge and render the UK's International Trade Department ""obsolete"". It came ahead of a key meeting of senior ministers about Brexit. The committee discussed rival options to replace customs union membership. Afterwards, a source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a narrow majority of those at the meeting had said the customs partnership was not viable, and it was suggested it would not be taken back to full cabinet for further discussion. But Downing Street sources said the meeting agreed that this option and the proposal for a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement were still ""serious propositions"", although they acknowledged there were ""challenges that need to be addressed"". Theresa May is understood to have asked for ""revised proposals"", our correspondent added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at the UK/EU border post-Brexit and whether businesses will be hit with tariffs or not. The complicating factor is that the UK wants to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other countries rather than have to stick with deals struck for the EU customs union. A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Government sources say the situation is constantly evolving. It is possible another option could emerge combining elements of the first two. But any solution would aim to avoid the need for physical border checks on the island of Ireland. Wednesday's cabinet sub-committee meeting may not reach a final decision on the proposals - and don't forget, this is all about the UK agreeing its stance before more Brexit talks. The EU does not appear to be keen on either option. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said there were ""a number of ways"" to deliver Britain's objectives on customs arrangements after Brexit. Reality Check: The government's customs options Please upgrade your browser The BBC's economic editor Kamal Ahmed says he understandsChancellor Philip Hammond (pictured above) favours a customs partnership. Mr Hammond and other Remain-voting cabinet ministers, such as business secretary Greg Clark, are hoping to persuade the prime minister to keep it on the table when the 11-strong Brexit sub-committee meets later. Remain-voting Tory backbenches also want it to remain an option. One of them, Vicky Ford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it did not mean remaining in the EU ""by the back door"" as critics claim and could protect British business. Brexiteer cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson, Liam Fox (pictured above) and David Davis - and a group of Conservative backbenchers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose Tory Research Group produced the dossier sent to Mrs May. The Cabinet all signed up to the two customs optionswhen they were announced last year,externalbut some are now thought to be worried that the customs partnership idea would mean a slide towards remaining in the customs union. Backbench Tory Brexiteers fear the scheme would be expensive and complex to operate, and could mean the UK is indefinitely trapped within the EU's customs arrangements - and unable to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other nations around the world. Mr Rees-Mogg said it would not only be ""unworkable"", it would the same as staying in the EU and was the ""single market by another name"". Housing minister Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 5 Live's Anna Foster the ""streamlined"" customs option was ""winning the argument"" in government as it was ""the one that's been tried and tested the most"". According to the Press Association, Downing Street has been privately warned that a customs partnership could collapse the government, as committed Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches regard it as unacceptable. A senior Conservative told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg ""the customs partnership is the breaking point"", suggesting that if No 10 doesn't do the Brexiteers' bidding, they could withhold their support. On Tuesday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Read Laura Kuenssberg's blog The MPs' dossier cautions against continued deliberations in government, saying that ""further delay is itself a decision"". It is the strongest warning yet from Tory Brexiteers to the PM, who have largely been supportive, in public, of her efforts to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU. Mr Rees-Mogg (pictured above) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""we are not in the business of making threats"". If it came to a confidence vote in the prime minister over the issue, the Tory MP said it was ""inconceivable"" that he would vote against her. Downing Street sources denied the document was an ultimatum, calling it part of the policy-making process. David Davis is preparing for the next round of talks with EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday that Brussels was ""pushing back"" against both proposals. The EU thinks the customs partnership proposal is very ambitious - to put it mildly - and has given the UK a list of questions about it, writes the BBC's Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming. What new burdens will be placed on customs officials in the EU27? How will the UK apply EU customs law if it's no longer in the club? How will the ""track and trace"" system work? The warning from Brussels about the UK government's other option, a ""highly streamlined"" customs deal, is that it doesn't fully solve the problem of avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which they say is about more than just tariffs. Hanging over it all is the issue of trust because the EU and UK are still arguing over 2bn euros (Â£1.76bn) of allegedly unpaid duties on Chinese shoes and textiles imported into Britain, and legal action looms. The EU's negotiators wonder whether the other side is about to change tack on a major issue, and they suggest that the upcoming political deal about the shape of the future relationship may have to be very vague if it's to find approval from a divided British government, parliament and public. Labour wants the UK to form a customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the prime minister is ""being held hostage by the extreme Brexiteers in her own party"". The party's shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said: ""Labour has been clear that the best way to protect jobs, the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland is by negotiating a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union after Brexit. ""However, the Tories appear more interested in issuing ultimatums and squabbling amongst themselves than acting in the national interest."" The Lib Dems, who back staying in the customs union and want a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said Mrs May was ""kicking the can down the road in a desperate attempt to hold the widening fissures of the Tory party together - it cannot and will not work"". SNP MP Tommy Sheppard accused the Scottish Conservative MPs who were among the group of Brexiteers warning Mrs May about a customs partnership of being ""British nationalists, who long for the return of days of Empire and for the time when the map of the world was mostly pink"".

"Breast screening error 'affects 450,000 women'Women in England did not receive a letter to their final routine breast examination before their 70th birthday.10m10 minutes agoHealth","This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter Up to 270 women in England may have died because they did not receive invitations to a final routine breast cancer screening, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says. Speaking in the Commons, he said 450,000 women aged 68-71 had failed to get invitations since 2009. Mr Hunt has announced an independent review and apologised ""wholeheartedly"" to the women and their families. He said oversight of the NHS screening programme had ""not been good enough"". Mr Hunt told the Commons that computer modelling suggested between 135 and 270 women may have had their lives shortened. GPs' leaders said they were ""shocked"" to learn of the error and said the implications for GPs would potentially be ""significant"". Of the 450,000 women affected, 309,000 are still alive and in their 70s. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Mr Hunt said: ""For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence."" He said a computer algorithm failure was to blame, which meant, in some cases, women approaching their 71st birthday were not sent an invitation for a final breast scan as they should have been. Variation in the way that local services sent out invitations may also have been a factor, he said. Breast cancer screening is currently offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in England. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening - scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment. Any woman who wants a mammogram will get one within six months, Mr Hunt said. Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May The health secretary said it was a priority to make sure additional scans did not cause any delays in the screening programme for other women. Public Health England discovered the problem after analysing data and has apologised to the women affected. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at PHE, said: ""They and their families' wellbeing is our top priority and we are very sorry for these faults in the system."" Mr Hunt told MPs in the Commons: ""Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says ""there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened"" He apologised ""wholeheartedly and unreservedly"" for the suffering caused. And he added: ""We also need to get to the bottom of precisely how many people were affected, why it happened and most importantly how we can prevent it from ever happening again."" Women in Scotland are not affected by the error because it has a different IT system. Wales and Northern Ireland have similar systems to England but Mr Hunt said there was no reason to believe they were affected. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the independent review and urged women affected not to panic. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the RCGP, said: ""The priority should not be to establish blame, but to put measures in place to invite those women affected for screening, where appropriate; to ensure there are enough resources in the system to cope with any additional demand that might follow as a result; and to take steps to ensure this never happens again."" Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK's director of policy and public affairs, said the breast screening error was ""very concerning"". She added: ""It's worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast see your GP straight away."" All women in this age group registered with a GP are invited for screening every three years - around 2.5 million people. This is because the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age. After 70, women can still have screening if they choose to by contacting their GP.

People with loose skin âforgottenâ by NHS,"This video can not be played Amy lost 19 stone but hates her saggy skin A senior plastic surgeon has told Newsbeat people who were obese and now have saggy skin are often ""forgotten"". Mark Soldin thinks a lot of people should be able to get the treatment on the NHS - and he's been ""fighting hard for patients to get better access"". The surgery can cost thousands of pounds. The NHS says funding is not generally available for cosmetic surgery unless there is a medical need and it impacts quality of life. In 2016/17, 752 abdominoplasty's (tummy tucks) were carried out on the NHS. BMI and obesity: Where are you on the UK fat scale? Steph used to weigh more than 20 stone (127kg) Steph O'Shea used to weigh more than 20 stone (127kg). She started losing weight in January 2017. She's lost six stone (38.1kg) but has been left with excess skin. ""It's not just one area. It's my arms, tummy, thighs and breasts,"" she says. Weight loss has left Steph with saggy skin Steph, 26, says her saggy skin is impacting on her daily life. ""It's affecting my relationship with my partner. Intimacy - that's pretty non-existent."" As part of her healthier lifestyle she exercises three times a week at the gym and says her skin can get in the way. ""My tummy - because it sags so much - it sits in between my legs, so it can get trapped in machines. ""You have to make sure you're having a shower, drying and moisturising properly and there is nothing left in the folds because you could get infections."" Steph, a mum-of-two, goes to the gym as part of her new lifestyle Steph, who's from Staffordshire, says she approached her GP about having surgery to remove her excess skin on the NHS. ""I was told I don't fit the criteria, they're here to save lives and not get me beach-ready for the summer and I should go private."" But Steph feels that's harsh. ""Hopefully by losing all this weight I have reduced my risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer - and in the long run I am saving the NHS money. ""I am not saying they should dish out cosmetic surgery for everyone, I think each case should be looked at individually."" Steph has lost six stone since January 2017 Plastic surgeon Mark Soldin works privately and for the health service. ""Patients can get this on the NHS. I have been fighting hard for patients to get better access for about 10 years now."" He says a group of surgeons developed guidelines for all GP practices to follow. ""They state if you've lost more than 50% of your excess body weight you'd be eligible. ""You'd need aBMI,external(body mass index) of less than 30 and you need to show [the excess skin] affects you functionally. ""It's not enough to say: 'I am unhappy with this'."" Mark Soldin is a consultant plastic surgeon Mark Soldin says people who are obese are often overlooked. ""They don't have a loud voice compared to patients with breast cancer for example, they have an extremely powerful lobby, they get what they want. Deservedly so, it's a cancer. ""But people that were obese, they don't have a loud voice and they are largely forgotten."" NHS bosses told Newsbeat that funding is ""not generally available"" for surgery to ""exclusively improve appearance"". But some hospitals will pay for procedures such as ""body contouring"", the co-chair of NHS Clinical Commissioners and Chief Clinical Officer told us. Dr Amanda Doyle said this may be funded ""where there is a clear medical need and the quality of life for a patient may be hampered."" Abby lost seven stone and had surgery to remove her excess skin in February Abby, 28, from Peterborough, paid privately for surgery to get her excess skin removed in February. It cost Â£7,800. She paid for it by taking out a loan and will be paying it back for the next five years. She thinks people should try to pay for their own surgery rather than using the NHS. ""I kind of feel there's people out there that need the NHS more than people that can save up and then get it done."" But Steph says one of the quotes she has had for the surgery is Â£24,000. She says that's unaffordable and she's set up a crowdfunding page. ""It's not do-able for average working class people. Who really has that kind of money spare?""

'Having sex five times a day wasn't enough',"This video can not be played Rebecca Barker said sex addiction took over her life and ruined her relationship Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives. ""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasn't enough."" Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship. Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex. ""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldn't get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire. ""I felt like everything reminded me of it.  I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it. ""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again. ""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people."" Ms Barker split with her partner and made lifestyle changes in a bid to control her addiction Ms Barker's addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple. ""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldn't understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from. ""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and that's why I wanted sex with him."" In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother. ""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that. ""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything."" Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France. ""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said. Relate defines sexual addiction as anysexual activity that feels ""out of control"",external. The Association for the Treatment of Sex Addiction and Compulsivity says its number of sex therapists has doubled in the past five years to 170 A questionnaire completed by 21,058 people since 2013 on the Sex Addiction Help website revealed 91% of those seeking help for sex addiction were male The largest age group of 31% was aged 26-35, 1% were under 16 and 8% over 55 The World Health Organization is expected to approve the inclusion of ""compulsive sexual behaviour disorder"" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list in May 2019 The NHS says experts disagree about whether it is possible to become addicted to sex,externaland points to Relate for further help Graham, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said his compulsion led him to cheat on his wife with ""hundreds"" of sex workers, leaving him with ""rip-roaring guilt"". ""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep. ""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy. ""It is damaging and life-destroying."" Graham said when his wife found out he was relieved Graham, who is in his 60s, estimates he paid hundreds of pounds a month for sex over several years, even building relationships with some of the sex workers he saw. ""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day. ""You have one affair and then you want another and another one. ""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week. ""It is just like being an alcoholic, it's a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned. ""Then when it's over you feel remorseful, you say you're never going to do it again."" 'I learned my husband was dead on a police computer' Every penny earned so far goes on rent Disguised women sneak into Iranian football match Graham stopped leading his ""horrendous double life"" when his wife found an email and confronted him. He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years. ""When I was found out, I remember feeling 'thank God - something might change'. ""I went to SAA which is an abstinence-based treatment. I call it going from shame to grace. ""It is such a relief to go to the meetings and find out there are other people who are just as miserable and sordid as you are. ""For people who are in this situation, I just want them to know that there is a way out and you can break the cycle."" Peter Saddington, from Relate, said there is some therapy and group work available for sex addicts, but most of it is private. ""[Addicts] realise it is causing harm, but they can't stop and they recognise they need help in changing it. ""For alcoholics, there is Alcoholics Anonymous, but they can also go to the NHS [which] provides support for people who have alcohol or drug problems. ""It would be appropriate that [sex addicts] can go to their GP and get support because it has a crippling effect both on them, on relationships, on their families, their financial situation and their mental health."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""People who think they may have a sex addiction can seek advice and help via NHS Choices, which includes contacts at Relate, Sexaholics Anonymous, SAA and ATSAC.""

Subpoena threat to Trump over Russia,"Mr Mueller (right) threatened to force Mr Trump to answer investigators' questions Special Counsel Robert Mueller warned he could order Donald Trump to testify as part of a probe into alleged Russian election meddling, US media report. It is believed to be the first time the special counsel has raised the possibility of issuing a subpoena. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied collusion, and Russia has also denied the allegations. Meanwhile, the lawyer who has been Mr Trump's main legal representative in the probe is to step down. The White House said on Wednesday that Ty Cobb had been considering retirement for some time and had decided to go at the end of this month. A guide to US legalese Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Key questions in the affair answered Mr Mueller suggested the threat of a subpoena, a court order forcing a witness to appear to give testimony, during talks with Mr Trump's lawyers in March. It came after Mr Trump's lawyers insisted during the meeting that the president was under no obligation to face questions by federal investigators in relation to the Russia inquiry, the Washington Post reported. However, Mr Mueller's team reportedly responded by suggesting they would issue a subpoena if Mr Trump declined. They agreed to provide the president's lawyers with more specific information about the questions they wished to ask Mr Trump. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The president's former lawyer, John Dowd, has also said that Mr Mueller mentioned the possibility of forcing Mr Trump to face questions. Mr Dowd, who resigned about a week and a half after the meeting, said he told investigators that the probe was not ""some game"", adding: ""You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States."" The list of possible questions has since been published in the New York Times, and it reportedly covers the president's motivations in dismissing former FBI director James Comey last May and his campaign's contacts with Russia. Mr Trump repeated his claim that the Russia inquiry is a ""witch hunt"" on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington If negotiations between Donald Trump's legal team and the special counsel's office have been a delicate dance, Robert Mueller just stomped on his counterpart's toes. A subpoena to force the president before a grand jury could start an explosive legal battle that eventually reaches the US Supreme Court. Mr Trump and his lawyers may argue that a president can't be compelled to answer such wide-ranging questions. The president has reportedly cooled on the idea of willingly meeting the special counsel - a result of his feeling that the Mueller team is out to get him. There have been hints that his legal advisers are torn on the matter. John Dowd, who resigned in March as the president's top personal lawyer, was said to be against an interview. Others, including recent arrival Rudy Giuliani, appear more open to co-operation. This may explain this week's spate of revelations. Possible Mueller questions, as compiled by the president's lawyers, were splashed across front page yesterday. The subpoena threat is today's news. Mr Mueller's team remains tight-lipped, but the evolving strategies of the president's side are playing out nearly in full view - and they may be inclined to turn this dance into a rumble. The US president himself has said he is willing to speak to Mr Mueller, but CNN reports that his enthusiasm has cooled after the offices of his personal attorney were raided. The network cites sources close to Mr Trump as saying they are yet to make a recommendation about whether he agrees to an interview with Mr Mueller. Some advisers reportedly believe Mr Mueller would not go so far as to issue a subpoena. If one was issued, Mr Trump's lawyers could fight it in court, or he could refuse to answer questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment, a constitutional protection against potential self-incrimination. Prominent US lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who has expressed support for Mr Trump in his legal battles, advised against the US president speaking to the special counsel. ""The strategy is to throw him softballs so that he will go on and on with his answers,"" he told the Washington Post. ""Instead of sharp questions designed to elicit yes or no, they make him feel very comfortable and let him ramble."" The special counsel is looking into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election, whether there was any collusion between the Kremlin and Mr Trump's election campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry. Mr Mueller was appointed special counsel following Mr Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey last May. He was chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself due to undisclosed communications with the Russian ambassador. Mr Rosenstein, who is the only Justice Department official with the authority to fire Mr Mueller, has been reportedly targeted for impeachment by House Republicans. Speaking on Tuesday, he addressed the ""people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time"". This video can not be played US Deputy Attorney General rails against 'threats' ""I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,"" he said. What does the special counsel do? The president has long insisted there was no collusion between his election campaign and the Russians. US media reported that sources familiar with the case said Mr Mueller informed Mr Trump's attorneys in March that he is a subject of the investigations, but not a criminal target. It remains unclear when Mr Mueller will request a meeting with the president.

Apple faces battery pledge complaints,"The dent on Joshâs iPhone which prevented Apple replacing the battery Apple has been accused of finding unnecessary faults with iPhones and thereby profiting from a battery replacement initiative. When the US firm announced it had been slowing down iPhones in order to ""preserve battery life"" in December last year, it apologised for not telling people sooner. Facing a consumer backlash, it promised owners of the iPhone 6 and more modern models a discounted or free battery replacement. It said: ""We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support - and we will never forget that or take it for granted."" But since then, some Watchdog viewers have told the programme that their faith in the company has been seriously shaken after trying to take Apple up on its offer. Apple demanded that some customers pay 10 times the sum it referred to in its apology. The company told customers this was because of existing damage to their phones that would impair the replacement of the batteries. But Watchdog's investigation found that this is not always the case. Josh Landsburgh sent his phone off to have the battery replaced in February. Two days later, he received an email from Apple pointing out a small dent to the edge of the phone, and quoting a cost of over Â£200 before it would make good on its battery promise. A furious Josh had the phone returned from Apple. He had the battery replaced without an issue at a local repair shop - which meant he voided his Apple warranty. ""They're trying to regain trust and they come back to you with, 'Give us more money than you were planning to initially.' I think it's just shocking, they've got enough money, they're Apple,"" he told the BBC. David Bowler also contacted Watchdog. Watchdogâs Nikki Fox meets David Bowler, whose phone Apple also claimed had âextra damageâ His phone was in perfect condition, but needed the battery replacing. This time, with no apparent damage outside, Apple told David there was damage inside the phone. The firm said the front microphone and speaker were faulty, quoting over Â£250 to resolve the issue. But David is adamant these components were working perfectly. He asked for his phone back, and Watchdog took his device to a mobile repair specialist. It told the programme: ""Obviously these things are working; they shouldn't say that they are faulty."" The specialist also replaced the battery with no issues, something Apple had refused to do without fixing the microphone and speaker first. So, is Apple profiting from saying sorry? Watchdog took Davidâs phone to a specialist to have the battery replaced Apple'srepair website does state that,external""if your iPhone has any damage that impairs the replacement of the battery, such as a cracked screen, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement"". It also offers a fresh 90-day warranty on any device it has serviced, even if the original guarantee had long expired. Furthermore, some Apple customer service representatives - contacted via webchat - said the firm made clear in its warranty that ""any and all damage"" must be repaired first before battery replacement. But neither Watchdog nor dispute resolution lawyer Matthew Purcell, of Sanders Law, could find any mention of this requirement. Mr Purcell told the programme: ""I think consumers are getting annoyed because at a time when Apple should be rebuilding trust, it seems like they're putting barriers in the way of people getting their phones repaired."" Apple sent the BBC the following response: ""When it comes to iPhone battery replacement, if your iPhone has any damage that impairs the replacement of the battery, such as a cracked screen, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair."" It has referred customers to its website for more information.

RAF 'may have killed civilians' in IraqDoubt is cast on the MoD's claim it has seen no evidence that strikes against IS caused civilian casualties.12h12 hours agoUK,"Mosul was retaken in December, three years after being seized by IS A source inside the coalition fighting the Islamic State group has told the BBC he believes civilians have been killed as a result of RAF air strikes. The claim casts into doubt the Ministry of Defence's statement it has seen ""no evidence"" that its strikes in Iraq have caused civilian casualties. Other coalition members have alerted the UK to times when civilians may have been harmed, a BBC investigation found. The MoD says ""everything possible"" is done to minimise the risk to civilians. But it has also been discovered that some RAF bombs have malfunctioned and strayed off target. Estimates for the number of civilians killed in the nine-month battle for Mosul - the last stronghold of the Islamic State group in Iraq - range from more than 1,000 to 10 times that number. The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and charts How many bombs has the UK dropped in 2017? Can civilian deaths be avoided in RAF strikes on IS? Many were trapped, held hostage by IS who used civilians as human shields. Some were also the unintended victims of the US-led coalition's bombing campaign, which saw 29,000 munitions dropped or fired in and around the city. The UK was second to the US in the number of airstrikes it conducted for thecoalition,external, a grouping of 75 countries formed in 2014 to defeat IS. Only about a dozen members of the coalition conducted airstrikes in and around Mosul, with British warplanes hitting more than 750 targets. An RAF Tornado was involved in the January 2017 strike The source, who has not been named to protect his identity, says it was ""impossible"" to conduct a bombing campaign in highly-populated areas, like Mosul, without killing civilians. He said he had seen evidence that British airstrikes had caused civilian casualties ""on several occasions"". ""To suggest they have not - as has been done - is nonsense,"" he added. The source described a strike on 9 January last year when an RAF Tornado fired a Brimstone missile on what was described as a ""lorry bomb"" in eastern Mosul. It caused a large secondary explosion and the source said he believes two civilians were ""almost certainly"" killed. The MoD insisted their ""very careful analysis"" had concluded that those killed were ""highly probably"" IS fighters. It refused a request to view the strike footage it filmed from the air and will not release the co-ordinates of other RAF airstrikes. But it did eventually confirm the location of this one strike. Many potential eyewitness to the strike were in hiding at the time but some say IS fighters were in the area. And there were reports of civilians being injured too. One man said the ""women and men were screaming in the aftermath. Some of them were wounded."" The incident highlights the limitations of making assessments only from the air. Both the MoD and the source describe the target as a ""lorry bomb"" but those on the ground insist it was smaller  - the size of an SUV. Another source in the coalition said it is possible for two different people looking at the same aerial imagery to reach different conclusions. Aerial surveillance cannot see through walls and rubble. During the BBC's investigation other factors emerged that might cast some doubt on whether British airstrikes have caused civilian deaths including: Reports of a number of RAF weapons malfunctions Instances of some bombs failing to detonate Occasions when bombs have strayed and exploded hundreds of metres off target - hitting buildings that were not even even under surveillance The MoD insists a ""very low percentage"" of weapons have malfunctioned but it has refused to give numbers. But other coalition members have highlighted, or ""flagged"", several incidents when UK airstrikes may have caused civilian harm. On each occasion the MoD says it saw no evidence it caused civilian casualties. Over the past three and a half years the RAF has dropped more than 3,700 bombs and missiles in the campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria. Cockpit footage of an RAF air strike on an IS artillery position in Mosul in 2017 It has still not claimed responsibility for a single civilian death. The MoD says it has done ""everything possible"" to minimise the risk to civilians. It highlights the professionalism of the RAF crews involved, their ""rigorous targeting"" procedures and  use of ""precision weapons"".  But it has never had anyone on the ground to investigate allegations of civilian harm. The MoD has been careful in its choice of words. It has also admitted it cannot completely eliminate the risk to civilians. In saying it has seen ""no evidence"" of causing civilian casualties it is not ruling out the possibility that it might have happened. Yet there is also the danger the public might have also been left with the impression that hundreds of British airstrikes in a heavily-populated city, like Mosul, caused zero civilian deaths. Back in the tightly packed streets of Mosul's old city, which suffered the heaviest bombardment, there seems to be no doubt that airstrikes by the US-led coalition did kill civilians. Abdel Rahman Ali lost five of his children in a coalition strike Abdel Rahman Ali lost five of his children, when a bomb hit his home, and says 47 civilians were killed as a result of the air strikes in his street alone. ""Nobody destroyed us except the coalition,"" he said. Airwars,external, a group which has been monitoring civilian casualties,  says it is likely that between 1,066 and 1,579 civilians died in the fighting in Mosul. Of the half a dozen coalition members who carried out airstrikes in the city, so far only the US and Australia have accepted responsibility for causing civilian casualties. At present the coalition has admitted to causing just over 350 civilian deaths in Mosul. US Central Command is still working its way through a list of other allegations. This video can not be played Why a group of volunteers is digging out bodies in Mosul's Old City Chris Woods of Airwars says: ""It's simply fanciful to claim no civilians have been harmed by the RAF. ""We don't live in a world of magic bombs and missiles that only kill bad people."" The reality is that while the UK and coalition airstrikes helped rid the city of the scourge of IS the MoD has carried out no investigations on the ground counting the cost to civilian life.

"UK's most polluted towns and cities revealedAreas above the limit include London and Manchester, with the Welsh town Port Talbot the worst.","Manchester was among the places with the highest recordings Update 4 May 2018: This story, first published on 2 May, has been revised after the WHO issued corrected figures, including those that had originally put Port Talbot at the top of  its list. More than 40 towns and cities in the UK are at or have exceeded air pollution limits set by the World Health Organization, its new report has found. The WHO estimates that 30 areas have fine-particle air pollution levels above 10 micrograms per cubic metre, with another 17 at that limit. Areas that exceeded the level included London, Manchester and Swansea. Dirty air can cause debilitating diseases and hasten death. The figures on air pollution arecontained in the WHO's report,external, which estimates that globally nine out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants. Most of the UK figures were collected between 2013 and 2015 and in some places estimates of fine-particle air pollution were made based on measurements of larger particles of pollution. In the UK, Scunthorpe had the highest estimated level of fine-particle air pollution at 15 micrograms per cubic metre, though this was from 2013. Fine-particle air pollution is particularly bad for us, penetrating deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory infections, the WHO says. It estimates that, globally, seven million people die each year from exposure to such pollution, with most of these deaths being in low and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa. The world's most polluted city in 2015, according to the WHO, was Muzaffarpur in India, with a figure of 197 micrograms per cubic metre - although that figure is under revision. Pasakha in Bhutan, Delhi in India and greater Cairo, Egypt, also had very high levels. This video can not be played Sarah MacFayden from the British Lung Foundation says people sometimes can't leave their homes as a result of air pollution However, while many UK towns had air pollution recorded at or above the WHO's recommended limit, in a number of places the levels are falling. In London, for example, levels fell from 17 to 11 micrograms from 2013 to 2015, while in the same period there was a fall from 17 micrograms to 12 in Sheffield. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said the UK still had ""a long way to go in the fight against air pollution"". ""The UK government needs to show leadership by adopting WHO air quality guidelines into national legislation and in doing so, help to protect the nation's heart and circulatory health."" A spokesman for the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: ""While air quality in the UK has improved significantly since 2010, this report from the WHO clearly shows the impact air pollution is having on the health of men, women and children in the UK and across the world. ""Tackling this important issue is a priority for this government which is why we have a Â£3.5bn plan to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions and will set out further actions through a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy later this year.""

Ariana Grande wants album to 'bring light',"Ariana Grande recently released her comeback single No Tears Left To Cry Ariana Grande has said she wants to ""bring light"" to our lives with her new album in her first interview since last year's Manchester attack. She didn't address the bombing directly but became emotional when US TV host Jimmy Fallon discussed it. The pop star did announce her new album Sweetener, which is due this summer. She said it is ""about bringing light to a situation, or to someone's life, or somebody else who brings light to your life, or sweetening the situation"". Speaking on Fallon's NBC talk show, the 24-year-old singer did not say any more about the inspirations behind it. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It was the host who addressed the events of last May, when 22 people died in a bombing after her concert at Manchester Arena. She returned to the city to stage the One Love concert less than two weeks later. Explaining that he hadn't seen the singer since that time, Fallon said: ""I know it's tough for everybody, tough for fans and tough for you, and I know you haven't done any interviews, and I understand that. ""I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming on the show and for being strong and for entertaining and for showing up and going back to Manchester and doing a benefit. I thought that was awesome of you. I just think you're so strong and so cool."" Ariana started welling up and just replied: ""Thanks. Thank you."" Ariana comeback is at two in UK chart Ariana Grande unveils emotional new single Fallon then quoted part of a message the singer wrote in the days after the attack: ""We won't let hate win. Our response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder, and to live more kindly and generously than we did before."" Fallon added: ""Thank you, pal."" The star staged the One Love concert less than two weeks after the attack Ian Youngs, arts & entertainment reporter Ariana Grande wants to carry on being a ""normal"" pop star - on Fallon's show, she performed her new single, she took part in zany sketches, she talked about her new album to cheers from the excitable crowd. And she is a brilliant pop star. But she will always be inextricably linked with the events of 22 May 2017. She is also only human. I don't think the reason she didn't talk directly about Manchester is because she wants to distance herself from it - if that was the case, she would have asked Fallon not to mention it either. His comments would have been planned in advance. Perhaps having him talk about it was a way of addressing the subject without having to discuss it herself. From the look on her face when he made his comments, perhaps it is just still too painful. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

This is a new chapter Ariana said she didn't enjoy the process of making the face masks that are seen in the video for No Tears Left To Cry, the first single from the new album. ""They wrap you up and they bandage you for like 30 or 40 minutes and you can't see. All of your senses are completely cut off,"" she said. But she did add the meaning was ""very deep - taking off one chapter and putting on another"". The album's coming in July or August She said she's going to do ""something special"" on the 20th of every month until the album comes out. The first ""something"" is performing at the Billboard Music Awards on 20 May. She then said there are only three 20ths until the release - putting the big day perhaps at 20 July, and certainly before 19 August. We know who she's worked with Namely Pharrell and Nas, and songwriters and producers Ilya and Savan Kotecha. God is a woman That, at least, is the title of one of her songs. And Ariana's grandmother prefers it to No Tears Left To Cry. ""She loves God Is A Woman,"" Ariana said. ""I'll ask her, 'Hey Nonna, what do you think of my single? Do you like No Tears Left To Cry?' She was like, 'I love it... but you know Ariana, can we listen to God Is A Woman again?'"" She also revealed other song titles including The Light Is Coming (a religious theme, perhaps?), REM and Raindrops. A family link with the past Raindrops is ""kind of like an intro"" to the album, which is ""a cover of a small part of a song from the '50s"". That song is An Angel Cried by The Four Seasons. ""We were really close to finishing the album and I woke up and I had it in my head,"" she said. She went to check who wrote it. ""This is so crazy, y'all are going to think I'm lying - but my grandfather's best friend, who I grew up hanging out with, Charlie Calello, wrote it with Bob Gaudio from the Four Seasons, and that gave me goosebumps.""

TSB bosses set for showdown with MPs,"Furious TSB customers are still facing account failures ahead of an examination of the bank's bosses by MPs on the influential Treasury Committee. The session comes as some customers battled problems with scheduled payments and online banking on Tuesday. One customer's savings account showed his balance had been minus Â£1.1m. TSB chief executive Paul Pester will be one of three bank chiefs giving evidence to Parliament later on Wednesday. He will be joined by TSB chairman Richard Meddings, and Miquel Montes, chief operating officer at TSB's Spanish owner, Sabadell. How it all went so wrong for TSB Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, said: ""We will take evidence from TSB and Sabadell representatives to find out how they got into this mess, who is responsible, and how they are putting it right."" TSB shut down services for two days from the evening of Friday 20 April to move customer data from former owner Lloyds to a new IT system managed by Sabadell. As soon as the new system was switched on during Sunday evening, customers reported seeing other people's account details alongside a range of other difficulties. Access to accounts via online banking and the bank's app was patchy in the following days, while those who did manage to get into their accounts encountered some extraordinary errors.

In a letter to MPs,external, Mr Pester also revealed the extent of ""widespread"" failures of technology in the branch network. Problems were still experienced in 40% of branches by last Friday. Frustrated customers also faced average waits of up to an hour for those telephoning the bank. Last Thursday, experts from computing giant IBM were called in to try to help solve the crisis. Questions will no doubt be asked about the origins of the IT crisis. The switchover of 5.4 million customers' account details to a new system had already been delayed. The move had been expected in November, and was set to save the business an estimated Â£100m a year. MPs will ask whether it really was fully prepared for the major task of shifting 1.3 billion customer records and, importantly, what contingency planning was in place if things started to go wrong. When failures did start to happen, there was a series of claims from the bank that the problems had been solved when they had not. Chief executive Paul Pester will face MPs Mr Pester is likely to be quizzed particularly about a pre-dawn tweet on Wednesday, in which he said at 03:40 that the app and online banking were up and running again. Within hours, customers were reporting the opposite. ""The Treasury Committee is extremely concerned by the problems at TSB, and by the apparent miscommunication to customers about the extent and nature of these problems,"" Ms Morgan said. Compensation will also be a key theme. Mr Pester said that no customer would be left out of pocket. That could be difficult to judge for many businesses which have been unable to pay staff and suppliers in the normal way. MPs will want details on exactly how the system of redress will work. Customers have faced nearly two weeks of disruption with their accounts. The timing has been particularly bad for Lorna McHale, who will be marrying Ben Connolly on Saturday. The couple have their savings for the wedding in a TSB account which they have been unable to access. The happy couple are unhappy with TSB ""We had no idea how much money was in there as we got bits and bobs for the wedding,"" said Ms McHale. The 26-year-old had to spend the morning before a dress fitting in a branch, which also had IT issues, but did not like the idea of taking out a large sum in cash. She said she had to ""ring to grovel"" with suppliers for their wedding, including the DJ, the wedding car provider, and those doing her hair and make-up, all of which were small businesses. She still cannot access online banking, as the bank's records are now using an old mobile number to which they sent the access code. The bank phoned her when she was in a meeting, and when she called back, the wait was going to be so long that she got cut off. ""I am stressed and disappointed. It is one thing that I really did not need right now,"" said the bride-to-be. ""I want to know what they are going to do to prevent it from happening again, and how they are going to compensate people for the undue stress.""

"Sickies in decline, report suggests","Employers are seeing more staff turning up to work while ill, according to a report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). It surveyed more than 1,000 organisations this year and found that 86% had observed staff attending work while ill, or ""presenteeism"". The rise compares with a survey in 2010 when just 26% of employers observed the behaviour. The CIPD also found high numbers of staff willing to work while on holiday. The scale of the problem is ""shocking"" according to Rachel Suff, Senior Employment Relations Adviser at the CIPD who said ""people feel under even more pressure to work"". She said employers need to do more to tackle the issue. ""Too few organisations are discouraging unhealthy workplace practices and tackling stress, which is strongly linked to health conditions such as anxiety and depression,"" Ms Suff said. This video can not be played Sickness and wages: Do I get paid if I am off work? Last year, the TUC described UK workers as ""mucus troopers"" after the Office for National Statistics said that sickness absence totalled 137 million working days in 2016, the equivalent of 4.3 days per worker and the lowest on record. When records began in 1993, the equivalent of 7.2 days were lost. There is no official definition for worker sickness. Employees are able to self-certify sickness for up to seven days. For longer periods, and statutory sick pay claims, a doctors note is needed. Some workplaces have their own specific rules. Emma Lowe has ulcerative colitis and says that, in a previous jobs, it was tough to make managers aware of the issues. ""I'd been having at least one day off a month due to my UC and I was told that I should 'grin and bear' the pain,"" she says. ""Unfortunately [my manager] didn't understand that on those days I was off sick, I couldn't even walk, let alone climb the stairs at work and be sat in an air-conditioned cyclone. ""My UC put me in hospital in 2010 and I was out sick for nearly two months. My manager at the time did not understand what UC was and had to Google it. Then he had to explain that I was genuinely sick to higher up."" Official guidance, published earlier this year, suggested that employers should give staff places to rest at work to help boost productivity. Public Health England,externalsaid that downtime at work can help employees switch off and get better quality sleep at night. Experts suggest that millions of pounds are lost owing to absenteeism, and presenteeism - when employees are at work but not operating at optimum levels. Some firms already encourage employees to have downtime at work. London-based money transfer service firm TransferWisehas a hammock and sauna on its premises, for example. And accountancy company PwC, as part of a training programme on resilience,tries to help its staff improve the quality of their sleep. The report by the CIPD was written in partnership with Simplyhealth. Do I get paid if I am off work sick? Video, 00:01:20Do I get paid if I am off work sick?

Briton injured in attack by own lion,"Mike Hodge and his wife Chrissy founded the animal sanctuary in 2010 A British wildlife park owner is recovering in a South African hospital after being mauled by one of his lions. Mike Hodge, 67, suffered neck and jaw injuries in the attack at the Marakele Animal Sanctuary in Thabazimbi. A video of Mr Hodge being attacked and dragged by the large male lion has been circulating on social media. The BBC understands the lion, reportedly called Shamba, has been put down. Mr Hodge, who set up the sanctuary with his wife Chrissy in 2010, had gone into the lion's enclosure to investigate a strange smell. The website for the Marakele Animal Sanctuary shows pictures of its lions encountering a tour group The video shows the lion attacking Mr Hodge as he tries to leave the enclosure, and then drag him along the ground towards some bushes. A spokeswoman for the Hodge family, Bernadette Maguire, has reportedly said in a statement that the incident happened as tourists were being shown around the sanctuary. In the video, people can be heard screaming as Mr Hodge calls for help. The statement said Mr Hodge is ""only too aware of the dangers of working with wildlife but they remain his passion"" despite the incident. It also highlighted how the family are ""devastated"" at the death of the lion, which they had raised from a cub. Mr Hodge was rescued when a warden fired a gun causing the lion to run off. The park remains closed following the attack. According to its website,externalthe sanctuary is home to a number of big cats, including tigers, as well as birds, monkeys and a collection of small animals, The site offers a ""lion mobile"" tour which allows visitors to get close to the lions. The description of the tour on the website says: ""I can promise you that Shamba will jump up and look you in the eyes, he also sits on the top of the truck whilst we take the drive through the camp.""

Mueller 'threatened Trump with subpoena',"Mr Mueller (right) threatened to force Mr Trump to answer investigators' questions Special Counsel Robert Mueller warned he could order Donald Trump to testify as part of a probe into alleged Russian election meddling, US media report. It is believed to be the first time the special counsel has raised the possibility of issuing a subpoena. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied collusion, and Russia has also denied the allegations. Meanwhile, the lawyer who has been Mr Trump's main legal representative in the probe is to step down. The White House said on Wednesday that Ty Cobb had been considering retirement for some time and had decided to go at the end of this month. A guide to US legalese Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Key questions in the affair answered Mr Mueller suggested the threat of a subpoena, a court order forcing a witness to appear to give testimony, during talks with Mr Trump's lawyers in March. It came after Mr Trump's lawyers insisted during the meeting that the president was under no obligation to face questions by federal investigators in relation to the Russia inquiry, the Washington Post reported. However, Mr Mueller's team reportedly responded by suggesting they would issue a subpoena if Mr Trump declined. They agreed to provide the president's lawyers with more specific information about the questions they wished to ask Mr Trump. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The president's former lawyer, John Dowd, has also said that Mr Mueller mentioned the possibility of forcing Mr Trump to face questions. Mr Dowd, who resigned about a week and a half after the meeting, said he told investigators that the probe was not ""some game"", adding: ""You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States."" The list of possible questions has since been published in the New York Times, and it reportedly covers the president's motivations in dismissing former FBI director James Comey last May and his campaign's contacts with Russia. Mr Trump repeated his claim that the Russia inquiry is a ""witch hunt"" on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington If negotiations between Donald Trump's legal team and the special counsel's office have been a delicate dance, Robert Mueller just stomped on his counterpart's toes. A subpoena to force the president before a grand jury could start an explosive legal battle that eventually reaches the US Supreme Court. Mr Trump and his lawyers may argue that a president can't be compelled to answer such wide-ranging questions. The president has reportedly cooled on the idea of willingly meeting the special counsel - a result of his feeling that the Mueller team is out to get him. There have been hints that his legal advisers are torn on the matter. John Dowd, who resigned in March as the president's top personal lawyer, was said to be against an interview. Others, including recent arrival Rudy Giuliani, appear more open to co-operation. This may explain this week's spate of revelations. Possible Mueller questions, as compiled by the president's lawyers, were splashed across front page yesterday. The subpoena threat is today's news. Mr Mueller's team remains tight-lipped, but the evolving strategies of the president's side are playing out nearly in full view - and they may be inclined to turn this dance into a rumble. The US president himself has said he is willing to speak to Mr Mueller, but CNN reports that his enthusiasm has cooled after the offices of his personal attorney were raided. The network cites sources close to Mr Trump as saying they are yet to make a recommendation about whether he agrees to an interview with Mr Mueller. Some advisers reportedly believe Mr Mueller would not go so far as to issue a subpoena. If one was issued, Mr Trump's lawyers could fight it in court, or he could refuse to answer questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment, a constitutional protection against potential self-incrimination. Prominent US lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who has expressed support for Mr Trump in his legal battles, advised against the US president speaking to the special counsel. ""The strategy is to throw him softballs so that he will go on and on with his answers,"" he told the Washington Post. ""Instead of sharp questions designed to elicit yes or no, they make him feel very comfortable and let him ramble."" The special counsel is looking into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election, whether there was any collusion between the Kremlin and Mr Trump's election campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry. Mr Mueller was appointed special counsel following Mr Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey last May. He was chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself due to undisclosed communications with the Russian ambassador. Mr Rosenstein, who is the only Justice Department official with the authority to fire Mr Mueller, has been reportedly targeted for impeachment by House Republicans. Speaking on Tuesday, he addressed the ""people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time"". This video can not be played US Deputy Attorney General rails against 'threats' ""I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,"" he said. What does the special counsel do? The president has long insisted there was no collusion between his election campaign and the Russians. US media reported that sources familiar with the case said Mr Mueller informed Mr Trump's attorneys in March that he is a subject of the investigations, but not a criminal target. It remains unclear when Mr Mueller will request a meeting with the president.

Why is the customs union key?,"We won't be staying in the EU's customs union, and we won't be joining a new customs union either - so says the government. But just in case you've got a bit lost in the weeds of what the, or indeed ""a"" customs union is, BBC Reality Check's Chris Morris explains the issues. So the customs union is back in the newsâ¦ We have, but like a fine wine some things get better with age. All members of the European Union are automatically members of the EU customs union (so is Monaco, but we're not going there).  It means there are no internal tariffs (that is, taxes) on goods that are transported between them. That's a big advantage for businesses like those in the car industry that rely on complex manufacturing supply chains. They can move stuff from one country to another throughout the EU without added costs or delays. UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 Senior MPs to force customs union vote Brexit: All you need to know Members of the customs union impose what's known as a common external tariff. That means they all charge exactly the same tariffs on goods brought into customs union territory from other countries. The benefit of that is that once the common tariff has been paid, no-one has to prove where all the parts in their products originally come from (known asrules of origin)- something that can be time-consuming and expensive. There's always a but, and this one has become really important in the Brexit debate. In the customs union you don't get to negotiate your own trade deals on goods around the world. All that has to be done at the EU level, because that is the only way to maintain the consistency of the common external tariff. But the government insists that the UK must have the freedom to negotiate its own trade deals after Brexit, in order to deliver on the demand to ""take back control"". That raises a question though - will any trade deals we do with other countries make up for what we could lose in trade with the EU outside the single market and the customs union? Most economists say they won't. We could try - this iswhat the Labour Party now advocates.Turkey has a customs union with the EU for most manufactured goods (it doesn't include agriculture, though) so there are precedents. But Turkey is still bound by the trade agreements the EU does around the world, and when new EU deals open up the Turkish market to companies from other countries, Turkey doesn't automatically get reciprocal rights for its companies. There are still long delays at Turkey's land border with the EU as well, because Turkey is not inthe single market.Labour argues that the UK is a much bigger economy that could get a much better deal than Turkey, but there's no sign that the EU would allow the UK to continue to negotiate all its own trade agreements if such a deal was to be done. The first one is a proposal that has emerged in Whitehall for a new customs partnership, in which the UK would collect the EU's tariffs on goods coming from other countries on the EU's behalf. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Business doesn't like the fact that this could mean far more bureaucracy and cost; and anyway there are plenty of people, both within the government and outside, who simply don't think the system will work. It has never been done anywhere in the world on the kind of scale proposed. Many supporters of Brexit are also suspicious of the proposal for a customs partnership. They fear it is a deliberately impractical ruse, designed to keep the UK in the customs union by default. The second proposal has the catchy title of a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"". The idea is that it would minimise checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border. The trouble with this idea is that it rubs up against one of the trickiest issues in the Brexit processâ¦ Yes, both the EU and the UK have committed to keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all but invisible, with no checks or infrastructure. Option two doesn't achieve that - in Whitehall-speak it is ""maximum facilitation"" (or max-fac) rather than no border at all. But even staying in the customs union wouldn't solve the problem on the Irish border entirely, because the UK would still be outside the single market and some checks would be needed to make sure goods complied with EU rules and regulations. There are plenty of clever people working on it. Some supporters of Brexit accuse the EU of exaggerating the problem in order to back the UK into a corner. But the EU has insisted for some time that the UK's proposals won't work in Ireland. So it's not surprising that customs and the Irish border have now become a litmus test of how successful the Brexit negotiations may prove to be over the coming months. And there isa series of parliamentary testsahead for the government that will keep all these issues in the news. In a symbolic vote on 26 April, the House of Commons approved a non-binding motion calling on the government to include the option of establishing ""an effective customs union"" as an objective in the Brexit negotiations. But more significant tests lie ahead in amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill and in particular to the Trade Bill - the latter calls explicitly for the UK to be part of a customs union.

'Having sex five times a day wasn't enough'Two sex addicts speak about the impact it has had on their lives.6h6 hours agoEngland,"This video can not be played Rebecca Barker said sex addiction took over her life and ruined her relationship Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives. ""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasn't enough."" Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship. Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex. ""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldn't get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire. ""I felt like everything reminded me of it.  I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it. ""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again. ""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people."" Ms Barker split with her partner and made lifestyle changes in a bid to control her addiction Ms Barker's addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple. ""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldn't understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from. ""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and that's why I wanted sex with him."" In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother. ""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that. ""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything."" Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France. ""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said. Relate defines sexual addiction as anysexual activity that feels ""out of control"",external. The Association for the Treatment of Sex Addiction and Compulsivity says its number of sex therapists has doubled in the past five years to 170 A questionnaire completed by 21,058 people since 2013 on the Sex Addiction Help website revealed 91% of those seeking help for sex addiction were male The largest age group of 31% was aged 26-35, 1% were under 16 and 8% over 55 The World Health Organization is expected to approve the inclusion of ""compulsive sexual behaviour disorder"" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list in May 2019 The NHS says experts disagree about whether it is possible to become addicted to sex,externaland points to Relate for further help Graham, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said his compulsion led him to cheat on his wife with ""hundreds"" of sex workers, leaving him with ""rip-roaring guilt"". ""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep. ""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy. ""It is damaging and life-destroying."" Graham said when his wife found out he was relieved Graham, who is in his 60s, estimates he paid hundreds of pounds a month for sex over several years, even building relationships with some of the sex workers he saw. ""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day. ""You have one affair and then you want another and another one. ""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week. ""It is just like being an alcoholic, it's a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned. ""Then when it's over you feel remorseful, you say you're never going to do it again."" 'I learned my husband was dead on a police computer' Every penny earned so far goes on rent Disguised women sneak into Iranian football match Graham stopped leading his ""horrendous double life"" when his wife found an email and confronted him. He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years. ""When I was found out, I remember feeling 'thank God - something might change'. ""I went to SAA which is an abstinence-based treatment. I call it going from shame to grace. ""It is such a relief to go to the meetings and find out there are other people who are just as miserable and sordid as you are. ""For people who are in this situation, I just want them to know that there is a way out and you can break the cycle."" Peter Saddington, from Relate, said there is some therapy and group work available for sex addicts, but most of it is private. ""[Addicts] realise it is causing harm, but they can't stop and they recognise they need help in changing it. ""For alcoholics, there is Alcoholics Anonymous, but they can also go to the NHS [which] provides support for people who have alcohol or drug problems. ""It would be appropriate that [sex addicts] can go to their GP and get support because it has a crippling effect both on them, on relationships, on their families, their financial situation and their mental health."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""People who think they may have a sex addiction can seek advice and help via NHS Choices, which includes contacts at Relate, Sexaholics Anonymous, SAA and ATSAC.""

Far-left anarchist groups, known as Black Blocs, hijacked a peaceful rally against President Emmanuel Macron's public sector labour reforms. Police said about 1,200 masked and hooded protesters attended the annual 1 May demonstration by labour unions. Four people, including a police officer, were lightly wounded. Police on Wednesday corrected an earlier figure of more than 200 arrested given out by the Interior Minister Gerard Collomb. The protesters were swamped with teargas and sprayed with a water cannon in an effort to disperse them. Protesters wore protective masks against tear gas They pulled down signs and clashed with officers The black-clad protesters attempted to hold up the demonstration march, before smashing shop windows along the route and torching a McDonald's near Austerlitz station. Various vehicles and a car dealership were also set ablaze, and graffiti was scrawled on walls. France's protesters revive ghosts of 1968 revolt Macron's reforms spark nationwide strikes In pictures: Workers unite for May Day Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux criticised the protesters for covering their faces.

"Belfast trust recalls 2,500 patientsPeople with brain conditions might have been misdiagnosed or not given the right treatment, it is feared.","The trust says it is a ""serious"" situation and has apologised More than 2,500 neurology patients in Northern Ireland, including children, are being recalled for a case review. The recall comes amid concerns some patients may have been misdiagnosed. The BBC can reveal that this follows a review of the work of neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Neurology is the treatment of brain conditions including MS, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke and Motor Neurone Disease. Following the case review, the patients involved could receive devastating news. While some of these conditions can be treated, nearly all are life-changing. Patients being recalled should have received a letter by post on Tuesday. It will include details about how to make an appointment. An advice line is now operating for those who have been affected - it is 0800 980 1100. The Ulster Independent Clinic, which confirmed that Dr Watt operated a private practice at the clinic until June 2017, said it would be operating a helpline for concerned patients from 09:00 BST on Wednesday morning - the number is 028 9068 6511. Both the trust and the Royal College of Physicians have carried out separate reviews of patients' notes. Concerns were initially raised by a GP about a patient's diagnosis and treatment in December 2016. The Belfast Health Trust said it was a ""serious"" situation and apologised to patients and their families. Nichola Mallon, SDLP, told the BBC that she raised the issue on behalf of several constituents last year. ""It is as if we have been beating our heads off a brick wall, trying to get information about what is going on and trying to get answers including diagnosis,"" she said. ""Some of my constituents have been in Dr Watt's care for years. But they can't get a proper diagnosis. So they are living in pain their quality of life is deteriorating, they don't know whether they are on the right medication, some cannot work."" Among the 2,500 under review are children, some of whom may have been struggling with a wrong diagnosis. A consultant who once worked alongside Dr Michael Watt said all of his colleagues were shocked. He said it was a ""daunting"" time for everyone, but patient safety must come first. Read more analysis from Marie-Louise here. This video can not be played 'We have never been involved with a recall of this scale' Dr Mark Mitchelson is responsible for neurosciences at the Belfast Health Trust. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said: ""While we hope this will affect a very small number of patients - the change in diagnosis could potentially be very significant. ""We understand that this must be incredibly anxious for them and, for that, we are deeply sorry for any distress that has been caused. ""Equally, we feel it's absolutely vital that we are prudent and cautious when dealing with any patient safety issues and hence, that is why we are recalling these patients to be seen."" Neurology is the field of medicine concerned with the operation of the brain While there is particular concern over a small number of his patients, the trust has decided to recall everyone who is currently in Dr Watt's care. The trust did not rule out the possibility, at a later stage,  it could stretch to patients who died while in Dr Watt's care. Dr Mitchelson said nine neurology consultants in the trust would be running 200 additional clinics starting from Saturday 5 May. They will see the 2,500 patients including teenagers as young as 14 years of age as quickly as possible. Beverley Davidson was one of thousands of neurology patients who discovered on Tuesday morning that they would face fresh appointments as part of the review. She told BBC News NI about how she found out about the news. ""I was out with my husband in the car, we turned the radio on and heard mention of Dr Watt and a bit of controversy over it - I decided to look at the news on the phone to see that patients were being recalled. ""I've come home and the letter is in the post to say I've been asked to come for an appointment in May. Beverley Davidson with the letter sent to her by the Belfast Health Trust ""I was shocked. It leaves you very uneasy. You're unsure of what's going on, what's going to happen. I'll have to go through lots of tests again, which was quite traumatic at the time. It leaves you in limbo, really - not good. ""I just don't know what to think - I found Dr Watt to be understanding and helpful. He took me through the paces of what I was going through. He made it quite easy to work with. The panic of who will take over or what will happen - I just don't know. ""The trust could have dealt with this a lot better than they have. To just send out a letter and hear a news report with no preparation - heartless. ""I wasn't expecting this today or any day. Within an hour, your whole world's upside down and will be until I have another consultation with whoever I get. ""I just hope they're just as efficient and professional as Dr Watt was with me."" Some of the recalled patients will be seen by doctors working in the independent sector. ""Certainly this is a significant number and, within the neurosciences division, we have never been involved with a recall of this scale,"" Dr Mitchelson said. ""These are patients with a wide range of neurological conditions, some of which are debilitating, complex and significantly serious. ""But standards did dip around one consultant and patient safety should always be paramount - hence the recall."" According to the Belfast Health Trust, Dr Watt has not seen any patient either in the public or private sector since June 2017. He remains an employee. The Ulster Independent Clinic said that Dr Watt operated a private practice at the clinic but he voluntarily suspended it in June 2017. ""Late last evening we were made aware of the completion of the review, commissioned by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, undertaken by the Royal College of Physicians into Dr Watt's clinical practice. ""When this is made available to us we will immediately consider the report to fully understand the type and extent of the concerns raised."" It added: ""We would like to reassure all Dr Watt's patients, potentially impacted by this issue, that we are moving as quickly as possible to address any concerns they may have."" Some of those who received letters on Tuesday have shared their experiences with BBC News NI. Kathy Ellis said that strong medication she did not need ""stole"" her life. ""I was like a zombie,"" she said. However, she improved after a new consultant changed her treatment. ""I feel so much better until today, until I got the letter,"" she said. Maeve Falconer said she was absolutely furious at Tuesday's patient recall ""I'm angry. I've been very tearful and crying all day. That's my life, how dare they."" Maeve Falconer said she was diagnosed with MS but later found out that was not the case. ""I believed that I had MS. I'd told my family, I'd told my employers, my husband told his employers. ""I thought if I told people I took control of it - and then to find out in February I didn't have MS, that was a bit of a shock."" She added: ""I am absolutely furious. I'm not recalled because I actually fell through the cracks before getting to that stage. ""But I'm so, so cross to think that I was not the only person in this position, that there are so many others who potentially are looking at the same thing as me or worse."" One caller to BBC's Talkback programme said his daughter, who has brain stem epilepsy, was a patient of Dr Watt's. ""We received a letter this morning (Tuesday) to go to the Royal Victoria Hospital on Sunday"", he said. ""She hasn't had an appointment with neurology for at least five years and now this has come like a bombshell - it's frightening. ""We feel we are left in limbo,"" the caller added. Nichola Mallon said getting answers was like ""beating our heads off a brick wall"" The trust said that it also wanted to reassure patients on already long waiting lists that they would not be affected by the recall. Dr Mitchelson said the consultants were very much aware of Northern Ireland's ""unacceptable"" waiting times and running 200 additional clinics would ensure these patients would not have to wait any longer. When asked by the BBC if the General Medical Council had been made aware of the review and Dr Watt, a spokesperson said that the trust had taken all ""appropriate action including liaising with the GMC"". ""It remains unclear if Dr Watt has referred himself to the governing body or if the Belfast Health Trust has done so on his behalf,"" the spokesperson said.

"Facebook to launch dating serviceFacebook's chief reflects on an ""intense year"" before revealing plans to match-make users.6h6 hours agoTechnology","This video can not be played WATCH: How Facebook plans to disrupt internet dating Facebook's chief has said that 2018 has been an ""intense year"" for his firm. But Mark Zuckerberg also took the opportunity to unveil a dating service among other new products at his firm's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California. He told his audience that the match-making feature would take privacy issues in mind and would launch ""soon"". The company can ill afford another data scandal as it continues to be embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica affair. ""There are 200 million people on Facebook who list themselves as single,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. ""And if we are committed to building meaningful relationships, then this is perhaps the most meaningful of all."" Shares in the dating business Match Group fell after the announcement and closed more than 22% below their opening price. The firm owns Tinder, a dating app that sources its profile information from Facebook. Facebook has faced fierce criticism ever since it emerged that it had failed to check whether political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had deleted data harvested about millions of its users. Mr Zuckerberg said that this was a ""major breach of trust"" that must never happen again. How Facebook plans to disrupt dating 'Hate speech button' fazes Facebook users Zuckerberg faces angry developers WhatsApp boss and co-founder Jan Koum to quit As part of efforts to restore confidence, he said the firm was building a new Clear History tool to provide members with more control over how their information is used. The feature will: let members see which third-party sites and apps Facebook collects data from provide the ability to delete the information prevent Facebook from being able to add such details to their profile in the future However,in a related blog,external, Facebook has acknowledged that the tool will take several months to develop, and that it would still need to retain related information in ""rare cases"" for security reasons. Mr Zuckerberg also addressed his company's efforts to tackle fake news and detect operations designed to disrupt elections. But while he opted not to unveil a smart speaker - which the BBC understands had once been destined to launch at F8 - he did introduce other novelties. Users will be able to send each other text-only messages via a new chat tool The headline feature is a new service to help singletons on the platform meet potential dates. He said the opt-in feature would focus on ""real long-term relationships, not just hook-ups"", and would exclude existing friends from potential matches. ""We have designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Zuckerberg also announced that video chat and new augmented reality filters were coming to its photo-sharing Instagram app. In addition, he said that group video calling would soon launch on its WhatsApp messaging service. Big businesses will also benefit from new WhatsApp tools to help them communicate with their customers, he declared. The chief executive also paid tribute to WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum, who announced he was quitting the company yesterday. ""One of the things I'm most proud of is we've built the largest, fully encrypted network in the world,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. According to an earlierreport by the Washington Post, Mr Koum had decided to leave because he was unhappy that the forthcoming business tools would involve a weakening of WhatsApp's encryption. Mr Zuckerberg rounded off his list of unveils by revealing that his company's Oculus virtual reality division had begun shipping its first standalone headset, meaning the device does not need to be plugged into a PC or smartphone to work. Oculus Go provides its own computing power rather than requiring a PC or smartphone He said the $199 kit - which costs Â£199 in the UK - was the ""easiest way to get into VR"" and had the ""highest quality lenses and optics that we have ever built"". The firm's larger Oculus Rift headsets have proved less popular than many industry insiders had predicted, and appear to have been outsold by Sony's less powerful PlayStation VR gear. Experts are split about the new device's prospects. ""The new device makes VR much more accessible to everyone,"" commented Adrian Willings from the gadget review site Pocket-lint. ""It's a brilliant middle ground, but it's a mobile experience so not as good as a PC one."" But the head of games at the IHS consultancy was less positive. ""I see the Oculus Go headset as quite awkwardly positioned versus existing technology in the market,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls. ""The major thing it has going for it is its price point, but the fact it has a similar user-experience to a premium smartphone adapter headset limits its appeal."" Mr Zuckerberg had a defiant message for F8's attendees For Mark Zuckerberg there were two audiences for his speech - the 5,000 developers in the hall, many of them anxious about their businesses, and the two billion Facebook users who don't know whether they should trust the social network. For developers, who have seen much of their access to data frozen as the privacy crisis deepens, he announced the reopening of app reviews. That means an end to a logjam for new apps. There was a mild cheer for this quite limited move and a huge one when he told attendees they would all walk away with a free Oculus Go VR headset - some people are easily pleased. Facebook developers had complained that some of their apps had stopped working as a consequence of its emergency measures For the wider audience, Zuckerberg kept hammering away at what has become his new mantra - that Facebook needs to take a broader view of its responsibilities. He admitted mistakes - the Cambridge Analytica breach of trust, failing to spot Russian interference in elections - and outlined the various steps being taken to combat fakery, to investigate dodgy apps and to give users more control. Apart from a new feature allowing users to clear their history - with the warning that it might make the Facebook experience worse - there was little that was new. But there was a clear defiant message - yes, Facebook was acting to make users safer, but it would continue to launch new services like dating that expanded its reach. Mark Zuckerberg thinks Facebook's huge global audience still believes in his vision - no real signs here that he has been chastened by recent events. In a separate development, some US-based users have reported that a new prompt has appeared beneath posts on their News Feed asking them if the messages contain hate speech. The service apparently extends to updates written by Mr Zuckerberg himself. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Body behind wall of Canada women's toiletCalgary police suspect the man crawled through a vent, fell and became stuck behind the wall.3h3 hours agoUS & Canada","Canadian police say the remains of an adult male have been found lodged behind the wall of a public toilet. A maintenance worker made the discovery on Monday morning in the women's restroom in a shopping centre in central Calgary, Alberta. He removed a wall panel in order to repair a toilet that would not flush and found the body. Police say they have not yet determined cause of death. A post-mortem examination was performed on Tuesday. ""Despite the circumstances of where the body was located, investigators do not suspect foul play and the death remains classified as undetermined,"" police said in a statement. Calgary fire services were called in to remove the body. Calgary police spokeswomanEmma Poole told CBC News,externalthey believe it is possible someone was crawling through a vent or duct, fell from above and became stuck behind the wall. YouTube stars paid to sell cheating Disguised women sneak into Iranian football match Restaurant fined for racial profiling ""So that is obviously something they would be looking at is someone crawling through the ventilation system,"" she said. Ms Poole told the BBC police currently believe the man ""probably went in there on his own"" and was unable to call for help. The investigation into when the victim died and how he ended up inside the wall at the Core shopping centre is continuing.

Briton injured after attack by own lion,"Mike Hodge and his wife Chrissy founded the animal sanctuary in 2010 A British wildlife park owner is recovering in a South African hospital after being mauled by one of his lions. Mike Hodge, 67, suffered neck and jaw injuries in the attack at the Marakele Animal Sanctuary in Thabazimbi. A video of Mr Hodge being attacked and dragged by the large male lion has been circulating on social media. The BBC understands the lion, reportedly called Shamba, has been put down. Mr Hodge, who set up the sanctuary with his wife Chrissy in 2010, had gone into the lion's enclosure to investigate a strange smell. The website for the Marakele Animal Sanctuary shows pictures of its lions encountering a tour group The video shows the lion attacking Mr Hodge as he tries to leave the enclosure, and then drag him along the ground towards some bushes. A spokeswoman for the Hodge family, Bernadette Maguire, has reportedly said in a statement that the incident happened as tourists were being shown around the sanctuary. In the video, people can be heard screaming as Mr Hodge calls for help. The statement said Mr Hodge is ""only too aware of the dangers of working with wildlife but they remain his passion"" despite the incident. It also highlighted how the family are ""devastated"" at the death of the lion, which they had raised from a cub. Mr Hodge was rescued when a warden fired a gun causing the lion to run off. The park remains closed following the attack. According to its website,externalthe sanctuary is home to a number of big cats, including tigers, as well as birds, monkeys and a collection of small animals, The site offers a ""lion mobile"" tour which allows visitors to get close to the lions. The description of the tour on the website says: ""I can promise you that Shamba will jump up and look you in the eyes, he also sits on the top of the truck whilst we take the drive through the camp.""
