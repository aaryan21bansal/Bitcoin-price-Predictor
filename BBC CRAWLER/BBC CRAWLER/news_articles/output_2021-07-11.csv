Small number of fans broke into Wembley - police,"A picture showing a line of police before the ticket barriers A small number of ticketless fans broke into Wembley Stadium for the Euro 2020 final, after videos showed crowds pushing through barriers, police said. Fans fought with stewards and police as they attempted to break through gates. The FA said it was ""entirely unacceptable"" and those involved were ""an embarrassment to the England team"". The Metropolitan Police said it had worked with security staff to prevent further breaches and also supported officials in ejecting ticketless fans. The FA said it would ""work with the relevant authorities to take action against anyone who is identified to have illegally forced their way into the stadium"". The statement from police came after Wembley Stadium initially denied that anyone without a ticket had gained entry, saying: ""There were no security breaches of people without tickets getting inside the stadium."" In a later statement, a stadium spokesperson said: ""There was a breach of security and a small group of people got into the stadium. ""We are now working closely with stadium stewards and security to remove these people. Anyone inside the stadium without a ticket will be instantly ejected."" Footage from inside Wembley showed fans fighting, apparently after some had forced through a door. And the BBC's Howard Nurse said it took until half-time for stewards to clear the gantry section meant for disabled spectators at Wembley. ""The area was rammed with people who should not have been there and it was quite an edgy situation,"" he said. Health minister Edward Argar told Sky News action would be taken against those who had broken the law. He said: ""It is sad when a very small number of people, a tiny minority, bring the sport into disrepute by trying to do something like this. ""Again, I would say they are not reflective of the fans of our national game and our national team."" A large crowd was also trying to enter the fan zone in Trafalgar Square without tickets shortly before kick-off, the Met Police said. Police said they had been ""engaging with the crowd and telling them to disperse"". At Wembley, a man was taken to hospital after he was hit by a bus on High Road. Police said the bus driver stopped at the scene and the man's injuries were not said to be life-threatening. Wembley Way was packed before the final In footage taken at Wembley Stadium and posted by video blogger Paul Brown, fans could be seen jumping over barriers and grappling with stewards and police, as some of them were ejected. Mr Brown said there were not enough police to deal with the size of the crowd. BBC News producer Warren Moran said he saw people without tickets forcing their way through the turnstiles, but could not say whether they were later ejected from the stadium. He said dozens of people were pushing through the gates for disabled people, which were open. Avideo posted by Sky Sports reporter Michelle Owen,externalshowed several fans streaming over barriers as stewards looked on. She said: ""If this is even crossing your mind, don't. You don't get far. Please don't ruin it for everyone at Wembley."" In addition to videos of crowds pushing past barriers, some witnesses said they had seen people getting in by ""tailgating"" behind ticket-holders through the turnstiles. The Daily Telegraph'sBen Rumsby posted on Twitter,externalthat he and others had seen examples of this in the build-up to the final. Were you at Wembley? Did you see people break in without tickets?

England fan-speak explained,"For the first time since 1966, England's men's football team has reached the final of a major tournament. More than 23 million people watched the 2-1 semi-final win over Denmark, with the TV audience for Sunday's final against Italy expected to be even bigger. But as football dominates the national conversation, how does the new or non-football fan cope? A phrase immortalised in Three Lions - the song released when England (the home of football, of course) hosted the European Championship in 1996. Just after the home side was knocked out in the semi-final, the song hit the top of the charts for the second time, and it has returned to the national consciousness in every tournament since. Do say:What a tune! Frank Skinner and David Baddiel's song is a heartwarming anthem about an English fan's hope and despair. They are football's Lennon and McCartney! I do not resent them having tickets for every match. Don't say:Isn't it all a bit jingoistic? And of course, football wasn't actually invented in England, merely codified here in the 19th Century, so this isn't really home at all. The trophy that England lifted in 1966 when they won the World Cup, was in 1946 named after the French former president of Fifa, which is the sport's governing body. The trophy is namechecked in the chorus of Three Lions. Do say:Three Lions on a shirt, Jules Rimet still gleaming. Don't say:Three Lions on a shirt,jewels remainstill gleaming. England's winning goal in Wednesday's semi-final against Denmark cameafter a controversial penalty, when the Dutch referee - and his assistant watching on TV - decided that midfielder Raheem Sterling had been fouled in the 18-yard box. Do say:There was definitely contact - not once, but twice - and besides, we were dominating the game! A goal was coming. Don't say:Why did he fall over so easily? You would never see a rugby player do that. Perhaps they should replay the game? Midfielder/forward Jack Grealish is one of England's most exciting players, but has started only one game in the tournament, something debated at length - great length - by fans across the country. Do say:Grealish dribbles beautifully and makes things happen - but don't question England team boss Gareth Southgate. The manager knows what he's doing. Don't say:Oh - you mean the one with a hairband who falls over a lot? To be honest, I'm indifferent as to whether he plays or not. Not bothered! More on the build-up to England v Italy in the Euro 2020 final Gareth Southgate by those who know him best England's likeable manager is a former player who, in 1996, missed the crucial penalty in the semi-final against Germany, ensuring the trophy did not ""come home"". Do say:He's more than a manager - he's a kind, intelligent, and empathetic ambassador for a new generation of down-to-earth footballers. Makes you proud to be English. Don't say: You do know, in his only management job in club football, he actually got Middlesbrough relegated from the Premier League. As well as Three Lions, England fans sing Sweet Caroline (by Neil Diamond), the national anthem (not by Neil Diamond), and, for reasons not fully known, Whole Again, the fifth single from early-2000s English girl group Atomic Kitten. Do say:Southgate you're the one, you still turn me on, football's coming home again. Don't say:Turn me on? Is that appropriate to sing about a 50-year-old football coach who looks like a successful - but nottoosuccessful - chain store regional manager? England's only major trophy came in 1966, when they beat West Germany 4-2 in the World Cup final at Wembley. Geoff Hurst scored a hat-trick; Bobby Moore lifted the trophy; Kenneth Wolstenholme, the TV commentator, said: ""They think it's all over - it is now."" You may have heard the game mentioned once or twice since then. Do say:Harry Kane is the new Bobby Moore; Raheem Sterling is the new Geoff Hurst; Jordan Pickford might - at a stretch - be the new Gordon Banks. Don't say:Did other countries even play football in 1966? Was it the World Cup or the Euros? And how long ago was that anyway? The chorus of Three Lions - that song again - goes:Three Lions on a shirt / Jules Rimet still gleaming / 30 years of hurt / Never stopped me dreaming. The clock is still ticking, and it's now 55 years since 1966. Do say:2021 could become a year that - like 1966 - evokes an image, a memory, a feeling, all of its own. A milestone in English history! A totemic moment! And we were there! Don't say:Technically the hurt didn't start until 1968, when we were knocked out of the European Championship - our first major tournament after 1966 - so really it's only 53 years of hurt... Since England's first match in 1872 (a 0-0 draw against Scotland) they have worn a badge featuring three lions - itself taken from the ancient royal arms of England. Since 1996, the Three Lions has been used by some as a nickname for the English team. Do say:Just seeing the badge makes makes my hairs stand up - simple but elegant; ancient but timeless; a beautiful baton being passed through generations of proud Englishmen and women. Don't say:Are lions even native to England? Wouldn't Three Cows be better? Or even Three Red Squirrels? Football teams generally line up with four dedicated defenders or three. It's a matter of choice. England have used both systems in the tournament so far, and could use either in the final. Do say:It's really refreshing to see an England team able to switch between formations so easily. Kyle Walker, who can play right-back or centre-back, is really crucial here. Don't say:Why not play eight defenders, then no-one could score past them? If the scores in the final against Italy are level after 90 minutes, 30 minutes of extra-time is played. If it's still level, the match is decided by a penalty shootout - each team taking five penalties apiece, and then going to sudden-death if needed. England have been knocked out of six major tournaments in this way (1990, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2006 and 2012) and won a shootout only twice (1996, in an earlier match, and 2018). Do say:We beat Colombia in 2018 on penalties. It's a new era! The modern-day England player has the technique and mentality to withstand the pressure. Don't say:Didn't Harry Kane actually miss his penalty against Denmark on Wednesday? And besides - why do they need penalties? If it's a draw, let them share the trophy. That way, no-one has to miss like Southgate in 1996. And what's a few more years of hurt, anyway...

Firms call for early end to self-isolation rules,"The UK Hospitality trade body says self-isolation rules were already causes ""carnage"" The UK's largest employers' body has urged the government to bring forward changes to Covid self-isolation rules. The CBI says it would ease firms' staff shortage problems and help ensure the next phase of lockdown reopening is a ""confident"" not ""anxious"" process. In a six-point plan published on Sunday, the CBI says clear guidance soon will help firms reopen. It wants clarity over continued workplace testing and says funding by government is also needed. Most Covid restrictions are due to end on 19 July. But planned changes to self-isolation rules are not expected until 16 August at the earliest. Many companies, especially in the hospitality and leisure sectors, says their 19 July reopening plans are in disarray.

Hot air balloon crash lands in town centre,"A hot air balloon crash-landed in a town centre in Nottinghamshire. British Transport Police (BTP) said its officers gave out first aid in Sutton-in-Ashfield after the aircraft came to a halt at about 20:50 BST on Saturday. Pilot Andrew Davidson, who brought the balloon down beside the Nags Head pub, said he had never experienced such a landing in more than 30 years of flying. ""It was untidy, but we were safe,"" he said. Mr Davidson, who is chairman of the Nottingham and Derby Hot Air Balloon Club, said he was ""anxious"" to land before reaching the town as he was low on fuel, but he could not find an appropriate spot. ""Unfortunately there were a lot of power lines, livestock and crops that prevented me from landing any sooner,"" he said. ""At that point you just have to make sure you can keep control of the balloon so it doesn't just drift."" Roof tiles were knocked off the pub as the balloon descended and one of the four people on board suffered a bloody nose, Mr Davidson said. He praised pub-goers for coming out to help and said the crash will be reported to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the British Balloon and Airship Club. ""This landing is very, very unusual - it's the first time I've ever done that, and I've flown hot air balloons for over 30 years,"" he said. ""I've never had one like that before, and I don't want one like that again. ""It was very interesting for the people of Sutton-in-Ashfield - I've seen some nice videos."" BTP Nottinghamshire confirmed its officers responded and offered first aid after the crash. ""This isn't something that happens very often,"" they tweeted.

From Wortley to Wembley: Rise of Kalvin Phillips,"Kalvin Phillips is difficult to miss in Leeds City Centre after being featured on a huge mural by artist Akse P19 First it was the Championship, then it was the Premier League's turn, now he's made a huge mark on the international stage. Since Kalvin Phillips set up Raheem Sterling for England's opening goal of Euro 2020 against Croatia, fans across England and beyond have started to take notice. Leeds United supporters have known about the 25-year-old's talent for years, but not quite as long as his first coach. The holding midfielder played youth football for his local side Wortley for seven years, with Elland Road scouts soon taking notice and snapping him up for Leeds' academy, aged 14. Read more Yorkshire stories Paul Hatfield, who coached him at Wortley Juniors, based just three miles away from Elland Road, said: ""We were playing a tournament up at Farnley Academy, one of the guys from Leeds spotted him and said, 'I like him, who's he?' ""I said 'That's Kalvin Phillips', and some of the passes he was doing on that day he's doing for England now. He covered all the pitch too."" Paul Hatfield, who has been with Wortley Football Club for 28 years, says Phillips ""just got better and better"" Phillips, who joined Wortley when he was eight years old, left to continue his footballing education with Leeds - with many fellow junior players deciding to leave too, such was his influence. ""Kalvin did stand out, he'd never miss training, always trained hard, listened to us - if something went wrong, he'd get his shoulders up, got on with it and started playing again,"" Mr Hatfield continued. ""Win, lose or draw, he'd come off still smiling."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The player, nicknamed the 'Yorkshire Pirlo' - after Andrea Pirlo - in honour of his playmaking ability, will face the retired Italy great's home country on Sunday in England's first major men's final in 55 years. Co-headteacher Karen Loney, one of many staff members at Whingate Primary School who remember Phillips as a pupil, said: ""His mum recently posted a snippet of Kalvin's Year 6 report. In it, I use the phrase 'laid-back attitude' and you can still see that now. ""A happy, smiley, bright boy who did well across the board, worked hard and loved nothing more than chasing a football round at breaks and lunchtimes."" This video can not be played Kalvin Phillips: Leeds United midfielder takes Ian Wright on a tour of his football roots On the streets of Wortley, everyone has a story about Phillips - with some more tenuous than others. At Cafe Blanco, owner Molly said: ""Well, he came in and bought an omelette and some sandwiches, and my co-owner, she had a photograph with him. ""It's nice to know a local lad done good."" Andy Rhodes and Karen Loney are two of several teachers at Whingate Primary School who remember Phillips Some homes in Wortley have been decorated in tribute to both England and the local hero Over the railway tracks from his old primary school is 'Mushy Field', his usual spot for a kickabout as a child. On a field that earned its nickname because of its proximity to a mushroom farm, Phillips mucked in and even found the time for a match with his mates after signing as a professional. Several of Phillips' friends were in the crowd at Wembley to see him play in England's semi-final win against Denmark, includingMicaiah Williams. Friends of Kalvin Phillips receive his match shirt following the Three Lions' 2-1 semi final win Mr Williams said: ""That's why he stayed on for the full 120 minutes and still had energy until the last second. ""It's great to see just a normal, humble guy doing so well."" Kalvin is not only a great footballer but a wonderful human being. I'll always remember his debut at Wolves in 2015 when he crunched one of the hosts' senior players, Kevin McDonald, with what has since become his trademark tackle. That aggression and competitive nature betrays a laid-back and respectful approach to life, illuminated by a beaming smile. He has always shown a self-awareness and politeness which has helped him cope not only with the demands and scrutiny of the national press, but also with the criticism that came from a section of the Leeds United support who were not convinced by his ability when he was in the Championship. He says United head coach Marcelo Bielsa has had a huge influence on his career, but so have predecessors such as Neil Redfearn and others in the academy at Thorp Arch who gave him his chance. He has proved the doubters wrong by combining hard work and considerable talent to become one of the bedrocks of England's success at Euro 2020. His rise to the Premier League and to representing England has the city bursting with pride for a local lad who loved his late Granny Val and adores his amazing family. Nice guys can win. The player's upbringing was not always an easy one, with his fatherserving time in prison,externaland his mother working long hours. Speaking to Ian Wright and Football Focus about his mother, Phillips said: ""It was just at the weekends we've seen her as she was busy working. ""We used to get up for school about eight o'clock and she'd drop us off in a car that wouldn't quite work properly, we'd see her for half an hour in the mornings, we'd go to my grandma's after school until she'd finish work."" Teachers at Whingate Primary School say they are ""immensely proud"" of Phillips' achievements Phillips has also spoken about how close he was to his late grandmother Valerie Crosby, who died in February. After England's win against Denmark, he joined the post-match celebrations wearing a shirt with 'Granny Val' on the back in tribute to her. Mr Hatfield said: ""He lives five minutes away from here, he's a Wortley lad and his granny said for him not to leave Leeds at all, so I can't see him leaving - but you never know."" Phillips, watched on by friends and family across west Leeds, has featured in every game England has played in Euro 2020 His impact hasn't gone unnoticed back at his former school, with teacher Andy Rhodes, who taught Phillips in Year 5, noticing his skills influencing the next generation of midfielders in Leeds. ""There's now more children who like to hit 20 or 30-yard balls, the long pass has definitely been picked up on,"" he said. ""A 'Kalvin Phillips pass' involves hitting it very hard across the pitch."" Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Fans who stormed gates did not get in, says Wembley","A picture showing a line of police before the ticket barriers A small number of ticketless fans broke into Wembley Stadium for the Euro 2020 final, after videos showed crowds pushing through barriers, police said. Fans fought with stewards and police as they attempted to break through gates. The FA said it was ""entirely unacceptable"" and those involved were ""an embarrassment to the England team"". The Metropolitan Police said it had worked with security staff to prevent further breaches and also supported officials in ejecting ticketless fans. The FA said it would ""work with the relevant authorities to take action against anyone who is identified to have illegally forced their way into the stadium"". The statement from police came after Wembley Stadium initially denied that anyone without a ticket had gained entry, saying: ""There were no security breaches of people without tickets getting inside the stadium."" In a later statement, a stadium spokesperson said: ""There was a breach of security and a small group of people got into the stadium. ""We are now working closely with stadium stewards and security to remove these people. Anyone inside the stadium without a ticket will be instantly ejected."" Footage from inside Wembley showed fans fighting, apparently after some had forced through a door. And the BBC's Howard Nurse said it took until half-time for stewards to clear the gantry section meant for disabled spectators at Wembley. ""The area was rammed with people who should not have been there and it was quite an edgy situation,"" he said. Health minister Edward Argar told Sky News action would be taken against those who had broken the law. He said: ""It is sad when a very small number of people, a tiny minority, bring the sport into disrepute by trying to do something like this. ""Again, I would say they are not reflective of the fans of our national game and our national team."" A large crowd was also trying to enter the fan zone in Trafalgar Square without tickets shortly before kick-off, the Met Police said. Police said they had been ""engaging with the crowd and telling them to disperse"". At Wembley, a man was taken to hospital after he was hit by a bus on High Road. Police said the bus driver stopped at the scene and the man's injuries were not said to be life-threatening. Wembley Way was packed before the final In footage taken at Wembley Stadium and posted by video blogger Paul Brown, fans could be seen jumping over barriers and grappling with stewards and police, as some of them were ejected. Mr Brown said there were not enough police to deal with the size of the crowd. BBC News producer Warren Moran said he saw people without tickets forcing their way through the turnstiles, but could not say whether they were later ejected from the stadium. He said dozens of people were pushing through the gates for disabled people, which were open. Avideo posted by Sky Sports reporter Michelle Owen,externalshowed several fans streaming over barriers as stewards looked on. She said: ""If this is even crossing your mind, don't. You don't get far. Please don't ruin it for everyone at Wembley."" In addition to videos of crowds pushing past barriers, some witnesses said they had seen people getting in by ""tailgating"" behind ticket-holders through the turnstiles. The Daily Telegraph'sBen Rumsby posted on Twitter,externalthat he and others had seen examples of this in the build-up to the final. Were you at Wembley? Did you see people break in without tickets?

Pick your England XI to play Italy,"The final England starting XI chosen by BBC Sport users - but who will Gareth Southgate go for? England v Italy in Euro 2020 final Date:Sunday, 11 JulyTime:20:00 BSTVenue:Wembley Stadium, LondonCoverage:Live on BBC TV, BBC Radio 5 Live, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app As England reached their first men's major tournament final in 55 years, we asked you who should start for the Three Lions in Sunday's Euro 2020 final against Italy at Wembley? With Gareth Southgate's side just one victory away from winning the European Championship on home soil, the majority of you think he should stick with the same XI he picked against Denmark. Once again the formation is a 4-3-3, with 60.66% of you wanting to see that. So who makes the cut? And who misses out? Jordan Pickfordwas selected in more than 90% of your teams. The Everton goalkeeper has conceded only one goal so far at Euro 2020 and has kept five clean sheets, two more than any other keeper. Harry MaguireandJohn Stonesremain your preferred partnership in front of Pickford. Maguire is the most selected player overall, while Stones is fifth. Either side of them,Kyle Walkeris your first-choice right-back (73.01 %) withLuke Shawfavoured to start on the left (73.82 %). Declan Rice(33.36 %),Kalvin Phillips(33.88 %) andMason Mount(16.7 %) all retain their places in midfield and are once again selected by you to start in front of the back four. Three Lions top scorerHarry Kaneis the second-most selected player overall. After failing to score in England's three group games, skipper Kane now has four goals, one behind the tournament's joint-top goalscorers - Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and the Czech Republic's Patrik Schick. Raheem Sterlingwas the most selected player on both the left and right side of the attack. The Manchester City forward received considerably more picks on the left-hand side, soBukayo Sakamakes the team on the right as he was the second-most selected player in that position. And whileJack Grealishwas a popular choice overall, he wasn't selected as the first or second pick in any position, so just misses out on your XI. You can still pick your England XI below, but your selection won't be counted towards the result. Don't forget to share your picks on social media using #bbcfootball.

'Final will be one of great collective experiences'In pictures: England's excitement ahead of finalVideo,"This video can not be played 'So good, so good, so good' - Ecstatic Southgate leads England celebrations England v Italy in Euro 2020 final Date:Sunday, 11 JulyTime:20:00 BSTVenue:Wembley Stadium, LondonCoverage:Live on BBC TV, BBC Radio 5 Live, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app For all the sporting success England has enjoyed over the past 20 years, its men's football team remains the one which, for most people, determines the sporting identity of the nation. Over the past two decades there have been memorable and long-awaited World Cup wins for England teams in rugby union and cricket, and the country has, of course, played a major part in Britain's emergence as an Olympic and Paralympic superpower. Yet, until recently, the football team had proved stubbornly unable to follow suit. An outlier. After reaching the semi-finals of both the 1990 World Cup and Euro '96, England became sadly symbolic of sporting underachievement. And for many fans this period of failure was made more frustrating given it coincided with the growth and success of the Premier League. Many wondered if it may indeed be partly to blame, with the influx of overseas managers and players. For years, every major tournament setback seemed to be a precursor to managerial resignations, Football Association reviews and deep regret. Bad luck, divided squads and failure under pressure etched into the very identity of the team. But no longer. Not since Gareth Southgate guided his young team to the last four of the 2018 World Cup, then proved it was no fluke by reaching the country's first major men's final since 1966. Victory against Italy would complete the team's renaissance, one that proves England can produce successful international managers after all. A team which just five years ago suffered arguably its lowest ever moment when crashing out of Euro 2016 to minnows Iceland. A collective of players who, unlike so many of those that came before, seem to relish representing their country and are inspired - not diminished - by wearing the Three Lions. Everything you need to read, watch or listen to before England v Italy Even if England lose, the sense is that huge progress has been made. The national sporting psyche has been healed, and future tournaments can be approached with optimism and confidence, rather than trepidation. But the importance and relevance of this team can only be understood by assessing its impact off the field too. After almost 18 months of the pandemic, England's campaign has given many people the lift and distraction they craved, providing some healing when it was needed most. Indicative of a new era of athlete activism, this group of diverse players also appear to have the social awareness, humility, and confidence to express themselves. By taking a knee before matches in order to highlight their support for racial equality for instance, this has meant some controversy and criticism. But backed by their manager, they have held their ground, inspiring millions in the process, and for many, proving a unifying force at a time of deep social and political division. Sunday's final will be one of the great collective experiences this country has shared. One that may even surpass the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. That event was also watched by vast numbers, appeared to bring families and communities together, and made the country feel good about itself. But much has happened in the nine years since that night, and for many, this game, and this team, feels even more significant as a result. Long read: Raheem Sterling - from scapegoat to national icon Watch: All the best video from Euro 2020 Euro 2020 final preview - Italy v England: Southgate wants fans to roar side to victory 'A special group, standing up for the things that matter' - meet the England squad player by player This video can not be played Harry Kane's winner sends England to Euro 2020 final The foundations for this were arguably laid down in 1997, when former FA technical director Howard Wilkinson reshaped football's academy system. But 31 January 2011 was a date when the route to the Euro 2020 began. By coincidence, Southgate joined the FA as its new director of elite development on the day building work began at the national football centre - St George's Park. The 330-acre site near Burton-on-Trent had been bought by the FA 10 years earlier and was Wilkinson's brainchild, but after much delay it eventually opened in 2012. With a hotel, 12 pitches and elite training facilities, it had everything to host all of England's age-group teams, but it also created ""a hive of information sharing"", according to Mike Rigg, the FA's head of talent management from 2013 to 2015. It was also where Southgate and former FA director of development Sir Trevor Brooking hatched their 10-year plan to get England playing the more attractive and successful football, which has finally borne fruit. ""It's a facility where you cannot walk down the corridor without bumping into 20 different people from football,"" Rigg says. ""It might be performance analysts or sports scientists and you would spend the whole day talking about football, whether it was in the offices, out on the pitch or in the canteen."" Getting coaches for each team together on a regular basis was something learned on one of several ""spying missions"" to the Spanish FA, says Rigg. Listen, download, subscribe on BBC Sounds: Daily Euros - all about Gareth Southgate If St George's Park gave everyone a feeling they were all heading in the same direction, in 2013 Greg Dyke then cranked the pressure up bysetting England the targetof reaching the Euro 2020 semi-finals and winning the 2022 World Cup. Soon afterwards, a clock was installed in a newly built coaches' room counting down the days to Qatar 2022. ""I think everybody thought I was nuts saying that,"" says Dyke. ""But today it looks a lot more hopeful. The idea was to give everybody a lift."" It certainly focused minds, according to Rigg, who is now technical director at Burnley. ""It was nine years away at the time, but then we started analysing: how many camps would that be? What are the ages of the players that are going to be around in 2022, how much contact time can we have with these players?"" he says. ""That nine years quickly became a matter of hours and the best thing that the 2022 target did was forcing change."" Thankfully, Dyke found the cash to do that. It led to increasing the number of youth teams so the FA would see players in years between competition age groups, starting from under-15s. It meant they could have more of an influence on players who they would only see 55 days a year. But there was still a key piece of the jigsaw to solve: getting the might of Premier League clubs onside. England manager Gareth Southgate and then-FA technical director Dan Ashworth, at the World Cup in Russia, in 2018 The lack of trust between the FA and the Premier League was defined by players of the so-called 'golden generation' who would form club cliques while on England duty and, despite their talent, would never reach the heights of the current squad. That also extended to clubs and the FA. The Premier League was at the peak of professionalism, but when on England duty, standards seemingly slipped. ""The confidence that clubs had in sending their players into England teams at all levels, wasn't at its highest,"" says Rigg, who has previously worked at Manchester City and Fulham. ""Clubs were saying that the players were coming back from international football in a worse state. They were brushing shoulders with other players, they were talking about contracts, agents were in their ears, and talking about different experiences in games and training."" Enter Dan Ashworth, the former West Brom technical director, who took over from the departing Southgate in 2013 to become its new director of elite development. He quickly improved the relationship between clubs and the FA, which has never looked back. ""Dan said it had to change,"" Rigg says. ""It had to be an experience that would benefit the players' development and not detract in any way. We attacked it from every single angle."" Part of that was helped by being based at St George's Park. But Ashworth also introduced a more elite staff structure including head of performance Dave Reddin, who had worked with England Rugby and the British Olympic Association, and head of player and coach development Matt Crocker was brought in from Southampton. They all helped launch an 'England DNA' in 2014, which made for a consistent playing style across all age groups, which was boiled down to six key principles. It also introduced players to the values expected of them, and they were also offered more education and support. In essence, England players were experiencing an elite performance culture - mirroring what they had at their clubs. The England Under 20s World Cup-winning team from 2017 Ashworth's club background meant he came into the FA knowing two key things. Firstly, that England players' technical development would largely rely on what happened in clubs. But secondly, that the players were mostly in good hands and a further revolution was to come. Playing time in first teams for English youngsters was a problem. But back at the training grounds, change was happening. Clubs had agreed to boost their youth team coaching programmes by creating a Â£320m Elite Player Performance Plan. Training hours were doubled and academies were graded based on performance. The FA also overhauled its coaching courses to focus on younger age groups. At first, there was not much difference in Premier League first teams, but proof that the talent existed came when England youth teams began winning tournaments. Ashworth, elevated to technical director, and his colleagues had prioritised success at youth level, believing that would lead to trophies for the senior team. Both Spain and Germany had both won under-19 and under-21 titles before going on to win respective World Cups in 2010 and 2014. In 2010, there were already signs of potential when England won the under-17 European Championship, a first age-group title in 27 years. Another followed in 2014. Then in 2017,English football exploded.The under-17s andunder-20swon their respective World Cups, the under-18s won the Toulon tournament and the under-19s won the European Championship. Included in those sides were current England players Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. ""Out of five age groups, four of them won trophies,"" said Brooking. ""You looked at those five years and thought we've got some great players coming through and that was the moment you knew the next few years were going to be great."" Around the same time, Borussia Dortmund signed Sancho, with other teenagers soon following him to Germany, which Brooking said ""was unheard of"". It was further recognition of a special group. When Ashworth left his role at the FA at the start of 2019, Southgate said: ""In terms of the work of a technical director, I don't think Dan could have had a bigger impact with the plans he put in place at the FA."" But having translated that youth team success to an unexpected semi-final at the 2018 World Cup, could Southgate take the team to the next level? This video can not be played 'I danced in Garethâs shoes' - how England coaches Chris Powell and Gareth Southgate bonded as youngsters There are many people who have played a part in getting England to their first major final in 55 years, but several think Southgate has been the cornerstone. If it hadn't been for anewspaper sting involving previous manager Sam Allardyce,who only lasted one game in charge, perhaps Southgate may not even have got the job. But having played his part in setting up the FA's vision, visiting clubs and coaches up and down the country to set out what a new England looked like, and having worked with many of the players in the current squad when he returned to the FA as under-21s manager in 2013, he has been perfectly placed. ""Gareth was in the FA and at St George's Park so when he became England manager [in 2016] he was rooted in that structure and without him I'm not sure it would have all worked,"" says Dyke. Southgate has taken the team to new levels by working hard on the team's culture and identity. Players are now presented with their caps rather than receiving them by post, and are assigned a legacy number which shows them their position in the long list of players who have represented the Three Lions. Over the past two years, Southgate has spoken about how the team reflect a modern Britain, and has built a bond between the team and the country. Before Euro 2020, the 50-year-old wrote in the Players' Tribune: ""It's about how we conduct ourselves on and off the pitch, how we bring people together, how we inspire and unite, how we create memories that last beyond the 90 minutes. That last beyond the summer. That last forever."" ""Eight or nine years ago, it was Gareth who was in at seven o'clock in the morning when we'd have Monday morning meetings at St George's Park,"" says Rigg. ""He's been fundamental and central to it all."" Brooking adds: ""Gareth has a fantastic knowledge of individual players and their characters in order to get the best out of the squad. ""I hope Sunday is the one, but I guarantee that we'll be there or thereabouts for the next 10 years.""

'Final will be one of great collective experiences',"This video can not be played 'So good, so good, so good' - Ecstatic Southgate leads England celebrations England v Italy in Euro 2020 final Date:Sunday, 11 JulyTime:20:00 BSTVenue:Wembley Stadium, LondonCoverage:Live on BBC TV, BBC Radio 5 Live, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app For all the sporting success England has enjoyed over the past 20 years, its men's football team remains the one which, for most people, determines the sporting identity of the nation. Over the past two decades there have been memorable and long-awaited World Cup wins for England teams in rugby union and cricket, and the country has, of course, played a major part in Britain's emergence as an Olympic and Paralympic superpower. Yet, until recently, the football team had proved stubbornly unable to follow suit. An outlier. After reaching the semi-finals of both the 1990 World Cup and Euro '96, England became sadly symbolic of sporting underachievement. And for many fans this period of failure was made more frustrating given it coincided with the growth and success of the Premier League. Many wondered if it may indeed be partly to blame, with the influx of overseas managers and players. For years, every major tournament setback seemed to be a precursor to managerial resignations, Football Association reviews and deep regret. Bad luck, divided squads and failure under pressure etched into the very identity of the team. But no longer. Not since Gareth Southgate guided his young team to the last four of the 2018 World Cup, then proved it was no fluke by reaching the country's first major men's final since 1966. Victory against Italy would complete the team's renaissance, one that proves England can produce successful international managers after all. A team which just five years ago suffered arguably its lowest ever moment when crashing out of Euro 2016 to minnows Iceland. A collective of players who, unlike so many of those that came before, seem to relish representing their country and are inspired - not diminished - by wearing the Three Lions. Everything you need to read, watch or listen to before England v Italy Even if England lose, the sense is that huge progress has been made. The national sporting psyche has been healed, and future tournaments can be approached with optimism and confidence, rather than trepidation. But the importance and relevance of this team can only be understood by assessing its impact off the field too. After almost 18 months of the pandemic, England's campaign has given many people the lift and distraction they craved, providing some healing when it was needed most. Indicative of a new era of athlete activism, this group of diverse players also appear to have the social awareness, humility, and confidence to express themselves. By taking a knee before matches in order to highlight their support for racial equality for instance, this has meant some controversy and criticism. But backed by their manager, they have held their ground, inspiring millions in the process, and for many, proving a unifying force at a time of deep social and political division. Sunday's final will be one of the great collective experiences this country has shared. One that may even surpass the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. That event was also watched by vast numbers, appeared to bring families and communities together, and made the country feel good about itself. But much has happened in the nine years since that night, and for many, this game, and this team, feels even more significant as a result. Long read: Raheem Sterling - from scapegoat to national icon Watch: All the best video from Euro 2020 Euro 2020 final preview - Italy v England: Southgate wants fans to roar side to victory 'A special group, standing up for the things that matter' - meet the England squad player by player This video can not be played Harry Kane's winner sends England to Euro 2020 final The foundations for this were arguably laid down in 1997, when former FA technical director Howard Wilkinson reshaped football's academy system. But 31 January 2011 was a date when the route to the Euro 2020 began. By coincidence, Southgate joined the FA as its new director of elite development on the day building work began at the national football centre - St George's Park. The 330-acre site near Burton-on-Trent had been bought by the FA 10 years earlier and was Wilkinson's brainchild, but after much delay it eventually opened in 2012. With a hotel, 12 pitches and elite training facilities, it had everything to host all of England's age-group teams, but it also created ""a hive of information sharing"", according to Mike Rigg, the FA's head of talent management from 2013 to 2015. It was also where Southgate and former FA director of development Sir Trevor Brooking hatched their 10-year plan to get England playing the more attractive and successful football, which has finally borne fruit. ""It's a facility where you cannot walk down the corridor without bumping into 20 different people from football,"" Rigg says. ""It might be performance analysts or sports scientists and you would spend the whole day talking about football, whether it was in the offices, out on the pitch or in the canteen."" Getting coaches for each team together on a regular basis was something learned on one of several ""spying missions"" to the Spanish FA, says Rigg. Listen, download, subscribe on BBC Sounds: Daily Euros - all about Gareth Southgate If St George's Park gave everyone a feeling they were all heading in the same direction, in 2013 Greg Dyke then cranked the pressure up bysetting England the targetof reaching the Euro 2020 semi-finals and winning the 2022 World Cup. Soon afterwards, a clock was installed in a newly built coaches' room counting down the days to Qatar 2022. ""I think everybody thought I was nuts saying that,"" says Dyke. ""But today it looks a lot more hopeful. The idea was to give everybody a lift."" It certainly focused minds, according to Rigg, who is now technical director at Burnley. ""It was nine years away at the time, but then we started analysing: how many camps would that be? What are the ages of the players that are going to be around in 2022, how much contact time can we have with these players?"" he says. ""That nine years quickly became a matter of hours and the best thing that the 2022 target did was forcing change."" Thankfully, Dyke found the cash to do that. It led to increasing the number of youth teams so the FA would see players in years between competition age groups, starting from under-15s. It meant they could have more of an influence on players who they would only see 55 days a year. But there was still a key piece of the jigsaw to solve: getting the might of Premier League clubs onside. England manager Gareth Southgate and then-FA technical director Dan Ashworth, at the World Cup in Russia, in 2018 The lack of trust between the FA and the Premier League was defined by players of the so-called 'golden generation' who would form club cliques while on England duty and, despite their talent, would never reach the heights of the current squad. That also extended to clubs and the FA. The Premier League was at the peak of professionalism, but when on England duty, standards seemingly slipped. ""The confidence that clubs had in sending their players into England teams at all levels, wasn't at its highest,"" says Rigg, who has previously worked at Manchester City and Fulham. ""Clubs were saying that the players were coming back from international football in a worse state. They were brushing shoulders with other players, they were talking about contracts, agents were in their ears, and talking about different experiences in games and training."" Enter Dan Ashworth, the former West Brom technical director, who took over from the departing Southgate in 2013 to become its new director of elite development. He quickly improved the relationship between clubs and the FA, which has never looked back. ""Dan said it had to change,"" Rigg says. ""It had to be an experience that would benefit the players' development and not detract in any way. We attacked it from every single angle."" Part of that was helped by being based at St George's Park. But Ashworth also introduced a more elite staff structure including head of performance Dave Reddin, who had worked with England Rugby and the British Olympic Association, and head of player and coach development Matt Crocker was brought in from Southampton. They all helped launch an 'England DNA' in 2014, which made for a consistent playing style across all age groups, which was boiled down to six key principles. It also introduced players to the values expected of them, and they were also offered more education and support. In essence, England players were experiencing an elite performance culture - mirroring what they had at their clubs. The England Under 20s World Cup-winning team from 2017 Ashworth's club background meant he came into the FA knowing two key things. Firstly, that England players' technical development would largely rely on what happened in clubs. But secondly, that the players were mostly in good hands and a further revolution was to come. Playing time in first teams for English youngsters was a problem. But back at the training grounds, change was happening. Clubs had agreed to boost their youth team coaching programmes by creating a Â£320m Elite Player Performance Plan. Training hours were doubled and academies were graded based on performance. The FA also overhauled its coaching courses to focus on younger age groups. At first, there was not much difference in Premier League first teams, but proof that the talent existed came when England youth teams began winning tournaments. Ashworth, elevated to technical director, and his colleagues had prioritised success at youth level, believing that would lead to trophies for the senior team. Both Spain and Germany had both won under-19 and under-21 titles before going on to win respective World Cups in 2010 and 2014. In 2010, there were already signs of potential when England won the under-17 European Championship, a first age-group title in 27 years. Another followed in 2014. Then in 2017,English football exploded.The under-17s andunder-20swon their respective World Cups, the under-18s won the Toulon tournament and the under-19s won the European Championship. Included in those sides were current England players Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. ""Out of five age groups, four of them won trophies,"" said Brooking. ""You looked at those five years and thought we've got some great players coming through and that was the moment you knew the next few years were going to be great."" Around the same time, Borussia Dortmund signed Sancho, with other teenagers soon following him to Germany, which Brooking said ""was unheard of"". It was further recognition of a special group. When Ashworth left his role at the FA at the start of 2019, Southgate said: ""In terms of the work of a technical director, I don't think Dan could have had a bigger impact with the plans he put in place at the FA."" But having translated that youth team success to an unexpected semi-final at the 2018 World Cup, could Southgate take the team to the next level? This video can not be played 'I danced in Garethâs shoes' - how England coaches Chris Powell and Gareth Southgate bonded as youngsters There are many people who have played a part in getting England to their first major final in 55 years, but several think Southgate has been the cornerstone. If it hadn't been for anewspaper sting involving previous manager Sam Allardyce,who only lasted one game in charge, perhaps Southgate may not even have got the job. But having played his part in setting up the FA's vision, visiting clubs and coaches up and down the country to set out what a new England looked like, and having worked with many of the players in the current squad when he returned to the FA as under-21s manager in 2013, he has been perfectly placed. ""Gareth was in the FA and at St George's Park so when he became England manager [in 2016] he was rooted in that structure and without him I'm not sure it would have all worked,"" says Dyke. Southgate has taken the team to new levels by working hard on the team's culture and identity. Players are now presented with their caps rather than receiving them by post, and are assigned a legacy number which shows them their position in the long list of players who have represented the Three Lions. Over the past two years, Southgate has spoken about how the team reflect a modern Britain, and has built a bond between the team and the country. Before Euro 2020, the 50-year-old wrote in the Players' Tribune: ""It's about how we conduct ourselves on and off the pitch, how we bring people together, how we inspire and unite, how we create memories that last beyond the 90 minutes. That last beyond the summer. That last forever."" ""Eight or nine years ago, it was Gareth who was in at seven o'clock in the morning when we'd have Monday morning meetings at St George's Park,"" says Rigg. ""He's been fundamental and central to it all."" Brooking adds: ""Gareth has a fantastic knowledge of individual players and their characters in order to get the best out of the squad. ""I hope Sunday is the one, but I guarantee that we'll be there or thereabouts for the next 10 years.""

Branson takes off on 'extraordinary' space flight,"UK businessman Sir Richard Branson is on his way to fulfilling a lifetime's ambition: flying to the edge of space. His Virgin Galactic rocket plane has taken off for a 1.5-hour mission which will see it reach an altitude where the sky turns black and the Earth's horizon curves away into the distance. The entrepreneur says he wants to evaluate the experience before allowing paying customers aboard next year. The mission above New Mexico began shortly after 08:30 EST (15:30 BST). Virgin Galactic is providingan online stream,externalof the event. This video can not be played Watch the moment Sir Richard Branson takes off on his space flight It's been a long road for Sir Richard to get to this point. He firstannounced his intention to make a space plane in 2004,external, with the expectation he'd have a commercial service available by 2007. Wally Funk, 82, to join Bezos space flight Branson gains licence for commercial spaceflights But technical difficulties, includinga fatal crashduring a development flight in 2014, have made the space project one of the most challenging ventures of his career. Branson will be accompanied by two pilots and three crewmates from the company ""I've wanted to go to space since I was a kid, and I want to enable hopefully hundreds of thousands of other people over the next 100 years to be able to go to space,"" Sir Richard told the BBC. ""And why shouldn't they go to space? Space is extraordinary; the Universe is magnificent. I want people to be able to look back at our beautiful Earth and come home and work very hard to try to do magic to it to look after it."" The vehicle, known as Unity, will be carried by a much bigger aeroplane to an altitude of about 15km (50,000ft), where it will be released. A rocket motor in the back of Unity will then ignite and blast the ship skyward. The motor will burn for 60 seconds, by which time Sir Richard, his three crewmates and the two pilots up front, will have a remarkable view of the planet below. The maximum height achievable by Unity is roughly 90km (55 miles, or 295,000ft), but towards the top of the climb Sir Richard will start to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness and he'll be able to float around the cabin and to look out of the window. Eventually, though, he'll have to strap back into his seat for the glide return to the spaceport in New Mexico. This video can not be played Beth Moses: ""It stuck in my soul; it's totally beautiful"" Sir Richard will be taking instruction throughout the flight from Beth Moses. She's the chief astronaut instructor at the businessman's Virgin Galactic company. Apart from the firm's cadre of test pilots, Moses is the only person who's so far experienced the exhilaration of an ascent. The view out of the window, she says, is ""just phenomenal"". ""Pictures don't do it justice. It's just so bright and beautiful. I saw the ocean, and halfway up the US and halfway down into Mexico. I saw the green of the land and the white snow-capped mountains,"" she told BBC News. ""Because you are weightless and still, and the ship has come to a stop, you can just soak it in, in a really timeless way. It stuck in my soul."" Unity folds its tailbooms on descent to stabilise its fall before then gliding home Unity is a sub-orbital vehicle. This means it can't achieve the velocity and altitude necessary to keep it up in space to circle the globe. The only other near-market sub-orbital system belongs to Amazon.com founder, Jeff Bezos. He has a rocket and capsule he calls New Shepard, and he will fly on its inaugural crewed flight on 20 July. The retail billionaire is going to ride to just over 100km above Texas, alongside his brother, Mark; thefamed female aviator Wally Funk; anda mystery individualwho bid $28m (Â£20m) in a ticket auction. But while Sir Richard has a line of some 600 individuals who've already paid deposits for tickets priced at up to $250,000 (Â£180,000), Mr Bezos has said little yet about how he intends to commercialise New Shepard. New Shepard has no pilots. The flight is fully computer-controlled Sir Richard says he has spoken to Jeff Bezos on the phone and they have wished each other well in their space endeavours. But there is no doubting there is some edge in the relationship. Mr Bezos was the first to announce his mission, only to see Sir Richard thenmove up his own published scheduleso he could win first-flight bragging rights. On Friday, Mr Bezos'sBlue Origin space company,externalissued a tweet that took a pop at Virgin Galactic's Unity vehicle. The posting repeated a claim that anyone who flew on the rocket plane would forever have an asterisk by their name because they wouldn't reach the ""internationally recognised"" altitude for where space begins -the so-called KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line,externalof 100km. The tweet also said Unity's impacts on the environment were far greater than New Shepard's. Virgin Galactic told the BBC that the carbon footprint of flying in Unity is equivalent to a business flight from London to New York, but that all the company's activities are offset.

Queen and PM wish England well as Euro final looms,"Fans have already started gathering outside Wembley for Sunday evening's final The Queen and Boris Johnson have led messages of support to the England team ahead of the Euro 2020 final. The monarch recalled presenting the World Cup trophy to Bobby Moore in 1966 as she praised the current team's ""spirit, commitment and pride with which you have conducted yourselves"". And in a letter to the squad, the prime minister said they had ""lifted the spirits of the whole country"". The Duke of Cambridge said he ""can't really believe this is happening"". Prince William, who is president of the English Football Association (FA), urged the squad to ""bring it home"" and said the team had already displayed ""the very best of England"". Gareth Southgate's team play Italy at Wembley on Sunday at 20:00 BST. What ARE they talking about? England fan-speak explained What's it like to have Gareth Southgate as your manager? Your stories of watching England 'A moment we feared would never happen' FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the mood in the England camp was ""very calm"". He said Southgate had built a really strong environment and created a ""band of brothers feeling"" in the team, which had a ""fantastic togetherness"" and ""resilience"". ""We're in a good place. It will be a tough game but we're going to give it a good go,"" he added. Asked what he would say to England fans considering booing the Italian national anthem before the match, he said: ""We've been really clear we do not support that. We want them to really get behind the teamâ¦ but get behind the team in the right way."" The Queen presents Bobby Moore with the Jules Rimet Trophy for winning the World Cup in 1966 The Queen's message hailed the ""spirit, commitment and pride"" of the England players.

"Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cutsThe group says the funding will help save ""critical projects"" and ensure progress is not ""wasted"".UK","Projects providing family planning services will be among those to benefit from the temporary funding A group of philanthropists, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are to provide Â£93.5m emergency funding to cover some UK foreign aid cuts. They said the temporary funding would help save ""critical projects"" and ensure progress was not ""wasted"". The government has decided to reduce this year's spending on overseas aid from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. It said the financial impact of the pandemic had forced ministers to take ""tough but necessary decisions"". The group, which also includes the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, the ELMA Foundation and Open Society Foundations, said the emergency funds would help projects tackling preventable diseases and providing family planning and sexual health services. They said it would prevent life-saving drugs from being thrown away because they pass their expiry date, and ensure women living in the poorest parts of the world are able to avoid unplanned pregnancies. The UN's family planning agency (UNFPA)looks set to lose some 85% of its funding from the UK,a drop of about Â£130m. Foreign Office criticised over aid cuts handling Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Is public opinion shifting on cutting foreign aid? A spokeswoman for the funder consortium, Kate Hampton, chief executive of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, said: ""These life-saving treatments are cost-effective investments. If they go unfunded this year, British taxpayer generosity will be wasted as clinics are closed and essential drugs expire and are thrown away."" The emergency funding was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who said it was ""desperately needed"". However, he called on the government to restore its commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on foreign aid. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: ""When Britain withdraws, others step in. By cutting our aid, we have given states such as China and Russia an opportunity to expand their influence at Britain's expense."" Charities including Oxfam and ActionAid have criticised the cuts - which amount to around Â£4bn a year -warning that they have already forced projects to be cancelled. Many Tory MPs have also spoken out against the move, which went against the pledge in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto to stick to the 0.7% figure. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has previously said it was hard to ""justify"" the commitment with the UK facing record borrowing,and with a national debt of well over Â£2 trillion. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK will spend more than Â£10bn to improve global health, fight poverty and tackle climate change this year - making us one of the biggest aid donors in the G7."" ""We have always been clear that the government will return to spending 0.7% of GNI [gross national income] on international development as soon as the fiscal situation allows,"" the spokesperson added.

Branson ready for 'extraordinary' space flightThe UK businessman is about to realise a lifetime's ambition by flying to the edge of space.Science & Environment,"UK businessman Sir Richard Branson is on his way to fulfilling a lifetime's ambition: flying to the edge of space. His Virgin Galactic rocket plane has taken off for a 1.5-hour mission which will see it reach an altitude where the sky turns black and the Earth's horizon curves away into the distance. The entrepreneur says he wants to evaluate the experience before allowing paying customers aboard next year. The mission above New Mexico began shortly after 08:30 EST (15:30 BST). Virgin Galactic is providingan online stream,externalof the event. This video can not be played Watch the moment Sir Richard Branson takes off on his space flight It's been a long road for Sir Richard to get to this point. He firstannounced his intention to make a space plane in 2004,external, with the expectation he'd have a commercial service available by 2007. Wally Funk, 82, to join Bezos space flight Branson gains licence for commercial spaceflights But technical difficulties, includinga fatal crashduring a development flight in 2014, have made the space project one of the most challenging ventures of his career. Branson will be accompanied by two pilots and three crewmates from the company ""I've wanted to go to space since I was a kid, and I want to enable hopefully hundreds of thousands of other people over the next 100 years to be able to go to space,"" Sir Richard told the BBC. ""And why shouldn't they go to space? Space is extraordinary; the Universe is magnificent. I want people to be able to look back at our beautiful Earth and come home and work very hard to try to do magic to it to look after it."" The vehicle, known as Unity, will be carried by a much bigger aeroplane to an altitude of about 15km (50,000ft), where it will be released. A rocket motor in the back of Unity will then ignite and blast the ship skyward. The motor will burn for 60 seconds, by which time Sir Richard, his three crewmates and the two pilots up front, will have a remarkable view of the planet below. The maximum height achievable by Unity is roughly 90km (55 miles, or 295,000ft), but towards the top of the climb Sir Richard will start to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness and he'll be able to float around the cabin and to look out of the window. Eventually, though, he'll have to strap back into his seat for the glide return to the spaceport in New Mexico. This video can not be played Beth Moses: ""It stuck in my soul; it's totally beautiful"" Sir Richard will be taking instruction throughout the flight from Beth Moses. She's the chief astronaut instructor at the businessman's Virgin Galactic company. Apart from the firm's cadre of test pilots, Moses is the only person who's so far experienced the exhilaration of an ascent. The view out of the window, she says, is ""just phenomenal"". ""Pictures don't do it justice. It's just so bright and beautiful. I saw the ocean, and halfway up the US and halfway down into Mexico. I saw the green of the land and the white snow-capped mountains,"" she told BBC News. ""Because you are weightless and still, and the ship has come to a stop, you can just soak it in, in a really timeless way. It stuck in my soul."" Unity folds its tailbooms on descent to stabilise its fall before then gliding home Unity is a sub-orbital vehicle. This means it can't achieve the velocity and altitude necessary to keep it up in space to circle the globe. The only other near-market sub-orbital system belongs to Amazon.com founder, Jeff Bezos. He has a rocket and capsule he calls New Shepard, and he will fly on its inaugural crewed flight on 20 July. The retail billionaire is going to ride to just over 100km above Texas, alongside his brother, Mark; thefamed female aviator Wally Funk; anda mystery individualwho bid $28m (Â£20m) in a ticket auction. But while Sir Richard has a line of some 600 individuals who've already paid deposits for tickets priced at up to $250,000 (Â£180,000), Mr Bezos has said little yet about how he intends to commercialise New Shepard. New Shepard has no pilots. The flight is fully computer-controlled Sir Richard says he has spoken to Jeff Bezos on the phone and they have wished each other well in their space endeavours. But there is no doubting there is some edge in the relationship. Mr Bezos was the first to announce his mission, only to see Sir Richard thenmove up his own published scheduleso he could win first-flight bragging rights. On Friday, Mr Bezos'sBlue Origin space company,externalissued a tweet that took a pop at Virgin Galactic's Unity vehicle. The posting repeated a claim that anyone who flew on the rocket plane would forever have an asterisk by their name because they wouldn't reach the ""internationally recognised"" altitude for where space begins -the so-called KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line,externalof 100km. The tweet also said Unity's impacts on the environment were far greater than New Shepard's. Virgin Galactic told the BBC that the carbon footprint of flying in Unity is equivalent to a business flight from London to New York, but that all the company's activities are offset.
