Macron: China Olympic boycott is insignificant,"Mr Macron said he preferred what he described as useful actions France has no plans to join a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, President Emmanuel Macron has said. Mr Macron said any such move would be insignificant and merely symbolic. The US, UK, Canada and Australia have said they will not send government representatives to the February games because of concerns over China's human rights record. This includes allegations of abuse against Uyghurs and other minorities. Relations are also strained over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong and concerns about Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, who was not seen for weeks after she accused a top government official of sexual assault. China says countries that boycott the games ""will pay the price for their mistaken acts"". Meanwhile United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he had accepted an invitation to attend the opening of the games. China preps for Winter Olympics as pressure grows Testing times in the Olympic mountains At an extended news conference on Thursday, Mr Macron said the Olympics should not be politicised, and that he preferred actions which had a ""useful effect"". ""To be clear: You either have a complete boycott, and don't send athletes, or you try to change things with useful actions,"" he said. The president added that France would work with the International Olympic Committee on a charter to protect athletes, in a veiled reference to Peng Shuai. ""I don't think we should politicise these topics, especially if it's to take steps that are insignificant and symbolic,"" he said. In a wide-ranging conversation with reporters, Mr Macron also touched on the following: He said he wanted the European Union to focus on defence and border protection, as well as reform of the Schengen agreement on free movement - France takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU in January He said the EU should rethink its budget rules to encourage investment as the world emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic The UK government has failed to keep its word on Brexit, he said, but there has been progress in talks in recent weeks Britain's role in pushing for the Aukus security pact with the US and Australia, which prompted Australia to cancel a submarine contract with France, ""was not the most obvious sign of friendship"" This video can not be played Athletes get ready for the 2022 Winter Olympics near Beijing China says nations will pay for Olympic boycott UK and Canada officials to boycott China Olympics US will pay price for Olympics boycott, China says 'We don't want to punish billion people' Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

People urged to cancel Christmas parties in Scotland,"Public Health Scotland said a number of Omicron Covid outbreaks were linked to parties People in Scotland have been urged to cancel Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases of the Omicron Covid variant. Public Health Scotland said a number of outbreaks caused by Omicron were linked to Christmas parties. Dr Nick Phin, its director of Public Health Science, said postponing plans would help to ""protect ourselves"". The first minister said earlier this week that sheexpected Omicron cases to rise rapidly in Scotland. One case of the new variant was recorded on Thursday, taking the total to 109, according to the latest figures - although the actual number of cases is believed to be much higher. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Scotland had 16 coronavirus deaths and 3,196 new cases in the past 24 hours. The Public Health Scotland (PHS) announcement came after Prime Minister Boris Johnsontold a Downing Street press briefing on Tuesday that: ""We don't want people to cancel such events."" PHS said early evidence suggested that the Omicron variant is much more transmissible that previous strains of the virus. Dr Phin added: ""The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties. ""We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now."" Dr Phin said that to minimise the further spread of the virus, PHS is asking people to ""defer their Christmas parties to another time"". ""I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones,"" he said. UK Hospitality Scotland said the announcement had come ""like a bolt out of the blue"". Executive director Leon Thompson toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""There was no prior notification that Public Health Scotland would be issuing this plea to the public to cancel going out for Christmas. ""This will be setting our members reeling this evening as they will be listening to their phones ringing and seeing all the cancellations coming in by email as we speak."" Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said that Christmas trade was ""a very big deal"" Scotland's finance secretary Kate Forbes said she understood it was a blow for the hospitality sector, but said she could not offer financial help unless Westminster provided more funding. She told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I would like to be in a position to provide additional support for businesses and I've made that clear to them, but with a fixed budget I can't create money overnight. ""We have joined with the Welsh government to speak to the Treasury to see if additional funding could be made available to help businesses through this very challenging period. ""They only get the Christmas trade once a year - they didn't get it last year - it's a very big deal."" What are the rules for wearing masks? Will Scotland hit its January booster jabs target? Less than an hour before the announcement, the Scottish government's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch had told Radio Clyde that people could still hold parties if they ""do it carefully"". He said: ""The present guidance today is to be careful - don't cancel your arrangements but think about testing, think about vaccination and think about following the guidance ""But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy your Christmas."" This is not a legally-enforceable  ban on Christmas parties. The Covid rules have not changed. But the advice carries the weight of Scotland's public health agency. The fear is that the Omicron variant could lead to a surge in new cases followed by a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths. The question is whether many of the people planning big parties will listen to the advice.  During lockdown, police broke up a number of parties being held in contravention of the rules. Today, the number of people in Scotland who have had booster jabs passed the two million milestone. However, more than a fifth of people aged between 18 and 30 remain completely unvaccinated. Will younger people planning a Christmas night out who have not listened to the advice on vaccination listen to advice to call off a party? Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, stressed that the PHS announcement was an appeal, rather than an instruction. She said: ""With many reports of super-spreader events - with Omicron being the cause of a lot of the transmission and linked to Christmas parties - it seems right to issue an appeal. ""It's not telling people not to have their Christmas parties but it's appealing to people's better nature, if you can, do the right thing."" Nicola Sturgeon is expected to give a televised update on Omicron in Scotland on Friday. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What are the current rules?

Rich countries could hoard jabs over Omicron - WHO,"People in many Western countries are being encouraged to get booster jabs The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern that wealthy countries will start to hoard Covid vaccines in response to the rapid spread of the new Omicron variant. It said this could threaten supplies to nations where most people are still unvaccinated. Some rich countries are accelerating the roll-out of a booster shot in response to Omicron. There are concerns that vaccines are less effective against the variant. Recent studies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccineshowed it produced far fewer neutralising antibodies against Omicron than against the original strain, but that this deficit could be reversed by the booster. However, the WHO says administering primary doses should be the priority. WHO vaccine director Kate O'Brien urged richer nations to continue donating vaccine doses and shipments to underserved countries to address what had become a dangerous inequity in access. ""As we head into whatever the Omicron situation is going to be, there is risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccines,"" she said. The WHO says primary doses should be the priority Supplies to the global vaccine-sharing programme Covax have increased in recent months. But world health officials fear a repeat of a shortfall of tens of millions of doses which occurred in the middle of this year, partly as a result of India suspending exports during a surge in cases. Dr O'Brien said it was possible that additional doses might provide added protection against Omicron, but there was as yet little evidence they were needed to protect against severe disease. Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? Do vaccines work against Omicron? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Omicron is the most heavily mutated version of coronavirus found so far. It was first identified in South Africa, where there is now a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times.

Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST UK officials say early signs suggest Omicron could be more transmissible than the current Delta strain. But Omicron's ability to cause severe disease is not yet clear. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, said early evidence suggested Omicron could be more transmissible but less severe. There have been more than 267 million cases of Covid-19 and more than five million deaths around the globe since the pandemic started in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Astroworld: Scott 'was unaware' fans were hurt,"Scott says he now wants to be ""the voice"" of the victims of last month's Astroworld tragedy US rapper Travis Scott has said he did not realise that concertgoers were in trouble during a deadly crowd surge as he performed in Texas last month. ""I stopped a couple of times... at the end of the day you just hear music,"" he told the Breakfast Club radio show in his first interview since the incident. Ten concertgoers were killed after panic broke out at the Astroworld music festival in Houston on 5 November. Multiple lawsuits have since been filed over the tragedy. Among those killed as a result of the crowd surge during Scott's headline set was nine-year-old Ezra Blount. The 30-year-old musician, one of the biggest names in rap music, has been criticised for not ending his show more abruptly. In a YouTube interview published on Thursday,Scott told Breakfast Club presenter Charlamagne Tha God,externalthat he did not hear details about what had happened that night until a press conference after the show. ""At that moment you're like: 'Wait, what?' People pass out, things happen at concerts, but something like that,"" he said. He described how he had paused his show ""to make sure everyone was OK"", but that he did not notice any fans pleading for help or any apparent danger. Asked how he felt about what had happened and how he was coping, Scott said he was still trying to come to terms with it all. ""Nothing like this has ever happened... at the end of the day these fans are your family, so you feel like you've lost something,"" he said, adding that he now wanted to be ""the voice"" of the victims. Astroworld tragedy: Were warning signs missed? Festival survivors recall panic: 'I had to get out of there' Who were the victims? Scott launched Astroworld with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. This video can not be played ""I'm honestly just devastated"" â Travis Scott posted this video on Instagram At the time of the incident, there were about 50,000 people attending the festival at Houston's NRG Park complex. The ages of the victims range between 10 and 27. Scott has offered to pay all funeral costs, but this has been rejected by half of the bereaved families, including the family of Blount. Blount, who lived in Dallas, died nine days after the concert. He had previously been placed in medically induced coma due to the severity of his injuries. In a statement, Scott has asked victims to reach out to him, saying he ""desperately wishes to share his condolences and provide aid"". He has also previously stated in an Instagram video that he was not aware how bad the situation had become during his set. ""Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need,"" he said. ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation."" But some Texas officials say the rapper should have stopped the show much earlier. In an interview with NBC's Today show last month, Houston fire chief Samuel PeÃ±a said: ""At one point there was an ambulance that was trying to make its way through the crowd. The artist has command of that crowd.""

Sun illegally sought my medical records - Miller,"This video can not be played Watch Sienna Miller's statement in full Sienna Miller says the Sun tried to ""profit out of her misery"" as she formally settled a phone hacking claim. Ms Miller's lawyers said in court she believed the newspaper targeted medical records about her 2005 pregnancy, despite its publisher's denials. The actor, 39, has been paid a major financial settlement after taking legal action against News Group Newspapers. Her lawyers told the court the payout is ""tantamount"" to an admission of illegal activity by the Sun. The size of the payout is confidential - but it may be one of the largest settlements by Rupert Murdoch's organisation to victims of phone hacking. In a statement read on Ms Miller's behalf at the High Court, she described how she felt the Sun ""brutally took away her choice"" when it allegedly leaked that she was pregnant. Speaking outside court on Thursday, Ms Miller said the newspaper thought it was ""above the law"". She said the Sun's actions ""shattered me, damaged my reputation - at times beyond repair"", causing her to accuse family and friends of selling information ""in a state of intense paranoia and fear"". Ms Miller is one of the latest high-profile people to receive damages for historical phone hacking by tabloid reporters. The NGN newspaper News of the World was closed down in 2011 after years of phone hacking came to light. Hundreds of celebrities, and members of the public, have since won compensation. The publisher has never admitted liability in relation to alleged phone hacking at the Sun, settling claims on the basis that such activity took place only at the News of the World. Sienna Miller settles phone hacking claim Ronan Keating accepts phone hacking damages Sun's owner reports Â£68m loss as paper sales fall Lawyers for News Group Newspapers (NGN), the Sun's parent company, had argued in court that Ms Miller should not be able to say anything in open court about the newspaper because she had settled without going to trial. But on Wednesday, the High Court judge ruled that she could publicly repeat some of her suspicions, based on evidence in her case, even if they were unproven. NGN denies any unlawful information gathering took place at the Sun and settled the claim with no admission of liability. In the statement read by Ms Miller's lawyer, David Sherborne, the court heard that the actor had been the subject of ""intense media scrutiny and serious intrusion"" from 2003, in particular from the Sun. He said she was ""horrified"" to see court documents which she believed showed senior Sun journalist Nick Parker had claimed expenses and met a ""medical records tracer"" in July and August 2005 to discuss her pregnancy. The statement said Ms Miller also believes the medical records tracer was Christine Hart, who allegedly obtained private medical information and appeared to have issued an invoice for ""Sienns (sic) Miller Pregnant research"". Ms Miller's statement said she was shocked to see that evidence ""appeared to show that the Sun had paid for Ms Hart to unlawfully target her to get information on her pregnancy"". It continued that the actor had a ""firm belief"" - based on call data and disclosures about private investigators and payments - that she was a subject of ""unlawful gathering techniques"" from around 2003. ""NGN's historic public denials and refusal to accept any responsibility has only served to intensify the upset,"" the statement said. It added that Ms Miller believes it was Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the Sun, who first called her representative to say that she knew the actor was pregnant. The former Sun editor's denials, ""including under oath"", that she was involved in or aware of unlawful activity were ""especially aggravating"" to Ms Miller, the statement said. The statement said that even though the settlement included no admission of liability, the fact that the Sun's publishers agreed to pay ""such a substantial sum"" was ""tantamount to an admission of liability on the part of the Sun"". Ms Miller ""feels fully vindicated"", her lawyer said. Outside court, the actor said she wanted to pursue her case to a full trial, but that option was not available to people without ""countless millions"". Ms Miller said she was ""deeply distressed and shocked"" by what she had learned about the actions of journalists and senior managers at the Sun. ""They very nearly ruined my life. I have certainly seen how they have ruined the lives of others,"" she said. Ms Miller, who has a nine-year-old daughter, said she hoped someone would take a legal case against the paper further than she had been able to. She said she would ""unhesitatingly"" participate as a witness. Paul Gascoigne also formally settled a claim on Thursday Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne also formally settled a claim against NGN on Thursday. In a statement, his lawyer told the court he had been the ""victim of unlawful information gathering"" by journalists from the Sun. Solicitor Gerald Shamash said Mr Gascoigne had been ""horrified"" to learn payments were made to a private investigator who is alleged to have got hold of his private medical information. Mr Gascoigne believed the payments were ""made in relation to obtaining private, very personally sensitive matters"", said Mr Shamash. He said the former Newcastle footballer was ""shocked"" to see information from the court's disclosure process allegedly showing the Sun had ""paid to obtain information on his mental health"". He said NGN agreed to pay substantial damages to settle the claim without a trial but have not admitted any liability in relation to the allegations of unlawful information gathering. Both Mr Gascoigne and Ms Miller said they felt ""fully vindicated"" in bringing their claims against NGN.

Councils given freedom to increase tax next year,"Local authorities will be able to increase council tax by as much as they want next year, the Scottish government has announced. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes opted to freeze income tax rates and bands in her budget. But she dropped the longstanding policy of freezing or setting limits on council tax rises. The government said councils should ""take full account of local needs"" and household budgets in their decisions. Opposition parties said councils would be forced to introduce big tax hikes due to a tough budget settlement, but Ms Forbes said the government had protected local government ""as far as we can"". Council elections are due to be held across Scotland next year. Ms Forbes said her tax and spending plans for the coming year - which will pass through Holyrood with the support of the Greens - would also provide funding to tackle child poverty, help businesses recover from the pandemic and help move towards ""net zero"" carbon emissions. Live: Kate Forbes sets out budget plans at Holyrood Scottish budget 2022-23: At a glance The move marks the first time that councillors have been given complete freedom to set local tax rates since the SNP came to power in 2007. The party originally campaigned on a policy of replacing the council tax before entering government at Holyrood, but moved instead to freeze the tax for nine years. Councils were allowed to raise taxes within agreed limits from 2017 onwards, but all authorities returned to the freeze last year after ministers offered them cash in return for not putting up rates. Ms Forbes did not include the detail of the new proposal in her speech at Holyrood, saying only that she would ""increase the fiscal autonomy and power of local government and put more say over how local budgets are raised in local hands"". Howeverdocuments published online,externalunderlined that ""councils will have complete flexibility to set the council tax rate that is appropriate for their local authority area"". The Scottish Conservatives said councillors would be left with ""a horrid choice between failing to deliver essential services or making up the shortfall through eye-watering tax rises"". Kate Forbes said she had offered a fair funding deal to councils Income tax rates have been frozen, although Ms Forbes has made some changes to the thresholds at which people fall into different bands. The thresholds of the starter and basic rates are to rise with inflation, but those for the higher and top rates will be frozen at their current levels in a bid to raise extra funds. Ms Forbes said this would ""maintain spending power in households who need our support eh most, yet also raise crucial revenues for public services from those who can most afford it"". However, the Scottish Fiscal Commission warned that income tax revenues were growing slowly, which could create a funding shortfall of Â£417m by 2026-27. The fiscal watchdog also said the economic outlook had improved since its last forecasts in January, with Scotland's output set to return to pre-pandemic levels by the second half of 2022. Income tax rates have been frozen, but some higher earners will pay more after thresholds were frozen The Â£35bn block grant for revenue spending is larger than at any point pre-pandemic. However, Ms Forbes argued that the overall package of funding available is smaller than in the previous two years, due to Covid-19 support being wound down. The finance secretary said she had faced ""hard choices"" in allocating funds while absorbing the ongoing costs of the pandemic. And she said her proposals would deliver more teachers, more funding for police and record investment in health and social care services. Other measures detailed in the budget include: Â£18bn for health and social care Â£4bn in social security payments, includingÂ£197m to double the Scottish Child Payment A business rates relief package for hospitality, retail and leisure firms worth Â£56m next year A public sector wage floor of Â£10.50 per hour Â£831m for affordable housing projects Almost Â£2bn of investment in decarbonising homes, transport and industry Ms Forbes said: ""This is a transitional budget, as people, businesses and services get back on their feet. It focuses on tackling the climate emergency, reducing inequalities and supporting economic recovery."" MSPs will vote on a budget bill next year, but the plans are already guaranteed to pass with the Scottish Greens having joined the SNP in government. Ms Forbes said the parties had worked closely on the plans, and Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said they would help ""accelerate a just transition to a net-zero economy and lay the foundations for a green economic recovery"". The budget plans include more money for health and social care However, opposition parties said the proposals did not do enough to protect Scottish workers and jobs. The Scottish Conservatives - who had called for more extensive tax reliefs for businesses - said firms had been ""left in the lurch"". Finance spokeswoman Liz Smith said: ""This budget has mostly been the same old story from a tired government that is increasingly out of ideas."" Meanwhile Labour's Daniel Johnson said the ""disappointing"" budget was not ambitious enough and represented a ""managed decline"". He said that throughout the budget process his party would ""tirelessly fight for a fair and ambitious recovery for our economy, our public services, and the people of Scotland"". And Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government had ""put councils in an armlock"", adding: ""It's clear that Kate Forbes wants councillors to take the blame for the decisions she has taken.""

PM's press chief spoke at No 10 party last year,"The PM's press chief addressed staff and gave out awards at a Downing Street party last Christmas that is now under investigation, it is understood. Jack Doyle, then deputy communications director, gave a speech to between 20 and 30 people at the 18 December event. A source has told the BBC there were food, drinks and games at the event. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was ""not fit for office"" and it was important to ""get to the bottom of this"". But Downing Street said: ""There is an ongoing review, and we won't be commenting further while that is the case."" This 18 December event is one of three government staff gatherings from last year now being investigated by the UK's top civil servant, Simon Case, for possible breaches of Covid rules. The others are a No 10 staff event on 27 November last year and a gathering at the Department of Education event on 10 December. The inquiry could be widened out if it considered there are credible allegations about other events. Which parties are being investigated? What were the rules on Christmas parties? Education department chief admits December party Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she did not hold a Christmas party last year, when she was international trade secretary, as she had been too ""busy"". ""We had a lot of deals to get done by 31 December, so that was my focus,"" she told the BBC'sPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinsonpodcast. The revelation of Mr Doyle's speech at the Downing Street gathering follows an arduous few days for the government, during which time it has been accused by Labour of not being honest over this and other events. ITV News, whichfirst reported,externalthat Mr Doyle had been present at the 18 December party, said he had also handed out award certificates to staff. The event took place two days after London went into Tier 3 lockdown restrictions, meaning people were told not to mix indoors with anyone outside their household or support bubble. No 10 has refused to explain how the party complied with the restrictions. The former Daily Mail political reporter became the prime minister's press secretary in 2020 He was promoted to Downing Street director of communications in April this year He is not the PM's official spokesman - but is in charge of how the government gets its message across to the media It is the role held by Alastair Campbell, when Labour was in power Mr Doyle earns between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999 a year On Wednesday, the prime minister told the Commons he had been ""repeatedly assured"" that there had been no party and that no Covid rules had been broken on that date. The government's chief whip Mark Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham that Mr Johnson ""will not have lied"" about any parties that took place on Downing Street last year. He added that the 18 December event had been a ""meeting"" rather than a social get-together, and that staff had discussed how to deal with coronavirus. But Sir Keir, speaking during a visit to Northumberland, said: ""It's absolutely important that we get to the bottom of this. ""This is just the latest allegation of dishonesty from the prime minister. We've had lie upon lie in relation to the parties going on in Downing Street. The prime minister is not fit for office."" This video can not be played Newscastâs take on the No 10 Christmas party fallout Government adviser Allegra Strattonquit her post on Wednesday after a backlash over a video she appeared in from last December, in which she joked about a Christmas party. Before her resignation, Mr Johnson told MPs that he was ""furious"" about the clip, obtained by ITV News, and was launching an investigation into whether Covid rules had been broken. Sources in Westminster are questioning whether it's possible for Jack Doyle to stay in his job. In part that's because one of the problems this week for No 10 has been their efforts to deny and explain what did or didn't happen. Ministers, and the prime minister himself, have been stuck in the Kafka-esque position of saying that they are sure no rules were broken, but they also don't know what went on. If they don't know what happened, how can they be sure that nothing went wrong? And if multiple sources have said there was a gathering of several dozen people, and people who were not on the Downing Street payroll had been invited, how can that have been just a few work drinks at the desk in a Covid-secure office? Read Laura's blog in full Meanwhile, Lord Geidt, the prime minister's standards adviser, is unhappy about the contents of an Electoral Commission report into the funding of refurbishments to the Downing Street flat but is not ready to resign over it, the BBC understands. Labour says the report shows Mr Johnson lied to Lord Geidt when he investigated the PM's conduct earlier this year, something denied by Downing Street. Labour has written to Lord Geidt, asking him to reinvestigate. Mr Johnson is also facing a rebellion from Conservative MPs over his plans announced on Wednesday to introducetighter Covid curbs in Englandto tackle the Omicron variant. Dozens of Tories have hit out at extra restrictions ahead of a vote next week, particularly the plans for mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs and large events. Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said the mood in the Conservative Party was ""sulphurous"", adding: ""What we need now is a bit of grip from No 10."" Business minister Paul Scully told BBC Breakfast it had been a ""difficult week for the government"" and that it had not ""been able to get across"" policies it had announced to deal with Covid and the economy.

Does Wales have its own Covid Plan B?,"Wales' beauty spots were closed to tourists in March 2020 when the pandemic hit Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that England will be heading into what's become known as the ""Plan B"" set of restrictions. Its in response to the emergence of Omicron, with officials increasingly concerned at the variant's transmissibility and pressure it could put on the NHS. In Wales, the devolved government has a set of regulations that look very much like Mr Johnson's announcement for England. People are already asked to work from home, and Covid passes are required in more venues than in England. Mask wearing has remained mandatory in many indoor public places, barring pubs and restaurants. Yet case rates have remained high - with seven day rates not fallen below 470 per 100,000 for months. Boosters are being rolled out to more people, but should officials want to slow the spread while more arms are being jabbed, there is a plan they could implement. It involves a return to the restrictions on our social lives and on businesses that were axed in summer. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Ministers, before Omicron, were at pains to stress they did not think a lockdown would be necessary again. Now, the picture is unclear. Welsh ministers have never ruled out needing to return to restrictions on businesses and our social lives, but have played down the chance of a new lockdown in the past. But ministers in Cardiff face potentially difficult choices if the decisions they want to take are different to those being considered in London, and the money to support Welsh restrictions does not emerge. Wales, in common with the rest of the UK, currently has no restrictions on social contact and all businesses are allowed to open. Butmask wearing is the law in indoor public spaces, including shops, public transport, hospitals and social care settings. The exception is in pubs, restaurants and nightclubs. The UK government had scrapped mask rules in England during the summer, but re-introduced them after Omicron emerged. People in Wales are also legally required toobtain a NHS Covid passif they are going to large events, a nightclub or a venue that's similar to a nightclub. The law goes further than the requirement in England, with passes also now needed to go to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. The pass needs to show if an individual has had a recent negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours, or two vaccinations. And it is not a legal restriction, but individuals are advised to work from home if they can. While there are no plans, the picture has become uncertain. Ministers had hoped expanding the NHS Covid pass system would avoid the need to take more drastic action. But in recent days Welsh ministers have not been able to say what restrictions will be in place during the festive period. They have instead emphasised people should take precautions - like taking a lateral flow test before meeting relatives. What is Plan B for Covid in England this winter? Why are UK Covid cases so high? First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously said he has no plans to shut businesses. But he had also written a letter to the prime minister asking for financial support if he needed to implement ""more interventionist measures"". He said the point of the letter was to make it clear to the UK government it they ""can't do what they did last year"", referring to a row when the Welsh government decided to go into a firebreak lockdown in October 2020 but furloughwas not extended in response. Under the latest Covid control plan,external, Wales is currently classed as being ""Covid Stable"", where there are very few restrictions. But the Welsh government could move to ""Covid Urgent"", drawn up if new and unexpected Covid pressures emerge - like a new variant that does not respond to vaccines, or if there is unsustainable pressure on the NHS. In that scenario, the Welsh government plans to return to the alert level lists of restrictions it had in place last year - stretching from restrictions on socialising to a Welsh lockdown. Ministers have given no clues what alert level they may choose in response to Omicron, or even if they will move to Covid urgent. The lightest set of restrictions, classed asalert level one,external, would see the rule of six on social contact indoors, and nightclubs closed. At alert level two,external, meetings with people outside your extended household in a private home would be effectively banned, and ice rinks shut. In alert level three,external, more venues would be forced to close, and pubs and restaurants would only be able to serve outside, and outdoor gatherings limited to six. Finally,alert level four,externalwould reintroduce a stay-at-home lockdown like that seen in January. But the rules are not set in stone. Laws on coronavirus in Wales have changed rapidly as the pandemic and they could be changed again. The Alpha variant contributed to large Covid wave at the end of last year, overwhelming hospital services. Wales was badly hit. Cinemas and other indoor entertainment venues were closed at the start of December, and alcohol was banned from sale in pubs, restaurants and cafes. But the situation saw Labour ministers go further. The country went into lockdown on 23 December, and plans to allow social contact indoors over the Christmas break were limited to just Christmas Day. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has no plans to reintroduce furlough Moving to Covid Urgent, combined with a ramping up of restrictions on businesses, poses real dilemmas for a devolved government that cannot summon large pots of cash. A long Welsh lockdown without the help the Welsh government has asked for from the UK government could leave thousands out of work and facing significant financial hardship. While the individual UK nations have pursued sometimes different lockdown policies, they did it with financial firepower from Westminster in the background - including the furlough scheme. Furlough ended on 30 Septemberand as things stand there are no plans to bring it back. Should a situation develop where pressure on the NHS in Wales was acute, but furlough did not return, the stakes in a Wales-only lockdown where businesses shut would be high for Mark Drakeford. But if the situation is bad in Wales, it may be the same in England, where Boris Johnson's government will face similar pressures.

Rich countries could hoard jabs over Omicron - WHOThere are concerns that booster rollouts in wealthy nations could threaten supply to poorer countries.World,"People in many Western countries are being encouraged to get booster jabs The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern that wealthy countries will start to hoard Covid vaccines in response to the rapid spread of the new Omicron variant. It said this could threaten supplies to nations where most people are still unvaccinated. Some rich countries are accelerating the roll-out of a booster shot in response to Omicron. There are concerns that vaccines are less effective against the variant. Recent studies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccineshowed it produced far fewer neutralising antibodies against Omicron than against the original strain, but that this deficit could be reversed by the booster. However, the WHO says administering primary doses should be the priority. WHO vaccine director Kate O'Brien urged richer nations to continue donating vaccine doses and shipments to underserved countries to address what had become a dangerous inequity in access. ""As we head into whatever the Omicron situation is going to be, there is risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccines,"" she said. The WHO says primary doses should be the priority Supplies to the global vaccine-sharing programme Covax have increased in recent months. But world health officials fear a repeat of a shortfall of tens of millions of doses which occurred in the middle of this year, partly as a result of India suspending exports during a surge in cases. Dr O'Brien said it was possible that additional doses might provide added protection against Omicron, but there was as yet little evidence they were needed to protect against severe disease. Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? Do vaccines work against Omicron? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Omicron is the most heavily mutated version of coronavirus found so far. It was first identified in South Africa, where there is now a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times. Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST UK officials say early signs suggest Omicron could be more transmissible than the current Delta strain. But Omicron's ability to cause severe disease is not yet clear. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, said early evidence suggested Omicron could be more transmissible but less severe.

Ms Forbes confirmed that income tax rates will remain unchanged next year although the higher and top rate thresholds will be frozen.. The government has also said that the council tax freeze will end, with local authorities being given ""full flexibility"" in setting rates. Other spending plans focus on business recovery from Covid, alongside the transition to ""net zero"" carbon emissions and tackling child poverty. The Scottish economy is now predicted to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the summer - two years earlier than previously forecast. The plans are effectively guaranteed to pass through Holyrood, with the SNP and their Green partners holding a majority of seats. Opposition parties say the proposals do not go far enough towards helping the country recover from the pandemic It comes after Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross used FMQs to accuse the Scottish government of showing contempt for people employed in the North Sea oil and gas industry. Mr Ross highlighted comments by Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie - a government minister - who said it was now only the ""hard right"" who back the industry. The first minister responded by saying she supports a ""just transition"" from fossil fuels to renewable and low carbon energy. The session comes amid concern about rising numbers of Omicron variant Covid cases. BBC Scotland News  That's it for our live page coverage of the Scottish budget. Thanks for joining us. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The questioner is particularly keen to know how it would affect plans for East Kilbride and the planned extension of the line to Levenmouth in Fife. This is what it says in the budget document: ""The budget provides almost
Â£1.4bn to maintain, improve and decarbonise Scotlandâs rail network,
including Â£247m on major project enhancements which includes decarbonisation of the Barrhead corridor, East Kilbride corridor, Fife and
Borders electrification."" So
no mention of a line extension for Levenmouth. The planning process is just
one of the reasons that may have to wait for a future yearâs budget. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor There is good news in the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC)
report, but also a tight squeeze on expectations of increased spending. The good news is of 10.4% forecast Scottish economic growth
for 2021-22.  That will take the economy back to the pre-pandemic level of
output by the second quarter of next year - two years earlier than forecast in
January. Unemployment will go up, according to the forecast, but to
a much lower peak than previously expected, of 4.9%. However, the prospects for the total budget at Holyrood are
very tight. In real terms, the budget falls in real terms, by 1% per
year, then rising by the time of the next Holyrood election by only 1%. Given the expectations set in the election campaign last
May, and the pressures to find more funds for health and social care, that is
an extremely tough outlook. It gets much tougher when the promises on welfare are taken
into account.  The SFC says commitments are rising by Â£750m per year, half
of that to meet the cost of the higher Scottish Child Payment. So while commitments and expectations rise steeply, income
tax revenue goes down and the total budget effectively stands still. And this is what is set aside for fightingclimate change: This is what the budget promised forthe economy:  Closing the attainment gap and lifting people out of poverty was another theme. Here is what the Scottish government has funded forequality:  The key anti-poverty measure is the doubling of the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 a week, from April 2022. The minimum wage will rise to Â£10.50 an hour for social care staff. Public sector workers on low pay will get inflationary increases of at least Â£775 for those earning less than Â£25,000, Â£700 for people on Â£25,000 to Â£40,000, and Â£500 to those earning above Â£40,000. The council tax freeze that has been in place since 2007 will end next year. Ms Forbes also announced:  Kate Forbes has set out her budget for 2022-23. She promised a Scottish Budget ""for climate, recovery and equality"". Here's what she offered forbusiness:   Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor There are big commitments in Kate Forbes' budget, stemming
from the election campaign and from the partnership with Green MSPs. But at least as significant are the numbers published by
the Scottish Fiscal Commission. The independent body provides the forecasts for
economic growth and tax revenue, on which Ms Forbes makes her calculations. Income tax revenue is looking weak. Higher tax rates in
Scotland ought to mean higher tax revenue. But because the tax base is rising
at a slower rate than the rest of the UK, the block grant from Westminster is
adjusted to take account of that. Next year, the SFC forecasts a net gap of Â£190m. Thereâs a
tiny surplus forecast for the year after and then some big net gaps again,
rising to Â£417m in 2026-27. This is the risk and the opportunity facing the Scottish
government since it took control of most aspects of income tax. If the income tax base grows faster, the Scottish
government gets the benefit of higher tax receipts than it would otherwise have
had.  If that base grows more slowly, then MSPs have less money than the
Treasury would have given them without fiscal devolution. As things now look to the Fiscal Commission, there will be
a lot less money available. Question from Jade Yes - and it's the lowest-paid public sector staff who should see the biggest difference in their wage slips. Kate Forbes outlined plans to guarantee at least an additional Â£775 for people who earn up to Â£25,000. Those earning between Â£25,000 and Â£40,000 will get an extra Â£700, and an additional Â£500 will go to those earning more than Â£40,000. The finance secretary said she recognised the challenges of inflation and rising living costs, and the ""huge effort"" the public sector has made in responding to the pandemic. She also announced a minimum wage of Â£10.50 for all bodies covered by the government's public sector pay policy, including social care workers. Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton asks about the ""oversight"" of 100,000 sufferers of Long Covid in the budget plans. Ms Forbes says that a Â£10m support fund and a care plan has been published and says Long Covid will be covered in the NHS funding announcement. She says she has allocated ""every penny"" in the budget.  The finance secretary responds by accusing Labour of ""parroting the Tory line"". She says focusing on the increased grant from Westminster fails to recognise that the Scottish government must ""absorb all the Covid costs"" within its budget Ms Forbes says Labour's demands for extra spending would have cost an extra Â£3bn - which, if services were not to be cut, would require big tax rises. She defends the planned pay rate of Â£10.50 an hour for carers - which is ""significantly higher"" than the national living wage - and higher than the rate called for by UK Labour for carers in England. Daniel Johnson, for Scottish Labour, says the budget does not contain the ""bold action"" needed to move beyond the Covid crisis. The child payment should be increased to Â£40 by April 2023, he argues. He also says care workers deserve a ""fair increase"" to Â£15 an hour, not the ""meagre, barely 50p increase"" that is planned, saying this is vital to boost recruitment. Mr Johnson says the phased return of business rates will not prevent many businesses going to the wall - and just resets the ""cliff edge"" into the summer. Schools should be fitted with ventilation systems to make them safer and ensure schooling can continue despite Covid uncertainties, he adds. Mr Johnson says the increase in the block grant from Westminster should have allowed the Scottish government to go much further. The cabinet secretary has choices - to use these funds, to be bold, to deliver recovery - or to continue SNP managed decline."" Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour The Scottish government has now published thefull budget document,external- which says that local authorities are to be given full flexibility over council tax rates for the first time since the SNP came to power in 2007. The document says that councils will have ""complete flexibility to set the Council Tax rate that is appropriate for their local authority area"". And it says it expects councils to take ""full account of local needs and of the impacts on household budgets of the decisions they make"". Ms Forbes hits back at the Tory MSP, saying that if the Scottish Conservatives want to deliver all the things they have set out, they should tell the parliament what they will cut and where the funding will come from. She says that if health and social care funding, business help and Covid costs have to be absorbed by the Scottish Budget, then there have to be ""stark choices"". Liz Smith responds for the Scottish Conservatives. She is ""astonished"" Kate Forbes has not acknowledged ""record block grant funding"" from Chancellor Rishi Sunak. While welcoming the doubling of the child payment, she says her party wanted to see support for public services and for economic recovery from Covid. Ms Smith would have liked to see 75% business rate relief and asked why there was no commitment to structural reforms and investment in skills in the digital infrastructure. On the block grant, Ms Forbes says next year's budget is indeed a reduction on this year's budget because the Tories ""have wished Covid away"". She says that there is a far bigger cushion on rates for business in Scotland than there is in England. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent Most of the cash goes on health, which usually accounts for more than 40% of the overall spend. Nicola Sturgeon has promised to increase investment by 20% over the parliamentary term - and a ""significant down payment on that commitment"" was promised. Social care also sucks up a fair chunk of the budget, even before the new National Care Service is set up. And thedoubling of the Scottish Child Paymentis forecast to cost Â£90m next year, then more than Â£300m per year when fully rolled out. Local government takes about a quarter of the cash while delivering many core services from schools to bin collections. Education, transport and justice also take up hefty chunks of spending. Public sector workers on low pay are to get help in the next financial year. The Scottish government will guarantee inflationary increases of at least Â£775 for those earning less than Â£25,000, Â£700 for people on Â£25,000 to Â£40,000, and Â£500 to those
earning above Â£40,000. Social care workers will see their hourly rate rise from a minimum of Â£10.02 per hour to Â£10.50 per hour across all bodies covered by
the pay policy. There will also be targeted support for lowest-paid staff across the public sector.  Ms Forbes concludes her statement by returning to her opening theme - that it is a budget of choices. She says it has delivered on promises on health, social care, helping low income families as well as supporting businesses and workers - but it is also a budget for a net zero future. Todayâs Budget is a Budget of choices, and we have chosen to tackle child poverty, to invest in the transition and to boost economic prosperity. Kate Forbes, Finance Secretary Ms Forbes says the hosting of COP26 showcased what was already being done in Scotland on climate change. She says the budget sets out almost Â£2bn of low-carbon capital investment in infrastructure - decarbonising homes, buildings, transport and industry. This includes the first Â£20m of the 10-year Just Transition Fund, to help the north east and Moray transition from carbon based industries  This government â working in partnership day in, day out with the Scottish Greens â is absolutely committed to meeting our statutory climate change targets and delivering the net zero society we not only want, but need, to see.""

Longannet power station chimney blown up,"This video can not be played The 600 foot high chimney stack at Longannet power station in Fife was brought down by controlled explosion The 600ft chimney at the former Longannet power station has been demolished in an explosion. The Fife site produced Scotland's last coal-fired energy until it ceased operation in 2016. The chimney was the largest free-standing structure in Scotland and was a local landmark for generations. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pushed the button to ignite 700kg of explosives, bringing down the chimney stack. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Today's event is a symbolic reminder that we have ended coal-fired power generation in Scotland, as we work in a fair and just way towards becoming a net-zero nation by 2045. Moving on from a power station's dirty past Longannet switch-off ends coal power ""Our goal is to generate 50% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030, and Scotland's energy sector is well placed to deliver on the key investments in renewables, hydrogen and energy storage required to achieve this. ""Growth in these sectors over the next decade will be transformative for Scotland, delivering further good, green jobs, strengthened energy security, and benefits for local communities as we decarbonise industry and society to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, in a way that leaves no-one behind."" Owner Scottish Power had projected the environmental slogan ""Make Coal History"" onto the chimney at night ahead of the demolition. Longannet was once the largest coal-fired power station in Europe. Its buildings have been removed in a series of controlled explosions in the years since it closed. As well as the environmental slogan, multi-coloured ""global warming stripes"", created by Professor Ed Hawkins of Reading University, were also projected onto the chimney. Scottish Power said the stripes showed the change in global temperature from 1850 to 2020, with shades of blue showing cooler-than-average years, and red showing years that were hotter-than-average. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said: ""At Cop26 in Glasgow, we were proud to show the world that Scotland has already made coal history. ""As a 100% energy company, we are committed to helping the UK end its reliance on fossil fuels. ""For half a century, Longannet's chimney has dominated the Firth of Forth skyline. We bade farewell to that landmark today - however this is a landmark day for Scotland too. ""Watching the chimney of Scotland's last coal-fired station fall today represents a real milestone, as the UK moves away from the large polluting power stations of the past and accelerates down the road to net-zero emissions."" The demolition marks an important moment in Scotland's energy transition but it's only a symbolic one. That's because it's more than five years since coal was last burnt to generate our domestic electricity. But symbolism is important since a few short miles away politicians spent two weeks in November trying to convince other countries to do the same. So, why have we been able to do it now when countries like India and China are struggling? Investment is one thing but another major reason is transition fuels like North Sea gas and nuclear. But in 2019 we generated 97% of our net electricity demand from renewables with huge amounts of offshore wind in the planning stages. For us the revolution is already happening but the hope now is that the rest of the developing word skips that middle step and switches straight to renewables. Multi-coloured ""global warming stripes"" have been projected onto the chimney at night. Longannet began generation in 1970 and Scottish Power said it was the largest coal-fired power station in Europe when first built, remaining the largest in Scotland until it closed on 31 March 2016. At the height of operations, it burned coal from around the world including from as far away as Russia and Colombia, as well as from Scottish open-cast mines. Typically, it consumed four million tonnes of coal per year and at full production could make enough electricity to power two million homes. The demolition of Longannet is being carried out by Scottish Power contractor Brown and Mason and work to remove materials at the site will continue into 2022. Scottish Power projected the environmental slogan ""Make Coal History"" onto the 600ft structure ahead of its demolition Ignacio Galan, chairman of Scottish Power and Iberdrola, said: ""Longannet played an important role in Scotland's history as its largest coal station, but the future can only be about clean energy. ""Everyone working at Scottish Power and the wider Iberdrola Group should be proud to be contributing to this impressive transition from fossil fuels to renewables.""

Millionaire murder accused 'couldn't stop' attack,"Sir Richard Sutton's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List A man accused of murdering one of the UK's richest men and attempting to murder his mother told a court he went ""completely crazy"" during the attack. Sir Richard Sutton, 83, was stabbed to death in April at his home near Gillingham, Dorset, and his partner Anne Schreiber was seriously injured. Thomas Schreiber 35, denies murder and attempted murder. He told Winchester Crown Court that he ""saw the knife and heard a voice in my head shouting 'attack, attack'"". Schreiber, who has admitted manslaughter, recounted the events leading up to the killing on 7 April at Moorhill, the house he shared with his mother and Sir Richard. It was the anniversary of his father's death, and he had planned to have a toast with the two of them to commemorate it, he told the court. He said he was ""sat very peacefully"" with Sir Richard in his office when his mother returned home, following a visit to her late husband's grave. Schreiber said: ""Mum came in and took one look at me and said 'you're drunk, just like your father'. I shouted: 'I'm not drunk.' ""She stormed off, I stormed off after her and punched her in the arm or the back."" Thomas Schreiber (left) was given an allowance by Sir Richard of Â£1,000 a month, the court has been told He told the jury he was ""extra sensitive"" when it came to the topic of his father, and he had been confronted by his mother in an ""angry way"". As he followed her into the kitchen he said he noticed a knife on the kitchen island. ""I picked up the knife and started stabbing my mum, and Richard came in and I think he tried to stop me and I started stabbing him, and I just couldn't stop attacking my mum and Richard."" He added, becoming tearful: ""My mum at one point shouted: 'Will you stop? Will you stop?' And I couldn't stop. ""And I started stabbing Richard and just going absolutely crazy and stabbing him and mum, and him and mum, and going between both of them."" Schreiber said during the attack he ""wasn't thinking, I couldn't physically control myself"". He said afterwards he sat on a sofa ""in complete horror, in complete shock"". He later left the house in Sir Richard's Range Rover, with a suitcase that had already been packed for a cancelled holiday. He left Whatsapp voice notes to friends, ex-girlfriends and family members saying goodbye, and attempted to stab himself in the heart and slit his wrists as police arrested him. Under cross-examination Schreiber admitted he was ""quite tipsy"" at the time of the attack, but denied being drunk. A toxicology report stated he was three times the legal limit to drive. The court heard that after the initial attack, Schreiber followed Sir Richard upstairs and continued stabbing him, leaving a trail of bloody footprints. Schreiber said he had no memory of this part of the killing. Adam Feest QC, prosecuting, put it to him that his version of events was a ""complete lie"". He said: ""You keep saying you lost control. Would it be more accurate to say you let your anger get the better of you?"" Schreiber replied: ""No, because I wasn't in control. I've been angry before and I've had control."" But Mr Feest QC pointed out one of the messages Schreiber had sent to a friend. In it he said: ""I've let my anger get the better of me and I've killed my mother and I've killed her partner... I had to take action."" Schreiber told the court that ""wasn't a proper reflection of what happened"". Mr Feest asked him if he attacked Sir Richard out of hatred. Schreiber said: ""That wasn't hatred. That was madness. That was more than anger. That was insanity. ""I've got a lot of flaws but I'm not a monster like that. On that day, at that time, I was a monster."" Earlier in the day, the jury was shown internet searches that Schreiber had made leading up to the killing. They included topics about attention deficit disorder and cognitive behavioural therapy, but also ""how to fight dark reoccurring thoughts"", ""12 clues a relationship with a parent is toxic"", and ""revenge on gold digging mother"". ""I was looking for answers on how to cope,"" he told the court. Sir Richard was listed at number 435 in the Sunday Times Rich List last year, with an estimated family fortune of Â£301m - a rise of Â£83m on the previous year. The trial continues.

Rich countries could hoard jabs over Omicron - WHOThere are concerns that booster rollouts in wealthy nations could threaten supply to poorer countries.,"People in many Western countries are being encouraged to get booster jabs The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern that wealthy countries will start to hoard Covid vaccines in response to the rapid spread of the new Omicron variant. It said this could threaten supplies to nations where most people are still unvaccinated. Some rich countries are accelerating the roll-out of a booster shot in response to Omicron. There are concerns that vaccines are less effective against the variant. Recent studies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccineshowed it produced far fewer neutralising antibodies against Omicron than against the original strain, but that this deficit could be reversed by the booster. However, the WHO says administering primary doses should be the priority. WHO vaccine director Kate O'Brien urged richer nations to continue donating vaccine doses and shipments to underserved countries to address what had become a dangerous inequity in access. ""As we head into whatever the Omicron situation is going to be, there is risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccines,"" she said. The WHO says primary doses should be the priority Supplies to the global vaccine-sharing programme Covax have increased in recent months. But world health officials fear a repeat of a shortfall of tens of millions of doses which occurred in the middle of this year, partly as a result of India suspending exports during a surge in cases. Dr O'Brien said it was possible that additional doses might provide added protection against Omicron, but there was as yet little evidence they were needed to protect against severe disease. Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? Do vaccines work against Omicron? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Omicron is the most heavily mutated version of coronavirus found so far. It was first identified in South Africa, where there is now a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times. Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST UK officials say early signs suggest Omicron could be more transmissible than the current Delta strain. But Omicron's ability to cause severe disease is not yet clear. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, said early evidence suggested Omicron could be more transmissible but less severe. There have been more than 267 million cases of Covid-19 and more than five million deaths around the globe since the pandemic started in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

"Woman fined â¬1,200 for Tour de France pile-upThe woman's cardboard sign brought down dozens of cyclists during a stage of the elite race in June.","The woman's cardboard sign caused one of the worst crashes in Tour de France history A French woman has been fined â¬1,200 ($1,357; Â£1,028) for causing a huge crash at the Tour de France by waving a cardboard sign in the riders' path. The peloton was 45km (28 miles) from the end of the first stage, when her sign clipped German rider Tony Martin. He fell to the ground and caused dozens of other riders to follow suit, in one of the tournament's worst ever crashes. The woman, 31, was also ordered to pay a symbolic one euro fine to France's professional cyclist association. The identity of the woman, who was a spectator at the elite race, was withheld after she was targeted by a torrent of online abuse, the AFP news agency reported. Video footage of the incident, which took place in June, has been shared widely online. The woman can be seen holding a sign with the German names for ""granny and granddad"". She is looking away from the peloton coming towards her and does not see them approach, while holding her sign too far into the road. As a result of the crash, two riders had to pull out of the Tour completely and another eight riders were treated for injuries. Allow Twitter content?

'Get checked' says Mark Wright after lump removal,"Mark Wright said he was speaking out to encourage others to take action Mark Wright has urged people to ""check yourself"" after having a tumour removed from his armpit. The presenter and former reality TV star said he had an operation to remove the 12cm tumour on Wednesday. Writing on Instagram, he said he wanted to speak openly about the issue to encourage others to take action. ""Nothing in life is more important than your health. Get checked, check yourself and make sure you take good care of yourself,"" he wrote. 'The lump on my jaw was cancer' Tom Parker: 'Brain cancer treatment must improve' Tom Parker says tumour has 'shrunk significantly' The former The Only Way Is Essex star, 34, also shared a series of photos showing himself in the operating theatre and the tumour itself after being removed.

He said it had been a ""tough call"" when speaking publicly about it, but that it was the right thing to do as it could ""potentially save one person"". Mark described finding a lump in his breast and armpit area which was ""not very big but enough to cause concern and to be cautious"" to get it checked. Most lumps are harmless but it's important to see a GP if you're worried or the lump is still there after two weeks. You should see a doctor if: Your lump gets bigger, is painful, red or hot Your lump is hard and does not move Your lump lasts more than two weeks A lump grows back after it's been removed You have a lump in the breast or testicles You have a swelling on the side of your neck, armpit or groin that does not go down Source: NHS,external Initially, Wright said he saw a doctor who ruled out anything serious. ""After some time the lump grew and began to bother me. I am someone that when it comes to life in general, I leave no stone unturned."" He then asked for a second opinion, and after a series of consultations he was in theatre ""having this little git removed"". The ""fast and incredible"" turnaround was to prevent it from becoming potentially more serious, but he said there was no confirmation that the tumour was harmless and it is being sent off for further testing.

LiveLiveScottish council tax freeze to end next year10 minutes ago,"Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has outlined the Scottish government's budget plans for the coming year. Ms Forbes confirmed that income tax rates will remain unchanged next year although the higher and top rate thresholds will be frozen.. The government has also said that the council tax freeze will end, with local authorities being given ""full flexibility"" in setting rates. Other spending plans focus on business recovery from Covid, alongside the transition to ""net zero"" carbon emissions and tackling child poverty. The Scottish economy is now predicted to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the summer - two years earlier than previously forecast. The plans are effectively guaranteed to pass through Holyrood, with the SNP and their Green partners holding a majority of seats. Opposition parties say the proposals do not go far enough towards helping the country recover from the pandemic It comes after Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross used FMQs to accuse the Scottish government of showing contempt for people employed in the North Sea oil and gas industry. Mr Ross highlighted comments by Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie - a government minister - who said it was now only the ""hard right"" who back the industry. The first minister responded by saying she supports a ""just transition"" from fossil fuels to renewable and low carbon energy. The session comes amid concern about rising numbers of Omicron variant Covid cases. BBC Scotland News  That's it for our live page coverage of the Scottish budget. Thanks for joining us. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The questioner is particularly keen to know how it would affect plans for East Kilbride and the planned extension of the line to Levenmouth in Fife. This is what it says in the budget document: ""The budget provides almost
Â£1.4bn to maintain, improve and decarbonise Scotlandâs rail network,
including Â£247m on major project enhancements which includes decarbonisation of the Barrhead corridor, East Kilbride corridor, Fife and
Borders electrification."" So
no mention of a line extension for Levenmouth. The planning process is just
one of the reasons that may have to wait for a future yearâs budget. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor There is good news in the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC)
report, but also a tight squeeze on expectations of increased spending. The good news is of 10.4% forecast Scottish economic growth
for 2021-22.  That will take the economy back to the pre-pandemic level of
output by the second quarter of next year - two years earlier than forecast in
January. Unemployment will go up, according to the forecast, but to
a much lower peak than previously expected, of 4.9%. However, the prospects for the total budget at Holyrood are
very tight. In real terms, the budget falls in real terms, by 1% per
year, then rising by the time of the next Holyrood election by only 1%. Given the expectations set in the election campaign last
May, and the pressures to find more funds for health and social care, that is
an extremely tough outlook. It gets much tougher when the promises on welfare are taken
into account.  The SFC says commitments are rising by Â£750m per year, half
of that to meet the cost of the higher Scottish Child Payment. So while commitments and expectations rise steeply, income
tax revenue goes down and the total budget effectively stands still. And this is what is set aside for fightingclimate change: This is what the budget promised forthe economy:  Closing the attainment gap and lifting people out of poverty was another theme. Here is what the Scottish government has funded forequality:  The key anti-poverty measure is the doubling of the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 a week, from April 2022. The minimum wage will rise to Â£10.50 an hour for social care staff. Public sector workers on low pay will get inflationary increases of at least Â£775 for those earning less than Â£25,000, Â£700 for people on Â£25,000 to Â£40,000, and Â£500 to those earning above Â£40,000. The council tax freeze that has been in place since 2007 will end next year. Ms Forbes also announced:  Kate Forbes has set out her budget for 2022-23. She promised a Scottish Budget ""for climate, recovery and equality"". Here's what she offered forbusiness:   Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor There are big commitments in Kate Forbes' budget, stemming
from the election campaign and from the partnership with Green MSPs. But at least as significant are the numbers published by
the Scottish Fiscal Commission. The independent body provides the forecasts for
economic growth and tax revenue, on which Ms Forbes makes her calculations. Income tax revenue is looking weak. Higher tax rates in
Scotland ought to mean higher tax revenue. But because the tax base is rising
at a slower rate than the rest of the UK, the block grant from Westminster is
adjusted to take account of that. Next year, the SFC forecasts a net gap of Â£190m. Thereâs a
tiny surplus forecast for the year after and then some big net gaps again,
rising to Â£417m in 2026-27. This is the risk and the opportunity facing the Scottish
government since it took control of most aspects of income tax. If the income tax base grows faster, the Scottish
government gets the benefit of higher tax receipts than it would otherwise have
had.  If that base grows more slowly, then MSPs have less money than the
Treasury would have given them without fiscal devolution. As things now look to the Fiscal Commission, there will be
a lot less money available. Question from Jade Yes - and it's the lowest-paid public sector staff who should see the biggest difference in their wage slips. Kate Forbes outlined plans to guarantee at least an additional Â£775 for people who earn up to Â£25,000. Those earning between Â£25,000 and Â£40,000 will get an extra Â£700, and an additional Â£500 will go to those earning more than Â£40,000. The finance secretary said she recognised the challenges of inflation and rising living costs, and the ""huge effort"" the public sector has made in responding to the pandemic. She also announced a minimum wage of Â£10.50 for all bodies covered by the government's public sector pay policy, including social care workers. Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton asks about the ""oversight"" of 100,000 sufferers of Long Covid in the budget plans. Ms Forbes says that a Â£10m support fund and a care plan has been published and says Long Covid will be covered in the NHS funding announcement. She says she has allocated ""every penny"" in the budget.  The finance secretary responds by accusing Labour of ""parroting the Tory line"". She says focusing on the increased grant from Westminster fails to recognise that the Scottish government must ""absorb all the Covid costs"" within its budget Ms Forbes says Labour's demands for extra spending would have cost an extra Â£3bn - which, if services were not to be cut, would require big tax rises. She defends the planned pay rate of Â£10.50 an hour for carers - which is ""significantly higher"" than the national living wage - and higher than the rate called for by UK Labour for carers in England. Daniel Johnson, for Scottish Labour, says the budget does not contain the ""bold action"" needed to move beyond the Covid crisis. The child payment should be increased to Â£40 by April 2023, he argues. He also says care workers deserve a ""fair increase"" to Â£15 an hour, not the ""meagre, barely 50p increase"" that is planned, saying this is vital to boost recruitment. Mr Johnson says the phased return of business rates will not prevent many businesses going to the wall - and just resets the ""cliff edge"" into the summer. Schools should be fitted with ventilation systems to make them safer and ensure schooling can continue despite Covid uncertainties, he adds. Mr Johnson says the increase in the block grant from Westminster should have allowed the Scottish government to go much further. The cabinet secretary has choices - to use these funds, to be bold, to deliver recovery - or to continue SNP managed decline."" Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour The Scottish government has now published thefull budget document,external- which says that local authorities are to be given full flexibility over council tax rates for the first time since the SNP came to power in 2007. The document says that councils will have ""complete flexibility to set the Council Tax rate that is appropriate for their local authority area"". And it says it expects councils to take ""full account of local needs and of the impacts on household budgets of the decisions they make"". Ms Forbes hits back at the Tory MSP, saying that if the Scottish Conservatives want to deliver all the things they have set out, they should tell the parliament what they will cut and where the funding will come from.

Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The questioner is particularly keen to know how it would affect plans for East Kilbride and the planned extension of the line to Levenmouth in Fife. This is what it says in the budget document: ""The budget provides almost
Â£1.4bn to maintain, improve and decarbonise Scotlandâs rail network,
including Â£247m on major project enhancements which includes decarbonisation of the Barrhead corridor, East Kilbride corridor, Fife and
Borders electrification."" So
no mention of a line extension for Levenmouth. The planning process is just
one of the reasons that may have to wait for a future yearâs budget. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor There is good news in the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC)
report, but also a tight squeeze on expectations of increased spending. The good news is of 10.4% forecast Scottish economic growth
for 2021-22.  That will take the economy back to the pre-pandemic level of
output by the second quarter of next year - two years earlier than forecast in
January. Unemployment will go up, according to the forecast, but to
a much lower peak than previously expected, of 4.9%. However, the prospects for the total budget at Holyrood are
very tight. In real terms, the budget falls in real terms, by 1% per
year, then rising by the time of the next Holyrood election by only 1%. Given the expectations set in the election campaign last
May, and the pressures to find more funds for health and social care, that is
an extremely tough outlook. It gets much tougher when the promises on welfare are taken
into account.  The SFC says commitments are rising by Â£750m per year, half
of that to meet the cost of the higher Scottish Child Payment. So while commitments and expectations rise steeply, income
tax revenue goes down and the total budget effectively stands still. And this is what is set aside for fightingclimate change: This is what the budget promised forthe economy:  Closing the attainment gap and lifting people out of poverty was another theme. Here is what the Scottish government has funded forequality:  The key anti-poverty measure is the doubling of the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 a week, from April 2022. The minimum wage will rise to Â£10.50 an hour for social care staff. Public sector workers on low pay will get inflationary increases of at least Â£775 for those earning less than Â£25,000, Â£700 for people on Â£25,000 to Â£40,000, and Â£500 to those earning above Â£40,000. The council tax freeze that has been in place since 2007 will end next year. Ms Forbes also announced:  Kate Forbes has set out her budget for 2022-23. She promised a Scottish Budget ""for climate, recovery and equality"". Here's what she offered forbusiness:   Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor There are big commitments in Kate Forbes' budget, stemming
from the election campaign and from the partnership with Green MSPs. But at least as significant are the numbers published by
the Scottish Fiscal Commission. The independent body provides the forecasts for
economic growth and tax revenue, on which Ms Forbes makes her calculations. Income tax revenue is looking weak. Higher tax rates in
Scotland ought to mean higher tax revenue. But because the tax base is rising
at a slower rate than the rest of the UK, the block grant from Westminster is
adjusted to take account of that. Next year, the SFC forecasts a net gap of Â£190m. Thereâs a
tiny surplus forecast for the year after and then some big net gaps again,
rising to Â£417m in 2026-27. This is the risk and the opportunity facing the Scottish
government since it took control of most aspects of income tax. If the income tax base grows faster, the Scottish
government gets the benefit of higher tax receipts than it would otherwise have
had.  If that base grows more slowly, then MSPs have less money than the
Treasury would have given them without fiscal devolution. As things now look to the Fiscal Commission, there will be
a lot less money available. Question from Jade Yes - and it's the lowest-paid public sector staff who should see the biggest difference in their wage slips. Kate Forbes outlined plans to guarantee at least an additional Â£775 for people who earn up to Â£25,000. Those earning between Â£25,000 and Â£40,000 will get an extra Â£700, and an additional Â£500 will go to those earning more than Â£40,000. The finance secretary said she recognised the challenges of inflation and rising living costs, and the ""huge effort"" the public sector has made in responding to the pandemic. She also announced a minimum wage of Â£10.50 for all bodies covered by the government's public sector pay policy, including social care workers. Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton asks about the ""oversight"" of 100,000 sufferers of Long Covid in the budget plans. Ms Forbes says that a Â£10m support fund and a care plan has been published and says Long Covid will be covered in the NHS funding announcement. She says she has allocated ""every penny"" in the budget.  The finance secretary responds by accusing Labour of ""parroting the Tory line"". She says focusing on the increased grant from Westminster fails to recognise that the Scottish government must ""absorb all the Covid costs"" within its budget Ms Forbes says Labour's demands for extra spending would have cost an extra Â£3bn - which, if services were not to be cut, would require big tax rises. She defends the planned pay rate of Â£10.50 an hour for carers - which is ""significantly higher"" than the national living wage - and higher than the rate called for by UK Labour for carers in England. Daniel Johnson, for Scottish Labour, says the budget does not contain the ""bold action"" needed to move beyond the Covid crisis. The child payment should be increased to Â£40 by April 2023, he argues. He also says care workers deserve a ""fair increase"" to Â£15 an hour, not the ""meagre, barely 50p increase"" that is planned, saying this is vital to boost recruitment. Mr Johnson says the phased return of business rates will not prevent many businesses going to the wall - and just resets the ""cliff edge"" into the summer. Schools should be fitted with ventilation systems to make them safer and ensure schooling can continue despite Covid uncertainties, he adds. Mr Johnson says the increase in the block grant from Westminster should have allowed the Scottish government to go much further. The cabinet secretary has choices - to use these funds, to be bold, to deliver recovery - or to continue SNP managed decline."" Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour The Scottish government has now published thefull budget document,external- which says that local authorities are to be given full flexibility over council tax rates for the first time since the SNP came to power in 2007. The document says that councils will have ""complete flexibility to set the Council Tax rate that is appropriate for their local authority area"". And it says it expects councils to take ""full account of local needs and of the impacts on household budgets of the decisions they make"". Ms Forbes hits back at the Tory MSP, saying that if the Scottish Conservatives want to deliver all the things they have set out, they should tell the parliament what they will cut and where the funding will come from. She says that if health and social care funding, business help and Covid costs have to be absorbed by the Scottish Budget, then there have to be ""stark choices"".

Calls to back Scottish business in Holyrood budget,"Kate Forbes said her budget would prioritise tackling poverty and climate change as well as backing business recovery The Scottish government has been urged to confirm extra support in its annual budget for businesses recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes is to set out her tax and spending plans to MSPs later on Thursday afternoon. They are effectively guaranteed to pass through Holyrood, with the SNP and Greens holding a majority of seats. However opposition groups have set out demands for hundreds of millions of pounds of extra support for business. Both the Conservatives and Labour have called for firms in the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic to be given further tax breaks. Ms Forbes has said business recovery is one of three areas to be prioritised, alongside the transition to ""net zero"" carbon emissions and tackling child poverty. 'Very difficult choices' in Scottish budget Scottish budget: What do you need to know? Holyrood's budget is bigger now than at any point pre-pandemic, although ministers say the amount of money to spend is less than was on hand over the last two years with funding for Covid-19 relief having been wound down. Ms Forbes said she faced ""very difficult choices"" while drawing up her plans, with ""acute needs"" in a number of sectors. The Scottish Conservatives have called for a Â£631m business support package, comprising a freeze on the business tax rate and a full year of 75% rates relief for leisure, hospitality and retail firms. Finance spokeswoman Liz Smith said firms had been ""devastated by Covid"" and that the plans ""would give them the essential breathing space to recover and rebuild"" If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of theBBC websiteto submit your question on this topic. Scottish Labour has also called for rates relief for these sectors, as part of an ""ambitious fiscal stimulus package"" to rescue high street firms, along with a Â£50 voucher for every adult to spend in shops. In addition to this, the party has demanded a ""game changing"" investment in education by providing tutors for pupils in schools in the most deprived areas of the country. Meanwhile the Scottish Lib Dems said they were open to backing the budget as long as it delivers cash for the NHS and social care and ""ambitious action"" to tackle climate change - and does not put funding towards a fresh independence referendum. Business groups have also urged ministers to prioritise support for firms, with the CBI saying Scotland ""faces a race against time to reassert its competitiveness as a destination for top talent and investment"". Kate Forbes has made clear that supporting business recovery from the pandemic will be one of her three spending priorities. However, she has also said that the Scottish government cannot sustain 100% rates relief for retail, hospitality, leisure and aviation businesses for another year. Instead, there's likely to be a phased approach to the reduction of that support. Other key measures will be tackling child poverty with the doubling of the child payment to Â£20 next year and new investment to help cut carbon emissions in transport and homes. The finance secretary has also said funding to upgrade the A9 and the A96 will not be deprioritised. She has promised to protect local government as far as possible and to give councils some more flexibility over how they spend cash, while ensuring their share of extra money for social care is ringfenced for that purpose. Ms Forbes is not expected to make major changes to the income tax system, with the SNP having pledged to freeze rates and bands in May's election manifesto. She said there would be a ""significant"" increase in the NHS budget, with social care funding also in line to be boosted. The finance secretary also said she would seek to ""protect"" the local government settlement, although she warned that there was ""never enough money for everybody to be happy"". And she said there would be a particular focus on tackling poverty saying that the pandemic had been ""particularly hard for those on the lowest incomes"". The government's plans look set to pass through Holyrood unaltered with the support of the Scottish Greens, who helped draw up the budget for the first time since the party's cooperation agreement with the SNP. Co-leader Lorna Slater said the budget would mark the start of ""a green recovery from the pandemic"" and a ""just transition"" away from the oil and gas industry.

'Pubs may run out of cash as more work from home'We talk to firms which rely on commuters about how the new home-working guidance will affect them.,"Clive Watson says office parties are now being cancelled Hospitality firms have warned they face a collapse in demand at their busiest time of year due to the government's new work-from-home guidance. The measures, designed to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, come in from Monday. One trade body called them a ""body blow"" to already-struggling pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues. Pub chain boss Clive Watson said some pubs could ""run out of cash"" without extra help from the government. However, the government is not planning any new economic support measures. Mr Watson said the City Pub Company, which has 44 sites in England and Wales, was just starting to get back on its feet after a rough 18 months. But he said the government was ""turning off the life support machine yet again"" by bringing back home-working. New rules on home working and masks in England What's the new guidance on working from home? How will Plan B affect the economy? ""From about 10 days ago office parties started to get cancelled [because of Omicron].

Does Wales have its own Covid plan B?,"Wales' beauty spots were closed to tourists in March 2020 when the pandemic hit Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that England will be heading into what's become known as the ""Plan B"" set of restrictions. Its in response to the emergence of Omicron, with officials increasingly concerned at the variant's transmissibility and pressure it could put on the NHS. In Wales, the devolved government has a set of regulations that look very much like Mr Johnson's announcement for England. People are already asked to work from home, and Covid passes are required in more venues than in England. Mask wearing has remained mandatory in many indoor public places, barring pubs and restaurants. Yet case rates have remained high - with seven day rates not fallen below 470 per 100,000 for months. Boosters are being rolled out to more people, but should officials want to slow the spread while more arms are being jabbed, there is a plan they could implement. It involves a return to the restrictions on our social lives and on businesses that were axed in summer. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Ministers, before Omicron, were at pains to stress they did not think a lockdown would be necessary again. Now, the picture is unclear. Welsh ministers have never ruled out needing to return to restrictions on businesses and our social lives, but have played down the chance of a new lockdown in the past. But ministers in Cardiff face potentially difficult choices if the decisions they want to take are different to those being considered in London, and the money to support Welsh restrictions does not emerge. Wales, in common with the rest of the UK, currently has no restrictions on social contact and all businesses are allowed to open. Butmask wearing is the law in indoor public spaces, including shops, public transport, hospitals and social care settings. The exception is in pubs, restaurants and nightclubs. The UK government had scrapped mask rules in England during the summer, but re-introduced them after Omicron emerged. People in Wales are also legally required toobtain a NHS Covid passif they are going to large events, a nightclub or a venue that's similar to a nightclub. The law goes further than the requirement in England, with passes also now needed to go to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. The pass needs to show if an individual has had a recent negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours, or two vaccinations. And it is not a legal restriction, but individuals are advised to work from home if they can. While there are no plans, the picture has become uncertain. Ministers had hoped expanding the NHS Covid pass system would avoid the need to take more drastic action. But in recent days Welsh ministers have not been able to say what restrictions will be in place during the festive period. They have instead emphasised people should take precautions - like taking a lateral flow test before meeting relatives. What is Plan B for Covid in England this winter? Why are UK Covid cases so high? First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously said he has no plans to shut businesses. But he had also written a letter to the prime minister asking for financial support if he needed to implement ""more interventionist measures"". He said the point of the letter was to make it clear to the UK government it they ""can't do what they did last year"", referring to a row when the Welsh government decided to go into a firebreak lockdown in October 2020 but furloughwas not extended in response. Under the latest Covid control plan,external, Wales is currently classed as being ""Covid Stable"", where there are very few restrictions. But the Welsh government could move to ""Covid Urgent"", drawn up if new and unexpected Covid pressures emerge - like a new variant that does not respond to vaccines, or if there is unsustainable pressure on the NHS. In that scenario, the Welsh government plans to return to the alert level lists of restrictions it had in place last year - stretching from restrictions on socialising to a Welsh lockdown. Ministers have given no clues what alert level they may choose in response to Omicron, or even if they will move to Covid urgent. The lightest set of restrictions, classed asalert level one,external, would see the rule of six on social contact indoors, and nightclubs closed. At alert level two,external, meetings with people outside your extended household in a private home would be effectively banned, and ice rinks shut. In alert level three,external, more venues would be forced to close, and pubs and restaurants would only be able to serve outside, and outdoor gatherings limited to six. Finally,alert level four,externalwould reintroduce a stay-at-home lockdown like that seen in January. But the rules are not set in stone. Laws on coronavirus in Wales have changed rapidly as the pandemic and they could be changed again. The Alpha variant contributed to large Covid wave at the end of last year, overwhelming hospital services. Wales was badly hit. Cinemas and other indoor entertainment venues were closed at the start of December, and alcohol was banned from sale in pubs, restaurants and cafes. But the situation saw Labour ministers go further. The country went into lockdown on 23 December, and plans to allow social contact indoors over the Christmas break were limited to just Christmas Day. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has no plans to reintroduce furlough Moving to Covid Urgent, combined with a ramping up of restrictions on businesses, poses real dilemmas for a devolved government that cannot summon large pots of cash. A long Welsh lockdown without the help the Welsh government has asked for from the UK government could leave thousands out of work and facing significant financial hardship. While the individual UK nations have pursued sometimes different lockdown policies, they did it with financial firepower from Westminster in the background - including the furlough scheme. Furlough ended on 30 Septemberand as things stand there are no plans to bring it back. Should a situation develop where pressure on the NHS in Wales was acute, but furlough did not return, the stakes in a Wales-only lockdown where businesses shut would be high for Mark Drakeford. But if the situation is bad in Wales, it may be the same in England, where Boris Johnson's government will face similar pressures.

"School dates changes to be considered, says FM","Could the traditional school year be about the change? Changes to the school year are to be considered by the Welsh government. The first minister said the structure of the school day and term dates needed to be modernised. Mark Drakeford said a ""radical policy shift"" was needed to the academic year, which dates back to the 19th Century when Wales was ""largely agricultural"". Teaching unions have said any changes must be based on the benefits to children and not about making parents' lives easier for childcare. Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru said they wanted to explore the options to change the ""rhythm"" of the school day, as part of their extendedco-operation agreementin the Senedd.

""The way we live our lives now, the way people are employed and the way parents have to manage the competing demands of life, means we need to revisit that fundamental thing about how the school year and the school day is organised in Wales,"" Mr Drakeford toldBBC Wales Live. Schools are not childcare providers, says teaching union NAHT Cymru Teaching union NAHT Cymru said it was keen to discuss changes with the Welsh government to improve education, though was sceptical about altering the daily school routine. ""It is widely acknowledged that the autumn term, for example, is always a difficult one, as learners have been out of school for so long, so we would be keen to discuss the evidence base for any changes,"" said director Laura Doel. ""We are concerned about the government's motivation for [exploring the rhythm of the school day] given there is no clear evidence to support it. ""Schools' core purpose is teaching and learning and while we want to be supportive of our families, schools are not there as childcare providers. ""We know that keeping children in school for longer does not increase a child's capacity to learn and the focus should be on providing quality teaching and learning during schools hours.

'Pubs may run out of cash as more work from home',"Clive Watson says office parties are now being cancelled Hospitality firms have warned they face a collapse in demand at their busiest time of year due to the government's new work-from-home guidance. The measures, designed to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, come in from Monday. One trade body called them a ""body blow"" to already-struggling pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues. Pub chain boss Clive Watson said some pubs could ""run out of cash"" without extra help from the government. However, the government is not planning any new economic support measures. Mr Watson said the City Pub Company, which has 44 sites in England and Wales, was just starting to get back on its feet after a rough 18 months. But he said the government was ""turning off the life support machine yet again"" by bringing back home-working.

Sun illegally sought my medical records - MillerActor Sienna Miller makes the accusation as the paper pays a major settlement in her hacking case.UK,"This video can not be played Watch Sienna Miller's statement in full Sienna Miller says the Sun tried to ""profit out of her misery"" as she formally settled a phone hacking claim. Ms Miller's lawyers said in court she believed the newspaper targeted medical records about her 2005 pregnancy, despite its publisher's denials. The actor, 39, has been paid a major financial settlement after taking legal action against News Group Newspapers. Her lawyers told the court the payout is ""tantamount"" to an admission of illegal activity by the Sun. The size of the payout is confidential - but it may be one of the largest settlements by Rupert Murdoch's organisation to victims of phone hacking. In a statement read on Ms Miller's behalf at the High Court, she described how she felt the Sun ""brutally took away her choice"" when it allegedly leaked that she was pregnant. Speaking outside court on Thursday, Ms Miller said the newspaper thought it was ""above the law"". She said the Sun's actions ""shattered me, damaged my reputation - at times beyond repair"", causing her to accuse family and friends of selling information ""in a state of intense paranoia and fear"". Ms Miller is one of the latest high-profile people to receive damages for historical phone hacking by tabloid reporters. The NGN newspaper News of the World was closed down in 2011 after years of phone hacking came to light. Hundreds of celebrities, and members of the public, have since won compensation. The publisher has never admitted liability in relation to alleged phone hacking at the Sun, settling claims on the basis that such activity took place only at the News of the World. Sienna Miller settles phone hacking claim Ronan Keating accepts phone hacking damages Sun's owner reports Â£68m loss as paper sales fall Lawyers for News Group Newspapers (NGN), the Sun's parent company, had argued in court that Ms Miller should not be able to say anything in open court about the newspaper because she had settled without going to trial. But on Wednesday, the High Court judge ruled that she could publicly repeat some of her suspicions, based on evidence in her case, even if they were unproven. NGN denies any unlawful information gathering took place at the Sun and settled the claim with no admission of liability. In the statement read by Ms Miller's lawyer, David Sherborne, the court heard that the actor had been the subject of ""intense media scrutiny and serious intrusion"" from 2003, in particular from the Sun. He said she was ""horrified"" to see court documents which she believed showed senior Sun journalist Nick Parker had claimed expenses and met a ""medical records tracer"" in July and August 2005 to discuss her pregnancy. The statement said Ms Miller also believes the medical records tracer was Christine Hart, who allegedly obtained private medical information and appeared to have issued an invoice for ""Sienns (sic) Miller Pregnant research"". Ms Miller's statement said she was shocked to see that evidence ""appeared to show that the Sun had paid for Ms Hart to unlawfully target her to get information on her pregnancy"". It continued that the actor had a ""firm belief"" - based on call data and disclosures about private investigators and payments - that she was a subject of ""unlawful gathering techniques"" from around 2003. ""NGN's historic public denials and refusal to accept any responsibility has only served to intensify the upset,"" the statement said. It added that Ms Miller believes it was Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the Sun, who first called her representative to say that she knew the actor was pregnant. The former Sun editor's denials, ""including under oath"", that she was involved in or aware of unlawful activity were ""especially aggravating"" to Ms Miller, the statement said. The statement said that even though the settlement included no admission of liability, the fact that the Sun's publishers agreed to pay ""such a substantial sum"" was ""tantamount to an admission of liability on the part of the Sun"". Ms Miller ""feels fully vindicated"", her lawyer said. Outside court, the actor said she wanted to pursue her case to a full trial, but that option was not available to people without ""countless millions"". Ms Miller said she was ""deeply distressed and shocked"" by what she had learned about the actions of journalists and senior managers at the Sun. ""They very nearly ruined my life. I have certainly seen how they have ruined the lives of others,"" she said. Ms Miller, who has a nine-year-old daughter, said she hoped someone would take a legal case against the paper further than she had been able to. She said she would ""unhesitatingly"" participate as a witness. Paul Gascoigne also formally settled a claim on Thursday Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne also formally settled a claim against NGN on Thursday. In a statement, his lawyer told the court he had been the ""victim of unlawful information gathering"" by journalists from the Sun. Solicitor Gerald Shamash said Mr Gascoigne had been ""horrified"" to learn payments were made to a private investigator who is alleged to have got hold of his private medical information. Mr Gascoigne believed the payments were ""made in relation to obtaining private, very personally sensitive matters"", said Mr Shamash. He said the former Newcastle footballer was ""shocked"" to see information from the court's disclosure process allegedly showing the Sun had ""paid to obtain information on his mental health"". He said NGN agreed to pay substantial damages to settle the claim without a trial but have not admitted any liability in relation to the allegations of unlawful information gathering. Both Mr Gascoigne and Ms Miller said they felt ""fully vindicated"" in bringing their claims against NGN.

Big rise in students asking for extra cashRequests for hardship funds doubled in 25% of English universities in the second and third lockdowns.Family & Education,"A loss of part-time work opportunities led to a rise in hardship funding applications between the second and third national lockdowns in England. The number of students seeking extra money because of financial problems doubled in 25% of English universities in the last academic year. More than 75% of universities that responded to a Universities UK (UUK) survey had seen an increase in requests for hardship funding. Students relying on part-time work were most affected during lockdowns. The government said it had made an extra Â£85m available for students ""in the greatest need"" in 2020-21. Students can apply for hardship funding directly from their universities or colleges. Individual institutions determine how much is given out - and many introduced emergency Covid hardship funds. The survey suggests a significant increase in requests in English universities between September 2020 and the end of January 2021 - during the second and third national lockdowns - compared with the same time period in the previous academic year. Of 81 universities that responded: 63 saw a rise in applications 32 saw requests increase by 50% or more 21 saw requests double. Oly, 19, who asked for his surname to be withheld, moved to Birmingham, in September 2020, to study specialist hair and media make-up. He had hoped to find part-time work on a make-up counter, to pay for his private student accommodation, but found the ""entire make-up industry pretty much just came to a halt"". ""I ended up looking for other things like being a cashier at a supermarket... but nowhere was hiring,"" he said. In January, living alone during the third lockdown and trying to feed himself on Â£15 a week, he applied for his university's hardship fund. He had hoped for about Â£800 but was given Â£250. ""I was happy, because even if it wasn't as much as I'd asked for, it was still enough that I could get by for a little bit longer,"" he said. Oly managed to find temporary work when Covid restrictions eased and now lives in cheaper accommodation - but he described last year as ""probably the most difficult time in my life"". ""I'm definitely having to budget somewhat more than I would if last year we hadn't had a pandemic,"" he said. ""I kind of wish I got my chance to be the naÃ¯ve first-year, where you could just go out and have flat parties and have fun - and maybe have a bit of a struggle with finances, but that's kind of normal."" Not far away, in Coventry, a 21-year-old recent graduate, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC News she had received Â£1,500 in hardship funding, after struggling to find a job in the pandemic. With her parents living abroad and no possibility of moving home, she described her financial situation as ""bleak"". Then, her mother fell ill. ""I was having to budget myself immensely to try and save as much of my student loan to avoid homelessness after graduating,"" she said. ""The hardship fund literally helped me not be homeless after university and meant I could go see my mum after almost losing her."" Now in full-time work, the ""huge stress and anxiety"" of financial difficulties last year continues to affect her mental health. ""I am under constant fear to save as much as possible so that I don't ever end up in fear of being homeless again,"" she said. Website tackles 'toxic' student rental market Student sex workers 'made hundreds of pounds' Student 'horror' homes infested with rats and damp UUK said a large proportion of the increase in requests had come from students from low-income households and those paying for private accommodation they had been unable to access in lockdowns. Applications from postgraduate and international students also increased because of a lack of access to maintenance support and a loss of part-time work opportunities. Restrictions affecting the retail and hospitality industries meant many could not work during term-time or earn money to save during university holidays. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced a four-week ""stay at home"" orderin England, on 31 October 2020. England then went into a tier system of restrictions, before athird national lockdown was announcedin early January. A second survey, in March, found the number of applications had continued to rise. A spokeswoman for UUK - which represents about 115 universities in England and 25 across the rest of the UK - said students had shown ""extraordinary resilience"" and ""for some, these financial difficulties are likely to be ongoing"". ""Universities have done all they can to step up support for these students, including using hardship funds, offering food vouchers, supporting students encountering digital poverty, and investing in mental health and wellbeing services,"" she said. She added universities were working to make students aware of support services and urged those struggling to contact their institution. Research by the National Union of Students suggests about a fifth of students were in part-time employment in January, compared with about a third in September. Larissa Kennedy joined staff and students striking outside King's College London this month. The union's president, Larissa Kennedy, said: ""The funding available for those hoping to access education is not designed to cover the cost of living, meaning students are under extreme financial pressure.""

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""No student should have to worry unduly about their financial situation whilst they are focusing on their studies.

Bird flu at phenomenal level in UK - chief vet,"Thousands of farmed birds have been culled. The UK's chief veterinary officer has told the BBC there is a ""phenomenal level"" of avian flu in the UK. Tens of thousands of farmed birds have already been culled, as the "" largest number of premises ever"" in an avian influenza outbreak are infected. Officials say the risk to human health is low - there is no link to the Covid-19 pandemic -  but infected birds should not be touched. ""It has huge human, animal, and trade implications,"" the chief vet said. Lessons learned from the foot-and-mouth outbreak are being used to try to control the outbreak, Dr Christine Middlemiss added. As ofWednesday,externalthere were 38 confirmed infected premises in the UK - 31 in England, three in Wales, two in Scotland, and two in Northern Ireland. The total last year was 26 confirmed cases. The disease is largely spread by migratory wild birds which return to Britain and pass it on to other birds. Dr Middlemiss said the UK was only a few weeks into the migratory season, which normally goes on until March. ""We are going to need to keep up these levels of heightened biosecurity for all that time."" An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone was declared across the UK on 3 November. It was extended on 29 November, requiring all bird owners to keep the animals indoors. Dr Middlemiss said there was a high level of infection in wild birds returning from the north of Russia and the east of Europe, where they spent the summer. The advice from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), is that the risk to human health from the avian flu A(H5N1) virus is ""very low"". However, members of the public are strongly advised not to touch diseased birds. The availability of eggs in supermarkets is unlikely to be affected, said Dr Middlemiss, because the number of farms affected is low compared to overall egg production. Turkeys have been culled in a North Yorkshire farm ""Whilst we're happy that there are not going to be any food supply issues, because of the overall large number of chickens and eggs and things we produce, it is devastating for those individual companies involved. It's also devastating for people who keep yard flocks."" The types of premises infected have ranged from bird sanctuaries and small flocks kept in gardens or yards, up to very large commercial farms. Peregrine falcons, curlews, barnacle geese and herring gulls are some of the wild bird species to have been found dead or dying from the disease. Where a case is confirmed after testing by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) biosecurity control zones are set up and the infected birds killed. In some commercial farms, more than 10 thousand birds have had to be destroyed. Thefirst detection,externalof the H5N1 strain this season was in rescued swans and captive poultry at a swan sanctuary in Worcester on 15 October. In November dead swans were found around the centre of Stratford-on-Avon and the Diglis Basin in Worcester; footpaths were blocked off and the public urged not to feed the animals. In Belfast the disease was confirmed in wild birds in an urban area. There have been other outbreaks in nature reserves in Scotland. Dr Middlemiss emphasised that ""the absolute key"" was biosecurity. She said that chicken sheds should be kept ""as clean as a surgical theatre"", which would reduce the chance of wild birds either directly or indirectly coming into contact with kept birds. Biosecurity measures, she said, had been learned from the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 when more than 2,000 cases of the disease in farms across the UK led to the culling of six million cows and sheep. However, foot-and-mouth was spread by cattle-to-cattle contact. Avian flu is being largely spread by wild birds, over which there can be ""very little control"". The clinical sign of infection is that birds tend to go off their food and water, then develop respiratory problems, eye discharges and sneezing. Then they can display nervous signs, like twisted necks. Dr Middlemiss said, ""We're not on our own. There are a large number of outbreaks across the EU happening. This is a different strain to last year. We do need to understand why we are seeing more year-on-year outbreaks, and understand what's behind that. She said she wanted to understand the pattern: ""We can't wait until another year and have an even bigger outbreak. So, we will be working not just with our own scientists but internationally, to understand more of what we can do about what's behind it."" The RSPB said: ""Everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, regularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands.""

New Zealand law aims to phase out smoking,"Anyone born after 2008 will not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime New Zealand will ban the sale of tobacco to its next generation, in a bid to eventually phase out smoking. Anyone born after 2008 will not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime, under a law expected to be enacted next year. ""We want to make sure young people never start smoking,"" Health Minister Dr Ayesha Verall said. The move is part of a sweeping crackdown on smoking announced by New Zealand's health ministry on Thursday. Doctors and other health experts in the country have welcomed the ""world-leading"" reforms, which will reduce access to tobacco and restrict nicotine levels in cigarettes. ""It will help people quit or switch to less harmful products, and make it much less likely that young people get addicted to nicotine,"" said Prof Janet Hook from the University of Otago. The crackdown has been met with mixed reactions. ""I reckon it's a good move, really,"" one man told Reuters news agency. ""Because right now there's a lot of young kids walking around with smokes in their mouth. Public are asking how they're getting these smokes. ""And it's also good for myself too because I can save more money."" However, others have warned that the move may create a black market for tobacco - something the health ministry's official impact statement does acknowledge, noting ""customs will need more resource to enforce border control"". ""This is all 100% theory and 0% substance,"" Sunny Kaushal, chairman of the Dairy and Business Owners Group, a lobby group for local convenience stores, told New Zealand's Stuff news site. ""There's going to be a crime wave. Gangs and criminals will fill the gap"". Dog sniffs out hole in a wall cigarette stash Smoking surge in young during Covid lockdown New Zealand is determined to achieve a national goal of reducing its national smoking rate to 5% by 2025, with the aim of eventually eliminating it altogether. At the moment, 13% of New Zealand's adults smoke, with the rate much higher among the indigenous Maori population, where it soars to almost a third. Maori also suffer a higher rate of disease and death. New Zealand's health ministry says smoking causes one in four cancers and remains the leading cause of preventable death for its five million strong population. The industry has been the target of legislators for more than a decade now. As part of the crackdown announced on Thursday, the government also introduced major tobacco controls, including significantly restricting where cigarettes can be sold to remove them from supermarkets and corner stores. The number of shops authorised to sell cigarettes will be drastically reduced to under 500 from about 8,000 now, officials say. In recent years, vaping - smoking e-cigarettes which produce a vapour that also delivers nicotine - has become far more popular among younger generations than cigarettes. New Zealand health authorities warn however, that vaping is not harmless. Researchers have found hazardous, cancer-causing agents in e-cigarette liquids as well. But in 2017 the country adopted vaping as a pathway to help smokers quit tobacco.

'Huge discrepancy' in NI school uniform grant,"Families in Northern Ireland can receive more than Â£100 less per child compared to those in England, Scotland and Wales There is a ""huge discrepancy"" between the school uniform grant available to families in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK. That is according to a Department of Education (DE) official. It has begun a review of the uniform grant. Families in Northern Ireland can receive more than Â£100 less per child compared to those in England, Scotland and Wales. That is ""shocking"", Northern Ireland assembly members said. A parents' group has also called for a wider statutory cap on school uniform prices, saying they are a ""source of financial stress"" for many families. New government rules in England mean that parentsmust be allowed to buy some uniform from High Street shopsas well as school suppliers, and the cost of anything branded must be kept to a minimum. A paper by the Northern Ireland Assembly's Research and Information Service, published in May, cited recent research from the Irish League of Credit Unions on school uniform costs. It suggested parents spent Â£131 on primary school uniforms and Â£177 on post-primary uniforms when preparing their children for the return to school. Separate UK-wide research by the Children's Society suggested that parents spent on average Â£337 per year on school uniforms for each secondary school child and Â£315 on each primary school child. A review of free school meals and uniform grant criteria is being carried out by DE and is expected to take about 18 months. It will consider the current rate of the school uniform grant in Northern Ireland. A review of free school meals and uniform grant criteria is being carried out by DE and is expected to take about 18 months Low-income families can receive a grant of Â£35.75 towards the cost of a primary school uniform and between Â£73-Â£78 towards the cost of a post-primary uniform and PE kit. But appearing before MLAs on Stormont's Education Committee, Margaret Rose McNaughton from DE said there was a ""huge discrepancy"" between the uniform grant in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK. According to figures provided by DE, parents can claim up to Â£150 per child in England, between Â£125 and Â£200 in Wales and at least Â£120 to Â£150 in Scotland. The level of grant in England, though, depends on which council area parents live in and in some areas it can be lower than that in Northern Ireland. ""The contribution to the uniform grant is very small in terms of the actual cost of what the uniform is and that is why we need to address the difference there,"" Ms McNaughton told MLAs. ""There is a real discrepancy in our costs and that is something that we are mindful of."" SDLP MLA Justin McNulty described the difference as ""shocking"". ""That's a really bad indictment on the department in terms of what's provided elsewhere and what's provided here,"" he said. Ms McNaughton said that a constrained education budget was one reason for the discrepancy. ""The budgets have been so particularly tight over the last number of years,"" she said. ""We know that there is a huge discrepancy there and that is what we're hoping to address as part of this review. ""In terms of the amount of a grant it all comes down to the amount of money available."" The Education Committee chairman, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle, also said there was ""an urgent need to increase a grant that has stayed the same for over a decade"". Sinn FÃ©in MLA Nicola Brogan said that the cost of expensive uniforms at some schools was ""a barrier to education"" for some pupils. There are statutory guidelines for schools in Wales which meanthey have to have uniforms which are affordable, accessible and gender neutral. Koulla Yiasouma has said she would ""support compulsory guidance, regulation or legislation"" on affordable uniforms The Parental Engagement Group (PEG) - which is represented on a forum established by DE for the review of free school meals and uniform grant criteria - is calling for ""bespoke legislation"" in Northern Ireland which would introduce a cap on uniform costs. ""In particular, we are concerned about the cost of branded items, the use of limited suppliers, thus limited choice and driving up price, use of non-high street options, as well as badges and embroidered items (such as blazers and sports kit),"" PEG said. ""Without statutory intervention costs will continue to rise and some schools will become inaccessible for low-income families."" At present, school uniform policy is mainly a matter for individual school boards of governors, althoughthe department ""advises"" schools to keep costs to a minimum. Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Children and Young People Koulla Yiasouma has also previously said she would ""support compulsory guidance, regulation or legislation that would ensure affordable uniforms for all children"".

New Zealand law aims to phase out smokingNo New Zealander born after 2008 will be able to buy tobacco under proposed new health laws.,"Anyone born after 2008 will not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime New Zealand will ban the sale of tobacco to its next generation, in a bid to eventually phase out smoking. Anyone born after 2008 will not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime, under a law expected to be enacted next year. ""We want to make sure young people never start smoking,"" Health Minister Dr Ayesha Verall said. The move is part of a sweeping crackdown on smoking announced by New Zealand's health ministry on Thursday. Doctors and other health experts in the country have welcomed the ""world-leading"" reforms, which will reduce access to tobacco and restrict nicotine levels in cigarettes. ""It will help people quit or switch to less harmful products, and make it much less likely that young people get addicted to nicotine,"" said Prof Janet Hook from the University of Otago. The crackdown has been met with mixed reactions. ""I reckon it's a good move, really,"" one man told Reuters news agency. ""Because right now there's a lot of young kids walking around with smokes in their mouth. Public are asking how they're getting these smokes. ""And it's also good for myself too because I can save more money."" However, others have warned that the move may create a black market for tobacco - something the health ministry's official impact statement does acknowledge, noting ""customs will need more resource to enforce border control"". ""This is all 100% theory and 0% substance,"" Sunny Kaushal, chairman of the Dairy and Business Owners Group, a lobby group for local convenience stores, told New Zealand's Stuff news site. ""There's going to be a crime wave. Gangs and criminals will fill the gap"". Dog sniffs out hole in a wall cigarette stash Smoking surge in young during Covid lockdown New Zealand is determined to achieve a national goal of reducing its national smoking rate to 5% by 2025, with the aim of eventually eliminating it altogether. At the moment, 13% of New Zealand's adults smoke, with the rate much higher among the indigenous Maori population, where it soars to almost a third. Maori also suffer a higher rate of disease and death. New Zealand's health ministry says smoking causes one in four cancers and remains the leading cause of preventable death for its five million strong population. The industry has been the target of legislators for more than a decade now. As part of the crackdown announced on Thursday, the government also introduced major tobacco controls, including significantly restricting where cigarettes can be sold to remove them from supermarkets and corner stores. The number of shops authorised to sell cigarettes will be drastically reduced to under 500 from about 8,000 now, officials say. In recent years, vaping - smoking e-cigarettes which produce a vapour that also delivers nicotine - has become far more popular among younger generations than cigarettes. New Zealand health authorities warn however, that vaping is not harmless. Researchers have found hazardous, cancer-causing agents in e-cigarette liquids as well. But in 2017 the country adopted vaping as a pathway to help smokers quit tobacco.

Big rise in students asking for hardship cash,"A loss of part-time work opportunities led to a rise in hardship funding applications between the second and third national lockdowns in England. The number of students seeking extra money because of financial problems doubled in 25% of English universities in the last academic year. More than 75% of universities that responded to a Universities UK (UUK) survey had seen an increase in requests for hardship funding. Students relying on part-time work were most affected during lockdowns. The government said it had made an extra Â£85m available for students ""in the greatest need"" in 2020-21. Students can apply for hardship funding directly from their universities or colleges. Individual institutions determine how much is given out - and many introduced emergency Covid hardship funds. The survey suggests a significant increase in requests in English universities between September 2020 and the end of January 2021 - during the second and third national lockdowns - compared with the same time period in the previous academic year. Of 81 universities that responded: 63 saw a rise in applications 32 saw requests increase by 50% or more 21 saw requests double. Oly, 19, who asked for his surname to be withheld, moved to Birmingham, in September 2020, to study specialist hair and media make-up. He had hoped to find part-time work on a make-up counter, to pay for his private student accommodation, but found the ""entire make-up industry pretty much just came to a halt"". ""I ended up looking for other things like being a cashier at a supermarket... but nowhere was hiring,"" he said. In January, living alone during the third lockdown and trying to feed himself on Â£15 a week, he applied for his university's hardship fund. He had hoped for about Â£800 but was given Â£250. ""I was happy, because even if it wasn't as much as I'd asked for, it was still enough that I could get by for a little bit longer,"" he said. Oly managed to find temporary work when Covid restrictions eased and now lives in cheaper accommodation - but he described last year as ""probably the most difficult time in my life"". ""I'm definitely having to budget somewhat more than I would if last year we hadn't had a pandemic,"" he said. ""I kind of wish I got my chance to be the naÃ¯ve first-year, where you could just go out and have flat parties and have fun - and maybe have a bit of a struggle with finances, but that's kind of normal."" Not far away, in Coventry, a 21-year-old recent graduate, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC News she had received Â£1,500 in hardship funding, after struggling to find a job in the pandemic. With her parents living abroad and no possibility of moving home, she described her financial situation as ""bleak"". Then, her mother fell ill. ""I was having to budget myself immensely to try and save as much of my student loan to avoid homelessness after graduating,"" she said. ""The hardship fund literally helped me not be homeless after university and meant I could go see my mum after almost losing her."" Now in full-time work, the ""huge stress and anxiety"" of financial difficulties last year continues to affect her mental health. ""I am under constant fear to save as much as possible so that I don't ever end up in fear of being homeless again,"" she said. Website tackles 'toxic' student rental market Student sex workers 'made hundreds of pounds' Student 'horror' homes infested with rats and damp UUK said a large proportion of the increase in requests had come from students from low-income households and those paying for private accommodation they had been unable to access in lockdowns. Applications from postgraduate and international students also increased because of a lack of access to maintenance support and a loss of part-time work opportunities. Restrictions affecting the retail and hospitality industries meant many could not work during term-time or earn money to save during university holidays. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced a four-week ""stay at home"" orderin England, on 31 October 2020. England then went into a tier system of restrictions, before athird national lockdown was announcedin early January. A second survey, in March, found the number of applications had continued to rise. A spokeswoman for UUK - which represents about 115 universities in England and 25 across the rest of the UK - said students had shown ""extraordinary resilience"" and ""for some, these financial difficulties are likely to be ongoing"". ""Universities have done all they can to step up support for these students, including using hardship funds, offering food vouchers, supporting students encountering digital poverty, and investing in mental health and wellbeing services,"" she said. She added universities were working to make students aware of support services and urged those struggling to contact their institution. Research by the National Union of Students suggests about a fifth of students were in part-time employment in January, compared with about a third in September. Larissa Kennedy joined staff and students striking outside King's College London this month. The union's president, Larissa Kennedy, said: ""The funding available for those hoping to access education is not designed to cover the cost of living, meaning students are under extreme financial pressure."" She urged the government to bring back maintenance grants, introduce a rent cap and ""redress exploitative housing costs"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""No student should have to worry unduly about their financial situation whilst they are focusing on their studies. ""This government made an additional Â£85m of funding available to universities for the 2020-21 academic year, which targeted students in the greatest need, for example those struggling with additional costs from having to maintain accommodation in more than one location due to the pandemic. ""This was on top of an existing Â£256m that universities could draw on towards student hardship funds.""

Plan B's effect on the economy,"Faced with the threat of cases of the new Omicron variant of Covid doubling every two to three days, the prime minister has imposed a new set of restrictions in England. They include increased requirements for mask-wearing, more working from home and proof of vaccination or Covid status at nightclubs and crowded indoor spaces. How will these measures - which the government calls Plan B - affect an economy which is still recovering from the impact of previous waves? The measures announced on Wednesday for England are much less stringent than those announced last winter. Similar measures are already in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with tougher ones in many other European countries. Covid: Should I be working from home now? Omicron: What are the new Plan B rules for England? Economies around the world have got used to operating under Covid restrictions. Businesses have adapted and workers learned how to operate from home. Many never went back to the office. Around a third of working adults in Great Britain work from home part of the time, according to the Office for National Statistics. Just over half travel to work every day, a figure that has risen steadily since restrictions were lifted in the spring. Data from Remit Consulting showed offices were at just 22% of pre-lockdown occupancy levels last week. The second lockdown in January 2021 had only one-fifth of the impact on economic output of the first lockdowns, says Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC. On the impact of Plan B on the economy as a whole, ""I would imagine that it will be pretty limited,"" he says. For individual companies in particular sectors, the impact could be more severe. Bars, restaurants, hotels and leisure industries have been badly hit by previous lockdowns and staff shortages - and Plan B could cause further problems. The Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs, hasalready warned of a ""devastating impact"". It claims that Covid passports in Scotland and Wales have already reduced attendance at nightclubs. Matthew Fell, policy director at the CBI, said: ""Fresh restrictions are a big setback for businesses, particularly for those in hospitality and retail who are in a critical trading period, as well as others such as transport."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the rise of the Omicron variant showed why the UK needed ""a permanent short-time working scheme - ready to go when a new crisis hits"". Nightclubs have warned that new restrictions could have a ""devastating"" impact If office workers stay home, it will hurt the businesses which cater to their needs - from the shops that sell lunches to the dry cleaners who press their suits. PwC estimates the economic impact of home working, from lost custom at those businesses and from the benefits of sharing ideas in work settings, at Â£15bn a year. The new measures will hit an economy already feeling the effects of the Omicron wave. There are signs that people are already responding to the news about the new variant and restricting their own behaviour. Figures compiled by Pantheon Macroeconomics show small falls in the numbers of people booking tables in restaurants, going to the cinema, going shopping or searching for information about pubs, gyms and hairdressers on Google since the news about Omicron emerged. ""It seems that consumers' confidence has been knocked back by news of the new variant,"" wrote Pantheon's chief economist Samuel Tombs in the research note. There are already widespread reports ofChristmas parties and events being cancelled. The furlough scheme helped to protect millions of jobs in industries such as restaurants The timing of the emergence of Omicron is particularly unfortunate for shops, restaurants and bars that rely on the festive period for a large proportion of their profits. The most significant measures to support businesses and workers through earlier waves, such as the furlough scheme and the Self-employment Income Support scheme, have been withdrawn. Trade unions have called for furlough to be reintroduced, but the government has confirmed that no new economic support package is being planned. The purpose of new restrictions is to contain the spread of the virus. If they reduce infections, deaths and long-term sickness, they should help to minimise the economic damage it creates. Governments have to balance the short-term impact with the long-term benefit. ""If it is done at the right time, it is a good thing,"" says PwC's Mr Gillham. ""It is a case of acting early enough and decisively enough for the measures to have the impact they are supposed to. That timing is very difficult to get right."" In some areas, the impact of Plan B was felt before it was even announced. The pound hit its lowest level of the year against the dollar on Wednesday - and newspaper reports of Plan B were ""definitely"" a factor, says Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank. The pound often falls when investors think the Bank of England is less likely to put up interest rates. A member of the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, Michael Saunders, said last week that there might be ""advantages"" to waiting for more data on how the Omicron wave develops. And the imposition of new restrictions could be seen as another reason to delay a rate rise, Ms Foley said. Any delay in the first rate rise will be a relief to households on variable mortgages. But if the pound stays weak, that could contribute to faster increases in the cost of imported goods and energy. The biggest unknown hanging over the economy is the course of the Omicron variant. Although it is spreading fast, we still don't know whether it will cause increased levels of severe sickness and death, and how much protection vaccines will bring. Therefore it's impossible to know how long the latest measures will be necessary for, or whether further restrictions will need to be introduced.

High Street Â£100 voucher cards deadline extendedEconomy Minister Gordon Lyons extends the deadline to spend cards until midnight on 19 December.Northern Ireland,"Many people are waiting anxiously for their post The deadline for spending the Â£100 High Street voucher has been extended until midnight Sunday 19 December, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has said. By Wednesday afternoon, more than 99% of cards had been delivered, according to the Department for the Economy. Mr Lyons said ""there has been a delay"" in dispatching some cards. As the deadline for Northern Ireland's Spend Local voucher scheme nears, thousands are still waiting for their card to be delivered. However, as more than 1.4m people have applied for a voucher, the department's spokesman said ""approximately 10,000"" cards were still to be received. Mr Lyons said the deadline ""was tight for some people"" but he is ""convinced we will get those extra cards out to people"". He toldBBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programmethat over 10,000 cards will be dispatched this week and ""they will get to people over the next few days"". ""Some applicants submitted evidence late, some errors were made and some duplicate applications were made and those had to be verified before they were sent out,"" he said. He said Â£118m has been injected into the local economy since the scheme began. He added the scheme has helped increase the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland to their highest point so far compared to pre-pandemic levels. ""It gives a few days to get out and get them spent - it's in our interest and in business' interest to get money back into local economy and get those cards spent,"" he added. Thousands waiting for High Street Â£100 voucher Advice group 'being called all time' over card problems Retail NI chief Glyn Roberts said ""it was only right"" the minister extended the deadline because there was ""a small but significant amount of cards that hadn't been dispatched"". ""This is a very short-term boost for many of those traders, but it still helps them, as a lot of retailers are still trying to pay off the last lockdown,"" Mr Roberts told BBC Radio Foyle.. Every resident in Northern Ireland aged 18 and over has been offered a Â£100 voucher from the Northern Ireland Executive, in an effort to encourage consumer spending and give the local economy a boost. The Â£145m High Street voucher scheme was introduced by Stormont ministers to help bricks-and-mortar businesses recover from the disruption to trade caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The aim was to increase footfall in high streets, which have been badly affected by lockdowns, but the cards can be spent in a variety of businesses. The pre-paid cards have been arriving through letterboxes since early October Just over 1.436m applications have been received to date by Stormont's Department for Economy, which is responsible for running the voucher scheme. At the outset, the department had estimated about 1.4m people would qualify under its rules. By Wednesday afternoon, 1,339,500 people had been ""approved"" for a Spend Local card - just 500 short of the department's 1.4m estimate. A spokesman for the Department for the Economy said more than 99% of cards had been delivered. On Thursday, the department said cards have been delivered to 99% of applicants and 10,000 cards are currently out for delivery this week. It said the delay in dispatching some cards is due to a number of reasons including applicants submitting evidence late; errors in applications; late submissions and some applications identified as duplicates before being verified. The High Street voucher schemeopened for applications on 27 September and saw huge demandin the early days of operation, with almost 500,000 requests on the first day. The original cut-off date for spending the voucher had been 30 November, but that deadline was later extended to 19 December after problems administering some cards. In total, the public as a whole were given just over 11 weeks to spend their voucher. However, not everyone received their cards as quickly as had been expected and many are still waiting. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has been promoting the voucher scheme in recent weeks There have been several problems administering the unprecedented scheme which has delayed the delivery of thousands of the requested vouchers. At the start, the department said cards were expected to arrive by post between seven and 10 days after an application was submitted, with everyone getting at least a month to spend the money. However, there were initial problems with the application page on the NI Direct website with some users complaining the site crashed after 500,000 people tried to apply on the first day. By late October, thedepartment said it could not automatically verify the identity of about 100,000 applicants,externalfrom existing data and had to contact them to request more information. There have also been complaints from a small number of users whose cards were rejected when they tried to pay in shops and other businesses. Last month,the charity Advice NI said it was taking phone calls ""all the time""from people having problems with the Â£100 Spend Local cards. The department said some of the reasons for delays included applications being incorrectly identified as duplicates. It also received 1,500 late submissions. ""To date more than Â£118m has been injected into the local economy as a result of this scheme,"" the Department for the Economy said in a statement on Wednesday. It added: ""Encouraging figures from the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium have also shown that footfall on our high streets has significantly improved compared to other areas of the UK."" Spend Local cards can be used to pay for goods and services at any business with a premises in Northern Ireland, as long as they have the equipment to accept card transactions. However, the cards cannot be used for online shopping or to fund gambling. They also cannot be used to withdraw cash or to settle fines such as parking tickets. After receiving your voucher by post, you will be issued with a PIN code which you will need in order to you use your card for the first time. After that it can be used for contactless payments. It is a matter of ""use or lose it"" as all Spend Local cards are due to expire on 19 December 2021 and cannot be used after this date. The Department for the Economy said any unspent money remaining on cards after the deadline will return to its coffers. It said it ""encourages everyone to fully spend their card right up to the scheme closing date"". Yes. The Department for the Economy stopped accepting new applications at midnight on 25 October 2021. Many applicants were also asked for extra documentation to verify their identity and the deadline for submitting this information was midnight on Friday 12 November.

With her parents living abroad and no possibility of moving home, she described her financial situation as ""bleak"". Then, her mother fell ill. ""I was having to budget myself immensely to try and save as much of my student loan to avoid homelessness after graduating,"" she said. ""The hardship fund literally helped me not be homeless after university and meant I could go see my mum after almost losing her."" Now in full-time work, the ""huge stress and anxiety"" of financial difficulties last year continues to affect her mental health. ""I am under constant fear to save as much as possible so that I don't ever end up in fear of being homeless again,"" she said. Website tackles 'toxic' student rental market Student sex workers 'made hundreds of pounds' Student 'horror' homes infested with rats and damp UUK said a large proportion of the increase in requests had come from students from low-income households and those paying for private accommodation they had been unable to access in lockdowns. Applications from postgraduate and international students also increased because of a lack of access to maintenance support and a loss of part-time work opportunities. Restrictions affecting the retail and hospitality industries meant many could not work during term-time or earn money to save during university holidays. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced a four-week ""stay at home"" orderin England, on 31 October 2020. England then went into a tier system of restrictions, before athird national lockdown was announcedin early January. A second survey, in March, found the number of applications had continued to rise. A spokeswoman for UUK - which represents about 115 universities in England and 25 across the rest of the UK - said students had shown ""extraordinary resilience"" and ""for some, these financial difficulties are likely to be ongoing"". ""Universities have done all they can to step up support for these students, including using hardship funds, offering food vouchers, supporting students encountering digital poverty, and investing in mental health and wellbeing services,"" she said. She added universities were working to make students aware of support services and urged those struggling to contact their institution. Research by the National Union of Students suggests about a fifth of students were in part-time employment in January, compared with about a third in September. Larissa Kennedy joined staff and students striking outside King's College London this month. The union's president, Larissa Kennedy, said: ""The funding available for those hoping to access education is not designed to cover the cost of living, meaning students are under extreme financial pressure."" She urged the government to bring back maintenance grants, introduce a rent cap and ""redress exploitative housing costs"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""No student should have to worry unduly about their financial situation whilst they are focusing on their studies. ""This government made an additional Â£85m of funding available to universities for the 2020-21 academic year, which targeted students in the greatest need, for example those struggling with additional costs from having to maintain accommodation in more than one location due to the pandemic. ""This was on top of an existing Â£256m that universities could draw on towards student hardship funds.""

"Netherlands to buy iconic Rembrandt self-portraitThe Dutch government puts aside â¬150m for the 1636 work, currently owned by the Rothschild family.Europe","The Netherlands government says it is planning to buy an iconic self-portrait of the 17th Century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn. It is seeking parliamentary approval for the purchase of the Standard Bearer, a work seen as hugely important for Dutch culture and history. The 1636 masterpiece has been owned by private collectors including the Rothschilds for centuries. It will go on tour before being displayed in Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum. ""The Standard Bearer is coming home for good after a journey of several centuries,"" Culture Minister Ingrid van Engelshoven said in a statement. The government is setting aside â¬150m (Â£129m; $170m) for the painting, while the museum's fund will add a further â¬10m and the Rembrandt Association â¬15m. The painting shows Rembrandt in the costume of a standard bearer who led troops into battle in the Eighty Years War, which culminated in the independence of the Netherlands in 1648. It was shown at an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in 2019. The Standard Bearer has been owned by a French branch of the Rothschild family since 1844, and France has declared it a national treasure.

The Romanian authorities say that the shipments, labelled as second-hand goods, were really just worthless junk destined for landfill. Millions can be made from this so-called waste crime - because itâs cheaper to send junk abroad and dump it, than to pay to have it properly disposed of at home.

New Zealand law aims to phase out smokingNo New Zealander born after 2008 will be able to buy tobacco under proposed new health laws.Asia,"Anyone born after 2008 will not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime New Zealand will ban the sale of tobacco to its next generation, in a bid to eventually phase out smoking. Anyone born after 2008 will not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime, under a law expected to be enacted next year. ""We want to make sure young people never start smoking,"" Health Minister Dr Ayesha Verall said. The move is part of a sweeping crackdown on smoking announced by New Zealand's health ministry on Thursday. Doctors and other health experts in the country have welcomed the ""world-leading"" reforms, which will reduce access to tobacco and restrict nicotine levels in cigarettes. ""It will help people quit or switch to less harmful products, and make it much less likely that young people get addicted to nicotine,"" said Prof Janet Hook from the University of Otago. The crackdown has been met with mixed reactions. ""I reckon it's a good move, really,"" one man told Reuters news agency. ""Because right now there's a lot of young kids walking around with smokes in their mouth. Public are asking how they're getting these smokes. ""And it's also good for myself too because I can save more money."" However, others have warned that the move may create a black market for tobacco - something the health ministry's official impact statement does acknowledge, noting ""customs will need more resource to enforce border control"". ""This is all 100% theory and 0% substance,"" Sunny Kaushal, chairman of the Dairy and Business Owners Group, a lobby group for local convenience stores, told New Zealand's Stuff news site. ""There's going to be a crime wave. Gangs and criminals will fill the gap"". Dog sniffs out hole in a wall cigarette stash Smoking surge in young during Covid lockdown New Zealand is determined to achieve a national goal of reducing its national smoking rate to 5% by 2025, with the aim of eventually eliminating it altogether. At the moment, 13% of New Zealand's adults smoke, with the rate much higher among the indigenous Maori population, where it soars to almost a third. Maori also suffer a higher rate of disease and death. New Zealand's health ministry says smoking causes one in four cancers and remains the leading cause of preventable death for its five million strong population. The industry has been the target of legislators for more than a decade now. As part of the crackdown announced on Thursday, the government also introduced major tobacco controls, including significantly restricting where cigarettes can be sold to remove them from supermarkets and corner stores. The number of shops authorised to sell cigarettes will be drastically reduced to under 500 from about 8,000 now, officials say. In recent years, vaping - smoking e-cigarettes which produce a vapour that also delivers nicotine - has become far more popular among younger generations than cigarettes. New Zealand health authorities warn however, that vaping is not harmless. Researchers have found hazardous, cancer-causing agents in e-cigarette liquids as well.

Elizabeth Holmes: I 'never' lied to investors,"Elizabeth Holmes and her partner Billy Evans make their way to court, where jurors heard the former CEO's explanations for her company's failure Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes testified she ""never"" lied to investors as her defence team rested its case in her criminal fraud trial. Ms Holmes, 37, pleaded not guilty to charges she lied about her firm, including that its technology could detect diseases with a few drops of blood. Prosecutors say she knowingly duped investors and patients. Her defence says she was merely a naÃ¯ve businesswoman whose firm failed. Ms Holmes faces 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Over seven days of testimony, Ms Holmes acknowledged mistakes were made, but insisted she did not defraud investors or patients. Asked by her lawyer on Wednesday if she ever led patients to believe Theranos could offer health testing services she knew it didn't, she replied: ""Of course not."" The firm, at one point valued at $9bn (Â£6.5bn), was once the start-up darling of Silicon Valley thanks to its promise to revolutionise the healthcare industry. But Theranos began to unravel in 2016 after a Wall Street Journal investigation reported that its core blood-testing technology did not work. Prosecutors are trying to convince the jury that Ms Holmes knew she was deceiving people. Under cross-examination, she conceded that there were errors in a 2014 Fortune magazine cover story by journalist Roger Parloff, which helped lift the young founder to stardom. On Tuesday, Assistant US Attorney Robert Leach showed Ms Holmes a line in the story, which said the company offered more than 200 diagnostic tests using the Theranos technology. Asked by Mr Leach if she would agree that statement was incorrect, Ms Holmes replied: ""I believe that now."" Ms Holmes testified last week that by 2014, Theranos had started to use third-party machines for most of its blood tests. She had no clear explanation for why investors were given a revenue projection of nearly $1bn in 2015, when internal estimates were much lower - around $113m. And she disputed claims that she lied to potential investors about Theranos devices being used in military helicopters. ""My testimony is I don't think I said that,"" she said. Ms Holmes' defence team countered with descriptions of a dogged worker, who poured her life into a product she believed would change lives. And Ms Holmes directed blame toward Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, her former boyfriend and former Theranos executive. Ms Holmes has accused Mr Balwani, 19 years her senior, of emotional and sexual abuse. She described an intense relationship, in which Mr Balwani controlled how she ran Theranos, who she spoke to, how she spoke to them, and what she ate. He has denied the allegations. Their decade-long relationship came to an end around the same time he stepped down as CEO in May 2016. Mr Balwani will be stand trial next year, but has said that he would invoke his constitutional right to remain silent if he was called to testify in the trial. Ms Holmes, seen here with former US President Bill Clinton and former chief executive of Alibaba, was once seen as the next Steve Jobs While much of her story is already known to the public, some of her testimony has surprised observers. She testified last week to being raped while a student at Stanford University. The assault led her to drop out of school, she said, and focus on her company full-time. ""I decided to put myself into building Theranos,"" she told the court through tears. ""I decided that I was going to build a life by building this company."" Closing arguments are expected to take place on 16 and 17 December, with jury deliberations to follow.

How will Plan B affect the economy?,"Faced with the threat of cases of the new Omicron variant of Covid doubling every two to three days, the prime minister has imposed a new set of restrictions in England. They include increased requirements for mask-wearing, more working from home and proof of vaccination or Covid status at nightclubs and crowded indoor spaces. How will these measures - which the government calls Plan B - affect an economy which is still recovering from the impact of previous waves? The measures announced on Wednesday for England are much less stringent than those announced last winter. Similar measures are already in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with tougher ones in many other European countries. Covid: Should I be working from home now? Omicron: What are the new Plan B rules for England? Economies around the world have got used to operating under Covid restrictions. Businesses have adapted and workers learned how to operate from home. Many never went back to the office. Around a third of working adults in Great Britain work from home part of the time, according to the Office for National Statistics. Just over half travel to work every day, a figure that has risen steadily since restrictions were lifted in the spring. Data from Remit Consulting showed offices were at just 22% of pre-lockdown occupancy levels last week. The second lockdown in January 2021 had only one-fifth of the impact on economic output of the first lockdowns, says Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC. On the impact of Plan B on the economy as a whole, ""I would imagine that it will be pretty limited,"" he says. For individual companies in particular sectors, the impact could be more severe. Bars, restaurants, hotels and leisure industries have been badly hit by previous lockdowns and staff shortages - and Plan B could cause further problems. The Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs, hasalready warned of a ""devastating impact"". It claims that Covid passports in Scotland and Wales have already reduced attendance at nightclubs. Matthew Fell, policy director at the CBI, said: ""Fresh restrictions are a big setback for businesses, particularly for those in hospitality and retail who are in a critical trading period, as well as others such as transport."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the rise of the Omicron variant showed why the UK needed ""a permanent short-time working scheme - ready to go when a new crisis hits"". Nightclubs have warned that new restrictions could have a ""devastating"" impact If office workers stay home, it will hurt the businesses which cater to their needs - from the shops that sell lunches to the dry cleaners who press their suits. PwC estimates the economic impact of home working, from lost custom at those businesses and from the benefits of sharing ideas in work settings, at Â£15bn a year. The new measures will hit an economy already feeling the effects of the Omicron wave. There are signs that people are already responding to the news about the new variant and restricting their own behaviour. Figures compiled by Pantheon Macroeconomics show small falls in the numbers of people booking tables in restaurants, going to the cinema, going shopping or searching for information about pubs, gyms and hairdressers on Google since the news about Omicron emerged. ""It seems that consumers' confidence has been knocked back by news of the new variant,"" wrote Pantheon's chief economist Samuel Tombs in the research note. There are already widespread reports ofChristmas parties and events being cancelled. The furlough scheme helped to protect millions of jobs in industries such as restaurants The timing of the emergence of Omicron is particularly unfortunate for shops, restaurants and bars that rely on the festive period for a large proportion of their profits. The most significant measures to support businesses and workers through earlier waves, such as the furlough scheme and the Self-employment Income Support scheme, have been withdrawn. Trade unions have called for furlough to be reintroduced, but the government has confirmed that no new economic support package is being planned. The purpose of new restrictions is to contain the spread of the virus. If they reduce infections, deaths and long-term sickness, they should help to minimise the economic damage it creates. Governments have to balance the short-term impact with the long-term benefit. ""If it is done at the right time, it is a good thing,"" says PwC's Mr Gillham. ""It is a case of acting early enough and decisively enough for the measures to have the impact they are supposed to. That timing is very difficult to get right."" In some areas, the impact of Plan B was felt before it was even announced. The pound hit its lowest level of the year against the dollar on Wednesday - and newspaper reports of Plan B were ""definitely"" a factor, says Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank. The pound often falls when investors think the Bank of England is less likely to put up interest rates. A member of the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, Michael Saunders, said last week that there might be ""advantages"" to waiting for more data on how the Omicron wave develops. And the imposition of new restrictions could be seen as another reason to delay a rate rise, Ms Foley said. Any delay in the first rate rise will be a relief to households on variable mortgages. But if the pound stays weak, that could contribute to faster increases in the cost of imported goods and energy. The biggest unknown hanging over the economy is the course of the Omicron variant. Although it is spreading fast, we still don't know whether it will cause increased levels of severe sickness and death, and how much protection vaccines will bring. Therefore it's impossible to know how long the latest measures will be necessary for, or whether further restrictions will need to be introduced.

Bird flu at 'phenomenal level' in UK - chief vet,"Thousands of farmed birds have been culled. The UK's chief veterinary officer has told the BBC there is a ""phenomenal level"" of avian flu in the UK. Tens of thousands of farmed birds have already been culled, as the "" largest number of premises ever"" in an avian influenza outbreak are infected. Officials say the risk to human health is low - there is no link to the Covid-19 pandemic -  but infected birds should not be touched. ""It has huge human, animal, and trade implications,"" the chief vet said. Lessons learned from the foot-and-mouth outbreak are being used to try to control the outbreak, Dr Christine Middlemiss added. As ofWednesday,externalthere were 38 confirmed infected premises in the UK - 31 in England, three in Wales, two in Scotland, and two in Northern Ireland. The total last year was 26 confirmed cases. The disease is largely spread by migratory wild birds which return to Britain and pass it on to other birds. Dr Middlemiss said the UK was only a few weeks into the migratory season, which normally goes on until March. ""We are going to need to keep up these levels of heightened biosecurity for all that time."" An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone was declared across the UK on 3 November. It was extended on 29 November, requiring all bird owners to keep the animals indoors. Dr Middlemiss said there was a high level of infection in wild birds returning from the north of Russia and the east of Europe, where they spent the summer. The advice from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), is that the risk to human health from the avian flu A(H5N1) virus is ""very low"". However, members of the public are strongly advised not to touch diseased birds. The availability of eggs in supermarkets is unlikely to be affected, said Dr Middlemiss, because the number of farms affected is low compared to overall egg production. Turkeys have been culled in a North Yorkshire farm ""Whilst we're happy that there are not going to be any food supply issues, because of the overall large number of chickens and eggs and things we produce, it is devastating for those individual companies involved. It's also devastating for people who keep yard flocks."" The types of premises infected have ranged from bird sanctuaries and small flocks kept in gardens or yards, up to very large commercial farms. Peregrine falcons, curlews, barnacle geese and herring gulls are some of the wild bird species to have been found dead or dying from the disease. Where a case is confirmed after testing by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) biosecurity control zones are set up and the infected birds killed. In some commercial farms, more than 10 thousand birds have had to be destroyed. Thefirst detection,externalof the H5N1 strain this season was in rescued swans and captive poultry at a swan sanctuary in Worcester on 15 October. In November dead swans were found around the centre of Stratford-on-Avon and the Diglis Basin in Worcester; footpaths were blocked off and the public urged not to feed the animals. In Belfast the disease was confirmed in wild birds in an urban area. There have been other outbreaks in nature reserves in Scotland. Dr Middlemiss emphasised that ""the absolute key"" was biosecurity. She said that chicken sheds should be kept ""as clean as a surgical theatre"", which would reduce the chance of wild birds either directly or indirectly coming into contact with kept birds. Biosecurity measures, she said, had been learned from the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 when more than 2,000 cases of the disease in farms across the UK led to the culling of six million cows and sheep. However, foot-and-mouth was spread by cattle-to-cattle contact. Avian flu is being largely spread by wild birds, over which there can be ""very little control"". The clinical sign of infection is that birds tend to go off their food and water, then develop respiratory problems, eye discharges and sneezing. Then they can display nervous signs, like twisted necks. Dr Middlemiss said, ""We're not on our own. There are a large number of outbreaks across the EU happening. This is a different strain to last year. We do need to understand why we are seeing more year-on-year outbreaks, and understand what's behind that. She said she wanted to understand the pattern: ""We can't wait until another year and have an even bigger outbreak. So, we will be working not just with our own scientists but internationally, to understand more of what we can do about what's behind it."" The RSPB said: ""Everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, regularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands.""

Working from home: 'It will be painful',"Clive Watson says office parties are now being cancelled Hospitality firms have warned they face a collapse in demand at their busiest time of year due to the government's new work-from-home guidance. The measures, designed to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, come in from Monday. One trade body called them a ""body blow"" to already-struggling pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues. Pub chain boss Clive Watson said some pubs could ""run out of cash"" without extra help from the government. However, the government is not planning any new economic support measures. Mr Watson said the City Pub Company, which has 44 sites in England and Wales, was just starting to get back on its feet after a rough 18 months. But he said the government was ""turning off the life support machine yet again"" by bringing back home-working. New rules on home working and masks in England What's the new guidance on working from home? How will Plan B affect the economy? ""From about 10 days ago office parties started to get cancelled [because of Omicron]. Going forward after yesterday's announcement that is only going to accelerate,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""What government has got to appreciate is for businesses, particularly in our sector, Christmas is always a key time."" The City Pub Company makes about a third of its annual profits in December, which tides it over in the quiet months of January and February. Hospitality firms fear losing vital passing trade as more people work from home. Businesses from dry cleaners to coffee houses depend on an office crowd, particularly in city centres. By contrast, those that cater to people in their homes, such as takeaways and supermarkets stand to gain from the new guidance. We talked to firms that rely on commuters about how the new home-working guidance will affect them. Passing trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abrahamovitch David Abrahamovitch runs Grind, a chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London, employing 250 staff. He also has a successful online store selling compostable coffee pods for Nespresso machines, and says he can ""fall back"" on that side of the business if things get tough. ""A lot of other hospitality businesses won't have that, so we're lucky,"" he told the BBC. ""But it will still be painful to watch the company go into reverse gear again."" Grind relies on people coming into central London and has also has seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since Omicron emerged, which Mr Abrahamovitch thinks will get worse. He is nervous about how the landlords he rents his shops from will react if things really slow down. ""They have already given a lot [of leeway in the pandemic], and everyone has their limits. They have businesses to run too."" James Greenhalgh says the uncertainty makes it impossible to plan ahead It's a similar story for James Greenhalgh, owner of the Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds city centre, who says about 50% his trade comes from the local office crowd. ""We've had such a hard time in the pandemic and things were just starting to pick up again. It's just so hard. I've genuinely thought about throwing in the towel."" His thinks the government's approach will stifle business growth. He was just about to agree a lease on bigger second shop but has now put that plan on ice. ""The rules seem to change every week, which makes it impossible for businesses to plan ahead,"" he said. ""The government should have been clear with business owners what might happen if a new variant came along. They should have told us about the contingency plans."" A study from the University of Sheffield suggests city centres stand to lose Â£3bn in 2022 due to more people working from home. Dr Jesse Matheson, lead author of the paper, said: ""This decrease will be concentrated in a few very dense centres; for example, the City of London will experience a spending decrease of 31.6%, and central Birmingham will experience a decrease of 8%. ""Some of this spending will be realised in the residential areas where these workers live, but some may be lost altogether."" Rich Bool was already noticing more staff working from home, even before the latest restrictions. He runs a mobile cafÃ©, making up to 30 trips a day to offices and industrial estates. ""It can be so difficult trying to work out from one week to the next what stocks and sandwiches you need,"" he told the BBC. ""There are just so many variables. More uncertainty is never welcome."" He has, however, learned a lot from previous lockdowns and mass home-working. Having a van means his Chippenham-based Cafe2U service can be nimble, going to where the best custom might be. Mr Bool now even visits some customers at their homes. ""We've built up a trusted relationship with some of our customers when we went to their offices. Now we take our food and drink to a few of them at home,"" he said. ""Obviously it's easy to make your own sandwich. But when you're working from home all the time, sometimes it's good to buy something if it's on your doorstep."" New rules on home working and masks for England How will Plan B affect the economy?

Sending US troops to Ukraine not on table - BidenThe US president says a Western response to a Russian invasion would not include boots on the ground.Europe,"Mr Biden said he was confident Mr Putin got his message US President Joe Biden has said that putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion is ""not on the table"". But Mr Biden warned of severe consequences if Russia did invade. He was speaking a day after two hours of talks by video link with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The virtual summit was aimed at reducing tensions in the region after a major Russian troop build-up along Ukraine's eastern border. Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to Russia. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether President Putin has made a decision. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Putin refused to say whether he would order troops into Ukraine. But he said he could not sit back while the military alliance moved close to Russia. Mr Biden said he had made it clear to Mr Putin during Tuesday's meeting that there would be ""economic consequences like none he's ever seen"". He was confident that the Russian leader got the message, he added. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Putin-Biden talks: What next for Ukraine? But when asked about possible military action, Mr Biden said the US's moral and legal obligations to its Nato allies in the region did not extend to Ukraine, who is not a member of the 30-member organisation. ""The idea that the US is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not on the cards right now,"" he said. The US president said he hoped high-level meetings with Russia and at least four major Nato allies to discuss Russia's concerns would be announced by Friday. Mr Putin spoke from his residence in Sochi The US has not specified what economic consequences it has in mind, but on Tuesday National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Nord Stream 2 - a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany bypassing Ukraine which is not yet in operation - provided ""leverage"" for the US and its allies. Other possible measures include restrictions on Russia's banks converting roubles into foreign currencies, or even disconnecting Russia from the Swift global financial payment system, reports say. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that, while Tuesday's talks brought ""no sensations"", he was grateful for President Biden's ""unwavering support"". More than 90,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. The movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. A large part of the recent Russian military build-up is in Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula which Russia seized from Ukraine and then annexed in 2014. Troops are also gathering near Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which are under the control of Russian-backed separatists. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in seven years of conflict since Russian-backed forces seized large areas of Ukraine's east. By Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter Russia's military option could take a variety of forms from a large incursion, to a significant invasion of the eastern part of Ukraine. One aim would be to bring the main fighting elements of the Ukrainian army to battle and to inflict such a defeat upon them that the Kyiv government has to rethink its position. Invading territory amidst a hostile population has significant risks. Ukraine's armed forces have had some Western weaponry and training and are much improved since 2015. However, Russian forces have also improved over recent years. The firepower Russia is building up is impressive. For all the talk about Ukrainian sovereignty Nato cannot and will not come to Ukraine's aid. And additional weapons supplies might simply contribute to Russia's justification for war.
