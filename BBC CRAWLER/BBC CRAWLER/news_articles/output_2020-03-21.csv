What we don't know about coronavirus deaths,"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

"Buy responsibly and think of others, shoppers told","This video can not be played George Eustice: ""Buying more than you need means that others may be left without"" Shoppers in the UK have been told to ""be responsible"" and think of others such as NHS workers, after panic-buying amid the coronavirus outbreak. Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was more than enough food to go around - but the challenge for shops is keeping shelves stocked. It comes as supermarkets have been overwhelmed by increased purchasing. Another 53 people with coronavirus have died in England, bringing the total of deaths in the country to 220. Meanwhile, cafes, pubs and restaurants across the UK have closed as part of measures to stop the virus spreading. And, on Saturday night, the National Trust announced it was closing its parks and gardens from midnight ""to help restrict the spread of the coronavirus"". ""Frankly we should all be ashamed,"" said Prof Stephen Powis, medical director at NHS England, who said panic-buyers are depriving NHS staff of the supplies they need. ""These are the very people that we all need to look after perhaps us or our loved ones in the weeks to come."" Earlier this week, a critical care nurse made an emotional video appeal for people to stop panic-buying and leave some goods for others who need to stay healthy. This video can not be played Critical care nurse Dawn was driven to despair by the actions of panic-buyers Also speaking at the news conference in Downing Street on Saturday, the head of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, said: ""There is plenty of food in the supply chain."" ""The issue is around people and lorries"" getting food onto shelves quick enough, she said. What are shops doing about stockpiling? She said the food industry was experiencing ""a peak in demand"" like at Christmas, but ""without the four-month build-up period."" ""There is Â£1bn more food in people's houses than there was three weeks ago, so we should make sure we eat some of it,"" she said. Shoppers have been met with empty shelves at stores across the UK There was a large queue of shoppers trying to get into the Costco store in Glasgow on Saturday Tape in a fast food store marks the floor where customers should stand to practice social distancing Mr Eustice said the government recognised it was a ""challenging time"" but that ""buying more than you need means others may be left without."" He added: ""There's no shortage of food. Food manufacturing has geared up to meet an increase in demand and it is up by 50%."" Asked whether he can rule out rationing or ration books, Mr Eustice said it was up to supermarkets to decide whether to put limits on how much of each item shoppers can buy. Some supermarkets have alreadyimposed limitsafter some members of the public started buying items like toilet roll in bulk. And many stores including Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl have said they are hiring thousands of staff to meet the unprecedented demand. Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, said it wants to take on 20,000 temporary workers ""to help feed the nation"". Labour said the government had been too slow and too quiet to reassure people that were was enough food. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Prof Powis, of NHS England, also reiterated the importance of people avoiding social contact. ""It's not for somebody else to follow, it's for you to follow, it's for me to follow, it's for everybody to follow,"" he said. This video can not be played Stephen Powis, NHS England: ""By not stockpiling...our health workers are able to get access to what they need"" ""This is all our problem and if we do it together, it will be an effective strategy. If you do it, you follow the advice, you will be saving somebody's life. ""This is the time in your lifetime whereby your action can save somebody's life. It is as simple and as stark as that.""

The number of people who have died in the UK with coronavirus rose to 233 on Saturday, as cases topped 5,000. It comes as NHS England plans to write to 1.5 million people most at risk. Those at-risk people will receive letters or text messages strongly advising them not to go out for 12 weeks to protect themselves, the government said. They include people who have received organ transplants, are living with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis or specific cancers such as blood or bone marrow.  Italian soldiers have been deployed to patrol across Lombardy Italy's northern Lombardy region has introduced even stricter measures than the rest of the country to try and stop the spread of coronavirus. On Facebook, the regional president Attilio Fontana announced that sport and physical activity in the open air, even on your own, will be banned. Other measures include banning the use of vending machines and suspending all open-air weekly markets. Work on building sites will be stopped apart from those working on hospitals, roads and railways. Of the 793 coronavirus deaths in Italy in the last 24 hours, 546 were in Lombardy. Former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz died on Saturday after being hospitalised with coronavirus. Sanz, 76, was president at the Bernabeu from 1995-2000, a period in which Real won the Champions League twice. ""My father has just died,"" wrote Sanz's son Lorenzo Sanz Duran on Twitter.

As we mentioned earlier, Italy has reported another big increase in the number of deaths of people with coronavirus - 793 in the last 24 hours. It's by far the worst single-day total worldwide since the pandemic began. In total 4,825 people have now died across the country. On average, one coronavirus patient is dying in Italy every two minutes. More than 53,500 people have been diagnosed with the virus nationally, up more than 6,500 since Friday. And that's despite strict measures in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. Here's a visual guide to the pandemic around the world. Bolivia has ordered people to stay at home for the next 14 days, the latest South American country to impose strict restrictions on movement in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""It's a tough but necessary decision for the good of everyone,"" said interim President Jeanine Anez. ""We must be at home for 24 hours a day."" So far, Bolivia has confirmed 19 coronavirus cases. Colombia and Argentina have also imposed similar restrictions. Read more about what Latin American countries are doing in their fight against the virus.

Authorities said they were engaged in aggressive contact tracing and containment strategies to curtail further spread. Meanwhile, the government says it is closing its airspace to all international flights from Monday. The use of passenger trains shall also to be suspended on that day. On the brighter side however, Lagos state governor announced that the Italian man who was the first registered case back on 28 February was discharged from hospital on Friday. During this Saturday's news conference, US President Donald Trump told US citizens to stay at home to help in the fight against coronavirus. A number of US states have already ordered shutdowns with one in five Americans soon set to be under a ""stay at home"" order. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Trump urges US citizens to stay indoors President Trump has now left the news conference at the White House. Before that, he talked about the 2020 Olympic Games, set to begin in Tokyo in late July. He says a decision about whether to postpone the games will be made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe soon. ""Prime Minister Abe has a big decision to make. Theyâve built one of the most beautiful venues Iâve ever seen... Itâs his decision and I know he is going to make it soon, I donât know what itâs going to be and I didnât think I should be influencing it. ""The job that Japan has done on that venue is incredible,"" he adds, calling the stadium âflawless"", ""beautiful"" and ""on-budget"". France has reported 112 more deaths from coronavirus, bringing the country's death toll to 562, according to the health ministry. ""Why arenât we sanitising masks,"" President Trump asks, adding: ""We have very good liquids to do this."" He says some mask designs ""donât lend themselves"" to this, and that heâs studied all the different mask designs. In New York, doctors and nurses have reportedly only been given one mask to use per week, and have taken to using hand sanitiser in an effort to keep them clean. Health officials recommend throwing away masks between patients. US President Donald Trump is still taking questions from reporters at the White House. He says his business, the Trump Organization, has been taking a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. He mentions that other hotel chains, such as the Hilton, have also been suffering. ""I guess, I havenât even asked, that Mar-a-lago is closed down,"" he says. ""As far as the hotels, I would probably do what everybody else is doing. You have to close things up. You donât want people to get together."" The spending bill being worked out by Congress is going to be ""really something very special,"" says President Donald Trump. ""Itâs gonna help people,"" he said about the stimulus bill that is forecast to be worth over $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn). ""We had the greatest economy in the history of the world and then we hit this problem,"" he says. Stock markets have shed all of the gains earned in the three years of the Trump presidency, economists said on Friday. ""Weâre doing this package, the likes of which nobody has ever done before,"" Mr Trump adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

What we can learn from Asia in our fight against the virus,"Some Asian countries have useful lessons for the West - as well as a preview of what challenges could follow The number of coronavirus cases in the West is skyrocketing, and countries have announced drastic measures, including school closures and lockdowns. The outbreak hit many countries in Asia several weeks earlier - and some places have been praised for containing the number of infections. For example, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan all kept case numbers relatively low - despite their proximity to mainland China. What did they do differently - and are there any lessons for other countries? Health experts agree on the same measures for containing the outbreak - test widely, isolate those infected, and encourage social distancing. Such measures are being adopted to varying degrees in the West now - but a key difference is that many countries didn't act as quickly. ""The UK and US lost an opportunity,"" says Tikki Pangestu, a former director of research policy at the World Health Organization (WHO). ""They had two months from what happened in China, yet there was this perception that 'China is very far away and nothing's going to happen'."" This video can not be played A doctor who became a patient describes what it's like to get tested for coronavirus China first reported cases of ""mysterious Sars-like pneumonia"" to the WHO on 31 December. At this point there was no confirmed human-to-human transmission, and little was known about the virus, but within three days Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong had all stepped up screening at border points - Taiwan even checked passengers on flights from Wuhan before they got off the plane. As scientists learned more about the virus, it became apparent that people without symptoms could still be contagious. So testing would be crucial. This video can not be played 60 days of coronavirus in the US - in 60 seconds Cases in South Korea spiked initially. However, it swiftly developed a test for the virus - andhas now tested more than 290,000 people,external. It conducts about 10,000 tests daily for free. ""The way they stepped up and screened the population was really remarkable,"" says Ooi Eng Eong, a professor in emerging infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore. South Korea had a rapid approvals system in place for infectious disease tests, following an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory syndrome in 2015 that left 35 dead. Is S Korea's rapid testing the key to coronavirus? Why US testing failed - and can it catch up now? By contrast, testing in the US was delayed - initial test kits were faulty, and private laboratories found it hard to get their tests approved. Many people struggled to get a test, and they were expensive. Eventually, free testing for everyone was passed in law. Meanwhile, the UK has said that only those in hospital will be routinely tested. That makes it harder to identify cases with milder symptoms. Prof Pangestu recognises that in some countries there aren't enough test kits. However, he describes extensive testing as ""the most important priority"", adding that ""testing those who are symptomatic but not necessarily hospitalised and still spreading the virus is perhaps even more important"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash It's not enough to just test those with symptoms - tracing those with whom they were in contact has been key. In Singapore, detectives have contact-traced more than 6,000 people - locating individuals with CCTV footage, testing them, and ordering them to self-isolate until their results are clear. In Hong Kong, contact tracing goes back to two days before someone develops symptoms. How Singapore stayed one step ahead of the virus They have also adopted intrusive ways of ensuring that those ordered to self-isolate actually stay at home. In Hong Kong, new arrivals from abroad are required to wear electronic bracelets to track their movements, while in Singapore those self-isolating are contacted several times a day, and required to send photographic proof of their whereabouts. Singapore has even deployed the armed forces in contact-tracing Singapore has hefty penalties - including jail terms - for anyone who breaks a ""stay at home"" order. It stripped one offender of his residency rights. Many countries in the West will find it hard to adopt such measures due to their larger populations, and greater civil liberties. ""We can do what we did because we're small,"" says Prof Ooi. ""To replicate what we're doing in its entirety would not make sense, it has to be adapted to suit each country."" Social distancing is considered one of the best ways of containing an outbreak. In Hong Kong, many busy streets fell quiet But the later the measures are introduced, the more extreme they need to be to work. In Wuhan, China, where the virus is thought to have started, five million people had left the city before the shutdown began. This led to the government imposing the biggest quarantine in human history. Both Italy and Spain were forced to introduce national lockdowns after their case numbers rose to the thousands. New York and California have ordered residents to stay at home, except for essential trips like buying groceries. By contrast, schools are still running in Singapore, although large public gatherings have been cancelled. In Hong Kong, schools have been closed and workers encouraged to work from home - but restaurants and bars remain open. Prof Ooi believes the difference is down to how quick governments were to implement social distancing. ""By the time a lot of countries had stepped up control measures, the number of cases was so large"" that drastic steps were needed, he says. Social distancing is affected by government decisions to ban gatherings or close schools, but it also depends on people being willing to take part. That's why public messaging - and individual attitudes - matter. ""Unless you get the co-operation of the public, your policies may not be adhered to, and enforcement only goes so far,"" says Prof Pangestu. ""The important thing is to show that policies are based on scientific evidence."" China came under fire for being slow to acknowledge the outbreak. It allowed a large political gathering to take place in Wuhan even as concerns grew. The authorities also punished doctors who tried to warn others - sparking fury after one died from the virus. The outbreak has led to people stocking up on food supplies It has since been praised for effectively slowing the spread of the virus, after imposing a massive lockdown and upscaling its hospital capacity. But critics say such extreme measures were only required because its initial response was slow. Coronavirus kills Chinese whistleblower doctor China and the virus that threatens everything In the US, President Donald Trump has often contradicted health officials about the severity of the outbreak and the number of test kits available. The government has also been unable to provide information on the number of people who have been tested, as many private laboratories have not been feeding data to the CDC. ""Outbreak response involves being transparent - that stops people panicking and hoarding things,"" says Prof Ooi. Some governments have used technology to update residents in great detail. Hong Kong provides an online dashboard of all cases - which includes a map that shows the individual buildings where cases were found. South Korea issues mobile alerts letting people know if they were in the vicinity of a patient. Are South Korea's virus alerts too revealing? In Singapore, the government has been praised for its clear communications on coronavirus, including a speech by the prime minister which encouraged people to stop panic buying. Its measures have had widespread public support - helped by the fact Singapore has a long history of emphasising collective responsibility for national security. And Singaporean media does not tend to challenge the official line. It's far too simplistic to say, as some have, that Asians are more likely to comply with government orders. In Hong Kong, public trust in the government is low - and there have been months of anti-government protests. But, in one of the densest cities in the world,many have voluntarily socially distanced themselves,external- with some even avoiding Lunar New Year gatherings, the equivalent of skipping Christmas events. Prof Pangestu believes that while Hong Kongers do not trust the government, ""they are very proud of Hong Kong, and see the outbreak as a threat to [the territory's] identity"". One survey suggests 98% of people in Hong Kong wore facemasks in public due to the outbreak Meanwhile, Karin Huster, a Seattle-based nurse and emergency field co-ordinator for Doctors Without Borders, spent a month in Hong Kong working on coronavirus training. She noticed many there had a strong ""individual sense of responsibility"" because they remembered the 2003 Sars outbreak that hit the territory particularly hard. That's also seen in the prevalent use of masks in part of Asia, which Ms Huster says is seen as a sign of ""respect towards others"". She noticed that occasionally people would avoid getting into a lift with her because she was not wearing a mask. By contrast,in much of the West, people have specifically been told not to wear masksunless they are ill, and many Asians have experienced harassment while wearing one. Experts in Asia agree that masks are far less effective than measures like hand washing, and that where supplies are limited, they should be left for healthcare workers. But there are different opinions over whether wearing a mask is worthwhile. Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiology professor at the University of Hong Kong, argues: ""Masks are not a magic bullet against coronavirusâ¦ but if everybody wears face masks, it probably can help, along with all the other measures [like hand washing and social distancing], to reduce transmission. ""The evidence base is quite thin, but we presume they have some effect, because that's the protection we give to healthcare workers."" This video can not be played US students on spring break defy COVID-19 warnings When it comes to social distancing, Ms Huster says: ""I think in America, people are so individualistic - it's going to be a little harder for us to sacrifice our 'freedom'."" She previously worked on the Ebola outbreak, where people were also required to wash hands more frequently and socially distance, and says the biggest challenge ""was making people understand the need to change the way they were doing things"". Experts believe the more aggressive measures being put in place in Western countries will successfully slow the rate of transmissions over time. But, to get a sense of their next challenge after that, they could also look ahead to Asia. Despite having contained the virus,China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong are now facing a second coronavirus wave, fuelled by people entering their borders. And it's not clear how long this outbreak could go on for. Prof Ooi is optimistic, as new infection numbers started falling within two to three weeks of lockdown in Hubei province. While China's shutdown was ""drastic"", he believes countries with softer measures should also be able to contain the outbreak within weeks. ""It should serve as inspiration for other countries right now - it's painful but it can be done."" By contrast, Prof Cowling worries that if a lockdown ends too early, local transmissions could start again. ""I don't know if social distancing can be sustained for the kind of time they need to be sustained. We can't really relax until there's a vaccine - which could take about 18 months,"" but ""people in Hong Kong are already a bit tired after two months."" ""Prolonged lockdowns are damaging for the economy, while an epidemic is damaging to public healthâ¦ there's not a lot of good choices."" How prepared is the US?

NHS deal will provide thousands of extra beds,"The private sector will reallocate almost its entire national hospital capacity in the first of its kind deal The NHS has struck a deal with private hospitals to acquire thousands of extra beds, ventilators and medical staff to fight the coronavirus outbreak. An extra 8,000 hospital beds across England, nearly 1,200 ventilators and almost 20,000 fully qualified staff will be available from next week. It comes as the number of people in the UK to die with coronavirus rose to 233. The agreement will see the private sector reallocate almost its entire national hospital capacity to the NHS. The extra resources will also help the NHS deliver other urgent treatments. According tothe latest figures,,externalthere are more than 5,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. The number of people with coronavirus who have died is now 220 in England, seven in Scotland, five in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The most recent 53 deaths in England were people aged 41 to 94 who had underlying health conditions, NHS England said. When will the coronavirus outbreak end? Coronavirus information: What should I do? Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? In pictures: First day of cafe and pub shutdown In London, the extra resources includes more than 2,000 hospital beds and more than 250 operating theatres and critical beds. The additional staff includes 10,000 nurses, more than 700 doctors and more than 8,000 other clinical staff, who will be joining the health service to help manage an expected surge in cases, said NHS England. Earlier this week, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met NHS 111 staff who had been taking calls from the public Chief executive Sir Simon Stevens hailed the deal with the private sector. He said: ""We're dealing with an unprecedented global health threat and are taking immediate and exceptional action to gear up. ""The NHS is doing everything in its power to expand treatment capacity and is working with partners right across the country to do so."" Under the terms of the deal, the private sector will be reimbursed at cost, meaning no profit will be made for doing so. ""Open book"" accounting and external auditors will verify the public funds being deployed. The NHS often uses private sector facilities when the need arises. But the mass purchasing of these resources is unprecedented. The ventilators will be crucial in helping the sickest. Just over 4% of people who developed symptoms are likely to need hospital care - and a third of those intensive care support. There are nearly 4,000 adult critical care beds in England currently. These extra ventilators will add to the hundreds freed up by the move to cancel routine operations from April, as well as steps to source others from elsewhere including the Ministry of Defence and old and new stocks. David Hare, chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, said: ""We have worked hand-in-hand with the NHS for decades and will do whatever it takes to support the NHS in responding to this pandemic."" He added the independent sector ""stands ready"" to maintain that support for as long as needed. Shoppers told to buy responsibly What could the West learn from Asia Five reasons to find hope amid Coronavirus chaos Shortly after the NHS announcement, Spire Healthcare released a statement confirming it had signed up to assist NHS England for a minimum of 14 weeks. The independent UK hospital group said it would spend the first week preparing staff and facilities before making all its 35 hospitals in England available to the NHS from 30 March. It added that it would be suspending all non-urgent elective surgery for patients over the age of 70 and vulnerable patients from 5:00 GMT on 20 March. The NHS deal comes as a consultant warned thatfrontline NHS staff risked ""cross infecting everybody"" because they are not getting the recommended protective equipment. The face mask, short gloves and apron worn by NHS staff is far short of the World Health Organization recommendations, said Dr Lisa Anderson of St George's Hospital in London. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Earlier this week, professional health bodieswrote to 65,000 former doctors and nurseswho have left the NHS in the last three years, asking them to rejoin the workforce. Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed Saturday's announcement and praised the ""heroes returning to the front line"". On Tuesday, NHS England announced that its hospitals across the country would be taking a range of actions to prepare, including freeing up 30,000 of the overall 100,000 beds available by postponing non-urgent operations and providing care in the community for those who are fit to be discharged. The NHS is also sourcing up to 10,000 beds in independent and community hospitals, which this deal largely now delivers.

As we mentioned earlier, Italy has reported another big increase in the number of deaths of people with coronavirus - 793 in the last 24 hours. It's by far the worst single-day total worldwide since the pandemic began. In total 4,825 people have now died across the country. On average, one coronavirus patient is dying in Italy every two minutes. More than 53,500 people have been diagnosed with the virus nationally, up more than 6,500 since Friday. And that's despite strict measures in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. Here's a visual guide to the pandemic around the world. Bolivia has ordered people to stay at home for the next 14 days, the latest South American country to impose strict restrictions on movement in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Before that, he talked about the 2020 Olympic Games, set to begin in Tokyo in late July. He says a decision about whether to postpone the games will be made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe soon. ""Prime Minister Abe has a big decision to make. Theyâve built one of the most beautiful venues Iâve ever seen...

In a news conference on Saturday night, he said the risk was ""everywhere"", urging people to stay indoors. He called the country's measures to curb the virus one of the strictest in Europe. Mr SÃ¡nchez also praised the response of his compatriots to the crisis, one week into the state of emergency. Spain has recorded 24,926 cases with 1,326 deaths. Scotland's Rural Economy and Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing has said he is ""furious"" at the ""reckless and irresponsible behaviour"" of people travelling to the Scottish Highlands and Islands during the coronavirus pandemic. His comments come after reports of people in campervans trying to find solace from outbreaks elsewhere across the UK. ""This has to stop now. Let me be crystal clear, people should not be travelling to rural and island communities full stop,"" Mr Ewing said in a statement. ""They are endangering lives. Do not travel. âPanic buying will have a devastating impact on the livelihoods of rural shops and potentially puts unwanted pressure on NHS services in our rural communities."" Kate Forbes, Scotland's finance secretary and a Highlands MSP, has also hit-out at those travelling. Read more here Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Before that, he talked about the 2020 Olympic Games, set to begin in Tokyo in late July. He says a decision about whether to postpone the games will be made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe soon. ""Prime Minister Abe has a big decision to make. Theyâve built one of the most beautiful venues Iâve ever seen... Itâs his decision and I know he is going to make it soon, I donât know what itâs going to be and I didnât think I should be influencing it. ""The job that Japan has done on that venue is incredible,"" he adds, calling the stadium âflawless"", ""beautiful"" and ""on-budget"". France has reported 112 more deaths from coronavirus, bringing the country's death toll to 562, according to the health ministry. ""Why arenât we sanitising masks,"" President Trump asks, adding: ""We have very good liquids to do this."" He says some mask designs ""donât lend themselves"" to this, and that heâs studied all the different mask designs. In New York, doctors and nurses have reportedly only been given one mask to use per week, and have taken to using hand sanitiser in an effort to keep them clean. Health officials recommend throwing away masks between patients. US President Donald Trump is still taking questions from reporters at the White House. He says his business, the Trump Organization, has been taking a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. He mentions that other hotel chains, such as the Hilton, have also been suffering. ""I guess, I havenât even asked, that Mar-a-lago is closed down,"" he says. ""As far as the hotels, I would probably do what everybody else is doing. You have to close things up. You donât want people to get together."" The spending bill being worked out by Congress is going to be ""really something very special,"" says President Donald Trump. ""Itâs gonna help people,"" he said about the stimulus bill that is forecast to be worth over $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn). ""We had the greatest economy in the history of the world and then we hit this problem,"" he says. Stock markets have shed all of the gains earned in the three years of the Trump presidency, economists said on Friday. ""Weâre doing this package, the likes of which nobody has ever done before,"" Mr Trump adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

NHS protective gear 'short of WHO guidelines',"Frontline NHS staff risk ""cross infecting everybody"" because they are not getting the recommended protective equipment, a consultant has warned. The face mask, short gloves and apron worn by NHS staff is far short of the World Health Organization recommendations, Dr Lisa Anderson of St George's Hospital, London, said. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the government to ""sort this out"". The PM has said work was continuing to get more personal protective equipment. Dr Anderson, a consultant cardiologist, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the current situation ""can't continue"". She said that the government had changed the rules to deviate from WHO guidelines, which currently recommend health staff wear a full gown and visor.

Mr Hunt said there were still ""gaps on the frontline"" and added that questions remained over whether doctors should wear full hazmat suits. Dr Anderson said that in Italy,which has seen the highest number of deaths from the virus, health workers have run out of stock and that nearly 10% of the health care force is infected.

Doctor's concern over super hospital hand hygiene,"Dr Henderson said hand sanitisers were not being sign-posted in the main entrance of the hospital A senior doctor has raised concerns over hand hygiene at Scotland's largest hospital. Dr Fiona Henderson, who works as a consultant anaesthetist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, said hand sanitisers were not clearly sign-posted at main public entrances. She also said some supermarkets were currently doing a better job at cleaning public spaces. The hospital's medical director has said he will look into installing better signs. Dr Henderson also raised concerns about people entering the hospital and not being compelled to use hand sanitisers. She told BBC Scotland'sDrivetime programme: ""I've never done anything like this before but I just absolutely have to speak out about the standard of basic infection control at the Queen Elizabeth. ""There's no enforcement of hand hygiene. What we need is manned hand-gel stations."" Dr Henderson said supermarkets were currently doing a better job at cleaning public spaces She said the hospital, which can hold up to a thousand patients, was a ""super, super, spreader right now"". ""As I walked into Sainsbury's there was a man cleaning the handle of my trolley - now it's a sad state of affairs that Sainsbury's are doing it better than the NHS."" Dr Henderson said a hand gelling station in the main entrance of the adult hospital was ""tucked away"" by Marks and Spencers and that no-one was using it. She said she understood the hospital didn't have the staff to create manned hand-gelling stations, but she called on the hospital's executive team to ""empower volunteers on social media"". ""Similarly, we don't have the cleaners. We need an army of cleaners going round keeping all the public areas absolutely spotless, we could equip these people with appropriate protective gear. ""The mere presence of these people would alter the behaviour of the public and staff coming through the doors."" Dr Scott Davidson, deputy medical director of acute services, said: ""We are aware of the concerns raised by one of my colleagues and have written to her directly to reassure her of the measures we are taking in response to Covid-19."" Dr Davidson said there was a significant amount of work and effort to address what was a ""developing situation"". He added: ""We are taking a wide range of measures across all our healthcare facilities to ensure the spread of the virus is minimised."" These include; Introducing strict visiting arrangement Limiting children's visits except in exceptional circumstances Reducing elective treatment and outpatient activity Introducing remote consultations Introducing a presence at the doors of four Emergency Departments to manage attendances and redirect patients to more appropriate services. Dr Davidson said hand sanitisers were strategically placed across the hospital to maximise their benefit for staff and patients. ""They are outside all ward entrances, outside rooms and inside rooms and in critical areas. There are also a number of areas where they are accessible to both staff and patients across the main atrium at the QEUH."" A spokeswoman for Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board said: ""Our cleaning compliance is regularly monitored internally and reported to our Board.  It is also monitored externally by Health Facilities Scotland who report the latest data on their website.  The latest published data shows the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital above the 90% compliance at 94.1%. ""All our hospitals also receive unannounced visits from Health Improvement Scotland and their report published in February on the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital positively recognised the hospital for its cleanliness and infection control measures.""

What we don't know about coronavirus deathsScary figures have been put forward for the expected death toll - but are they quite what they seem?Health,"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Train services to be cut due to coronavirus Updates on Friday 20 March Daniel Wainwright, Kate Darlington, Lauren Potts, David Schaffer and Tom Garry Explore the data on how the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in the UK. Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. At least 50,000 free weekly food parcels are to be sent out to clinically vulnerable people in England. The World Snooker Championship, due to start at the Crucible on 18 April, is postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Much like pubs, restaurants, theatres, gyms and leisure centres across the country, our live updates on this page are also coming to a close for the night. However, coverage of the coronavirus pandemic continues across the BBC and you can find all the latest information on the BBC news website and app. We'll be back at 8am on Monday - in the mean time, take care and have a safe weekend.

Entry fees, which can cost more than Â£80, will not be ""immediately refunded"" with organisers saying they had already paid out ""unrecoverable"" costs. They have yet to confirm whether entrants will be compensated in future. As coronavirus continues to spread, the BBC has been receiving questions about how safe or unsafe certain modes of transport are. For example, it's a common belief that you are more likely to become ill on an aeroplane, because you're breathing ""stale"" air, but some scientists have actually said that the air on an aircraft may well be of better quality than on a train or a bus, because the air is being changed at a faster rate. So what are the risks?You can find more details here. And as a reminder, the government has advised against all non-essential travel. Here's some more on precisely what the chancellor said earlier today. Rishi Sunak outlined: ""We're setting up a new coronavirus job retention scheme. Every employer in the country will be eligible. ""Government grants will cover 80% of the salary of retained workers, up to a total of Â£2,500 per month, just above the median income. ""That means workers in any part of the UK can retain their job even if their employee can not afford to pay them, and be paid at least 80% of their salary. ""The scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to 1 March and will be open initially for at least three months. I will extend the scheme for longer if necessary."" More details on the government's plans can be found here. We ""respect and agree with the government's decision"", says one pub in East London, as they close for the first time in 12 years.

NHS deal will provide thousands of extra bedsPrivate hospitals will reallocate almost their entire capacity to tackling the coronavirus outbreak.UK,"The private sector will reallocate almost its entire national hospital capacity in the first of its kind deal The NHS has struck a deal with private hospitals to acquire thousands of extra beds, ventilators and medical staff to fight the coronavirus outbreak. An extra 8,000 hospital beds across England, nearly 1,200 ventilators and almost 20,000 fully qualified staff will be available from next week. It comes as the number of people in the UK to die with coronavirus rose to 233. The agreement will see the private sector reallocate almost its entire national hospital capacity to the NHS. The extra resources will also help the NHS deliver other urgent treatments. According tothe latest figures,,externalthere are more than 5,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. The number of people with coronavirus who have died is now 220 in England, seven in Scotland, five in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The most recent 53 deaths in England were people aged 41 to 94 who had underlying health conditions, NHS England said. When will the coronavirus outbreak end? Coronavirus information: What should I do? Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? In pictures: First day of cafe and pub shutdown In London, the extra resources includes more than 2,000 hospital beds and more than 250 operating theatres and critical beds. The additional staff includes 10,000 nurses, more than 700 doctors and more than 8,000 other clinical staff, who will be joining the health service to help manage an expected surge in cases, said NHS England. Earlier this week, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met NHS 111 staff who had been taking calls from the public Chief executive Sir Simon Stevens hailed the deal with the private sector. He said: ""We're dealing with an unprecedented global health threat and are taking immediate and exceptional action to gear up. ""The NHS is doing everything in its power to expand treatment capacity and is working with partners right across the country to do so."" Under the terms of the deal, the private sector will be reimbursed at cost, meaning no profit will be made for doing so. ""Open book"" accounting and external auditors will verify the public funds being deployed. The NHS often uses private sector facilities when the need arises. But the mass purchasing of these resources is unprecedented. The ventilators will be crucial in helping the sickest. Just over 4% of people who developed symptoms are likely to need hospital care - and a third of those intensive care support. There are nearly 4,000 adult critical care beds in England currently. These extra ventilators will add to the hundreds freed up by the move to cancel routine operations from April, as well as steps to source others from elsewhere including the Ministry of Defence and old and new stocks. David Hare, chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, said: ""We have worked hand-in-hand with the NHS for decades and will do whatever it takes to support the NHS in responding to this pandemic."" He added the independent sector ""stands ready"" to maintain that support for as long as needed. Shoppers told to buy responsibly What could the West learn from Asia Five reasons to find hope amid Coronavirus chaos Shortly after the NHS announcement, Spire Healthcare released a statement confirming it had signed up to assist NHS England for a minimum of 14 weeks. The independent UK hospital group said it would spend the first week preparing staff and facilities before making all its 35 hospitals in England available to the NHS from 30 March. It added that it would be suspending all non-urgent elective surgery for patients over the age of 70 and vulnerable patients from 5:00 GMT on 20 March. The NHS deal comes as a consultant warned thatfrontline NHS staff risked ""cross infecting everybody"" because they are not getting the recommended protective equipment. The face mask, short gloves and apron worn by NHS staff is far short of the World Health Organization recommendations, said Dr Lisa Anderson of St George's Hospital in London. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Earlier this week, professional health bodieswrote to 65,000 former doctors and nurseswho have left the NHS in the last three years, asking them to rejoin the workforce. Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed Saturday's announcement and praised the ""heroes returning to the front line"". On Tuesday, NHS England announced that its hospitals across the country would be taking a range of actions to prepare, including freeing up 30,000 of the overall 100,000 beds available by postponing non-urgent operations and providing care in the community for those who are fit to be discharged. The NHS is also sourcing up to 10,000 beds in independent and community hospitals, which this deal largely now delivers.

Man proposes in Iceland after holiday cancelled,"Robert Ormsby had planned to propose to his girlfriend Patsy Murdoch in Reykjavik A nurse proposed to his girlfriend in a branch of Iceland after a romantic trip to the country of the same name was cancelled due to the coronavirus. Robert Ormsby popped the question in an empty aisle after their holiday to Reykjavik was called off on Monday. Patsy Murdoch said ""yes"", but admitted she was ""laughing hysterically"" as he got on one knee in the Tonbridge store. A photo of the proposal has gone viral and the couple said they were happy to spread some joy at this tough time. ""It's nice to know you can cheer somebody up by doing something that was just a humorous thing to make up for what we were going to miss,"" said Mr Ormsby, a charge nurse at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. The couple, both 58, were on their way to dinner when he nipped into Iceland under the pretence of picking something up. ""I was actually looking for an empty aisle,"" he said. As he dropped on one knee, his partner ""looked embarrassed at first,"" but quickly said ""yes"" and he ""popped the ring on her finger,"" he said. The online response to their proposal had been a welcome distraction, Ms Murdoch said The couple, from Sevenoaks, Kent, had bought the ring together and Ms Murdoch said she had been a ""bit suspicious when his suit went on"" earlier in the evening, but expected the proposal would be made at the restaurant. ""I was thinking 'what do you want in Iceland?' I didn't twig for a minute and then suddenly he went down on one knee....I was just laughing hysterically."" Ms Murdoch, who works for Hospice in the Weald, added: ""It was very exciting."" She said the online response had ""gone berserk"" and had been a welcome distraction from the impact of the pandemic. ""We all need a bit of distraction at the moment,"" she added. The couple posed for a photograph near the checkout as they left and gave permission for the company to post the images on social media. ""It's kind of gone a bit crazy since then,"" said the groom-to-be, who coincidentally worked for the frozen food firm in the 1980s. Mr Ormsby, who now works in operating theatres, said he would like to use the attention to praise the hard work of colleagues preparing for the worst of the outbreak. Anaesthetists are the ""frontline people for this"", he said, adding that it was ""frightening and reassuring at the same time"" to see the lengths they have gone to, to get ready for when the crisis hits.

Call for more help for the self-employed,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""The government is going to step in and help to pay people's wages"" Financial help is urgently needed for the five million self-employed workers hit by the coronavirus pandemic, trade unions and a former cabinet minister have urged. Conservative MP David Davis said the economy could suffer a near ""fatal seizure"" if they were not protected. Thegovernment is to pay 80% of salaries of staff kept on by employers. But Treasury minister Stephen Barclay said it would be ""operationally"" hard to protect self-employed incomes. He said the self-employed were being helped by measures such as the deferral of self-assessment tax requirements, payment holidays for mortgage payers and the strengthening of the welfare ""safety net"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the BBC's Today programme that the lack of measures put in place for the self-employed ""will cause real hardship unless we get to grips with it"". The cinema workers' union Bectu said the measures were a ""devastating blow"" to its freelance and self-employed members and that workers needed ""much more"" support than was promised. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who announced the support package on Friday at the daily coronavirus briefing with the PM, said closing pubs and restaurants would have a ""significant impact"" on businesses. But he added the government intervention - covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month - would mean workers should be able to keep their jobs, even if their employer could not afford to pay them. However, there was not the same wages guarantee for millions of self-employed people in the UK. Instead, Mr Sunak increased benefits that many will have to fall back on. Mr Davis said it was vital the chancellor found a way of extending support to the self-employed. ""It is absolutely necessary. Without this the whole of the British economy will have a seizure - almost a fatal seizure in economic terms,"" he told the BBC. ""It is great for those who have got jobs but it does miss out a pretty important sector of the economy - namely the self-employed - and he (Mr Sunak) is going to have to find a way of replicating this for the self-employed as well."" It is understood the government's wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the pandemic, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence. The news was welcomed by UK business leaders who expressed ""relief"" after the government committed to pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's biggest business group, said it was a ""landmark"" offering from the government. ""It marks the start of the UK's economic fightback - an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage,"" director general Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC Newsnight. Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), said many pubs had been ""hung in limbo"" and welcomed the ""clear instruction that closing their doors is the right thing to do"" and gave owners confidence that the government would support their staff and their business. Pubs have been ordered to close to help slow the spread of the virus The government had been under growing pressure to intervene to support workers to prevent mass unemployment as a result of measures directed against the outbreak. But some business groups warned of the potential risk to firms if they had to wait for the money to arrive, with some businesses facing rent payments before the support is due. The wage package is the latest in a series of government moves aimed at easing the burden on businesses and their employees. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was not yet clear how many people would take advantage of the government's offer, but he estimated that for every 1% of private sector workers who do, it will cost about Â£1bn. ""So if, for example, 10% of private sector workers do, it's Â£10bn over three months and if it's 20% then it's Â£20bn, or thereabouts,"" Mr Johnson told BBC 4's Today programme. The Bricklayer's Arms pub in West Putney, London is pictured with a closed sign This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible, but temporary, economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. In theory, it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps more. Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government to do. At 80% cent of wages up to Â£2,500 a month, it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation. Read more. A deserted Spanish Tapas restaurant in Camberley, in Surrey The new measures came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the closures of cafes, pubs and restaurants would be enforced ""strictly"" and that the situation would be reviewed each month. He also announced that all the UK's nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres had been told to close ""as soon as they reasonably can"". ""The more effectively we follow the advice we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full,"" the prime minister said. It follows similar measures taken in other countries - including in Ireland, wherepubs and bars were asked to close from last Sunday. Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the UK rose to 177 on Friday - with 167 in England, six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.

They have yet to confirm whether entrants will be compensated in future. As coronavirus continues to spread, the BBC has been receiving questions about how safe or unsafe certain modes of transport are. For example, it's a common belief that you are more likely to become ill on an aeroplane, because you're breathing ""stale"" air, but some scientists have actually said that the air on an aircraft may well be of better quality than on a train or a bus, because the air is being changed at a faster rate. So what are the risks?You can find more details here. And as a reminder, the government has advised against all non-essential travel. Here's some more on precisely what the chancellor said earlier today. Rishi Sunak outlined: ""We're setting up a new coronavirus job retention scheme. Every employer in the country will be eligible. ""Government grants will cover 80% of the salary of retained workers, up to a total of Â£2,500 per month, just above the median income. ""That means workers in any part of the UK can retain their job even if their employee can not afford to pay them, and be paid at least 80% of their salary. ""The scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to 1 March and will be open initially for at least three months. I will extend the scheme for longer if necessary."" More details on the government's plans can be found here. We ""respect and agree with the government's decision"", says one pub in East London, as they close for the first time in 12 years.

"One in five Americans ordered to stay at homeAs the US battles the coronavirus outbreak, ""non-essential"" travel from Canada and Mexico is halted.US & Canada","This video can not be played 60 days of coronavirus in the US - in 60 seconds A number of US states have ordered shutdowns with one in five Americans soon set to be under a ""stay at home"" order. Connecticut and New Jersey on Friday joined Illinois and California in ordering residents to stay at home in order to combat coronavirus. New York State ordered non-essential businesses to close. The virus has claimed nearly 230 lives in the US and infected more than 18,500 people. Globally more than 275,000 patients have tested positive for the respiratory illness and more than 11,000 have died. A ban on non-essential travel across the US-Canada border came into effect at midnight on Saturday. Speaking at the White House later in the day, President Donald Trump said governors, mayors and citizens were working with ""urgency and speed"" in what he described as a ""war against the virus"". Also at the news conference, Vice-President Mike Pence said he and his wife would be tested after one of his aides tested positive for the virus. ""Neither the president or I had direct contact"" with staffer, Mr Pence said, adding that the staffer was ""well"". On Friday Connecticut, Illinois and New York announced measures directing tens of millions of people to stay at home. The restrictions order most workplaces to close and require residents to remain inside except for trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo restricted public gatherings and ordered all ""non-essential workers"" to stay at home. The measures come as confirmed coronavirus cases in New York reached 7,000 - the highest of any US state. ""These provisions will be enforced,"" Mr Cuomo told reporters. ""These are not helpful hints."" Late on Friday, President Trump declared a major disaster in New York State, a move that will release federal funding. What can West learn from Asia's coronavirus fight? Dow erases Trump presidency gains in virus sell-off New York and the neighbouring New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania also issued a joint order on Friday for the closure of all ""personal care"" businesses, such as hair and nail salons and piercing and tattoo parlours. All outdoor team sports such as basketball games are also banned under the measures, which take effect on Sunday night. On Thursday California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a similar order, telling all residents to stay at home. He estimated more than half of the 40 million people in his state would contract Covid-19 in just the next two months. Images from Los Angeles show some of the city's most famous landmarks completely deserted while the freeways are almost empty. Images from Los Angeles show some of the city's busiest spots left completely empty Illinois, whose biggest city is Chicago, has also ordered all residents indoors with exceptions to shop for food and medicine or take exercise. Nevada and Hawaii have also introduced tough new restrictions to reduce social contact. President Trump has so far ruled out any nationwide lockdown. He said on Friday: ""I don't think we'll ever find [a US shutdown] necessary"". He added that the US was ""winning"" the war against the virus. By Sophie Long, BBC News, Los Angeles These may be the most restrictive measures to be put in place in modern Californian history, but in Los Angeles life goes on and the streets are far from empty. In a city famous for its gridlocked rush-hour traffic, cars are moving more freely past the palm trees on Sunset Boulevard. In Hollywood cyclists still overtake joggers and families still go out for a stroll. But these could all be seen as essential excursions. People have been told that those who work in critical sectors should still go to work. Busses are still running and grocery stores, pharmacies and banks are all still open. But many people are staying at home and friends and neighbours are keeping their distance. Restaurants and bars closed their doors days ago, but now all gatherings outside the home have been banned and there is no indication when the restrictions will be lifted. Like a scene from a disaster movie, a road in Los Angeles is almost empty as the lockdown bites Venice Beach in Los Angeles on the first day of lockdown On Saturday, the US and Canada suspended all non-essential traffic across their shared border, which hundreds of thousands of people normally cross each day, for at least 30 days. The curbs took effect at midnight, the Canadian government said. President Donald Trump said on Friday: ""In normal times, these massive flows [of immigrants] place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants and to the public at large."" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf meanwhile said both sides wanted ""to make sure cargo continues, trade continues, healthcare workers continue to be able to traverse that border"". Similar restrictions have been put into place on the US's southern border with Mexico. Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said that the measures would reduce the risk of the virus spreading further while not affecting economic activity between the two countries. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said US citizens should immediately return home unless they intend to remain abroad for some time. This video can not be played Students on spring break defy Covid-19 warnings There have been more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19 in Canada, whichhas barred travel into the country by most foreign citizens.,externalTwelve people have died. On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said asylum seekers crossing into the country on foot from the US would be turned back as part of the border shutdown. Economic damage from the outbreak is also becoming clear  with more than 500,000 applications for unemployment benefits made this week compared to 27,000 in the same week last year. Air Canada has meanwhile announced plans to lay off 5,100 employees. The government has announced a C$82bn ($57bn, Â£49bn) financial package to boost the economy, more than a quarter of which will be used to directly support workers and businesses. In most provinces across the country, schools have been closed, as have public venues including bars, restaurants and cinemas. Restrictions on mass gatherings are in place. In the province of Ontario, public events of more than 50 people are banned. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone?

A spokesperson for the Trump Organization would not confirm the mothballing of the resort, but told CNN: ""Various facilities are temporarily closed given local, state and federal mandates. ""We anxiously await the day when this pandemic is over and our world-class facilities can reopen."" Mr Trump's hotel in Las Vegas has already closed after coronavirus restrictions were introduced by the governor of Nevada. The president's hotels in New York and Washington DC remain open, though more than 200 staff have reportedly been laid off as their occupancy rate plunges amid the pandemic.

The virus has claimed nearly 230 lives in the US and infected more than 18,500 people. Globally more than 275,000 patients have tested positive for the respiratory illness and more than 11,000 have died. A ban on non-essential travel across the US-Canada border came into effect at midnight on Saturday. Speaking at the White House later in the day, President Donald Trump said governors, mayors and citizens were working with ""urgency and speed"" in what he described as a ""war against the virus"". Also at the news conference, Vice-President Mike Pence said he and his wife would be tested after one of his aides tested positive for the virus. ""Neither the president or I had direct contact"" with staffer, Mr Pence said, adding that the staffer was ""well"". On Friday Connecticut, Illinois and New York announced measures directing tens of millions of people to stay at home. The restrictions order most workplaces to close and require residents to remain inside except for trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo restricted public gatherings and ordered all ""non-essential workers"" to stay at home. The measures come as confirmed coronavirus cases in New York reached 7,000 - the highest of any US state. ""These provisions will be enforced,"" Mr Cuomo told reporters. ""These are not helpful hints."" Late on Friday, President Trump declared a major disaster in New York State, a move that will release federal funding.

Dow erases Trump presidency gains in virus sell-off New York and the neighbouring New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania also issued a joint order on Friday for the closure of all ""personal care"" businesses, such as hair and nail salons and piercing and tattoo parlours. All outdoor team sports such as basketball games are also banned under the measures, which take effect on Sunday night. On Thursday California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a similar order, telling all residents to stay at home. He estimated more than half of the 40 million people in his state would contract Covid-19 in just the next two months.

Images from Los Angeles show some of the city's busiest spots left completely empty Illinois, whose biggest city is Chicago, has also ordered all residents indoors with exceptions to shop for food and medicine or take exercise. Nevada and Hawaii have also introduced tough new restrictions to reduce social contact. President Trump has so far ruled out any nationwide lockdown. He said on Friday: ""I don't think we'll ever find [a US shutdown] necessary"". He added that the US was ""winning"" the war against the virus. By Sophie Long, BBC News, Los Angeles These may be the most restrictive measures to be put in place in modern Californian history, but in Los Angeles life goes on and the streets are far from empty. In a city famous for its gridlocked rush-hour traffic, cars are moving more freely past the palm trees on Sunset Boulevard. In Hollywood cyclists still overtake joggers and families still go out for a stroll. But these could all be seen as essential excursions. People have been told that those who work in critical sectors should still go to work. Busses are still running and grocery stores, pharmacies and banks are all still open. But many people are staying at home and friends and neighbours are keeping their distance. Restaurants and bars closed their doors days ago, but now all gatherings outside the home have been banned and there is no indication when the restrictions will be lifted. Like a scene from a disaster movie, a road in Los Angeles is almost empty as the lockdown bites Venice Beach in Los Angeles on the first day of lockdown On Saturday, the US and Canada suspended all non-essential traffic across their shared border, which hundreds of thousands of people normally cross each day, for at least 30 days. The curbs took effect at midnight, the Canadian government said. President Donald Trump said on Friday: ""In normal times, these massive flows [of immigrants] place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants and to the public at large."" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf meanwhile said both sides wanted ""to make sure cargo continues, trade continues, healthcare workers continue to be able to traverse that border"". Similar restrictions have been put into place on the US's southern border with Mexico. Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said that the measures would reduce the risk of the virus spreading further while not affecting economic activity between the two countries. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said US citizens should immediately return home unless they intend to remain abroad for some time.

On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said asylum seekers crossing into the country on foot from the US would be turned back as part of the border shutdown. Economic damage from the outbreak is also becoming clear  with more than 500,000 applications for unemployment benefits made this week compared to 27,000 in the same week last year. Air Canada has meanwhile announced plans to lay off 5,100 employees. The government has announced a C$82bn ($57bn, Â£49bn) financial package to boost the economy, more than a quarter of which will be used to directly support workers and businesses. In most provinces across the country, schools have been closed, as have public venues including bars, restaurants and cinemas. Restrictions on mass gatherings are in place. In the province of Ontario, public events of more than 50 people are banned. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone?

UK recession not yet a depression,"""It's like sleep mode"" was the way one Cabinet minister described the point of this significant intervention in the employment market. The idea here is to help employers put the workforce temporarily not needed in a sharp downturn into hibernation for when normality returns, not to fire them and do irreparable damage to the nation's productive capacity. This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible but temporary economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. Let's be clear, we are in a recession already, as is most of the coronavirus-afflicted developed world. The point of actions such as this is to prevent the permanent scars of depression. The seeds are there for a quick return to growth - all the same buildings and computer systems and networks and transport infrastructure are there, once this wretched pandemic passes, whether that is in six months or nine months or a year. In theory it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps many more. Coronavirus: Government to pay up to 80% of workers' wages Coronavirus: What are shops doing about stockpiling? Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government would do. At 80% of wages up to Â£2,500 a month it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation. Weeks after Brexit, the UK does the most continental European-style economic intervention for decades. A massive support package that was the product of government negotiating in a small room with business groups and the unions. It shows that the Treasury does believe that the very sharp plunge in the size of the economy can be followed by a bounceback - but not if millions of people are scarred by unemployment. Economics shows that these can have long lasting impact. The chancellor was given the room for this partly by the Bank of England's biggest ever announcement of purchasing government debt. There are fiscal risks here if this pandemic lasts much longer than three months. But the risks of not acting were much greater. Indeed thousands of workers had already been fired. The Treasury scheme is designed to get those immediate economic victims of the crisis back in to their workforces. Business owners will then have to give them a leave of absence and receive taxpayer funding worth four-fifths of their salary. Such employees should be picking up the phone to their ex-bosses. There are gaps. The government is not saying there will be no pain. The self-employed still have it relatively tough, despite some changes to the benefit system. A delay to billions in VAT payments should also help things in the interim. But for those in jobs, or very recently fired, it requires employers to hold their nerve until the taxpayer payments begin at the end of next month. How do I get a food parcel?

Last night of the pubs in UK,"Drinkers around England won't be able to prop up the bars at their regular haunts after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. Despite the prime minster'splea for people not to enjoy ""one last pint""on Friday night, a few establishments reported an influx of customers before last orders. For others, a quiet week continued as it had started, and their final night of trading was marked by empty seats. Ryan North has ""a lot of beer to use up"" Ryan North, manager at city centre bar The Wardrobe, said staff had been ""in limbo"" since Monday. ""It's slowed right down since then when people came in for their last pint. ""Picture says it all really, no point in staying open, but we've got a lot of beer to use up."" Refurbishments and the ban have hit Daniel Force Daniel Force, barkeeper at the Brunswick Arms in Dawlish, said they had been closed for six weeks for a refurbishment. ""We tried to open up this week just to get some people through the door, and now we're being told we're closing tonight,"" he said. ""We even had a police officer come in to enforce the closure and make sure we close our doors at midnight."" ""It's going to be tough, but hopefully with everyone's help, we'll be able to knuckle through."" Birmingham ""Relief"" at certainty for The Loft The Loft, near the city's Hippodrome theatre, was empty on Friday evening. Owner Lawrence Barton said the chancellor's announcement had ""actually brought a sense of conclusion and relief"". ""I think the measures the Chancellor announced this evening are going to greatly help business and give us confidence we can support our workforce. ""We've been very concerned, the hospitality sector has been decimated, at least now it will give business owners the confidence to take the measure they need to secure as many jobs as possible.""

Tunbridge Wells A late storm before the calm in Kent Manager Anthony Price closed the doors of the Bedford pub in Tunbridge Wells at 20:00 GMT. Staff took over Â£500 in their last hour and were forced to turn away dozens of people shortly before closing, he said. The owners had considered closing earlier in the week, but had waited to receive the government order to close ""because we didn't know whether the insurance companies would cover us"". ""It was pay day for the staff today, so we wanted to make sure they got paid and made sure they were going to be alright for at least a month,"" he said. Mr Price expects the pub to be closed for 12 weeks, but said it was ""all up in the air"". Forcing pubs to close was the wrong decision, he said. ""I think the public are very resilient, especially the British, we are known for our stiff upper lip. I think, let the public decide what they want to do. ""If the older generation, the younger generation, they want to go to bars and restaurants, let them. At least give them the option. ""By me working, that's down to me, that's my risk. If the older generation want to come in for a beer, that's at their risk. ""I understand why they've done it and hopefully it brings a quicker resolution to the end of the virus, but I just think let people do what they want to do. It's locking people up for a minimum of 12 weeks, it is like prison.

'Relief' for UK businesses after wages promise,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""The government is going to step in and help to pay people's wages"" Financial help is urgently needed for the five million self-employed workers hit by the coronavirus pandemic, trade unions and a former cabinet minister have urged. Conservative MP David Davis said the economy could suffer a near ""fatal seizure"" if they were not protected. Thegovernment is to pay 80% of salaries of staff kept on by employers. But Treasury minister Stephen Barclay said it would be ""operationally"" hard to protect self-employed incomes. He said the self-employed were being helped by measures such as the deferral of self-assessment tax requirements, payment holidays for mortgage payers and the strengthening of the welfare ""safety net"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the BBC's Today programme that the lack of measures put in place for the self-employed ""will cause real hardship unless we get to grips with it"". The cinema workers' union Bectu said the measures were a ""devastating blow"" to its freelance and self-employed members and that workers needed ""much more"" support than was promised. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who announced the support package on Friday at the daily coronavirus briefing with the PM, said closing pubs and restaurants would have a ""significant impact"" on businesses. But he added the government intervention - covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month - would mean workers should be able to keep their jobs, even if their employer could not afford to pay them. However, there was not the same wages guarantee for millions of self-employed people in the UK. Instead, Mr Sunak increased benefits that many will have to fall back on. Mr Davis said it was vital the chancellor found a way of extending support to the self-employed. ""It is absolutely necessary. Without this the whole of the British economy will have a seizure - almost a fatal seizure in economic terms,"" he told the BBC. ""It is great for those who have got jobs but it does miss out a pretty important sector of the economy - namely the self-employed - and he (Mr Sunak) is going to have to find a way of replicating this for the self-employed as well."" It is understood the government's wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the pandemic, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence. The news was welcomed by UK business leaders who expressed ""relief"" after the government committed to pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's biggest business group, said it was a ""landmark"" offering from the government. ""It marks the start of the UK's economic fightback - an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage,"" director general Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC Newsnight. Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), said many pubs had been ""hung in limbo"" and welcomed the ""clear instruction that closing their doors is the right thing to do"" and gave owners confidence that the government would support their staff and their business. Pubs have been ordered to close to help slow the spread of the virus The government had been under growing pressure to intervene to support workers to prevent mass unemployment as a result of measures directed against the outbreak. But some business groups warned of the potential risk to firms if they had to wait for the money to arrive, with some businesses facing rent payments before the support is due. The wage package is the latest in a series of government moves aimed at easing the burden on businesses and their employees. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was not yet clear how many people would take advantage of the government's offer, but he estimated that for every 1% of private sector workers who do, it will cost about Â£1bn. ""So if, for example, 10% of private sector workers do, it's Â£10bn over three months and if it's 20% then it's Â£20bn, or thereabouts,"" Mr Johnson told BBC 4's Today programme. The Bricklayer's Arms pub in West Putney, London is pictured with a closed sign This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible, but temporary, economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. In theory, it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps more. Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government to do.

Speaking at the same briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak saidthe new measures to help out-of-work employeeswere ""unprecedented"". He appealed to employers to stand by their workers during the coronavirus crisis, in the wake of many firms warning of collapse. England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told reporters at the briefing that the government was not advising people against going outside. ""We are saying, if you are going to go outside, go in a way that reduces your social contact,"" she said. In a separate televised address, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also asked all restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas to close. First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster said the measures are ""for the community's protection"", while Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was ""the right thing to do"". The latest announcement came afterMr Johnson said on Thursday that the UK could ""turn the tide""on the coronavirus outbreak within 12 weeks.

The Duchess of Cambridge visited the London Ambulance Service 111 control room in Croydon with her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, on Friday In other key UK developments: Speaking alongside the PM on Friday, Dr Jenny Harries insisted the UK has a ""perfectly adequate"" supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline staff. She said in the last 36 hours, a completely separate ""oversight and supply chain"" had been set up to ensure hospitals and other care providers receive the gear they need The PM said he plans to chair another meeting with representatives of supermarkets on Saturday amid continuing concern over panic buying Social distancing would be needed for ""at least half of the year""to stop intensive care units being overwhelmed, according to the government's scientific advisers. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommended alternating between more and less strict measures for most of a year MPs from all the main parties are picking up their stethoscopesand returning to old jobs in health and social care in a bid to help services tackle the coronavirus crisis. It comes after news that around65,000 retired medics will be asked to return to the NHS to help fight the pandemic. Dame Vera Lynn used her 103rd birthday tocall on the British public to find ""moments of joy"" during these ""hard times"". Christmas decorations have been appearing across the country,as people stuck at home try to bring some much-needed joy amid the coronavirus pandemic Major supermarkets have announced plans to hire extra staff to cope with increased demand. Tesco is set to employ 20,000 new workers for at least the next 12 weeks; Aldi wants to recruit 9,000 (which will include 4,000 permanent roles); and Asda plans to hire more than 5,000 temporary employees laid off due to Covid-19. Morrisons said it will create 3,500 jobs to expand its home delivery service, while Lidl hopes to recruit 2,500 staff to start work immediately In a message to the nation on Thursday,the Queen urged people to come together for the common good.

Mass gatherings had already been banned a few days beforehand. But then videos of crowded pubs full of tourists ignoring the two-metres-apart social distancing advice and literally ""touching hands"" as they sang Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline went viral. So the Irish government swiftly announced a compulsory closure until at least 29 March. The measure was widely welcomed by a relieved public that now knew where it stood on going out for a drink. Some politicians have said they are aware that not all pubs, particularly in more rural areas, are complying - but inspections by police officers have so far found no evidence of breaches.

Have UK experts over-egged coronavirus deaths?,"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

On Friday, Mr Burr again responded, tweeting that his decision to sell stock was made ""solely based on public news reports"". He specifically cited the Asia coverage provided by the CNBC network. ""Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however,"" he said in a short statement, ""I spoke with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee this morning and asked him to open a complete view of the matter with full transparency.""

Dow erases Trump presidency gains in virus sell-off,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 major American companies fell more than 4.5% on Friday, erasing all the gains it had made since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. The drop helped to finish the worst week on Wall Street since 2008, with all three indexes down at least 12%. The falls come as authorities tighten restrictions on activity in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. New York state on Friday ordered non-essential businesses to close. Illinois also made a similar move, while California earlier mandated that its residents shelter in place. The Dow lost more than 900 points to close at 19,173, while the wider S&P 500 dropped 4.3% to 2,304 and the Nasdaq lost 3.8% to 6,879.5. They have now fallen more than 30% from their recent records. Mr Trump has taken credit as the share indexes climbed during his presidency - gaining nearly 50% as of last month. He has written about them on Twitter at least 131 times, according to a tally by the New York Times. At briefings this week, Mr Trump has said he is not worried about the economy in the long-run, arguing that business will bounce back after the pandemic eases and restrictions can be relaxed. For now, however, the upheavals are severe. Unemployment claims in the US surged 30% this week, as thousands of people lost their jobs, while in the restaurant industry alone as many as 7 million jobs could be cut in the next three months, according to estimates by the National Restaurant Association. Delta Air Lines on Friday said it would lose $10bn in its second quarter, while United Airlines warned that it would cut jobs starting in April if the government does not provide relief funding. Both firms saw share prices fall about 30% this week. Coca-Cola lost more than 8%, after warning the virus had upended its growth forecast, as sales to theatres, sporting venues and restaurants evaporate. Earlier, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms ended up 0.76%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 gained more than 3%. The market moves came as the state of New York ordered staff at all ""non-essential"" businesses to remain at home as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. The move expands earlier restrictions and comes as California on the west coast said its nearly 40 million residents should ""shelter in place"". The US has confirmed more than 14,000 cases of the coronavirus, including more than 7,000 in New York. The surge has started to strain its health care system. ""This is the most drastic action we can take,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, New York said pharmacies, grocery stores, banks and shipping firms were among those exempt from the order, which goes into effect on Sunday. Many places have already been forced to shut, including schools, shopping centres, and theatres. Mr Cuomo also issued additional rules for the state's 19.5 million citizens, saying healthy people who are not at risk may go outside for exercise and to go grocery shopping, but should otherwise remain at home. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, who has been a leader of the national response, said he supported the move. ""Please co-operate with your governor,"" he said at the White House's daily coronavirus briefing. The US also said it would bar non-essential travel between the US and Canada, from midnight. However, US President Donald Trump said he did not think shelter in place orders needed to be expanded nationally, noting that many states have far lower infection rates. ""They're watching it on television but they don't have the same problems,"" he said. Restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of the coronavirus have expanded rapidly this week and are already having a devastating economic effect, with the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits surging more than 30% this week. Economists are predicting a sharp contraction in economic growth in coming months, and have warned that millions of jobs are at risk. Congress is working on a more than $1tn relief bill, that is expected to include direct payments of more than $1,000 for each American who earns less than a certain amount. It would also include millions for businesses affected by the pandemic, such as airlines and hotels.

"Pubs and restaurants told to shut to fight virusTheatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres must also close as soon as they reasonably can, the prime minister says.UK","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are telling cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight... and not to open tomorrow"" Cafes, pubs and restaurants must close from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. All the UK's nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres have also been told to close ""as soon as they reasonably can"". Mr Johnson said the situation would be reviewed each month. Meanwhile, thegovernment said it will pay 80% of wages for employeeswho are not able to work, up to Â£2,500 a month. The announcement about closures follows similar measures taken in other countries - including in Ireland, wherepubs and bars were asked to close from last Sunday. There have been 167 deaths in England from the coronavirus outbreak, as well as six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The Bricklayer's Arms pub in West Putney, London is pictured with a closed sign A deserted Spanish Tapas restaurant in Camberley, in Surrey Speaking at a daily Downing Street press briefing, Mr Johnson said the measures would be enforced ""strictly"" and that licensing arrangements would make doing so ""relatively simple"". He urged people not to go out on Friday night ahead of the closures, stressing: ""For now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart.""

Speaking at the same briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak saidthe new measures to help out-of-work employeeswere ""unprecedented"". He appealed to employers to stand by their workers during the coronavirus crisis, in the wake of many firms warning of collapse. England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told reporters at the briefing that the government was not advising people against going outside. ""We are saying, if you are going to go outside, go in a way that reduces your social contact,"" she said. In a separate televised address, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also asked all restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas to close. First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster said the measures are ""for the community's protection"", while Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was ""the right thing to do"". The latest announcement came afterMr Johnson said on Thursday that the UK could ""turn the tide""on the coronavirus outbreak within 12 weeks.

She said in the last 36 hours, a completely separate ""oversight and supply chain"" had been set up to ensure hospitals and other care providers receive the gear they need The PM said he plans to chair another meeting with representatives of supermarkets on Saturday amid continuing concern over panic buying Social distancing would be needed for ""at least half of the year""to stop intensive care units being overwhelmed, according to the government's scientific advisers. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommended alternating between more and less strict measures for most of a year MPs from all the main parties are picking up their stethoscopesand returning to old jobs in health and social care in a bid to help services tackle the coronavirus crisis. It comes after news that around65,000 retired medics will be asked to return to the NHS to help fight the pandemic. Dame Vera Lynn used her 103rd birthday tocall on the British public to find ""moments of joy"" during these ""hard times"". Christmas decorations have been appearing across the country,as people stuck at home try to bring some much-needed joy amid the coronavirus pandemic Major supermarkets have announced plans to hire extra staff to cope with increased demand. Tesco is set to employ 20,000 new workers for at least the next 12 weeks; Aldi wants to recruit 9,000 (which will include 4,000 permanent roles); and Asda plans to hire more than 5,000 temporary employees laid off due to Covid-19.

Mass gatherings had already been banned a few days beforehand. But then videos of crowded pubs full of tourists ignoring the two-metres-apart social distancing advice and literally ""touching hands"" as they sang Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline went viral. So the Irish government swiftly announced a compulsory closure until at least 29 March. The measure was widely welcomed by a relieved public that now knew where it stood on going out for a drink. Some politicians have said they are aware that not all pubs, particularly in more rural areas, are complying - but inspections by police officers have so far found no evidence of breaches. Several restaurants in Ireland, while staying closed, are now offering takeaway food - but strictly observing the recommended social distance advice as they do so. The Irish government's core Covid-19 message that to pull together as a country people will have to spend time apart is certainly currently working.

'Relief' for businesses after wages promise,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""The government is going to step in and help to pay people's wages"" Financial help is urgently needed for the five million self-employed workers hit by the coronavirus pandemic, trade unions and a former cabinet minister have urged. Conservative MP David Davis said the economy could suffer a near ""fatal seizure"" if they were not protected. Thegovernment is to pay 80% of salaries of staff kept on by employers. But Treasury minister Stephen Barclay said it would be ""operationally"" hard to protect self-employed incomes. He said the self-employed were being helped by measures such as the deferral of self-assessment tax requirements, payment holidays for mortgage payers and the strengthening of the welfare ""safety net"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the BBC's Today programme that the lack of measures put in place for the self-employed ""will cause real hardship unless we get to grips with it"". The cinema workers' union Bectu said the measures were a ""devastating blow"" to its freelance and self-employed members and that workers needed ""much more"" support than was promised. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who announced the support package on Friday at the daily coronavirus briefing with the PM, said closing pubs and restaurants would have a ""significant impact"" on businesses. But he added the government intervention - covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month - would mean workers should be able to keep their jobs, even if their employer could not afford to pay them. However, there was not the same wages guarantee for millions of self-employed people in the UK. Instead, Mr Sunak increased benefits that many will have to fall back on. Mr Davis said it was vital the chancellor found a way of extending support to the self-employed. ""It is absolutely necessary. Without this the whole of the British economy will have a seizure - almost a fatal seizure in economic terms,"" he told the BBC. ""It is great for those who have got jobs but it does miss out a pretty important sector of the economy - namely the self-employed - and he (Mr Sunak) is going to have to find a way of replicating this for the self-employed as well."" It is understood the government's wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the pandemic, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence. The news was welcomed by UK business leaders who expressed ""relief"" after the government committed to pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's biggest business group, said it was a ""landmark"" offering from the government. ""It marks the start of the UK's economic fightback - an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage,"" director general Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC Newsnight. Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), said many pubs had been ""hung in limbo"" and welcomed the ""clear instruction that closing their doors is the right thing to do"" and gave owners confidence that the government would support their staff and their business. Pubs have been ordered to close to help slow the spread of the virus The government had been under growing pressure to intervene to support workers to prevent mass unemployment as a result of measures directed against the outbreak. But some business groups warned of the potential risk to firms if they had to wait for the money to arrive, with some businesses facing rent payments before the support is due. The wage package is the latest in a series of government moves aimed at easing the burden on businesses and their employees. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was not yet clear how many people would take advantage of the government's offer, but he estimated that for every 1% of private sector workers who do, it will cost about Â£1bn. ""So if, for example, 10% of private sector workers do, it's Â£10bn over three months and if it's 20% then it's Â£20bn, or thereabouts,"" Mr Johnson told BBC 4's Today programme. The Bricklayer's Arms pub in West Putney, London is pictured with a closed sign This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible, but temporary, economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. In theory, it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps more. Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government to do. At 80% cent of wages up to Â£2,500 a month, it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation. Read more.

UK to pay wages for workers facing job losses,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""The government is going to step in and help to pay people's wages"" The government will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a radical move aimed at protecting people's jobs. It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. The ""unprecedented"" measures will stop workers being laid off due to the crisis, chancellor Rishi Sunak said. Firms have warned the virus could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold. Mr Sunak saidclosing pubs and restaurantswould have a ""significant impact"" on businesses. It is understood that the wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the coronavirus, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence. Coronavirus: Wages, sick pay and time off explained Labour urges 'faster' cash for workers Coronavirus recession not yet a depression The chancellor said the move would mean workers should be able to keep their jobs, even if their employer could not afford to pay them. He said they were ""unprecedented measures for unprecedented times."" ""I know that people are worried about losing their jobs, about not being able to pay the rent or mortgage, about not having enough set by for food and bills... to all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,"" Mr Sunak added The wages cover, which relates to gross pay, will be backdated to the start of March and last for three months, but Mr Sunak said he would extend the scheme for longer ""if necessary"". The scheme, which will be run by HMRC, is expected to make the first grants to businesses ""within weeks"", a Treasury spokeswoman said. Employers' body the CBI said Mr Sunak's announcement was ""a landmark package"". ""It marks the start of the UK's economic fightback - an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage,"" said director general Carolyn Fairbairn. The Resolution Foundation think tank also said the package was ""hugely welcome"", reaching lower-paid workers that were most at risk of job losses. But other lobby groups warned of the potential risk to firms which had to wait for the money to arrive. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, said many businesses faced rent payments before the support was due. ""Banks and landlords need to do more to help us bridge the gap towards this generous government support. Damage is being done now, so we need help now."" The Federation of Small Businesses also warned the delay in wages help - potentially until the end of April - meant many small firms would still face ""an immediate, potentially terminal cash flow crunch"". The government has faced huge pressure to intervene to support workers to prevent mass unemployment as anti-virus measures have seen many firms' revenues evaporate almost overnight. The wage package is the latest in a series of government moves aimed at easing the burden on businesses and their employees. However, there was not the same wages guarantee for the self-employed. Instead, Mr Sunak increased benefits that many will have to fall back on. Other measures to support firms and workers included: VAT payments by companies deferred until the end of June Interest free cash grants to small businesses Self-assessment income tax payments for July 2020 deferred for six months Increase in standard Universal Credit of Â£20 a week, with the same rise for those still on the working tax credit scheme Nearly Â£1bn for those struggling to pay rent, through increases in housing benefit and Universal Credit Capital Economics said that it expected the unemployment rate to rise from just under 4% to about 6% due to the crisis. However, without this latest government intervention, that rate would have risen to the financial crisis level of 8%, it said. This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible, but temporary, economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. In theory, it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps more. Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government to do. At 80% cent of wages up to Â£2,500 a month it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation. It shows that the Treasury does believe that the very sharp plunge in the size of the economy can be followed by a bounceback - but not if millions of people are scarred by unemployment. Economics shows that these can have long lasting impact. The chancellor was given the room for this partly by the Bank of England's biggest ever announcement of purchasing government debt. There are risks if this pandemic lasts much longer than three months. But the risks of not acting were much greater. Now it requires employers to hold their nerve until the payments begin at the end of next month. And for the banks to help that process.

Coronavirus: Who will pay my wages if I can't work?What is happening to workers' wages and sick pay during the coronavirus outbreak?BusinessComments,"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare.

Who will pay me if I can't work?,"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare.

Teachers to estimate grades after exams cancelledTeachers will base assessments on coursework and mock results as schools await key workers' children.Family & Education,"Pupils whose exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus epidemic will be given grades estimated by their teachers, the government has said. The announcement comes as most UK schools closed their doors to a majority of pupils indefinitely in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. But many schools will re-open on Monday with a skeleton staff to accommodate the children of ""key workers"". There are concerns the hastily arranged system may struggle to cope. Teachers in England will look at coursework, mocks and other evidence from A-level and GCSE students and will award grades. And a process will be agreed with exam regulators and exam boards to see that pupils' ""hard work and dedication is rewarded and fairly recognised"". This video can not be played The government has closed all schools, but what does that mean for exams, and who can still go in? A similar process is likely to be followed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England's Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said cancelling exams was something no education secretary would ever want to do, but it was vital in these ""extraordinary times"". ""My priority now is to ensure no young person faces a barrier when it comes to moving onto the next stage of their lives - whether that's further or higher education, and apprenticeship of a job,"" he said. How long could schools be closed? When will the outbreak end? Pupils 'scared and anxious' The announcement came as hundreds of thousands of school pupils were saying sometimes tearful goodbyes to each other for possibly the last time. Pupils at the end of primary, GCSE and A-Level students do not know whether they will see their classmates again in school. Head teachers and local authority officials have been struggling to work out whose children they should be accommodating when schools partially re-open on Monday. Thegovernment has published a list of key workers,externalwhose children can still go to school if they cannot be looked after at home. These workers' jobs are considered ""critical"" for the response to the pandemic. The list has been separated into eight categories, including frontline health workers and social-care staff, nursery and teaching workers and those involved in food production and delivery. It also includes the police, those in key public services, transport workers and critical staff in financial services and utilities. Northern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir has said all schools there should be prepared to cater for key workers' childrenafter they close on Monday. Anyone who thinks the emergency schools that are due to open on Monday will run like regular ones is wrong. They will instead comprise a patchwork of available teachers, support staff and pupils whose parents find themselves lucky enough to be on the key workers' list. They will not be following a specific curriculum, there will be no working towards exams and pupils are unlikely to be taught in their own year groups. How many pupils each school can accommodate will be a daily moving picture as staff fall ill. And head teachers will have to make some tough decisions about who can come into class - and sometimes their decisions will not be popular One spoke of arguing with a father who asked for a place because he worked in McDonald's; others in more obviously frontline jobs have also been disappointed. On the up side, the lucky ones may have a chance to learn in new and different ways, while their former classmates grapple with online learning from home. Nurseries, colleges and childminders are also closing their doors, though some are being asked to re-open to accommodate key workers' children. Vulnerable children, including those who have a social worker and those with special educational needs, will also be allowed to go to school. Dr Mary Bousted, joint-general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending."" She also called for education workers to be tested for Covid-19 to ensure safe working in schools. She added: ""There simply won't be enough education staff available for work on school sites if all members with symptoms are forced to self-isolate."" The government stressed that ""every child who can be safely cared for at home should be"" and asked workers to consult their employers to confirm whether ""their specific role is necessary"". The Department for Education said it would help local authorities identify those ""who most need support at this time"". The government has encouraged local authorities to keep residential special schools and specialist colleges open wherever possible. The full list includes: Frontline health workers, such asdoctorsandnurses Someteachersandsocial workers Those in key public services, including those essential to thejustice system, religious staff and public-service journalists Local and national government workersdeemed crucial to delivering essential public services Workers involved infood production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery Public-safety workers, includingpolice, armed forces personnel, firefighters and prison staff Essential air, water, road and railtransport workers Utilities, communication and financial services staff, includingpostal workersandwaste-disposal workers Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"âAlternative Eurovision' planned for 2020Organisers say an alternative event will replace the contest, which was scrapped on Wednesday.","Russias Little Big were considered a front-runner for this year's contest Organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest are investigating an ""alternative"" show after this year's event was cancelled due to coronavirus.

It's the first time that Eurovision has not taken place since it first aired in 1956. The 2020 contest would have seen performers from 41 countries gather with 16,000 fans at Rotterdam's Ahoy Arena to compete for the songwriting trophy. But after the Dutch government banned large public gatherings, the European Broadcasting Union called off the event to protect the ""health of artists, staff, fans and visitors"". Eurovision Song Contest cancelled over coronavirus How does the UK's Eurovision entry stack up? Five lessons from Eurovision 2019 The event's executive supervisor, Jon Ola Sand, added: ""We are very proud of the Eurovision Song Contest, that for 64 years has united people all around Europe. ""We regret this situation very much,"" he added, but promised the event would return ""stronger than ever"" next year, preferably in the Netherlands, which won the contest in 2019. James Newman was due to represent the UK at the contest Newman, said he was ""gutted not to be going to Rotterdam"" but recognised it was ""more important for everyone to remain safe during these unprecedented times"". Russia's Little Big, whose song Uno was considered a front-runner at the contest,shared a similar sentiment on Facebook,external, writing: ""We regret about it and we also assume that this is the only proper decision in such a situation."" The decision to stage an alternative event came just 48 hours after Eurovision was called off, and was prompted by the ""overwhelming"" response of fans. ""The EBU is very aware of how much the Eurovision Song Contest will be missed,"" organisers explained. ""The contest's values of universality and inclusivity, and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music, are needed more than ever right now."" They said they hoped the alternative programme would ""help unite ands entertain artists around Europe at this challenging time"".

Five reasons to find hope amid coronavirus chaos,"Many across India clapped from their balconies on Sunday as a mark of respect for medical staff We appreciate that these are dark times for people around the world, as the coronavirus continues to spread. Numbers of infections and fatalities are rising, cities and even countries are shutting and many people are being forced into isolation. But amid all the worrying news, there have also been reasons to find hope. As countries go into lockdown over the virus, there have been significant drops in pollution levels. Both China and northern Italy have recorded major falls in nitrogen dioxide - a serious air pollutant and powerful warming chemical - amid reduced industrial activity and car journeys. Researchers in New York also told the BBC that early results showed carbon monoxide, mainly from cars, had been reduced by nearly 50% compared with last year. And with airlines cancelling flights en masse and millions working from home, countries around the world are expected to follow this downward path. You can read more about the drops in pollution levels here. On a similar note, residents of Venice have noticed a vast improvement in the water quality of the famous canals running through the city. The streets of the popular tourist destination in northern Italy have emptied amid the outbreak leading to a drastic drop in water traffic, which has allowed sediment to settle. The usually murky water has gone so clear that fish can even be seen. This video can not be played The cruise ship cancellations have led to cleaner canals in Venice There are plenty of stories of panic buying and fights over toilet roll and tins, but the virus has also spurred acts of kindness around the world. Two New Yorkers amassed 1,300 volunteers in 72 hours to deliver groceries and medicine to elderly and vulnerable people in the city. Facebook said hundreds of thousands of people in the UK had joined local support groups set up for the virus, while similar groups have been formed in Canada,sparking a trend there known as ""caremongering"". Supermarkets in Australia are among those to create a special ""elderly hour"" so older shoppers and those with disabilities have a chance to shop in peace. This video can not be played Australia's elderly shoppers now have a special supermarket shopping hour People have also donated money, shared recipe and exercise ideas, sent uplifting messages to self-isolating elderly people and transformed businesses into food distribution centres. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW MEASURES:What is the UK advice? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Between a hectic work and home life it is often easy to feel disconnected from those around you. As the virus affects us all, it has brought many communities around the world closer together. In Italy, where a countrywide lockdown is in place, people have joined together on their balconies for morale-boosting songs. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Italians sing from their windows to boost morale A fitness instructor in southern Spain led an exercise class from a low roof in the middle of an apartment complex, which residents in isolation joined from their balconies. Many people have used the opportunity to reconnect with friends and loved ones over phone or video calls, while groups of friends have organised virtual clubbing or pub sessions using mobile apps (including those of us in the BBC who are working from home). The virus has also highlighted the importance of health workers and other people working in key services. Thousands of Europeans have taken to their balconies and windows to applaud the doctors and nurses fighting the virus, while medical students in London have volunteered to help healthcare professionals with childcare and household chores. With millions of people now stuck in isolation, many are using the opportunity to get creative. Social media users have shared details of their new hobbies, including reading, baking, knitting and painting. The DC Public Library in Washington is among those hosting a virtual book club, while Italian Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura has launched an Instagram series called Kitchen Quarantine, teaching basic recipes to aspiring foodies who are stuck at home. This video can not be played Facebook group helps parents and their kids during coronavirus lockdown An art teacher in the US state of Tennessee has been live-streaming classes for children who are out of school, inspiring them to get creative at home. And while many public spaces have been shut, art fans have been making the most of virtual tours offered by the world's biggest galleries, observing the famous paintings of the Louvre in Paris and the classic sculptures of the Vatican museum from their living rooms. Australia's Sydney Observatory offered a tour of the night sky for people stuck at home. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.
