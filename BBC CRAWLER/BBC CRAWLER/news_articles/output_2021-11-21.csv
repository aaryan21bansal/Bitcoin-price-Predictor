Labour and Plaid Cymru approve Senedd deal,"The deal includes expanding free childcare for two year olds Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru's ruling bodies have approved a co-operation deal between the parties in the Senedd. BBC Wales has been told there was ""solid support"" for the deal at Welsh Labour's executive committee. Plaid Cymru's national executive committee also backed the deal but it will require the support of the party's members. The ""very wide-ranging"" deal includes a pledge toextend free school mealsto all primary school pupils. Some of the main points of the deal include: Introducing local tourism taxes Publishing proposals on rent controls to make properties affordable for locals Reforming housing law toend homelessness Creating an NHS style free-at-point-of-needNational Care Service Plans to change council tax Changes to the number of Members of the Senedd This video can not be played Parents share their experiences of paying for childcare. It also includes plans to expand thefree childcare offer for two year olds, and for all primary age children to be entitled to free school meals in Wales. The deal includes a cap onsecond and holiday home numbers, amid concerns those living in seaside and rural communitiesare being ""priced out"" of buying in their areas. There is also a commitment to ""work towards""parity of ""reward and recognition"" for health and care workers, and to reform building safety and provide more cash to help people in flats with cladding problems. This video can not be played It includes plans to provide more cash for people with cladding problems BBC Wales has been told the deal also includes a commitment to ""explore the creation of a shadow Broadcasting and Communications Authority for Wales, to address our concerns about the current fragility in the media and attacks on its independence"". ""This body would support the use of the Welsh language, particularly in digital and encourage media plurality. Council tax could change under a Labour-Plaid deal House prices could ruin community Talks with Plaid cannot go on forever, says FM ""We believe broadcasting and communication powers should be devolved to Wales,"" the deal adds. It comes as the process toappoint the new chairmanof the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to be re-started. It is expected that the deal will be published in full on Monday. Mark Drakeford (left) had been in talks with Plaid Cymru's Adam Price over the deal In ablog post,external, Darren Williams, a member of Labour's executive committee, said the agreement included free childcare for all two-year-olds, creation of a national care service, limits on second home ownership, and the creation of a publicly-owned construction company and an energy company. He also said it would include changes in the Senedd's size, ""including a statutory guarantee of gender balance"". The first minister has previously explained the talks were necessary because Welsh Labour has no overall majority to deal with""challenging and ambitious issues""as it has 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay. Talks were publicly announced in September after Labour and Plaid Cymru had been indiscussions over the summeraround policies they could work together on. Inmid-October, Mark Drakeford said the ""discussions need to come to a conclusion"" and they could not ""continue forever"". The deal would not amount to a coalition between the parties, and Plaid Cymru members of the Senedd will not be entering government. But BBC Wales has been told Plaid would be able to appoint special advisers to work on the deal in government. A Welsh Conservatives spokesman said the ""deal is remarkable for its absence of solutions to fix the NHS - currently experiencing its worst performance on record - or improve the economy in Wales"". ""Labour's latest deal with the nationalists does not deliver on the priorities of working families across Wales, and will only cause constitutional chaos that risks holding back our economic recovery.""

Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru close to Senedd deal,"The Welsh Labour government and Plaid Cymru are close to finalising a co-operation deal in the Senedd. Both parties' ruling bodies will meet on Saturday to decide whether to approve the deal. It could still be rejected, or further talks demanded, but if agreement is reached, an announcement could be made as early as Monday. BBC Wales was told the ""very wide-ranging"" draft includes plans to change council tax and reforms to social care. It also includes expansion of free childcare, measures to tackle second homes and many other issues. Labour won the Senedd election in May, but did not win a majority. What could Labour and Plaid Cymru work on? Welsh Labour and Plaid in co-operation talks Speaking at the British Irish Council meeting in Cardiff, Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said an agreement ""had been reached"" but was yet to be ratified by Plaid Cymru and Labour. He added he hoped to ""be more public about the whole agreement"" early next week, ""if we succeed"". The first minister has previously explained the talks were necessary becauseWelsh Labour has no overall majorityto deal with ""challenging and ambitious issues"". Talks were publicly announced in September afterLabour and Plaid Cymru had been in discussions over the summeraround policies they could work together on. In mid-October, Mr Drakeford said the""discussions need to come to a conclusion""and they could not ""continue forever"". BBC Wales has been told those discussions are drawing to a close, with Labour's Welsh Executive Committee and Plaid's National Executive Committee to discuss the deal on Saturday. Plaid and Labour have worked together in the Senedd before One of the big policies included in the prospective deal is a commitment to change thecouncil tax system, which both parties promised to reform in their manifestos for May's election. Speaking in September, Mr Drakeford said changing the council tax system would be ""very difficult to do because some people lose out, a lot of people win"". The deal would not amount to a coalition between the parties, and Plaid CymruMembers of the Seneddwill not be entering government. But BBC Wales has been told Plaid would be able to appoint special advisers to work on the deal in government. Council tax is among the policies that could be changed as a result of the agreement The two parties have worked together in the Senedd before - Plaid Cymru went into coalition government with Labour between 2007 and 2011. After the 2016 election, the party agreed to a ""compact"" co-operation deal with Labour, allowing Carwyn Jones to return as first minister. That ended in 2017, although Plaid supported the Welsh budget a year after that. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We are having positive discussions with Plaid Cymru about developing an agreement on a range of policy areas where we have shared interests. We will not be commenting further while these discussions are ongoing."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The talks have been criticised by the Welsh Conservatives. On Friday Tory MS Sam Kurtztweeted,external: ""Vote Labour get Plaid. Vote Plaid get Labour."" Speaking when they were announced, Tory Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: ""You only need look at Welsh Labour's policy programme to see how out of ideas it is. ""But turning to nationalists with no mandate is an act of desperation and lunacy."" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson added: ""Talks have been held with the Welsh government about developing an agreement. Those talks have reached a conclusion and discussions are now ongoing with political groups and parties."" The agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru has been a long time in the making. In fact, many of the agreed commitments appeared in both parties manifestos and, other than on the question of independence, little divides the two parties in terms of ideology. From Labour's point of view the agreement means that legislating will be a whole lot easier, while Plaid Cymru will hope to beef up the government's constitutional agenda. Plaid will be only too well aware though that there could be an electoral price to be paid if they are seen to be cosying up to Labour, and whatever is said now it's unlikely that the agreement will remain in place for the whole of the Senedd term.

Man Utd sack manager Solskjaer,"This video can not be played Watford 4-1 Manchester United: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will take the 'flak' for United loss Manchester United have sacked manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Watford. The club have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches and are seventh in the table, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea. First-team coach Michael Carrick has been placed in temporary charge while United seek an interim manager to the end of the season. ""It is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,"" United said. Reaction to Solskjaer's sacking What went wrong at Man Utd - and was it all down to Solskjaer? The stats that tell the tale of Solskjaer's reign Everything you need to know about Solskjaer's United exit - in one place The club's recent run of poor form includes a 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool on 24 October and a 2-0 defeat by Manchester City on 6 November. United added: ""While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success. ""Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future."" Solskjaer is a former Red Devils player, scoring 126 goals in 11 seasons from 1996-2007 including the winner in the 1999 Champions League final. United said in their statement: ""His place in the club's history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. ""He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family."" United next play when they travel to Spain to take on Villarreal in the Champions League on Tuesday, before league games against Chelsea and Arsenal. Darren Fletcher will stay on as technical director, while Mike Phelan and Kieran McKenna - who were part of Solskjaer's coaching set up - will also remain at the club for the time being. Former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, currently out of work, is an early favourite with bookmakers to become United's next manager. Allow Twitter content?

Solskjaer, 48, replaced Jose Mourinho on an interim basis in December 2018. The Norwegian was then given the jobfull-timein March 2019 on a three-year contract and, in July, signed a new deal with the club until 2024. Solskjaer was United's fourth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 - and had lasted longer than more experienced predecessors David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho. But with United finishing in second place in the Premier League last May - 12 points behind champions Manchester City - and losing the Europa League final to Villarreal on penalties, it was accepted that Solskjaer needed a trophy this season to stay in the job. United are top of their Champions League group after four games, level on points with second-placed Villarreal but only two ahead of Atalanta in third. They were beaten by Moyes' West Ham in the third round of the Carabao Cup and have yet to start their FA Cup campaign. This video can not be played Premier League: How 'fantastic' Watford put four goals past 'embarrassing' Man Utd After four wins and a draw in their first five Premier League games, United have been poor, claiming just four points from a possible 21. They have conceded 21 goals in 12 games - only the bottom two sides Norwich and Newcastle have conceded more, with 27. United goalkeeper David de Gea described his side's defeat by Watford as ""embarrassing"" and ""another nightmare"". ""We don't know what to do with the ball, we are conceding a lot of goals. It's a horrible moment,"" he added. Solskjaer leaves United with a win percentage of54.2%from168games across all competitions.

After the seismic Liverpool defeat, Solskjaer said he ""had come too far"" to give up. And United had attempted to stand firm with their backing of Solskjaer despite a poor start to the season. But there has been intense scrutiny and criticism of their performances from pundits, the media, and even the players themselves. Both Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes have spoken out in recent weeks - and on the Monday after the humiliation by rivals Liverpool,BBC Sport reportedthat an increasing number of players had started to lose faith in Solskjaer's tactics and felt he was out of his depth compared with managers at other leading clubs, namely Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp and Chelsea's Thomas Tuchel. After a 4-2 defeat at Leicester in October,Pogba saidUnited needed to ""change something"", adding: ""We have been having these kind of games for a long time and haven't found the problem. We have conceded easy and stupid goals."" And after United lost the Manchester derby, Fernandes said players needed to ""look in the mirror"" because they were ""not at the same level"" as their City counterparts. Solskjaer becomes the sixth Premier League managerial casualty of the season, a high numberthat has been attributed in partto the fact that full crowds have returned to games for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The suggestion is that struggling managers are more vulnerable to the sack with big crowds calling for them to go than they were when games were being played in empty - or partly empty - stadiums. There were only four Premier League managerial exits in the whole of last season, and only Slaven Bilic, at West Brom, lost his job before Christmas. But this season, Xisco Munoz at Watford, Steve Bruce at Newcastle, Nuno Espirito Santo at Tottenham, Daniel Farke at Norwich, and Dean Smith at Aston Villa have all left their clubs. United spent more than Â£110m in the summer, bringing in Jadon Sancho (Â£73m), Raphael Varane (Â£34m) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Â£12.85m) - investment that followed fan protests against the Glazer family ownership towards the end of last season. During Solskjaer's reign, United have spent more than Â£400m on transfer fees - and those signings include captain Harry Maguire from Leicester for Â£80m, Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace for Â£50m, Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon for Â£47m, and Donny van de Beek from Ajax for Â£39m.

For a start, United officials felt Solskjaer had affected the ""cultural reboot"" demanded of him when Jose Mourinho was sacked in December 2018. He had also reshaped the squad, replacing players such as Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez with younger attacking talent and, until the middle of September, had maintained a steady improvement. They are small achievements for a club of United's size but the securing successive top-three finishes -for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 - was viewed as a positive, as were the four semi-final appearances and a Europa League final. The brutal truth is none of this turned into tangible silverware, which might have provided a buffer over the past 10 weeks. Nevertheless, United's ownership and executive team were united in believing Solskjaer deserved the chance to halt the dreadful run, first at Watford and, in theory, beyond that, into key games against Villarreal and Chelsea. But the manner of Saturday's reverse at Vicarage Road made it clear something significant had to change and Solskjaer has paid the price.

Maternity 'crisis' sparks protest by midwives,"One of the marches took place at Swansea Midwives have said maternity services are at an ""unsustainable"" level and want help with what they dubbed a staffing and safety crisis. Parents, health workers and midwives protested across the UK on Sunday. ""Maternity services are at crisis point and we need to fight,"" said Cardiff march organiser Katie Falvey. The Welsh government said it had commissioned a review into service demand, while the UK government has pledged Â£95m for recruitment. The March With Midwives ""grassroots action for solidarity"" protests took place in 50 towns and cities with maternity units and were described as a ""UK vigil for maternity crisis"". Nursing and midwife numbers jump by record amount Midwives protest across the UK over maternity 'crisis' The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' Campaigners want politicians and health officials to ""listen to staff and service users, fund emergency retention of staff and reduce demands"" on midwives. ""We need to make sure that the government and public are aware of the crisis we're facing,"" said Ms Falvey, a 21-year-old final year student midwife from Essex studying in Wales. Katie Falvey said she had witnessed midwives suffering ""chronic burnout, stress and fatigue"" during placements ""It is something that affects everyone and not just the midwives. ""It's just got to the point now where it's very unsustainable and something needs to change. ""This isn't something that can be put on the back burner, it really requires urgent action. We need funding, we need the staff."" The march came after aRoyal College of Midwives (RCM) survey last month,externalfound more than half of midwives were being ""driven out"" because of ""understaffing and fears they can't deliver safe care to women"". The Nursing and Midwifery Council said there are almost 40,000 midwives registered in the UK The midwifery body warned of an ""exodus"" after its UK-wide poll of 1,273 workers said 57% of midwives surveyed planned to leave the NHS within the next year. The RCM called for health chiefs to ""urgently review"" staffing levels as chief executive Gill Walton said: ""Safety in maternity services hang in the balance here, because without adequate numbers of staff, we are fighting a losing battle."" It comes after a number of high-profile maternity scandals atCwm Taf Morgannwghealth board in south Wales and at hospitals inEast Kent,Shrewsbury and TelfordandMorecambe Bayin England. New mum Vikki Mill, who marched in Bangor, said without support from her midwives, she or her daughter ""simply wouldn't be here today"". Florence spent her first days in a special baby care unit in hospital Florence was born at home in Penmaenpool, Gwynedd, last June because the midwife unit in nearby Dolgellau was a temporary Covid hospital. But Vikki needed hospital treatment after she retained her placenta, and the nearest major hospital was a 55-mile drive away in Bangor. But the ambulance Vikki ""waited hours for"" didn't have a car seat and wasn't equipped to transfer her first-born as paramedics had expected to transfer an adult. ""Flo had to go in a car seat with me in the ambulance but 40 minutes into the journey, my midwife noticed Flo was struggling to breathe,"" recalled Vikki. Vikki Mill, husband Will and Florence are all doing well after a ""chaotic"" start to their daughter's life ""The rest of the 90-minute journey saw both the paramedic and my midwife being thrown around in the back while holding Flo's chin off her chest and an adult oxygen mask over her face, keeping a close eye on my blood pressure. ""The midwife and the paramedic kept Flo alive on that journey - and the midwives who came to our house respected my birth space, gave me reassurance and also saved my life."" Vikki said returned to Bangor to march for a profession that she said was ""underfunded and undervalued"" by governments. ""My story is not unique,"" she said. ""To give birth, you rely on midwives. It's a momentous time in someone's life but you need medically trained professionals. Vikki and Will said they were indebted to their midwives after their care for Florence ""They have the skills, they know what to do in the event of an emergency when a baby is born and it's essential to listen to them, elevate their voice and hopefully reduce some of the demands on them."" The Nursing and Midwifery Council said the number of UK registered midwives had steadily increased over the years to 39,664 - with about 1,400 in Wales. Latestofficial figures show births have decreased,externalwith the Office for National Statistics saying there were 613,936 live births in England and Wales in 2020. The Royal College of Midwives hascalled for more investment,externalin the NHS as campaigners claim midwives are leaving the profession, maternity units are closing and the safety of births in the UK is in crisis. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We recognise that all staff working in maternity services have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. ""We regularly meet with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Royal College of Midwives and all health board maternity services to discuss staffing levels, skill mix and maternity workforce as a whole. We also worked with them in producing our five-year maternity vision published in 2019. ""Over the past five years training places for midwives have increased by 97%. We have also recently commissioned a review into the real-time system used by midwives to assess service demand."" The UK government said it was ""committed to patient safety"" and wanted to make the NHS ""the safest place in the world to give birth"". ""Midwives do an incredibly important job and we know how challenging it has been for those working during the pandemic,"" said a Department for Health and Social Care spokesman. ""There are more midwives working in the NHS now than at any other time in its history and we are aiming to hire 1,200 more with a Â£95m recruitment drive.""

"El Salvador plans Bitcoin city at base of volcanoFunded by the cryptocurrency, it will use the volcano's energy to power mining, the president says.Latin America & Caribbean","President Nayib Bukele announced the plans to a raucous crowd El Salvador plans to build a Bitcoin city at the base of a volcano, with the cryptocurrency used to fund the project, its president has announced. The city will be circular to represent the shape of a large coin and will be built in the south-eastern region of La UniÃ³n, President Nayib Bukele said. The site would take advantage of the Conchagua volcano's geothermal energy to power Bitcoin mining, he added. El Salvador recently became the first country to use Bitcoin as legal tender. The move led to large-scale protests over fears the cryptocurrency would bring instability and inflation to the impoverished Latin American country. Fear and excitement as Bitcoin becomes legal tender El Salvador divided over Bitcoin legal tender law What is Bitcoin? Addressing a raucous crowd at a promotional Bitcoin event in the coastal town of Mizata late on Saturday, Mr Bukele said the planned new city would ""include everything"". ""Residential areas, commercial areas, services, museums, entertainment, bars, restaurants, airport, port, rail - everything devoted to Bitcoin,"" the 40-year-old said. The president, who appeared on stage wearing a baseball cap backwards, said that no income taxes would be levied in the city, only value added tax (VAT). He said that half of the revenue gained from this would be used to ""to build up the city"", while the rest would be used to keep the streets ""neat and clean"". Mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is done using sophisticated computers to solve complex mathematical problems. It is costly, difficult and takes up large amounts of energy. Mr Bukele did not provide dates for construction or completion of the city, but said he estimated that much of the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 Bitcoins. One Bitcoin is currently trading at just under $60,000 (Â£45,000). In September, El Salvador introduced the virtual currency as a legal tender, alongside the US dollar. At the time, the government released a new digital wallet app, giving away $30 (Â£22) in Bitcoin to every citizen. More than 200 new cash machines were also installed across the country. It presented the measure as a way to boost economic development and jobs, but El Salvador has been divided by the move. It means that businesses, wherever possible, are now obliged to accept the digital coins as payment. Bitcoin is a controversial currency in part because its value can fluctuate significantly - it has risen and fallen dramatically over the past year.

The protocol is the deal between the EU and UK agreed as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border. Mr Å efÄoviÄ was speaking on Sunday on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show. He said that in his meetings with stakeholders in Northern Ireland the message had been to ""focus on the key priorities and problems we have to solve"". He said the four problems he heard repeatedly were supply of medicines, a need to reduce customs formalities, reduce SPS (agrifood) checks and find a way to better involve Northern Ireland stakeholders in the dealings of the protocol. ""If we can find a way to solve these problems we are opening the way for a smooth operation of the protocol,"" he said. ""My feeling is the Northern Irish people want us to work together to look for a way for the Protocol to work properly and in the smoothest possible way,"" he added. Lord Frost has said the solution is that ""goods which both we and the EU agree aren't going to leave NI should not be treated as if they were moving from one country to another because they are not and goods going into Ireland should be checked in the Irish Sea to protect the EU's single market and avoid a hard border"". Lord Frost said it was possible to generate momentum after meeting MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Friday Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the key word in Frost's article was the word ""urgency"". ""Sometimes I feel in our meetings I am the only one pushing for urgent solutions,"" he told the programme. ""We have been putting proposals on the table on solving the uninterrupted supply of medicines to NI since June and I remember Lord Frost telling me that what is important for him is not only content but also process. ""I was waiting to see if he can deliver on that solution jointly and I have to say that until today that has not been the case,"" he said. ""If we would still be in the mode of political posturing and bringing new problems to the table, I don't think we will solve the most pressing issues for Northern Ireland and so we may be acting alone to ensure the Northern Ireland people have the medicines they need,"" he added. Both men said that talks on Friday had brought some progress, with Mr Å efÄoviÄ saying there had been a ""change of tone"" andLord Frost saying ""significant gaps remain"". Allow Twitter content?

The Protocol leaves NI in the EU's single market for goods, meaning goods can flow freely with the Republic of Ireland. The main issue around the Protocol is that goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to a so-called Irish Sea border. The EU has acknowledged its is causing difficulties to some businesses and needs to be improved. However the UK is seeking more fundamental changes, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role. Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem Serious EU intent to fix NI border row - Irish PM What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Mr Å efÄoviÄ also discussed the possibility of theUK triggering Article 16. Article 16 of the protocol allows unilateral ""safeguard"" measures to be taken if either the EU or UK concluded that the deal was leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. That would amount to a suspension of parts of the deal. On Thursday, Lord Frost reiterated that triggering Article 16 remained an option for the UK. Goods arriving in Belfast from GB are subject to checks and controls The EU believes the use of Article 16 is unjustified and would be used by the UK as pretext to repudiate the protocol. Last month Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveneyhinted the EU could terminate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response. However, on Sunday Mr Å efÄoviÄ said he wanted to focus on the ""positives"". ""We shouldn't go into hypothetical negative scenarios,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

""We have to build a basis for future relations,"" he said adding that that basis was being built through a mutual agreement. ""If you pull the plug from the basics, then of course you have problems and therefore I think we should avoid them and focusing on a positive agenda and solving problems,"" he said. However, he said such an action would have serious consequences for EU-UK relations and people in NI. Late on Thursday night, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saidthere was ""serious intent"" in the EU to solve the disagreementon Northern Ireland. He said the mood music surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks but he admitted feeling frustrated that the issue had hindered the ""full flowering"" of the two sides' alliance.

"Labour and Plaid Cymru approve Senedd dealThe deal, including free school meals for all primary pupils, now needs backing from Plaid members.","The deal includes expanding free childcare for two year olds Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru's ruling bodies have approved a co-operation deal between the parties in the Senedd. BBC Wales has been told there was ""solid support"" for the deal at Welsh Labour's executive committee. Plaid Cymru's national executive committee also backed the deal but it will require the support of the party's members. The ""very wide-ranging"" deal includes a pledge toextend free school mealsto all primary school pupils. Some of the main points of the deal include: Introducing local tourism taxes Publishing proposals on rent controls to make properties affordable for locals Reforming housing law toend homelessness Creating an NHS style free-at-point-of-needNational Care Service Plans to change council tax Changes to the number of Members of the Senedd This video can not be played Parents share their experiences of paying for childcare. It also includes plans to expand thefree childcare offer for two year olds, and for all primary age children to be entitled to free school meals in Wales. The deal includes a cap onsecond and holiday home numbers, amid concerns those living in seaside and rural communitiesare being ""priced out"" of buying in their areas. There is also a commitment to ""work towards""parity of ""reward and recognition"" for health and care workers, and to reform building safety and provide more cash to help people in flats with cladding problems. This video can not be played It includes plans to provide more cash for people with cladding problems BBC Wales has been told the deal also includes a commitment to ""explore the creation of a shadow Broadcasting and Communications Authority for Wales, to address our concerns about the current fragility in the media and attacks on its independence"". ""This body would support the use of the Welsh language, particularly in digital and encourage media plurality. Council tax could change under a Labour-Plaid deal House prices could ruin community Talks with Plaid cannot go on forever, says FM ""We believe broadcasting and communication powers should be devolved to Wales,"" the deal adds. It comes as the process toappoint the new chairmanof the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to be re-started. It is expected that the deal will be published in full on Monday. Mark Drakeford (left) had been in talks with Plaid Cymru's Adam Price over the deal In ablog post,external, Darren Williams, a member of Labour's executive committee, said the agreement included free childcare for all two-year-olds, creation of a national care service, limits on second home ownership, and the creation of a publicly-owned construction company and an energy company. He also said it would include changes in the Senedd's size, ""including a statutory guarantee of gender balance"". The first minister has previously explained the talks were necessary because Welsh Labour has no overall majority to deal with""challenging and ambitious issues""as it has 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay. Talks were publicly announced in September after Labour and Plaid Cymru had been indiscussions over the summeraround policies they could work together on. Inmid-October, Mark Drakeford said the ""discussions need to come to a conclusion"" and they could not ""continue forever"". The deal would not amount to a coalition between the parties, and Plaid Cymru members of the Senedd will not be entering government. But BBC Wales has been told Plaid would be able to appoint special advisers to work on the deal in government. A Welsh Conservatives spokesman said the ""deal is remarkable for its absence of solutions to fix the NHS - currently experiencing its worst performance on record - or improve the economy in Wales"".

What went wrong at Man Utd?,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer first took over as interim manager of Manchester United in December 2018 It is the speed and steepness of the descent that has taken Manchester United by surprise. Not too long ago, it was all so different. There was much backslapping and an air of celebration whenUnited secured Cristiano Ronaldo's returnon 27 August amid strong interest from Manchester City. When the Portuguese superstar marked his second United debut with two goals in a 4-1 win over Newcastle, all seemed well. When hundreds of fans waited more than half-an-hour to hail the Portuguese superstar as he conducted interviews after that match, it seemed inconceivable that 10 weeks later, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be sacked. But, after surviving the5-0 home defeat by Liverpoolon 24 October and the 2-0 'humiliation' by Manchester City on 6 November, Solskjaer was catapulted out of the manager's chair following Saturday's4-1 loss at Watford. The statistics are stark. Four wins in 13 matches in all competitions since that Newcastle victory. Seven points from eight Premier League games, with United keeping one clean sheet. Nineteen goals conceded in seven games. Out of the Carabao Cup. The stats that tell the tale of Solskjaer's reign Everything you need to know about Solskjaer's United exit - in one place It would have been even worse but for an injury-time David de Gea penalty save that ensured a 2-1 Premier League win at West Ham in September, and three critical late goals from Ronaldo in the Champions League - late winners at home to Villarreal and Atalanta, and a dramatic point-saver against Gian Piero Gasperini's side in Italy. Solskjaer guided United to third and second in the Premier League in his two full seasons in charge For some, Solskjaer's exit has been a long time coming. They were never convinced the Norwegian was up to the job in the first place and have been waiting for him to fail since his appointment was made permanent in March 2019. That judgement is harsh. Solskjaer restored pride to a club that had turned in on itself during the last days of the Jose Mourinho era. Without question, he acted and took decisions for the benefit of Manchester United, a club seared into his heart. He secured a second-place finish in the Premier League last season, which is as high as United have managed since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. After 19 games, they were top, a position they have not enjoyed at such an advanced stage of the season since Ferguson left. Had they beaten Villarreal in the Europa League final as expected, Solskjaer would have given himself an element of protection against the problems that engulfed him. But De Gea missed in a bizarre penalty shootout in Gdansk and, as some felt at the time, the effect of those fine margins going against the Norwegian are now being felt. This video can not be played Premier League: How 'fantastic' Watford put four goals past 'embarrassing' Man Utd That is not to say Solskjaer bears no responsibility for United's collapse. It has been obvious for a long time which players he trusts and which he does not. Evidently, Donny van de Beek falls into the latter category. It is not entirely clear what role Solskjaer played in Van de Beek's Â£35m arrival from Ajax in September 2020, but he never gave any particular impression he thought the Dutchman could be a significant presence at Old Trafford. BBC Sport has been told by more than one source that Solskjaer felt there was a nervousness about Van de Beek, leading to uncertainty over whether he could flourish at United. That view is slightly odd given nearly every match last season was played in an empty stadium. That Van de Beek came on and scored as United thrashed about looking for a way back into the Watford game undermined Solskjaer's view even more. Van de Beek was among a number of United players who have been edged to the periphery this season. Dean Henderson's hopes of challenging for the goalkeeping slot have been dashed, although, admittedly, David de Gea has been one of United's best performers. However, with De Gea and Henderson on first-team duties, Tom Heaton has been reduced to the role of third choice, which does not seem to be the best use of the 35-year-old, who was in the England squad before he got injured two years ago. Jesse Lingard posted a picture of himself on social media wearing a West Ham kit on Friday. This came after BBC Sport and other media outlets, learned of the collapse of contract talks with United. Lingard's outstanding loan spell at West Ham in the second half of last season propelled him back into the England reckoning. He opted not to return to London Stadium on a permanent basis in the summer, partly because he understood Solskjaer would offer more opportunities, which have not arrived. Harry Maguire, who joined Manchester United in 2019 for Â£80m, was sent off against Watford on Saturday On 12 November, Harry Maguire stuck his fingers in his ears - a gesture interpreted as a dig at his critics - after scoring in England's 5-0 win over Albania. Eight days later, the United captain was sent off playing for his club in the defeat at Watford. Those two matches encapsulated the defender's recent form. Good for England, terrible for United. That could be seen during the 4-2 defeat at his old club Leicester in October, when his error offered the home side a way back into a game they were losing. It could be seen too during the Manchester derby in early November, when he and Luke Shaw dithered, and allowed City's Bernardo Silva to take control and score. Maguire and Shaw were passive, waiting for the ball to go out of play. That attitude contrasted sharply with Bernardo, who was pro-active in trying to make something happen. It hinted at a timidity that runs throughout the United side. Aaron Wan-Bissaka's concentration has never been great. But after being caught in no-man's land against Liverpool in October and having it exposed mercilessly by TV pundits, he did virtually the same thing against City in the build-up to their opening goal. Bruno Fernandes' failure to take a clear chance to equalise at Watford came after a performance against City that was as poor as he has produced since he came to United, as he gave cheap possession away time after time. It has never been entirely clear why United spent Â£47m on Brazilian midfielder Fred. And the only thing that can be said about the injured Paul Pogba is that no-one is arguing that things would have been any better had the Frenchman - sent off after coming on as a substitute against Liverpool - been available. This video can not be played Manchester United: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ""honoured"" & ""privileged"" for trust shown by club One of the accusations regularly thrown about Solskjaer is that he doesn't have a strong footballing style to mark him out, meaning that he pales in comparison with managerial heavyweights such as Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel. This view ignores the fact he has beaten sides managed by all three, while also getting the better of Julian Nagelsmann, Marcelo Bielsa and Mauricio Pochettino. Initially, Solskjaer felt his squad lacked the fitness to press the way he wanted. He got rid of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez with the aim of having a younger strikeforce who could run and force opposition defences into mistakes. His midfield still looked weak, but there was a coherent pattern to Solskjaer's recruitment. He signed Jadon Sancho early in the close season and persuaded Edinson Cavani to remain at Old Trafford for an extra year when it had appeared the Uruguayan was minded to move on. Cristiano Ronaldo had an immediate impact on his return to Old Trafford Ronaldo's arrival smashed the template. At a stroke, the number nine role, which Cavani and Mason Greenwood had been expected to share, was handed over to the 36-year-old. As a consequence, Cavani has barely played and Greenwood has occupied a wide role, reducing Sancho's opportunities. Ronaldo's abilities are beyond question and his goals have saved United more than once this season. But pressing defenders out of possession was not his game 10 years ago and nothing has changed. Did Solskjaer really value Ronaldo's Old Trafford return as much as the executives who knew what a commercial impact the Portuguese superstar would have? And, if not, was he willing to say so? Even when Solskjaer was still in his job and results were going well, a few sources, steeped in United's history, wondered whether he was prepared to go to war internally for what he believed was right, whether he was prepared to challenge the Glazer family and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. Deep down, the theory goes, Solskjaer always felt he was fortunate to get such a massive job given his relatively low-profile managerial CV, and his nature meant he would accept imperfect situations rather than rail against them. That narrative may explain why Solskjaer survived those awful defeats by Liverpool and Manchester City. It may also explain why United allowed Antonio Conte to join Tottenham rather than making a move for the demanding Italian. Now though, they are on the search for post-Ferguson manager number five. And after what has gone before, there can be no real confidence they will get it right this time.

Man Utd sack manager SolskjaerThe club is seventh in the Premier League following Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Watford.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Watford 4-1 Manchester United: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will take the 'flak' for United loss Manchester United have sacked manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Watford. The club have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches and are seventh in the table, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea. First-team coach Michael Carrick has been placed in temporary charge while United seek an interim manager to the end of the season. ""It is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,"" United said. Reaction to Solskjaer's sacking What went wrong at Man Utd - and was it all down to Solskjaer? The stats that tell the tale of Solskjaer's reign Everything you need to know about Solskjaer's United exit - in one place The club's recent run of poor form includes a 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool on 24 October and a 2-0 defeat by Manchester City on 6 November. United added: ""While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success. ""Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future."" Solskjaer is a former Red Devils player, scoring 126 goals in 11 seasons from 1996-2007 including the winner in the 1999 Champions League final. United said in their statement: ""His place in the club's history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. ""He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family."" United next play when they travel to Spain to take on Villarreal in the Champions League on Tuesday, before league games against Chelsea and Arsenal. Darren Fletcher will stay on as technical director, while Mike Phelan and Kieran McKenna - who were part of Solskjaer's coaching set up - will also remain at the club for the time being. Former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, currently out of work, is an early favourite with bookmakers to become United's next manager. Allow Twitter content?

Solskjaer, 48, replaced Jose Mourinho on an interim basis in December 2018. The Norwegian was then given the jobfull-timein March 2019 on a three-year contract and, in July, signed a new deal with the club until 2024. Solskjaer was United's fourth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 - and had lasted longer than more experienced predecessors David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho. But with United finishing in second place in the Premier League last May - 12 points behind champions Manchester City - and losing the Europa League final to Villarreal on penalties, it was accepted that Solskjaer needed a trophy this season to stay in the job. United are top of their Champions League group after four games, level on points with second-placed Villarreal but only two ahead of Atalanta in third. They were beaten by Moyes' West Ham in the third round of the Carabao Cup and have yet to start their FA Cup campaign. This video can not be played Premier League: How 'fantastic' Watford put four goals past 'embarrassing' Man Utd After four wins and a draw in their first five Premier League games, United have been poor, claiming just four points from a possible 21. They have conceded 21 goals in 12 games - only the bottom two sides Norwich and Newcastle have conceded more, with 27. United goalkeeper David de Gea described his side's defeat by Watford as ""embarrassing"" and ""another nightmare"". ""We don't know what to do with the ball, we are conceding a lot of goals. It's a horrible moment,"" he added. Solskjaer leaves United with a win percentage of54.2%from168games across all competitions.

After the seismic Liverpool defeat, Solskjaer said he ""had come too far"" to give up. And United had attempted to stand firm with their backing of Solskjaer despite a poor start to the season. But there has been intense scrutiny and criticism of their performances from pundits, the media, and even the players themselves. Both Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes have spoken out in recent weeks - and on the Monday after the humiliation by rivals Liverpool,BBC Sport reportedthat an increasing number of players had started to lose faith in Solskjaer's tactics and felt he was out of his depth compared with managers at other leading clubs, namely Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp and Chelsea's Thomas Tuchel. After a 4-2 defeat at Leicester in October,Pogba saidUnited needed to ""change something"", adding: ""We have been having these kind of games for a long time and haven't found the problem. We have conceded easy and stupid goals."" And after United lost the Manchester derby, Fernandes said players needed to ""look in the mirror"" because they were ""not at the same level"" as their City counterparts. Solskjaer becomes the sixth Premier League managerial casualty of the season, a high numberthat has been attributed in partto the fact that full crowds have returned to games for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The suggestion is that struggling managers are more vulnerable to the sack with big crowds calling for them to go than they were when games were being played in empty - or partly empty - stadiums. There were only four Premier League managerial exits in the whole of last season, and only Slaven Bilic, at West Brom, lost his job before Christmas. But this season, Xisco Munoz at Watford, Steve Bruce at Newcastle, Nuno Espirito Santo at Tottenham, Daniel Farke at Norwich, and Dean Smith at Aston Villa have all left their clubs. United spent more than Â£110m in the summer, bringing in Jadon Sancho (Â£73m), Raphael Varane (Â£34m) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Â£12.85m) - investment that followed fan protests against the Glazer family ownership towards the end of last season. During Solskjaer's reign, United have spent more than Â£400m on transfer fees - and those signings include captain Harry Maguire from Leicester for Â£80m, Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace for Â£50m, Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon for Â£47m, and Donny van de Beek from Ajax for Â£39m.

For a start, United officials felt Solskjaer had affected the ""cultural reboot"" demanded of him when Jose Mourinho was sacked in December 2018. He had also reshaped the squad, replacing players such as Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez with younger attacking talent and, until the middle of September, had maintained a steady improvement. They are small achievements for a club of United's size but the securing successive top-three finishes -for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 - was viewed as a positive, as were the four semi-final appearances and a Europa League final. The brutal truth is none of this turned into tangible silverware, which might have provided a buffer over the past 10 weeks. Nevertheless, United's ownership and executive team were united in believing Solskjaer deserved the chance to halt the dreadful run, first at Watford and, in theory, beyond that, into key games against Villarreal and Chelsea. But the manner of Saturday's reverse at Vicarage Road made it clear something significant had to change and Solskjaer has paid the price.

Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock,"Technology retailers have warned that they may have insufficient stock to meet Black Friday demand due to delays in the supply chain. The IMRG, the UK's Online Retail Association, said the industry had seen delays to stock arriving. ""The real pinch points are Asia,"" Andy Mulcahy, IMRG insights director, said. Shortages of drivers and warehouse staff to send out purchased goods are also a worry for businesses, according to Mr Mulcahy.

Man Utd manager Solskjaer leaves club,"This video can not be played Watford 4-1 Manchester United: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will take the 'flak' for United loss Manchester United have sacked manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Watford. The club have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches and are seventh in the table, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea. First-team coach Michael Carrick has been placed in temporary charge while United seek an interim manager to the end of the season. ""It is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,"" United said. Reaction to Solskjaer's sacking What went wrong at Man Utd - and was it all down to Solskjaer? The stats that tell the tale of Solskjaer's reign Everything you need to know about Solskjaer's United exit - in one place The club's recent run of poor form includes a 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool on 24 October and a 2-0 defeat by Manchester City on 6 November. United added: ""While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success. ""Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future."" Solskjaer is a former Red Devils player, scoring 126 goals in 11 seasons from 1996-2007 including the winner in the 1999 Champions League final. United said in their statement: ""His place in the club's history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. ""He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family."" United next play when they travel to Spain to take on Villarreal in the Champions League on Tuesday, before league games against Chelsea and Arsenal. Darren Fletcher will stay on as technical director, while Mike Phelan and Kieran McKenna - who were part of Solskjaer's coaching set up - will also remain at the club for the time being. Former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, currently out of work, is an early favourite with bookmakers to become United's next manager. Allow Twitter content?

Solskjaer, 48, replaced Jose Mourinho on an interim basis in December 2018. The Norwegian was then given the jobfull-timein March 2019 on a three-year contract and, in July, signed a new deal with the club until 2024. Solskjaer was United's fourth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 - and had lasted longer than more experienced predecessors David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho. But with United finishing in second place in the Premier League last May - 12 points behind champions Manchester City - and losing the Europa League final to Villarreal on penalties, it was accepted that Solskjaer needed a trophy this season to stay in the job. United are top of their Champions League group after four games, level on points with second-placed Villarreal but only two ahead of Atalanta in third. They were beaten by Moyes' West Ham in the third round of the Carabao Cup and have yet to start their FA Cup campaign. This video can not be played Premier League: How 'fantastic' Watford put four goals past 'embarrassing' Man Utd After four wins and a draw in their first five Premier League games, United have been poor, claiming just four points from a possible 21. They have conceded 21 goals in 12 games - only the bottom two sides Norwich and Newcastle have conceded more, with 27. United goalkeeper David de Gea described his side's defeat by Watford as ""embarrassing"" and ""another nightmare"". ""We don't know what to do with the ball, we are conceding a lot of goals. It's a horrible moment,"" he added. Solskjaer leaves United with a win percentage of54.2%from168games across all competitions.

After the seismic Liverpool defeat, Solskjaer said he ""had come too far"" to give up. And United had attempted to stand firm with their backing of Solskjaer despite a poor start to the season. But there has been intense scrutiny and criticism of their performances from pundits, the media, and even the players themselves. Both Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes have spoken out in recent weeks - and on the Monday after the humiliation by rivals Liverpool,BBC Sport reportedthat an increasing number of players had started to lose faith in Solskjaer's tactics and felt he was out of his depth compared with managers at other leading clubs, namely Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp and Chelsea's Thomas Tuchel. After a 4-2 defeat at Leicester in October,Pogba saidUnited needed to ""change something"", adding: ""We have been having these kind of games for a long time and haven't found the problem. We have conceded easy and stupid goals."" And after United lost the Manchester derby, Fernandes said players needed to ""look in the mirror"" because they were ""not at the same level"" as their City counterparts. Solskjaer becomes the sixth Premier League managerial casualty of the season, a high numberthat has been attributed in partto the fact that full crowds have returned to games for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The suggestion is that struggling managers are more vulnerable to the sack with big crowds calling for them to go than they were when games were being played in empty - or partly empty - stadiums. There were only four Premier League managerial exits in the whole of last season, and only Slaven Bilic, at West Brom, lost his job before Christmas. But this season, Xisco Munoz at Watford, Steve Bruce at Newcastle, Nuno Espirito Santo at Tottenham, Daniel Farke at Norwich, and Dean Smith at Aston Villa have all left their clubs. United spent more than Â£110m in the summer, bringing in Jadon Sancho (Â£73m), Raphael Varane (Â£34m) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Â£12.85m) - investment that followed fan protests against the Glazer family ownership towards the end of last season. During Solskjaer's reign, United have spent more than Â£400m on transfer fees - and those signings include captain Harry Maguire from Leicester for Â£80m, Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace for Â£50m, Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon for Â£47m, and Donny van de Beek from Ajax for Â£39m.

For a start, United officials felt Solskjaer had affected the ""cultural reboot"" demanded of him when Jose Mourinho was sacked in December 2018. He had also reshaped the squad, replacing players such as Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez with younger attacking talent and, until the middle of September, had maintained a steady improvement. They are small achievements for a club of United's size but the securing successive top-three finishes -for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 - was viewed as a positive, as were the four semi-final appearances and a Europa League final. The brutal truth is none of this turned into tangible silverware, which might have provided a buffer over the past 10 weeks. Nevertheless, United's ownership and executive team were united in believing Solskjaer deserved the chance to halt the dreadful run, first at Watford and, in theory, beyond that, into key games against Villarreal and Chelsea. But the manner of Saturday's reverse at Vicarage Road made it clear something significant had to change and Solskjaer has paid the price.

World Cup a chance to 'engage' on human rights,"Germany are among teams to have highlighted migrant workers' rights in Qatar Wales would use World Cup qualification as an ""opportunity to engage"" around Qatar's human rights record, according to the boss of Welsh football. Wales aretwo play-off games away from qualifyingfor the World Cup finals for the first time since 1958. Amnesty International claim migrant workers are being exploited in Qatar building stadiums for the tournament. Qatar's government said it has ""never shied away from acknowledging that its labour system is...a work in progress."" Denmark have said they will put""extra pressure"" on Fifaover human rights concerns in the build-up to the World Cup. Norway, Netherlands and Germanyplayers have protestedabout alleged human rights abuses in Qatar. Asked in an interview with theBBC Politics Walesprogramme if the Welsh players would protest, the Football Association of Wales' chief executive Noel Mooney said: ""I certainly haven't discussed it with the players. ""I haven't heard anything about that to be fair, that's up to the players."" What next for Wales in World Cup play-offs? Rainbow Wall for Wales' LGBTQ+ fans Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar. Asked what he would say to Wales' LGBTQ+ fans who might want to travel to the World Cup, Mr Mooney said: ""My advice would be that they should go to the match, to the games and follow us in Qatar at the World Cup. ""We'll make sure that whatever we have to do to protect people is in place. ""This is an opportunity, rather than being negative about it, we see it as an opportunity to engage, to give our view of how people should be treated to them,"" he added. The Qatar government said: ""Qatar rejects Amnesty's assertion that labour reforms have not translated into changes on the ground for hundreds of thousands of migrant workers. ""Every year, more companies are held accountable for violating the law. ""Systemic reform is a long-term process and shifting the behaviour of every company takes time."" Ryan Giggs will stand trial in January, accused of assault, as well as coercive and controlling behaviour. He denies the charges In a wide-ranging interview with Politics Wales, Mr Mooney also said he could see a ""tension"" between comments made by the FAW around Ryan Giggs' involvement in the Wales squad. The Wales manager will stand trial in January, accused of assault, as well as coercive and controlling behaviour. He denies the charges. After Giggs was arrested last year, the FAW said he would""not be involved""with the Wales team. But assistant boss Robert Page has said Giggs was""a phone call away""and that he would ""have an input and rightly so."" Asked if he could see a tension between the FAW and Page's comments around whether Ryan Giggs was involved in the squad or not, Mr Mooney replied: ""I can see how there would be a tension on it, yeah, I can see how there is."" But Mr Mooney went on to say he was ""not aware"" that Ryan Giggs had ""any input into any of our squads"". Former Wales women's boss Jayne Ludlow has called for her players to earnequal paywith the men's team for playing for Wales. Mr Mooney said the FAW would be ""getting really close to that [equal pay] if not full parity on pay in the next year or so."" He said the FAW ""significantly increased"" the pay for women's internationals and they ""now use the same pitches, the same chartered flights, the same chefs, in fact they've got additional care"". With a study claimingWelsh football is worth Â£550mto the country, the FAW has called on the Welsh government to invest more in the grassroots game. An audit of the pitches required in Wales is being conducted over the next few months. But Mr Mooney said he thought the ""bill will come in north of Â£100 million"". He added that he would like to see a ""significant increase in investment into grassroots facilities"" in the upcoming draft Welsh government budget for the next financial year.
