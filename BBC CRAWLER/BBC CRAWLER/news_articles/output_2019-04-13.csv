'New class' of medicine reverses disease,"Sue Burrell no longer has severe bouts of pain. Doctors have used a new type of medicine called ""gene silencing"" to reverse a disease that leaves people in crippling pain. The condition, acute intermittent porphyria, also causes paralysis and is fatal in some cases. The novel approach fine-tunes the genetic instructions locked in our DNA. Doctors say they are ""genuinely surprised"" how successful it is and that the same approach could be used in previously untreatable diseases. Sue Burrell, from Norfolk, has endured pain few could imagine and needed to take strong opioid painkillers every day. At one point her porphyria was causing severe attacks every couple of weeks and needed hospital treatment. But even then morphine did not stop the pain. She told the BBC it was worse than child-birth, saying: ""It's so intense - so strong it's in your legs, in your back, and it just resonates everywhere. It's really, really unbearable."" Her sister was affected even more severely and was completely paralysed in hospital for two years. British Porphyria Association,external There are several types of porphyria, but each is caused by the body being unable to produce enough of a substance called haem. Haem is a key component of the haemoglobin in red blood cells that transport oxygen around the body. Problems in the body's haem manufacturing process can lead to a build up of toxic proteins. These cause the attacks of physical pain in Sue's form of the disease. In other porphyrias the proteins can cause skin problems. There is some speculationKing George III had porphyria. Sue no longer needs daily painkillers Sue was one of the patients on the trial and is now taking the drug. She says her life has been transformed. ""I've had pain for 10 years, I didn't expect that could go away. I'm seeing friends and they're [asking] 'you're not taking any painkillers?' and I was [saying] 'no!'."" A clinical trial on 94 people across 18 countries was presented at the International Liver Congress in Vienna. The therapy cut the number of severe attacks by 74%. And 50% of patients were completely clear of attacks that needed hospital treatment, compared to 16% given a dummy treatment. One person dropped out of the study due to side effects. Your DNA contains the instructions for building the human body The treatment uses an approach called gene silencing. A gene is part of our DNA that contains the blueprint for making proteins, such as hormones, enzymes or raw building materials. But our DNA is locked away inside a cell's nucleus and kept apart from a cell's protein-making factories. So our bodies use a short strand of genetic code, called messenger RNA, to bridge the gap and carry the instructions. This drug, called givosiran, kills the messenger in a process known as RNA interference. In acute intermittent porphyria it lowers the levels of an enzyme involved in haem production and prevents the build-up of toxic proteins. Prof David Rees, from King's College London, treated patients taking part in the trial in the UK. He told the BBC: ""This is a really important treatment - it's innovative. Porphyria is one of the first conditions it has been used in successfully. ""I'm genuinely surprised how well it works in this condition and I think it offers a lot of hope for the future."" Potentially yes, but it is still very early days. Gene silencing has been used to treat a genetic disease that causes nerve damage and the US Food and Drug Administrationsaid such medicines,external""have the potential to transform medicine"". A similar approach is also being investigated in Huntington's disease, which is caused by a toxic protein that kills brain cells. Huntingtonâs breakthrough may stop disease Researchers are also looking into it as an alternative to statins for lowering cholesterol. Barry Greene, the president of Alnylam, which developed the porphyria drug, told the BBC the latest findings were ""heralding a brand new class of medicine"". The field of gene silencing has been around for a long time. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006,externalwent to the researchers who discovered RNA interference, which occurs naturally in our cells. But the field is now getting to the point where it can be harnessed to help some patients. Dr Alena Pance, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, told the BBC News website: ""I get excited about this, because targeting the messenger RNA allows the fine-tuning of the proteins that are involved in certain diseases. ""And therefore, perhaps for the first time, [it can] offer a tool to be able to control those diseases to very accurate levels. ""There are diseases that are very difficult to find treatment for, that with this technology might be possible to tackle."" Kind of. Gene therapy permanently alters the hard copy of the genetic instructions in DNA. This can be beneficial as it means you need treatment only once, but could also be more risky. If anything goes wrong, such as accidentally editing the wrong part of the genetic code, it cannot be undone. Gene silencing leaves the original DNA alone, but targets the instructions that it sends out into the cell. The downside is you need to keep taking the treatment for the therapy to work. The two approaches are likely to have roles in different diseases. Gene therapy has greater potential in diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy where a vital protein for keeping muscles intact is missing. Gene silencing has more potential where tweaking levels of a protein will affect the course of a disease. This is the million dollar question, almost literally, as so far genetic medicines have been expensive. A recent gene therapy for a rare form of blindnesswas priced at $850,000,external(Â£650,000) for the one-off treatment. How much the monthly injections of givosiran will be is still unknown. The hope will be that as the field develops, the costs will eventually come down.

Sex attacks involving dating apps 'rising',"The number of recorded sexual offences involving online dating sites and apps has almost doubled in the last four years, police figures suggest. Offences where a dating site was mentioned in a police report increased from 156 in 2015, to 286 last year, according to figures from 23 of the 43 forces in England and Wales. The Online Dating Association said apps try to protect users from harm. But the National Police Chiefs' Council said firms had a duty to do more. The figures reveal that between 2015 and 2018 there were a total of 2,029 recorded offences - including sexual offences - where an online dating website or app was mentioned in a police report. In 2015, 329 offences were recorded, compared to 658 recorded offences last year. Victims told BBC's 5 Live Investigates more should be done by the companies operating the apps to prevent predators from using them to seek out victims. They called on companies to ask for proof of ID documents and to carry out criminal record checks to prevent offenders from using dating apps to target victims. Katherine Smith, 26, was stabbed to death by Anthony Lowe in September 2017, two months after they met on the website Plenty of Fish. Ms Smith was stabbed 33 times, receiving wounds to her back, heart and lungs. Debbie Smith and her daughter, Katherine Lowe pleadedguilty to murder at Cardiff Crown Court last yearand was jailed for a minimum of 18 years. His trial heard how Lowe faked his identity to meet Ms Smith, saying he was 10 years younger and that his name was Tony Moore. He did not mention his criminal past. Katherine's mother, Debbie, said: ""They should double-check people before they let them on to these sites, it's so easy. ""If Katherine had known he had a criminal record she wouldn't have gone out with him."" The National Police Chiefs' Council said firms have a social responsibility to prevent abuse on their platforms. ""This would assist law enforcement to concentrate resources on offenders who pose the most harm to the most vulnerable in our society."" George Kidd, chief executive of the Online Dating Association which represents some of the online dating and app companies, said they are unable to do criminal record checks on users but do work with police and are committed to doing all they can to help keep people safe. ""A third of relationships start this way and 10 million people use them in the UK. It's part of our social fabric, we want to celebrate it and make sure it's safe,"" he said. Match Group, which owns Plenty of Fish, said it uses ""industry-leading automated and manual moderation and review tools, systems and processes - and spends millions of dollars annually - to prevent, monitor and remove people who engage in inappropriate behaviour from our apps"". ""Match Group takes the safety, security and well-being of our users very seriously - we consider it our top priority,"" it added.

"Give Sweden priority on Assange, Javid urged","More than 70 MPs and peers have signed a letter urging the home secretary to ensure Julian Assange faces authorities in Sweden if they want his extradition. The Wikileaks founder, who is now in UK custody, was arrested on Thursday after years in Ecuador's London embassy. Sweden is considering whether to reopen an investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against him. And the US is seeking his extradition in relation to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, in 2010. The whistle-blowing website Wikileaks has published thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and war. Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of sexual assault, which he has denied. At the time, the Australian-born 47-year-old said he had had entirely consensual sex with two women while on a trip to Stockholm, and that the Swedish claims against him were part of a smear campaign. Swedish prosecutors dropped a rape investigation into Assange in 2017 because they were unable to formally notify him of allegations while he stayed in the embassy. Two other charges of molestation and unlawful coercion had to be dropped in 2015 because time had run out. But Swedishprosecutors say they are now re-examining Assange's caseat the request of the lawyer acting for the alleged rape victim. In their letter to Sajid Javid, 70 parliamentarians - chiefly Labour MPs and peers - urged him to ""stand with the victims of sexual violence"" and ensure the rape claim against the Wikileaks founder could be ""properly investigated"". ""We do not presume guilt, of course, but we believe due process should be followed and the complainant should see justice be done,"" the letter said. Labour's Stella Creasytweeted a copy of the letter sent to Mr Javid.,external The same letter was also sent to shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK government should not extradite Julian Assange to the US. But speaking on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said he had made it ""very clear all along that if there are allegations which Julian Assange needs to answer, of sexual issues, sexual attacks that may or may not have taken place in Sweden, then it's a matter for the courts to decide - but I do think he should answer those questions"". He added: ""My objection was to his extradition to the United States because I do believe that Wikileaks told us the truth about what was actually happening in Afghanistan and in Iraq."" The Labour leader said it was now for Sweden to put forward proposals on the matter. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also said on Friday she was ""disgusted"" the US allegation had been ""allowed to eclipse"" the sex offence case. Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world Why Julian Assange is a wanted man Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in embassy One of the letter's signatories, Stephen Kinnock, told the BBC the events surrounding Assange had ""become politicised"", and that the letter was intended ""to underline the point that first and foremost Mr Assange is accused of rape and sexual violence in Sweden"". ""It is vital that doesn't get airbrushed out of the conversation."" Assange was dramatically arrested by UK police on Thursday after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum. Westminster Magistrates' Court found him guilty of a charge of breaching bail later that day. He faces up to 12 months in prison for that conviction. The letter from parliamentarians says both UK and US authorities seem to have been aware in advance of Ecuador's decision to rescind Mr Assange's political asylum, but said it was a matter of ""grave concern"" that Swedish authorities did not appear to be aware of the impending arrest. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London The United States alleges that Assange conspired with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. Documents published by Wikileaks relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents. The US has already charged Assange witha single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers,externalto reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. If found guilty, Assange could be jailed for up to five years. Extradition proceedings are dealt with by the courts. According to the Home Office, the home secretary can bring a limited number of factors into consideration when deciding whether to order a person's extradition. These include whether the person might be at risk of the death penalty or whether the requesting state might try to add additional charges it has not specified. Lawyer Rebecca Niblock said that, if Sweden made an extradition request, it would be for the home secretary to decide which would take precedence, considering factors such as which was made first and the seriousness of the offence. The rape allegation in Sweden has a limitation period which expires in August 2020; inquiries into claims of molestation and unlawful coercion have already been timed out. Assange is due to face a hearing over his possible extradition to the US on 2 May. His lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" for journalists publishing information about the US. The UN has called for his right to a fair trial to be respected during any extradition process.

Most new schools not fitted with sprinklers,"The government has been accused of a ""callous disregard"" for pupils' safety after admitting just 15% of new schools are being built with sprinklers to tackle fires. Schools minister Nick Gibb said 105 of the 673 schools built and open by February were fitted with sprinklers. The government said sprinklers were installed when ""considered necessary"". But the Fire Brigades Union said the government was showing ""utter complacency"" on fire safety in schools. ""We've made it clear that newly-built schools and other high-risk buildings should have sprinkler systems,"" added the FBU. ""Sprinklers can assist in the control of a fire in its early stages, limiting damage and giving occupants additional time to escape, as well as reducing the risks faced by firefighters attending the incident."" Firefighters call for sprinkler law 'No sprinklers in 96% of London towers' Sprinklers 'would have saved Grenfell' Sprinklers are mandatory in new school buildings in Scotland and Wales, but not in England. Government guidance on safe school design says all new premises should be fitted with sprinklers ""except in a few low-risk schools"". There were no fatalities from school fires in the eight years up to 2017/18, but there were 244 casualties, according to official figures. The National Education Union said it was ""perverse"" that ministers were not enforcing the advice. The Department for Education stressed pupil and staff safety was ""paramount"", and defended its record. It added: ""All new school buildings must be signed-off by an inspector to certify that they meet the requirements of building regulations and where sprinklers are considered necessary, they must be installed."" The new data came in response to a question from Labour MP and former teacher Stephanie Peacock, who said: ""The ridiculous thing is that we spend far more rebuilding and repairing schools after fires than we would have paid to install sprinklers in the first place.""

British Steel seeks ÃÂ£100m government loan,"British Steel's Scunthorpe plant British Steel is seeking a Â£100m loan from the government in order to meet EU emission rules. Previously, the company could have used EU-issued carbon credits to settle its 2018 pollution bill. However, the steel maker has been affected by a European Union decision to suspend UK firms' access to free carbon permitsuntil a Brexit withdrawal deal is ratified. Sources say there is no danger to British Steel sites or jobs. The EU'semissions trading system,external's rules allow industrial polluters to use carbon credits to pay for the previous year's emissions, or trade them to raise money. Each free permit gives a firm the right to emit a tonne (1,000kg) of carbon dioxide (CO2), and they can be traded for money. In a statement the company said: ""We are discussing the impact of Brexit on our business with ministers and officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and they have been extremely responsive and supportive to date."" The company is in talks with Department for Business about financial help. The Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy told the BBC: ""As the business department, we are in regular conversation with a wide range of sectors and companies."" British Steel has until 30 April to comply with EU emission rules. What happens after Brexit?

Labour 'trying to break Brexit deadlock',"Jeremy Corbyn said he did not want to pitch remain and leave supporters against each other The real divide in society is between rich and poor and not Brexit, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told party members in Llandudno. At Welsh Labour conference Mr Corbyn said his party is trying to end the Commons deadlock on the issue. He said he did not want to pit remain voters in one part of the country against leave voters in another. Meanwhile Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said Brexit should not be used to ""short-change"" Wales. He also announced Â£2.3m tooffer sanitary products to all learners in schools and colleges. The Labour frontbench in Westminsteris taking part in Brexit talks with Theresa May's government. ""Only Labour has been consistently trying to find a way through the deadlock,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""Labour doesn't believe the real divide in society is between people who voted to remain or to leave the European Union. ""We believe the real divide is between the many - who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes - and the few - who set the rules, reap the rewards and dodge their taxes."" Welsh Labour conference is taking place in Llandudno over the weekend Labour does not want to ""set the hard up family in Cardiff that voted to remain, against the hard up family in Wrexham that voted to leave,"" Mr Corbyn said. The politician said people that believe leaving or remaining in the EU are ends in themselves are ""wrong"". ""The first question is what kind of society do we want to be,"" he said. ""On that we can find so much common ground."" Mr Corbyn said the previous weeks in politics had been ""intense"" and that the Westminster political system had not come out of it well. He said it was ""scandalous"" that the offer of talks on Brexit had come so late from the PM. His party will continue to talk to the government, the leader said, to abide by the result of the referendum without ""wrecking our economy"". But if that is not possible all options should remain on the table, including a public vote, Mr Corbyn said to applause from delegates. There are calls in his party for another referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU. Mark Drakeford said Alun Cairns could be ""heading for a fight"" over Brexit In his conference speech, Mr Drakeford told delegates that Theresa May was the ""first Prime Minister in history to fall on her own sword - and then to miss it"". The Welsh Labour leader accused the Conservative party of being ""wrapped and trapped by a mythical nostalgia for a past remembered only by its ever diminishing membership"". In a speech which did not mention a further referendum, Mr Drakeford said ""the chaos of Brexit"" is seen as an opportunity for Mr Cairns ""to grow his own office"". ""So let me issue this very clear warning to the Secretary of State for Wales,"" Mr Drakeford said, referring to Alun Cairns. The AM for Cardiff West said if Mr Cairns ""continues to persist in using the so-called UK Shared Prosperity Fund"" - which is aimed to replace EU funds - ""as a means of by-passing the National Assembly, as a way of using Brexit to short-change the people of Wales, then he is heading for a fight"". Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Will Labour push for a public vote? What are the Brexit sticking points? The FM said EU funds must be replaced, and devolved powers kept: ""Not a penny less, not a power lost"". Currently EU funds in Wales are spent by a body of the Welsh Government. Last year Theresa May would not confirm if the new fundwould be devolved. Mr Drakeford said he had a ""simple message"" to voters and Labour members on the European elections, saying they should be taken as seriously as a general election. ""You will be told that these elections are meaningless; that it's not worth bothering to turn out to campaign or not even bothering to vote,"" he said. ""Please do not believe it."" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Ruth Jones was elected to represent Newport West last week Mark Drakeford's first speech as Welsh Labour leader was well received in the hall, and contained a popular policy announcement on combating period poverty. But it was curiously retrospective given that Mr Drakeford only took up the reins of government in December. Perhaps that's because it was also, undoubtedly, an appeal for party unity at a time when Brexit is turning both main UK parties upside down and inside out. There was the promise of legislation on fair working and a call to delegates to front up in the event that elections to the European Parliament take place next month. But the divisive issue of another Brexit referendum? That was the proverbial elephant in the room. New Labour MP Ruth Jones, who won the Newport West by-election last week, gave the welcome address at conference, telling delegates that in devolution's 20th year ""our task is to stand up for the people of Wales"". ""People have had enough after a decade of austerity,"" she said, calling it a ""political choice, not a financial one"". Shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees appealed ""for calmness in a country that is divided because of the inexplicable way the prime minister has handled the Brexit negotiations"". She said language in emails and on social media had become ""intimidating"", and had reported the worst cases to the police. ""It's changed from 'I'm writing to tell you I don't agree with you' to 'you're a traitor, letting down people who voted for you',"" she said.

Train delays due to cable thefts soar,"The length of time passengers are being delayed on Great Britain's railways because of cable thefts has reached a five-year high, new figures suggest. The BBC's 5 Live Investigates found there were nearly 950 hours of delays in 2018 across more than 7,000 journeys in England, Wales and Scotland. British Transport Police figures also show an 85% increase in live cable thefts last year. Network Rail says thefts cost the taxpayer millions of pounds each year. The figures do not include delays in Northern Ireland. Network Rail, which owns and maintains most of Great Britain's railways, said delays doubled from 2016-17, when 400 hours were recorded across 3,000 train journeys. More than three-quarters of the trains affected were in or around London. Police say an increase in global copper prices is leading to more organised gangs and opportunists ripping up or cutting down cables. Thieves steal cables for the copper inside them, and then sell the metal on as scrap. Supt Mark Cleland, from British Transport Police, said: ""All metal theft is primarily driven by the price of metal so, as metal rises in value, we see a trend that crime rises with it. At the moment we're in this upward trend of the price of metal rising."" Experts say that even if the cable is security-marked, it can be made untraceable by stripping the rubber and granulating the metal at scrapyards. James Nattrass, director of incident management and operational security at Network Rail, said cable theft was ""not a victimless crime"". ""It costs the taxpayer millions of pounds a year, and the total cost to the economy is even higher when you consider the impact of delays to freight, and to passengers who want to get work. ""Not only is it disruptive for our passengers, it is also extremely dangerous for the perpetrators. Thousands of volts of electricity run through cables and interfering with them can be fatal."" The Scrap Metal Dealers Act was introduced in 2013 to try to clamp down on metal thefts - with cash sales banned and all dealers needing a licence. But a Freedom of Information request showed that last year in England, a third of mobile scrap collectors had not renewed their licences. The Local Government Association defended the act, saying: ""A drop in the current levels of renewals could be for a number of reasons, not least one being that the act has subsequently discouraged those businesses who were not operating within the law.""

"The footballer, the prince, and the proposition","Eamonn O'Keefe, Prince Abdullah bin Nasser and one of the prince's wives at the Barracuda restaurant in London in 1976 The Grand Hotel, Cannes, 1976. On a hot summer night, a rich man and a poor man stand in a lift. The rich man is Prince Abdullah bin Nasser: grandson of the founder of Saudi Arabia; son of the ex-governor of Riyadh; rich beyond imagination. The poor man is Eamonn O'Keefe: footballer from Manchester; son of a print worker; owner of a terraced house in Oldham. The men are coming back from the casino. Abdullah has lost - he always lost - but no matter. If you're a Saudi prince, a few thousand dollars is lunch money. Eamonn doesn't gamble, but he has won. Two years earlier he was a reserve at Plymouth Argyle in the third tier of English football, trying to find coins for the electricity meter. Now, he's flying with the jet set: first class planes, five-star hotels, on a grand tour of Europe with one of the world's richest families. And then, in the lift, Abdullah turns to Eamonn. ""I've been meaning to tell you something,"" says Abdullah. He puts his hand on Eamonn's shoulder. ""I am finding that I love you."" Eamonn can smell the prince's breath; cigarettes and Johnnie Walker whisky. Nervously, he replies. ""You mean - like a brother?"" ""No,"" says Abdullah. ""Not like a brother."" And that, on a hot summer night in Cannes, is where the trouble began. Eamonn (front left) pictured with the Manchester Boys team. ""I broke my leg 15 minutes after this was taken"" Eamonn, who's now 65, grew up in post-war Britain, in a three-bedroom, semi-detached council house in Blackley, north Manchester. He had three brothers, two sisters, and a dog. Gran lived with them too. Where did they all sleep? ""I'm still baffled,"" he says in a Manchester hotel, smiling at the memory. His dad, an Irishman, ran the St Clare Catholic men's football team. His mum washed and ironed the kit; Eamonn fetched the balls, then waxed them with dubbin before the next match. Eamonn's house was 30 yards from the park and he would play there, on the wet Manchester grass, until it got dark. He was a fine footballer: picked for Manchester Schools and Manchester United's youth team until, in a match against Altrincham, he broke his leg. His dream - playing under the lights at Old Trafford - was over. Instead, he left school and worked as an errand runner for the Manchester Evening News. When his leg was better, he signed for Stalybridge Celtic, a semi-professional club nearby. His first manager was George Smith, an ex-player who was building an international coaching career. George - who had already worked in Iceland - left Stalybridge to manage Al-Hilal, one of the biggest clubs in Saudi Arabia. Soon afterwards, Eamonn left too, moving 300 miles south to sign as a professional for Plymouth. But he was miserable there - his wages barely covered the rent - and he lasted less than a season. Then, after coming home, he received a letter. The postmark was in Arabic. Eamonn, who still lives in north-west England, revisiting one of his former streets in Manchester The letter was from George Smith. He wanted Eamonn to fly to Saudi for a month's trial. If he impressed - and could handle the heat - he would become Al-Hilal's first European signing. ""It was November, I think it was snowing [in Manchester],"" says Eamonn. ""I thought - 'That's not a bad shout.'"" But it wasn't just the weather that appealed. Eamonn was married with two children: a spell in Saudi, he thought, would mean repaying the mortgage on his house sooner than he thought. He went to London and flew to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, via Cairo and Jeddah. On arrival in Jeddah, he knew he was in a different world. A Saudi official took his Sunday Express, got a pair of scissors, and cut out the pictures of women, leaving only their heads. It could have been worse, says Eamonn: the man next to him had the News of the World. The culture shocks kept coming. In Riyadh, George waited for Eamonn on the runway, sitting on the bonnet of a huge Buick. At home, Eamonn drove a Morris Mini estate. In Manchester, fish and chips were a treat. At the five-star hotel, Eamonn signed for free food and drink. Eamonn - a 22-year-old from a council house - was in an alternative universe. It wasn't just the heat, or the palm trees or the shimmering desert that stretched to the horizon. It was the wealth. The formation of Opec in 1960, and the oil crisis of 1973, meant the Saudi economy was booming. Between 1970 and 1980, the country's economy rocketed by more than 3,000%. It was wallowing in oil, and serious men had serious money. Eamonn was about to meet one of them. Eamonn O'Keefe (second right) playing for Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s Eamonn first saw Prince Abdullah bin Nasser at Al-Hilal's training ground in Riyadh. Still on trial, he was playing a practice game when Abdullah, the club president, pulled up in a blue Buick. From the pitch, Eamonn saw a pair of eyes peering through the rolled-down window. ""George said: 'See the car over there? That's my laddo - the president. He says yes or no [to the contract]. So sharpen up!'"" Straight away, the ball came in from the right wing. Eamonn's eyes lit up. He leapt, blond locks bouncing in the desert air, and headed the ball towards goal. ""It bulleted into the top corner,"" he says, more than 40 years later. ""And I mean bulleted."" Five minutes later, the ball came in from the left wing. Again, he leapt. Again, the ball hit the top corner. As they waited to re-start the game, George whispered in Eamonn's ear. ""Whatever you were thinking,"" he said, referring to Eamonn's wage demands, ""add another nought on."" After the match, Eamonn, still in his sweat-drenched kit, went to meet the prince. Abdullah asked if the hotel was OK; Eamonn said it was. Abdullah asked if George was happy; George said he was. ""Then go to the hotel and write down your needs,"" said the prince. Eamonn and George made a list: money, car, apartment, flights to England and private schooling for Eamonn's two children when they were old enough. At the next training session, the blue Buick pulled up. George gave Abdullah the list. ""Not a problem,"" the prince said. At home, Eamonn earned Â£40 a week, plus Â£15 playing football. His new weekly wage was around Â£140 - equal to Â£1,100 today, according to Bank of England inflation data. There were no taxes, no bills and no worries. With his contract agreed, Eamonn flew back to Manchester, packed his bags and returned to Riyadh with his family. At first they lived in a hotel, and - as before - paid for nothing. ""The bill was staggering, but it was never questioned,"" says Eamonn. His wife took a well-paid job at the First National City Bank, and, as Al-Hilal trained only twice a week, Eamonn passed his time by the pool, looking after the children, talking football with George. They were blissful days in the desert. ""I can still see the kids with the floats on,"" he says. From the start, Abdullah liked Eamonn. He bought him a car - ""a silver Pontiac Ventura, bonnet like a runway"" - and often invited him over for tea. They watched football on a big screen (a luxury in 1976) or talked to Abdullah's brothers. It was an unlikely set-up - a blond-haired boy from England welcomed into the Saudi royal court - but Eamonn enjoyed it. He was young and confident, and found the Saudis surprisingly down-to-earth and kind. In some ways, it was like Manchester - except here, his friends ran the country. On the pitch, things also went well. Eamonn liked his team-mates, and the team reached the semi-final of the King's Cup (before losing on penalties to rivals Al-Nassr). Saudi Arabia wasn't perfect - Eamonn once drove into a square where a public flogging was taking place, with his children in the back seat - but life was good. When the season ended, the O'Keefes returned to England for a holiday. Before they left, Abdullah asked for Eamonn's home phone number. ""I'm also planning a trip to England,"" said the prince. ""We should meet up."" Eamonn was the first European professional to play in the Saudi league After three weeks in England, Abdullah phoned Eamonn's mother's house, where the O'Keefes were staying. Eamonn was out so his mother took the call. ""What's-he-called has been on the phone,"" she told her son. ""That prince fella."" Eamonn called Abdullah back - reverse charges - at the Carlton Tower, a hotel near Harrods in London. Two days later he was on a train to Euston. A chauffeur met him at the station. In the capital, Eamonn was again riding on a merry-go-round of Saudi money. He watched as the prince bought six Cecil Gee suits and wondered, in the Grosvenor Hotel, why a man with white gloves stood near the urinals. (""I honestly thought - he doesn't hold it for you, does he?""). When one of Abdullah's assistants needed new shoes, Eamonn was given Â£200 and sent to buy a pair. He gave back Â£150 and went to Marks & Spencer. ""Different world,"" says Eamonn. Soon afterwards, the same assistant returned to Riyadh, so Abdullah asked Eamonn if he wanted to take his place on the tour. It was Paris next, followed by Cannes, Rome, Cairo and back to Saudi. Abdullah's wife wanted to buy furniture; the prince planned to roll the dice at Europe's casinos. His wife and children were going to Wales with his mother-in-law, so Eamonn agreed. A week later, he was in a limousine to Heathrow, ready for his grand tour with ""Prince What's-He-Called"". By now, the Saudi prince and the boy from Blackley were friends. Eamonn and Abdullah: the Unlikely Lads. ""We got on great, we were laughing all the time,"" says Eamonn. ""I think he was bored with all these [other] fellas sucking up to him."" At Charles de Gaulle airport, the Saudi ambassador met the prince and his party. ""Flags on the car, all that,"" says Eamonn. While Abdullah held meetings, he gave Eamonn a case to look after. Eamonn got coffee and a bar of chocolate, waited in the VIP area, and was eventually taken to Paris alone, case in tow. An hour later, the phone rang in his hotel room. It was Abdullah, asking for the case, so Eamonn went downstairs to the prince's suite. The prince flipped the locks and showed Eamonn what he'd been carrying: thousands upon thousands of French francs. ""A bit like you see on telly, when there's no room for anything else,"" says Eamonn. ""I left it on the seat when I got coffee at the airport - can you imagine if I'd lost it?"" That night, Eamonn dined in a glass-bottomed boat on the Seine, before admiring the city from his hotel balcony. He fell asleep a happy man. But his sweet dreams didn't last. Two days later, they flew to Cannes, where they went to the casino and rode in the same lift. Eamonn with his car in the Saudi desert After Abdullah made his move, the lift suddenly felt smaller, says Eamonn. The prince had made his feelings clear, so Eamonn did too. He wasn't gay. He wasn't interested in a relationship. He wanted to be a footballer, and nothing else. ""It was probably 15 seconds [until the lift doors opened],"" says Eamonn. ""But it felt like a month. There was this horrible coldness."" At that moment, the grand tour was over. The atmosphere had changed, and so had the itinerary. Instead of three nights in Rome, they had one; instead of stopping in Cairo, they went straight to Riyadh. ""It was like ice,"" remembers Eamonn. Eamonn was embarrassed, but he wasn't worried. In the lift, Abdullah told him their relationship would return to ""president and player"", and Eamonn believed him. ""I was not thinking for a minute I was in any danger,"" he says. ""I thought - I've got my contract, we'll get back to normal."" After getting back to Riyadh, that changed. Homosexuality was - and still is - illegal in Saudi Arabia, and the royal family were - and still are - omnipotent. Eamonn wasn't going to reveal Abdullah's secret - but what if Abdullah wanted to apply some pressure? Eamonn felt worried. Claustrophobic. Paranoid, perhaps. He went to tell George what had happened, to seek reassurance. He didn't get it. ""They're not going to leave it at that, you idiot,"" said George. George Smith is 84 now; still watching football and still bursting with stories from a long coaching career. Does he remember Eamonn? ""Oh yes,"" he says on the phone from Rochdale. ""I made him a pro."" George's tales bounce from Saudi to Iceland, via Oman and Bahrain. But Eamonn sticks out. He liked him, but even before their grand tour he was worried. Eamonn spent too much time with Abdullah, he thought - and Abdullah spent too much money on Eamonn. ""I thought they were too close, and the president [Abdullah] knew it,"" he says. ""He knew I was worried about it."" When George heard about Cannes, he told Eamonn to leave Saudi for his own safety. ""He was in danger,"" he says. ""Anything could have happened."" Such as? ""God knows. An accident of some sort. He was interfering with royalty [Abdullah] - you can't do it."" Eamonn went cold. He knew a secret about one of the most powerful men in the country, and that - he thought - put him in danger. He spent the night on George's sofa, but passed most of it staring at the ceiling. He was 22 years old, far from home, and scared. His family were in England, and he couldn't let them return to Riyadh. But there was a problem. To leave the country, his boss had to sign his exit visa - and his boss was Prince Abdullah. To Eamonn, Saudi always felt gilded. Now, it felt like a gilded cage. Jimmy Hill, pictured on the Parkinson show in 1976, was involved in releasing Eamonn from his Saudi contract The next morning, Eamonn decided to lie. He would tell Abdullah that his father was ill, and he needed to see him in England. He went to Abdullah's mansion, told his story and waited for a reaction. The prince listened but made no decision. Instead, he made him sweat. They would discuss it tomorrow, Abdullah said. It was another long night. The five-star hotel in Paris, when he'd slept without a care in the world, seemed a long time ago. The next day, Eamonn went to the football club to meet Abdullah. The prince closed the door and told his staff not to disturb them. Eamonn remembers the prince sitting at the head of a large table. ""Is this because of France?"" the prince asked. ""I don't believe you will return."" As Eamonn tried to persuade Abdullah, the prince reached for a pen and paper. Slowly, Eamonn says, he started writing in Arabic. It was a deal. Eamonn could go home, but only for a week. All he had to do was sign. Eamonn couldn't read Arabic. For all he knew, he was signing his life away. So he couldn't sign it. But he couldn't rip it up, either. If he did, the prince would never let him go. He thought, quickly, and decided on what he now calls ""the Bluff of the Year"". ""You want me to sign this?"" asked Eamonn. ""I have to trust this contract in Arabic - but you don't trust me back? OK, not a problem."" Eamonn took the pen and went to sign. At the last second, Eamonn says, Abdullah snatched the paper, ripped it up, and threw it in the bin. ""I will arrange a flight for you,"" he said, reluctantly. The next day, Eamonn went to the airport. He took only a week's clothes, so Abdullah didn't think he was leaving for good. Was he still scared? ""Absolutely,"" says Eamonn. ""Because if he [Abdullah] says you're not getting on the plane, you're not getting on it. Even when the plane went up, I was worried."" After he landed in London, he punched the seat in front with joy. But his problems weren't over. To resume his career in England, he needed to register with the Football Association. To register with the Football Association, he needed clearance from Saudi Arabia. After speaking to the FA, Eamonn received a fax from Riyadh. It demanded: -9,000 Saudi riyals for breaking the contract (around Â£1,200 then, equal to Â£8,000 today) -1,500 riyals for repairing the air conditioning at his apartment -Â£300 (in sterling) to repay a loan from Abdullah -Minus one month's salary still owed to Eamonn Eamonn could accept points one and four. The others, he felt, were revenge by Abdullah. The air conditioning wasn't broken, he says, and he never borrowed a penny from the prince. Eamonn spoke to the FA and, on 22 November 1976, received a telegram from London. ""Please ring - reverse charges - urgent,"" it said. It was signed by the new head of Saudi football, Jimmy Hill. Jimmy Hill's telegram to Eamonn In 1976, Jimmy Hill was one of the most famous men in English football. In 1961, as head of the players' union, he had abolished the maximum wage; by the 1970s, he was presenter of the BBC's primetime football show, Match of the Day. The contract in Saudi was worth Â£25m. How much went to him and his son Duncan (also employed in Saudi) is unknown, but it was too much to be blown by a boy from Blackley. As requested, Eamonn phoned Hill. Eamonn's dad - a trade unionist - said he was happy to tell Fifa, and the world, what happened in Cannes. Two weeks later, a meeting was arranged in Altrincham between a mutual friend of George and Eamonn's, a representative from Al-Hilal, and Eamonn. ""What do you think would have happened if you stayed?"" asked the man from Al-Hilal, sarcastically. ""When it's your family, you can't gamble,"" Eamonn replied, deadly serious. After a heated discussion, the men shook hands. A week later, the Saudis sent Eamonn's release, and he was free to play in England. The Saudi adventure was over. Finally, he was off the merry-go-round. Eamonn rebuilt his career to the extent that he was picked to play for the Republic of Ireland against England at Wembley (number nine in the Irish side) When he got back to England, Eamonn was broke. He couldn't get his wages - they were in a Saudi account - so he had to sell his house in Oldham. He returned to work at the Manchester Evening News, and, eventually, started playing for semi-professional side Mossley. After the sunshine and swimming pools of Saudi, the wind and rain of the Northern Premier League seemed like a step down. But Eamonn loved it. In 1979, Mossley won the league and cup double and Eamonn moved to Everton, in the top tier of English football, for Â£25,000. He played 40 times in the First Division before moving to Wigan Athletic. He also played five times for the Irish Republic - including, in 1985, against England at Wembley. The last time he had been there, in 1968, he was a wide-eyed fan watching Manchester United beat Benfica in the European Cup final. Now, people were paying to watch him. It is one of many reasons why he isn't bitter about Saudi, Abdullah or that hot summer night in Cannes. ""If it [the incident in the lift] hadn't happened, I would have stayed in Saudi,"" he says. ""I might never have played for Everton, might never have played for Ireland."" Eamonn is now retired near Manchester, but still works part-time for Everton FC Abdullah remained as president of Al-Hilal until 1981, and kept spending. After Eamonn, his next signing was Rivellino, the Brazilian World Cup winner. The club won the new Jimmy Hill-organised league in 1977 and 1979, and are now one of the biggest clubs in Asia. Apart from his love of football, not much is known about the prince. The Saudi government's Center for International Communication and Al-Hilal Football Club both declined to comment on Eamonn's story, and there has been little written about the prince. He was, after all, one of hundreds. Abdullah's grandfather - Ibn Saud, the founder of the country - had 45 sons. Of those, 36 had children of their own, one of whom was Abdullah. As one Saudi expert told the BBC: ""These guys lead very sheltered lives, in a society which has the opposite of an enquiring press."" The Saudi government wouldn't say whether Abdullah was alive, but the Al Hilal website suggests he is dead. A Middle East journalist told the BBC he passed away in 2007, another thought it might be 2006. According to Arabic Wikipedia - the entry runs to less than 400 words - Abdullah had three wives and seven children. The last time Eamonn saw him was the ""Bluff of the Year"" in Riyadh. Saudi police make 'gay wedding' arrests 'I needed consent to leave the house' Where is gay sex still against the law? After managing Cork City in Ireland, Eamonn worked for the council in Cheshire. He moved to Portugal but is now retired near Manchester. He was treated for cancer in 2017 with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and is making a steady recovery. ""Touching wood and sending up a quick prayer, it's all looking good now,"" he says. He still works on match days in the hospitality suites at Everton, sharing stories from his career. For years, he didn't talk about Saudi: he didn't want to relive the trauma, or open himself to homophobic taunts. After coming home, he even turned down a cheque from a tabloid reporter. But now, more than 40 years on, he is happy to share all. More than anything, he wants his Saudi team-mates to know why he left. ""I loved my time in Saudi - how can you not love living like that?"" he says. ""I loved my team-mates, the facilities were great, the whole set-up was fantastic. We were happy there."" Eight years ago Eamonn wrote an autobiography. Its title perfectly captures his life, from the green grass of St Clare's Catholic club to his red-hot Saudi adventure. I Only Wanted To Play Football.

UK teachers suffer 'appalling treatment',"UK teachers were awarded millions of pounds in compensation from schools last year after suffering ""appalling treatment"", a union has claimed. The NASUWT teachers' union said its members had received Â£14.9m over the past 12 months as a result of attacks, injuries and discrimination at work. One teacher received Â£10,000 after being racially abused more than a dozen times in 18 months, the NASUWT said. The Department for Education said schools had a ""duty"" to protect staff. The union also reported that a 54-year-old disabled member of teaching staff received Â£45,000 after being dismissed for querying the failure to put in place reasonable adjustments to enable him to do his job. He had multiple disabilities, including a form of arthritis, hypertension, gout and diabetes, which the employer was aware of. Teachers sent home over unruly pupils row 'We are kicked, spat on, hit and sworn at' Secondary school staff suffer work attacks Other cases included members experiencing assaults from pupils, discriminatory practices related to pregnancy-related and flexible-working requests, race discrimination and discrimination based on age, sexual orientation and religion or belief. A DfE spokeswoman said: ""No teacher should face discrimination or ill-treatment in the workplace. ""The majority of schools provide safe and reasonable working environments for teaching staff, and it's important that they remain as such."" Despite winning financial compensation for many of its members, the NASUWT said it believed the recorded cases of abuse were ""only the tip of the iceberg"". It added: ""In most cases the money awarded does not compensate for the fact that a teacher's physical or mental health may have been affected and they can no longer work in their chosen profession.""

UK teachers suffer 'appalling treatment'Almost Â£15m in compensation has been awarded to members of one teachers' union over the past year.Family & Education,"UK teachers were awarded millions of pounds in compensation from schools last year after suffering ""appalling treatment"", a union has claimed. The NASUWT teachers' union said its members had received Â£14.9m over the past 12 months as a result of attacks, injuries and discrimination at work. One teacher received Â£10,000 after being racially abused more than a dozen times in 18 months, the NASUWT said. The Department for Education said schools had a ""duty"" to protect staff. The union also reported that a 54-year-old disabled member of teaching staff received Â£45,000 after being dismissed for querying the failure to put in place reasonable adjustments to enable him to do his job. He had multiple disabilities, including a form of arthritis, hypertension, gout and diabetes, which the employer was aware of. Teachers sent home over unruly pupils row 'We are kicked, spat on, hit and sworn at' Secondary school staff suffer work attacks Other cases included members experiencing assaults from pupils, discriminatory practices related to pregnancy-related and flexible-working requests, race discrimination and discrimination based on age, sexual orientation and religion or belief. A DfE spokeswoman said: ""No teacher should face discrimination or ill-treatment in the workplace. ""The majority of schools provide safe and reasonable working environments for teaching staff, and it's important that they remain as such."" Despite winning financial compensation for many of its members, the NASUWT said it believed the recorded cases of abuse were ""only the tip of the iceberg"". It added: ""In most cases the money awarded does not compensate for the fact that a teacher's physical or mental health may have been affected and they can no longer work in their chosen profession.""

Sudan leader vows to 'uproot regime',"Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan adopted a more conciliatory tone on TV The leader of Sudan's interim military council has vowed to ""uproot the regime"" two days after a military coup. Speaking on TV, Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan announced the restructuring of state institutions, the end of a night curfew and the release of political prisoners. Protests continue despite the ousting of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir. Demonstrators have demanded an immediate move to civilian rule and vow to stay in the streets. Gen Burhan, who replaced the coup leader after he resigned on Friday, also dissolved all provincial governments and pledged respect for human rights. The army would maintain ""peace, order and security"" across Sudan during an already announced transition period that would last at most two years until elections could be and civilian rule introduced, he added. Using a more conciliatory tone, Gen Burhan also called on the opposition to ""help us restore normal life"", promised to try those who killed demonstrators and vowed a war on corruption. Sudan unrest: The key questions Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power The speech followed the resignation of feared security chief Gen Salah Gosh hours after the coup leader himself, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, stepped aside. No official reason has been given for either departure. Later on Saturday the army named Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as the deputy head of the Transitional Military Council. Known by the nickname ""Hemeti"", the general commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF), which grew out of the government-backed Janjaweed militia. The Janjaweed are accused of carrying out atrocities in the western region of Darfur in the early 2000s. Opposition groups have met the military to discuss ""transitional arrangements"". Protester spokesman Mohammad Youssef al-Mustafa told the BBC they insisted on the immediate creation of a civilian government, but said military figures would be allowed a role in it. And according to the privately-owned Baj News website the leader of the opposition Sudanese Congress Party, Omar el-Digeir, said representatives had demanded a civilian government with ""full executive powers"" and a role for civilians during the transition. He also said they were waiting for the army to release jailed demonstrators, as promised. Sudanese people have been demonstrating for weeks The Sudan Professionals Association (SPA), which has been spearheading the demonstrations, said the council's response ""did not achieve any of the demands of the people"" and urged protests to continue. Among its demands are the restructuring of state security, the arrest of ""corrupt leaders"" and the dissolution of militias that operated under former President Bashir. When Mr Bashir was removed, he was replaced by a military council led by Mr Ibn Auf. But demonstrators camping out outside army headquarters in the capital Khartoum refused to disperse, rejecting Mr Ibn Auf as an ally of Mr Bashir. Mr Ibn Auf was head of military intelligence during the Darfur conflict andthe US imposed sanctions on him in 2007,external. On Friday the new leader announced he was resigning and being replaced by Gen Burhan, who is seen as a less controversial figure. The new military leader, Lt-Gen Burhan, could be seen talking to demonstrators on Friday Protestors have called for the abolition of ""arbitrary decisions by leaders that do not represent the people"" and the detention of ""all symbols of the former regime who were involved in crimes against the people"". ""Until these demands are fully met, we must continue with our sit-in at the General Command of the Armed Forces,"" the SPA said. On Saturday, Sudanese TV reported the resignation of Gen Gosh, head of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) which has powerful forces within the capital. Gen Salah Gosh seen here in 2010 The general has been a key ally of Mr Bashir since the early 1990s and is among 17 Sudanese officials indicted for genocide, human right abuses and war crimes in the Darfur region by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2009. The NISS has extensive powers and influence, supervising the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. By Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC reporter The momentum is clearly with the protesters. They have forced out two powerful generals in just a matter of days. NISS, which Gen Gosh headed, exemplified the ruthlessness of security forces under Mr Bashir's regime. There is however anger that Gen Gosh is not being arrested for alleged human rights abuses. The SPA has called for the disbandment of NISS. And interestingly soon after Gen Gosh's resignation was announced, the SPA released the names of its negotiating team. In the past they said they would not publish any names for fear they would be targeted. The fact that they can do so now suggests there could be room for talks with the military council. But in his first address Gen Burhan insisted the council would govern for two years. This idea has been rejected by opposition groups who demand a civilian transitional government. They have asked for demonstrations to continue until this happens. He has also been indicted by the ICC on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. But the military council has said it will not extradite Mr Bashir, who denies the charges, although he may be put on trial in Sudan. What next for Sudan's 'master manipulator'? Mr Bashir's National Congress Party on Saturday called his overthrow unconstitutional, and demanded that the military council release the party's imprisoned members.

'World's largest plane' takes flight,"This video can not be played If successful the jet would be a cheaper way to launch objects into space than using rockets The world's largest aeroplane by wingspan has taken flight for the first time. Built by Stratolaunch, the company set up by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 2011, the aircraft is designed to act as a flying launch pad for satellites. The idea is to fly the plane to 10 km (6.2 miles) high before releasing satellites into orbit. Its 385 ft (117 m) wingspan is longer than an American football field. Microsoft founder announces space venture The billionaires fuelling a space race If successful, such a project would be a cheaper way to launch objects into space than rockets fired from the ground. The twin-fuselage six-engine jet flew up to 15,000 ft (4,572m) and reached speeds of about 170 miles per hour (274 km/h) on its maiden flight. The pilot Evan Thomas told reporters the experience was ""fantastic"" and that ""for the most part, the airplane flew as predicted"". According to their website,Stratolaunch aims to ""make access to orbit as routine as catching a commercial airline flight is today"",external. British billionaire Richard Branson's companyVirgin Galactic has also developed aircraft that launch rockets into orbitfrom great height.

Tulip firm stockpiles bulbs over Brexit,"The west Norfolk fields are the largest outdoor commercial tulip crop in the UK The UK's biggest outdoor commercial tulip grower has said it has been stockpiling bulbs as uncertainty over Brexit continues. Belmont Nurseries, near King's Lynn, said the future of the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU) was a cause of major concern. ""We're very much UK based, but we do also sell to Europe,"" nursery director Mark Eves said. There about about 17 varieties of tulips in the field of nearly 30 million stems ""In the four days before Motherâs Day we supplied nearly four million stems to UK supermarkets,"" Mark Eves said The nursery said it brought forward a lot of its Dutch imports to give itself a ""buffer"" while it awaits further movement in Brexit talks. Mr Eves said the decision was taken because of fears of any delays at British ports that could be caused by Brexit. How new Brexit delay has hit four firms ""If the lorry is held up at port for any length of time the bulbs simply won't get the fresh air they need blown across them during transport which means they won't flower - basically, they'd be ruined."" The EU has granted theUK a six-month extension, eliminating the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit. The heads are removed from the tulips so the flowering energy returns to the bulb to make it stronger Mr Eves said: ""We haven't got a problem with Brexit, we've got more problem with MPs not knowing how much sugars they want in their tea - let alone what they are doing to sort out trade deals. ""I appreciate the complexities, but the fact they can't agree with themselves - it's disappointing, to say the least."" The Belmont Nursery fields are the largest outdoor crop grown in the UK It takes about two year for this crop to go from bulb production to stems suitable for supermarket sales In 25 years, Belmont has reached the point where it is producing about 75 million bulbs a year. None of the millions of tulips in the field, which is not open to the public, make it to a vase - when the time is rightthe flowers are beheaded by giant mower-like machineto remove the petals. A rogue colour in a row looks beautiful, but it is not what the tulip producers want ""People still wonder why we take the heads off, saying it seems such a waste, but if we don't take the head off we don't get the higher quality bulb and this is all about getting the best quality bulb we can,"" Mr Eves said. ""It's a challenge every year with the weather- so to see them growing well is an absolute pleasure."" The rogue colours in the row are removed to ensure a consistent bulb stock goes back to the glasshouses . The blossom worth billions for Japan.

Neolithic dog's head recreated from skull,"The model was created by a forensic artist who normally recreates human heads The head of a Neolithic dog has been recreated using a skull discovered in a cairn tomb in Orkney. A forensic artist used 3D images of the 4,000-year-old animal to build the model - complete with realistic muscle, skin and hair. The animal is believed to have been the size of a large collie with features similar to a European grey wolf. The skull was one of 24 discovered when the chamber at Cuween Hill was excavated in 1901. It is believed the dogs were placed there more than 500 years after the passage tomb was built. The skull was one of 24 discovered in a chamber tomb at Cuween Hill The model was built by forensic artist Amy Thornton using 3D images produced by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) and  Edinburgh University's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. Ms Thornton used identical techniques to those she would normally use to recreate a human head. She said: ""The reconstruction was originally created in clay using traditional methods, with a 3D print of the Cuween Hill skull as the base to build the anatomy on to. ""The completed sculpture was then cast in silicone and finished with the fur coat resembling a European grey wolf, as advised by experts. ""The resulting model gives us a fascinating glimpse at this ancient animal."" Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said the model would help ""to better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals"". He said: ""Just as they are treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep. ""But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special significance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about 4,500 years ago. Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the 'dog people'. ""While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.""

British Steel seeks Â£100m government loan,"British Steel's Scunthorpe plant British Steel is seeking a Â£100m loan from the government in order to meet EU emission rules. Previously, the company could have used EU-issued carbon credits to settle its 2018 pollution bill. However, the steel maker has been affected by a European Union decision to suspend UK firms' access to free carbon permitsuntil a Brexit withdrawal deal is ratified. Sources say there is no danger to British Steel sites or jobs. The EU'semissions trading system,external's rules allow industrial polluters to use carbon credits to pay for the previous year's emissions, or trade them to raise money. Each free permit gives a firm the right to emit a tonne (1,000kg) of carbon dioxide (CO2), and they can be traded for money. In a statement the company said: ""We are discussing the impact of Brexit on our business with ministers and officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and they have been extremely responsive and supportive to date."" The company is in talks with Department for Business about financial help. The Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy told the BBC: ""As the business department, we are in regular conversation with a wide range of sectors and companies."" British Steel has until 30 April to comply with EU emission rules. What happens after Brexit?

Welsh schools to get free sanitary products,"Free sanitary products are being made available in Welsh schools More than 141,000 girls in all Welsh primary and secondary schools will be given access to free sanitary products under Welsh Government plans. Ministers have set up a Â£2.3m grant for councils to fund the scheme. The move aims to tackle period poverty - where women and girls find it too expensive to buy sanitary items. It follows similar moves to roll outfree products at secondary schools in England, andto offer them to patients in the Welsh NHS. Campaigners say young women and girls find themselves missing school because they cannot afford the items. The price of periods Is there period poverty in the UK? First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the cash, to be made available to councils immediately,at Welsh Labour conference on Saturday. ""It's unthinkable that young women could be forced to miss days of their education simply because they can't access or afford period products,"" said education minister Kirsty Williams. ""We're committed to tackling this inequality in Wales and this funding will help make period products available to learners in all schools, free of charge and in the most dignified way possible."" The move is aimed at tackling ""period poverty"" - where women and girls cannot afford sanitary products The move was welcomed by Hilary Beach, who has campaigned on the issue in Chepstow where she is a town councillor. She founded an effort to offer ""dignity bags"",encouraging members of the public to donate sanitary productsto be redistributed to women-in-need. ""There's a certain amount of period poverty in Monmouthshire,"" the town councillor said. She said education of some young women suffers ""because they are not able to fully participate when they have got their periods,"" she said. The Welsh Government announcement was ""tremendous news"", she added. Last year Â£700,000 was provided to boost school toilet facilities, and Â£440,000 to allow councils to provide products through schools, food banks and shelters to those who otherwise may struggle to afford them.

"Give Sweden priority on Assange, Javid urgedMore than 70 MPs and peers write to the home secretary backing Julian Assange's extradition to Sweden.UK","More than 70 MPs and peers have signed a letter urging the home secretary to ensure Julian Assange faces authorities in Sweden if they want his extradition. The Wikileaks founder, who is now in UK custody, was arrested on Thursday after years in Ecuador's London embassy. Sweden is considering whether to reopen an investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against him. And the US is seeking his extradition in relation to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, in 2010. The whistle-blowing website Wikileaks has published thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and war. Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of sexual assault, which he has denied. At the time, the Australian-born 47-year-old said he had had entirely consensual sex with two women while on a trip to Stockholm, and that the Swedish claims against him were part of a smear campaign. Swedish prosecutors dropped a rape investigation into Assange in 2017 because they were unable to formally notify him of allegations while he stayed in the embassy. Two other charges of molestation and unlawful coercion had to be dropped in 2015 because time had run out. But Swedishprosecutors say they are now re-examining Assange's caseat the request of the lawyer acting for the alleged rape victim. In their letter to Sajid Javid, 70 parliamentarians - chiefly Labour MPs and peers - urged him to ""stand with the victims of sexual violence"" and ensure the rape claim against the Wikileaks founder could be ""properly investigated"". ""We do not presume guilt, of course, but we believe due process should be followed and the complainant should see justice be done,"" the letter said. Labour's Stella Creasytweeted a copy of the letter sent to Mr Javid.,external The same letter was also sent to shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK government should not extradite Julian Assange to the US. But speaking on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said he had made it ""very clear all along that if there are allegations which Julian Assange needs to answer, of sexual issues, sexual attacks that may or may not have taken place in Sweden, then it's a matter for the courts to decide - but I do think he should answer those questions"". He added: ""My objection was to his extradition to the United States because I do believe that Wikileaks told us the truth about what was actually happening in Afghanistan and in Iraq."" The Labour leader said it was now for Sweden to put forward proposals on the matter. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also said on Friday she was ""disgusted"" the US allegation had been ""allowed to eclipse"" the sex offence case. Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world Why Julian Assange is a wanted man Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in embassy One of the letter's signatories, Stephen Kinnock, told the BBC the events surrounding Assange had ""become politicised"", and that the letter was intended ""to underline the point that first and foremost Mr Assange is accused of rape and sexual violence in Sweden"". ""It is vital that doesn't get airbrushed out of the conversation."" Assange was dramatically arrested by UK police on Thursday after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum. Westminster Magistrates' Court found him guilty of a charge of breaching bail later that day. He faces up to 12 months in prison for that conviction. The letter from parliamentarians says both UK and US authorities seem to have been aware in advance of Ecuador's decision to rescind Mr Assange's political asylum, but said it was a matter of ""grave concern"" that Swedish authorities did not appear to be aware of the impending arrest. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London The United States alleges that Assange conspired with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. Documents published by Wikileaks relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents. The US has already charged Assange witha single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers,externalto reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. If found guilty, Assange could be jailed for up to five years. Extradition proceedings are dealt with by the courts. According to the Home Office, the home secretary can bring a limited number of factors into consideration when deciding whether to order a person's extradition. These include whether the person might be at risk of the death penalty or whether the requesting state might try to add additional charges it has not specified. Lawyer Rebecca Niblock said that, if Sweden made an extradition request, it would be for the home secretary to decide which would take precedence, considering factors such as which was made first and the seriousness of the offence. The rape allegation in Sweden has a limitation period which expires in August 2020; inquiries into claims of molestation and unlawful coercion have already been timed out. Assange is due to face a hearing over his possible extradition to the US on 2 May. His lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" for journalists publishing information about the US. The UN has called for his right to a fair trial to be respected during any extradition process.

"'New class' of medicine reverses diseaseGene silencing drugs spared patients from the crippling pain caused by porphyria, in a clinical trial.","Sue Burrell no longer has severe bouts of pain. Doctors have used a new type of medicine called ""gene silencing"" to reverse a disease that leaves people in crippling pain. The condition, acute intermittent porphyria, also causes paralysis and is fatal in some cases. The novel approach fine-tunes the genetic instructions locked in our DNA. Doctors say they are ""genuinely surprised"" how successful it is and that the same approach could be used in previously untreatable diseases. Sue Burrell, from Norfolk, has endured pain few could imagine and needed to take strong opioid painkillers every day. At one point her porphyria was causing severe attacks every couple of weeks and needed hospital treatment. But even then morphine did not stop the pain. She told the BBC it was worse than child-birth, saying: ""It's so intense - so strong it's in your legs, in your back, and it just resonates everywhere. It's really, really unbearable."" Her sister was affected even more severely and was completely paralysed in hospital for two years. British Porphyria Association,external There are several types of porphyria, but each is caused by the body being unable to produce enough of a substance called haem. Haem is a key component of the haemoglobin in red blood cells that transport oxygen around the body. Problems in the body's haem manufacturing process can lead to a build up of toxic proteins. These cause the attacks of physical pain in Sue's form of the disease. In other porphyrias the proteins can cause skin problems. There is some speculationKing George III had porphyria. Sue no longer needs daily painkillers Sue was one of the patients on the trial and is now taking the drug. She says her life has been transformed. ""I've had pain for 10 years, I didn't expect that could go away. I'm seeing friends and they're [asking] 'you're not taking any painkillers?' and I was [saying] 'no!'."" A clinical trial on 94 people across 18 countries was presented at the International Liver Congress in Vienna. The therapy cut the number of severe attacks by 74%. And 50% of patients were completely clear of attacks that needed hospital treatment, compared to 16% given a dummy treatment. One person dropped out of the study due to side effects. Your DNA contains the instructions for building the human body The treatment uses an approach called gene silencing. A gene is part of our DNA that contains the blueprint for making proteins, such as hormones, enzymes or raw building materials. But our DNA is locked away inside a cell's nucleus and kept apart from a cell's protein-making factories. So our bodies use a short strand of genetic code, called messenger RNA, to bridge the gap and carry the instructions. This drug, called givosiran, kills the messenger in a process known as RNA interference. In acute intermittent porphyria it lowers the levels of an enzyme involved in haem production and prevents the build-up of toxic proteins. Prof David Rees, from King's College London, treated patients taking part in the trial in the UK. He told the BBC: ""This is a really important treatment - it's innovative. Porphyria is one of the first conditions it has been used in successfully. ""I'm genuinely surprised how well it works in this condition and I think it offers a lot of hope for the future."" Potentially yes, but it is still very early days. Gene silencing has been used to treat a genetic disease that causes nerve damage and the US Food and Drug Administrationsaid such medicines,external""have the potential to transform medicine"". A similar approach is also being investigated in Huntington's disease, which is caused by a toxic protein that kills brain cells. Huntingtonâs breakthrough may stop disease Researchers are also looking into it as an alternative to statins for lowering cholesterol. Barry Greene, the president of Alnylam, which developed the porphyria drug, told the BBC the latest findings were ""heralding a brand new class of medicine"". The field of gene silencing has been around for a long time. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006,externalwent to the researchers who discovered RNA interference, which occurs naturally in our cells. But the field is now getting to the point where it can be harnessed to help some patients. Dr Alena Pance, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, told the BBC News website: ""I get excited about this, because targeting the messenger RNA allows the fine-tuning of the proteins that are involved in certain diseases. ""And therefore, perhaps for the first time, [it can] offer a tool to be able to control those diseases to very accurate levels. ""There are diseases that are very difficult to find treatment for, that with this technology might be possible to tackle."" Kind of. Gene therapy permanently alters the hard copy of the genetic instructions in DNA. This can be beneficial as it means you need treatment only once, but could also be more risky. If anything goes wrong, such as accidentally editing the wrong part of the genetic code, it cannot be undone. Gene silencing leaves the original DNA alone, but targets the instructions that it sends out into the cell. The downside is you need to keep taking the treatment for the therapy to work. The two approaches are likely to have roles in different diseases. Gene therapy has greater potential in diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy where a vital protein for keeping muscles intact is missing. Gene silencing has more potential where tweaking levels of a protein will affect the course of a disease. This is the million dollar question, almost literally, as so far genetic medicines have been expensive. A recent gene therapy for a rare form of blindnesswas priced at $850,000,external(Â£650,000) for the one-off treatment. How much the monthly injections of givosiran will be is still unknown. The hope will be that as the field develops, the costs will eventually come down.

Welsh schools to get free sanitary productsGirls will be offered free sanitary products under Welsh Government plans.,"Free sanitary products are being made available in Welsh schools More than 141,000 girls in all Welsh primary and secondary schools will be given access to free sanitary products under Welsh Government plans. Ministers have set up a Â£2.3m grant for councils to fund the scheme. The move aims to tackle period poverty - where women and girls find it too expensive to buy sanitary items. It follows similar moves to roll outfree products at secondary schools in England, andto offer them to patients in the Welsh NHS. Campaigners say young women and girls find themselves missing school because they cannot afford the items. The price of periods Is there period poverty in the UK? First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the cash, to be made available to councils immediately,at Welsh Labour conference on Saturday. ""It's unthinkable that young women could be forced to miss days of their education simply because they can't access or afford period products,"" said education minister Kirsty Williams. ""We're committed to tackling this inequality in Wales and this funding will help make period products available to learners in all schools, free of charge and in the most dignified way possible."" The move is aimed at tackling ""period poverty"" - where women and girls cannot afford sanitary products The move was welcomed by Hilary Beach, who has campaigned on the issue in Chepstow where she is a town councillor. She founded an effort to offer ""dignity bags"",encouraging members of the public to donate sanitary productsto be redistributed to women-in-need. ""There's a certain amount of period poverty in Monmouthshire,"" the town councillor said. She said education of some young women suffers ""because they are not able to fully participate when they have got their periods,"" she said. The Welsh Government announcement was ""tremendous news"", she added. Last year Â£700,000 was provided to boost school toilet facilities, and Â£440,000 to allow councils to provide products through schools, food banks and shelters to those who otherwise may struggle to afford them. Rhondda Cynon Taf last year announced it would offer free sanitary productsto all school girls in the council area. Mr Drakeford told conference that colleges would also benefit - full details were not provided at the time of the announcement on Saturday.

"Labour 'trying to break Brexit deadlock'Jeremy Corbyn tells Welsh Labour the real divide is between rich and poor, and not on Brexit.Wales politics'Shock' as teen found dead in parkThe 13-year-old boy was found in Ystrad Mynach Park and has been named locally as Carson Price.Wales","Jeremy Corbyn said he did not want to pitch remain and leave supporters against each other The real divide in society is between rich and poor and not Brexit, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told party members in Llandudno. At Welsh Labour conference Mr Corbyn said his party is trying to end the Commons deadlock on the issue. He said he did not want to pit remain voters in one part of the country against leave voters in another. Meanwhile Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said Brexit should not be used to ""short-change"" Wales. He also announced Â£2.3m tooffer sanitary products to all learners in schools and colleges. The Labour frontbench in Westminsteris taking part in Brexit talks with Theresa May's government. ""Only Labour has been consistently trying to find a way through the deadlock,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""Labour doesn't believe the real divide in society is between people who voted to remain or to leave the European Union. ""We believe the real divide is between the many - who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes - and the few - who set the rules, reap the rewards and dodge their taxes."" Welsh Labour conference is taking place in Llandudno over the weekend Labour does not want to ""set the hard up family in Cardiff that voted to remain, against the hard up family in Wrexham that voted to leave,"" Mr Corbyn said. The politician said people that believe leaving or remaining in the EU are ends in themselves are ""wrong"". ""The first question is what kind of society do we want to be,"" he said. ""On that we can find so much common ground."" Mr Corbyn said the previous weeks in politics had been ""intense"" and that the Westminster political system had not come out of it well. He said it was ""scandalous"" that the offer of talks on Brexit had come so late from the PM. His party will continue to talk to the government, the leader said, to abide by the result of the referendum without ""wrecking our economy"". But if that is not possible all options should remain on the table, including a public vote, Mr Corbyn said to applause from delegates. There are calls in his party for another referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU. Mark Drakeford said Alun Cairns could be ""heading for a fight"" over Brexit In his conference speech, Mr Drakeford told delegates that Theresa May was the ""first Prime Minister in history to fall on her own sword - and then to miss it"". The Welsh Labour leader accused the Conservative party of being ""wrapped and trapped by a mythical nostalgia for a past remembered only by its ever diminishing membership"". In a speech which did not mention a further referendum, Mr Drakeford said ""the chaos of Brexit"" is seen as an opportunity for Mr Cairns ""to grow his own office"". ""So let me issue this very clear warning to the Secretary of State for Wales,"" Mr Drakeford said, referring to Alun Cairns. The AM for Cardiff West said if Mr Cairns ""continues to persist in using the so-called UK Shared Prosperity Fund"" - which is aimed to replace EU funds - ""as a means of by-passing the National Assembly, as a way of using Brexit to short-change the people of Wales, then he is heading for a fight"". Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Will Labour push for a public vote? What are the Brexit sticking points? The FM said EU funds must be replaced, and devolved powers kept: ""Not a penny less, not a power lost"". Currently EU funds in Wales are spent by a body of the Welsh Government. Last year Theresa May would not confirm if the new fundwould be devolved. Mr Drakeford said he had a ""simple message"" to voters and Labour members on the European elections, saying they should be taken as seriously as a general election. ""You will be told that these elections are meaningless; that it's not worth bothering to turn out to campaign or not even bothering to vote,"" he said. ""Please do not believe it."" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Ruth Jones was elected to represent Newport West last week Mark Drakeford's first speech as Welsh Labour leader was well received in the hall, and contained a popular policy announcement on combating period poverty. But it was curiously retrospective given that Mr Drakeford only took up the reins of government in December. Perhaps that's because it was also, undoubtedly, an appeal for party unity at a time when Brexit is turning both main UK parties upside down and inside out. There was the promise of legislation on fair working and a call to delegates to front up in the event that elections to the European Parliament take place next month. But the divisive issue of another Brexit referendum? That was the proverbial elephant in the room. New Labour MP Ruth Jones, who won the Newport West by-election last week, gave the welcome address at conference, telling delegates that in devolution's 20th year ""our task is to stand up for the people of Wales"". ""People have had enough after a decade of austerity,"" she said, calling it a ""political choice, not a financial one"". Shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees appealed ""for calmness in a country that is divided because of the inexplicable way the prime minister has handled the Brexit negotiations"". She said language in emails and on social media had become ""intimidating"", and had reported the worst cases to the police. ""It's changed from 'I'm writing to tell you I don't agree with you' to 'you're a traitor, letting down people who voted for you',"" she said.

EU takes migrants after Mediterranean stand-off,"Migrants rest on the rescue ship Alan Kurdi Four EU countries have agreed to take in 64 African migrants who were rescued after being stranded in the Mediterranean Sea for almost two weeks. The Alan Kurdi ship, operated by the German humanitarian group Sea-Eye, had been refused entry by Italy and Malta. Both countries had said it was Libya's responsibility, Sea-Eye had claimed. But on Saturday the Maltese government announced that the migrants will be redistributed among Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg. ""None of the migrants will remain in Malta. The ship Alan Kurdi will not be allowed to enter Malta,"" the government said in a statement. The agreement had come through the co-ordination of the European Commission, it added. Mediterranean migrant crossings 'deadlier than ever' Sharp fall in illegal migration to EU Two migrants had already been evacuated to Malta after falling ill on the German ship, named after the three-year old boy who drowned as his family fled the conflict in Syria. ""Once again the smallest member of the European Union was put under unnecessary pressure, being asked to resolve a case which was neither its responsibility nor its remit,"" the Maltese government said. ""A solution was found in order not to let the situation deteriorate further while making it clear Malta cannot keep shouldering this burden.""

Shots fired after car 'driven at police',"Officers opened fire in west London on Saturday morning during an incident involving a car that was colliding with vehicles. The Ukrainian embassy said its ambassador's vehicle was ""deliberately rammed"" as it sat parked outside the building in Holland Park. When officers arrived on the scene, a car was ""driven at them"", the Met said. Officers used firearms and a Taser before arresting a man in his 40s on suspicion of attempted murder. Police said the uninjured man was ""taken to a central London hospital as a precaution"". They added that the situation was neither ongoing nor being treated as terror-related. The Met said its officers arrived at the scene just before 10:00 BST after ""reports of antisocial behaviour involving a car"". Describing the events of Saturday morning, the Ukrainian embassy said that after seeing the ambassador's car being targeted, police ""blocked up"" the other vehicle. Police said the car, which was driven at officers, collided with multiple vehicles ""Nevertheless, despite the police actions, the attacker hit the ambassador's car again,"" the embassy said. It added police were ""forced to open fire on the perpetrator's vehicle"". The embassy said none of its staff had been injured and that police were now investigating ""the suspect's identity and motive for the attack"". The police arrested the man on suspicion of the attempted murder of police officers and criminal damage. A silver car was the subject of forensic investigation on Saturday afternoon Darcy Mercier, who lives across the road from the Ukrainian embassy, told the BBC the man arrived in the street around 07:00 and was ""blasting music"". Mr Mercier said he approached the man and asked him to turn the music off but was ignored. ""He sat in the middle of the street for over two hours. I was out on my terrace when he started ramming the embassy car,"" he added. This video can not be played Footage shot from a nearby building showed armed police removing the car's driver Local resident Heather Feiner, originally from the US, added: ""From the time I heard the shots until I got to the window, which took about 15 seconds, all these police cars were already there. ""I could see a police officer that fired the shots. I could see them pointing their gun at the car. ""From what I could see [the suspect] didn't appear to be struggling at that point."" The incident took place near the Ukrainian embassy in west London Emma Slatter, who witnessed the arrest, believes the man reversed into the diplomat's car while backing away from an oncoming police car. ""It seems like he was moving erratically or wanting to move away from being boxed in, maybe not realising there were police behind him as well,"" she said. She added: ""That was when he collided backwards."" The police brought in sniffer dogs to search the area Ch Supt Andy Walker, from the Met's specialist firearms command, said: ""As is standard procedure, an investigation is now ongoing into the discharge of a police firearm during this incident. ""While this takes place, I would like to pay tribute to the officers involved this morning who responded swiftly to this incident and put themselves in harm's way, as they do every day, to keep the people of London safe."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan tweeted that he was ""very concerned"" to hear about the incident and added that he'd spoken with Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Natalia Galibarenko.

"Tulip firm stockpiles bulbs over BrexitThe UK's biggest outdoor tulip grower says it needs a ""buffer"" in case of delays at British ports.","The west Norfolk fields are the largest outdoor commercial tulip crop in the UK The UK's biggest outdoor commercial tulip grower has said it has been stockpiling bulbs as uncertainty over Brexit continues. Belmont Nurseries, near King's Lynn, said the future of the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU) was a cause of major concern. ""We're very much UK based, but we do also sell to Europe,"" nursery director Mark Eves said. There about about 17 varieties of tulips in the field of nearly 30 million stems ""In the four days before Motherâs Day we supplied nearly four million stems to UK supermarkets,"" Mark Eves said The nursery said it brought forward a lot of its Dutch imports to give itself a ""buffer"" while it awaits further movement in Brexit talks. Mr Eves said the decision was taken because of fears of any delays at British ports that could be caused by Brexit. How new Brexit delay has hit four firms ""If the lorry is held up at port for any length of time the bulbs simply won't get the fresh air they need blown across them during transport which means they won't flower - basically, they'd be ruined."" The EU has granted theUK a six-month extension, eliminating the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit. The heads are removed from the tulips so the flowering energy returns to the bulb to make it stronger Mr Eves said: ""We haven't got a problem with Brexit, we've got more problem with MPs not knowing how much sugars they want in their tea - let alone what they are doing to sort out trade deals.

Shakespeare's London home 'pinpointed'A historian believes he has located where Shakespeare lived when he wrote Romeo and Juliet.London,"Parting is such sweet sorrow - Shakespeare moved out in 1598 New research has shown where William Shakespeare lived in London when he was writing Romeo and Juliet. It was previously known the playwright lived close to the site of Liverpool Street station between 1597 and 1598. But theatre historian Geoffrey Marsh has cross-referenced various official records to pinpoint the exact location. Evidence suggests the Bard lived at what is now known as 35 Great St Helen's - a site next to St Helen's Church occupied by an office block. What light through yonder window breaks? 35 Great St Helen's - close to the Gherkin, is now occupied by an office block Over a decade of research, Mr Marsh discovered that in the 1590s, Shakespeare was a tenant of the Company of Leathersellers, the guild that organised the Elizabethan leather trade. His home was most likely in a cluster of properties that overlooked the churchyard of St Helen's, yards from where the Gherkin stands today, Mr Marsh said. Shakespeare's 'original classroom' revealed Shakespeare 'may have been a humble schoolmaster' Inside Shakespeare's Stratford-upon-Avon home Shakespeare's economic legacy Geoffrey Marsh cross-referenced various records Mr Marsh, who is also the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum's department of theatre and performance, said: ""The place where Shakespeare lived in London gives us a more profound understanding of the inspirations for his work and life. ""Within a few years of migrating to London from Stratford, he was living in one of the wealthiest parishes in the city, alongside powerful public figures, wealthy international merchants, society doctors and expert musicians. ""The merchants had connections across Europe and the doctors were linked to the latest progressive thinking in universities in Italy and Germany. ""Living in what was one of the power locales of London would have also enhanced Shakespeare's status as he developed his career, sought a family coat of arms and planned to buy an impressive and expensive house in Stratford.""

North Korean state media reported the comments by Mr Kim on Saturday. He urged Mr Trump to pursue a deal that was ""mutually acceptable."" In response the president tweeted praise of Mr Kim and welcomed the idea of a new summit. The two leaders first met in Singapore last year. However, a second summit in Hanoi in February broke down.

A woman staying at the site with her two children, who asked to remain anonymous, said she woke up earlier to see police and forensic staff ""everywhere"". ""It is just really eerie,"" she said. ""Loads of people have packed up and left and I have asked to be moved to the furthest part otherwise I was going home."" The woman said the police presence was frightening for her children. ""It doesn't feel like a holiday camp - it is horrible,"" she added. In a statement earlier, holiday park manager Robert Ellwood said he had arrived on site this morning to find police already there. In a further statement, the holiday park management said the child had been attacked by a dog ""present in the same caravan"", adding the site would remain open. It added: ""Clearly our thoughts are very much with the family involved - they have our deepest sympathies."" Police said the dog had been found and was now in kennels The mayor of Looe, councillor Armand Toms, said the ""tragedy was so sad for the family"" and his thoughts were with them. He said: ""This community will do whatever it can to help. ""It always has done and will in the future and I am speaking not as the town's mayor but as someone born and bred here.""

EU takes migrants after Mediterranean stand-offThe 64 African migrants will be redistributed among four countries after being stranded at sea.Europe,"Migrants rest on the rescue ship Alan Kurdi Four EU countries have agreed to take in 64 African migrants who were rescued after being stranded in the Mediterranean Sea for almost two weeks. The Alan Kurdi ship, operated by the German humanitarian group Sea-Eye, had been refused entry by Italy and Malta. Both countries had said it was Libya's responsibility, Sea-Eye had claimed. But on Saturday the Maltese government announced that the migrants will be redistributed among Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg. ""None of the migrants will remain in Malta. The ship Alan Kurdi will not be allowed to enter Malta,"" the government said in a statement. The agreement had come through the co-ordination of the European Commission, it added. Mediterranean migrant crossings 'deadlier than ever' Sharp fall in illegal migration to EU Two migrants had already been evacuated to Malta after falling ill on the German ship, named after the three-year old boy who drowned as his family fled the conflict in Syria. ""Once again the smallest member of the European Union was put under unnecessary pressure, being asked to resolve a case which was neither its responsibility nor its remit,"" the Maltese government said. ""A solution was found in order not to let the situation deteriorate further while making it clear Malta cannot keep shouldering this burden."" Three teenage migrants were charged in Malta last monthafter ""hijacking"" an oil tanker that had rescued them.

Welsh schools to get free sanitary productsGirls will be offered free sanitary products under Welsh Government plans.Wales politics,"Free sanitary products are being made available in Welsh schools More than 141,000 girls in all Welsh primary and secondary schools will be given access to free sanitary products under Welsh Government plans. Ministers have set up a Â£2.3m grant for councils to fund the scheme. The move aims to tackle period poverty - where women and girls find it too expensive to buy sanitary items. It follows similar moves to roll outfree products at secondary schools in England, andto offer them to patients in the Welsh NHS. Campaigners say young women and girls find themselves missing school because they cannot afford the items. The price of periods Is there period poverty in the UK? First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the cash, to be made available to councils immediately,at Welsh Labour conference on Saturday. ""It's unthinkable that young women could be forced to miss days of their education simply because they can't access or afford period products,"" said education minister Kirsty Williams. ""We're committed to tackling this inequality in Wales and this funding will help make period products available to learners in all schools, free of charge and in the most dignified way possible."" The move is aimed at tackling ""period poverty"" - where women and girls cannot afford sanitary products The move was welcomed by Hilary Beach, who has campaigned on the issue in Chepstow where she is a town councillor. She founded an effort to offer ""dignity bags"",encouraging members of the public to donate sanitary productsto be redistributed to women-in-need. ""There's a certain amount of period poverty in Monmouthshire,"" the town councillor said. She said education of some young women suffers ""because they are not able to fully participate when they have got their periods,"" she said. The Welsh Government announcement was ""tremendous news"", she added. Last year Â£700,000 was provided to boost school toilet facilities, and Â£440,000 to allow councils to provide products through schools, food banks and shelters to those who otherwise may struggle to afford them. Rhondda Cynon Taf last year announced it would offer free sanitary productsto all school girls in the council area. Mr Drakeford told conference that colleges would also benefit - full details were not provided at the time of the announcement on Saturday.

Sudan coup leader steps down after a day,"Mr Ibn Auf quit a day after becoming military council chief The head of Sudan's military council has stood down a day after leading a coup that toppled long-time leader Omar al-Bashir amid a wave of protests. Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf announced his decision on state TV, naming as his successor Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan. The army has said it will stay in power for two years, followed by elections. But protest leaders say they will not leave the streets until the military hands over to a civilian government. Mr Bashir's downfall followed months of unrest that began in December over rising prices.

The new man in charge is also a top military figure, but the Associated Press news agency reports that his record is cleaner than other Sudanese generals. He is also said to have met with protesters to hear their views. Lt-Gen Burhan could be seen talking to demonstrators on Friday Mr Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the Darfur conflict. However, the military council has said it will not extradite Mr Bashir, who denies the charges, although he may be put on trial in Sudan. Despite Mr Bashir's removal on Thursday, demonstrators had refused to disperse, camping out outside army headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, in defiance of a curfew. Demonstrators stayed out on the streets of Khartoum overnight In its first response, the military council came out and denied it was seeking power, telling the protesters that they would decide the country's future, while the army maintained public order. A few hours later, Mr Ibn Auf announced he was resigning and would be replaced by Lt-Gen Burhan. Country profile ""In order to ensure the cohesion of the security system, and the armed forces in particular, from cracks and strife, and relying on God, let us begin this path of change,"" he said. Protesters celebrated his abrupt departure but the Sudan Professionals Association, which has been spearheading the demonstrations, later announced that the sit-in would continue. This video can not be played Sudanese women reject 'regime coup' ""We call on the armed forces to ensure the immediate transfer of power to a transitional civilian government,"" they said on Facebook. They further called for the abolition of ""arbitrary decisions by leaders that do not represent the people"" and the detention of ""all symbols of the former regime who were involved in crimes against the people"". ""Until these demands are fully met, we must continue with our sit-in at the General Command of the Armed Forces,"" the SPA said. Meanwhile, police said at least 16 people had been killed by stray bullets at the protests on Thursday and Friday. Awad Ibn Ouf has stepped down to be replaced by a general the senior military hope will be more acceptable to the protesters. The momentum is with civil society. The regime has floundered since this phase of protests began. The old ways of coercion haven't worked and they face a civil society that is well organised and disciplined. This is a further retreat. It is unlikely to be the last. And there's the economic crisis brought about by misrule, corruption and loss of oil revenues. Even the regime's friends in the Middle East and Asia will think twice about rescue packages if it looks like a new version of the old venality and brutality. That's an important pressure. This is an exciting moment. Just think about the role of women in all of this, of social media and civil society. It's happening in Sudan but the significance of these forces working peacefully for change is universal. Yes it's very precarious, but also full of possibility. Have you been taking part in protests?

Sudan protesters demand civilian rule now,"Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan adopted a more conciliatory tone on TV The leader of Sudan's interim military council has vowed to ""uproot the regime"" two days after a military coup. Speaking on TV, Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan announced the restructuring of state institutions, the end of a night curfew and the release of political prisoners. Protests continue despite the ousting of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir. Demonstrators have demanded an immediate move to civilian rule and vow to stay in the streets. Gen Burhan, who replaced the coup leader after he resigned on Friday, also dissolved all provincial governments and pledged respect for human rights. The army would maintain ""peace, order and security"" across Sudan during an already announced transition period that would last at most two years until elections could be and civilian rule introduced, he added. Using a more conciliatory tone, Gen Burhan also called on the opposition to ""help us restore normal life"", promised to try those who killed demonstrators and vowed a war on corruption. Sudan unrest: The key questions Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power The speech followed the resignation of feared security chief Gen Salah Gosh hours after the coup leader himself, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, stepped aside. No official reason has been given for either departure. Later on Saturday the army named Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as the deputy head of the Transitional Military Council. Known by the nickname ""Hemeti"", the general commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF), which grew out of the government-backed Janjaweed militia. The Janjaweed are accused of carrying out atrocities in the western region of Darfur in the early 2000s. Opposition groups have met the military to discuss ""transitional arrangements"". Protester spokesman Mohammad Youssef al-Mustafa told the BBC they insisted on the immediate creation of a civilian government, but said military figures would be allowed a role in it. And according to the privately-owned Baj News website the leader of the opposition Sudanese Congress Party, Omar el-Digeir, said representatives had demanded a civilian government with ""full executive powers"" and a role for civilians during the transition. He also said they were waiting for the army to release jailed demonstrators, as promised. Sudanese people have been demonstrating for weeks The Sudan Professionals Association (SPA), which has been spearheading the demonstrations, said the council's response ""did not achieve any of the demands of the people"" and urged protests to continue. Among its demands are the restructuring of state security, the arrest of ""corrupt leaders"" and the dissolution of militias that operated under former President Bashir. When Mr Bashir was removed, he was replaced by a military council led by Mr Ibn Auf. But demonstrators camping out outside army headquarters in the capital Khartoum refused to disperse, rejecting Mr Ibn Auf as an ally of Mr Bashir. Mr Ibn Auf was head of military intelligence during the Darfur conflict andthe US imposed sanctions on him in 2007,external. On Friday the new leader announced he was resigning and being replaced by Gen Burhan, who is seen as a less controversial figure. The new military leader, Lt-Gen Burhan, could be seen talking to demonstrators on Friday Protestors have called for the abolition of ""arbitrary decisions by leaders that do not represent the people"" and the detention of ""all symbols of the former regime who were involved in crimes against the people"". ""Until these demands are fully met, we must continue with our sit-in at the General Command of the Armed Forces,"" the SPA said. On Saturday, Sudanese TV reported the resignation of Gen Gosh, head of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) which has powerful forces within the capital. Gen Salah Gosh seen here in 2010 The general has been a key ally of Mr Bashir since the early 1990s and is among 17 Sudanese officials indicted for genocide, human right abuses and war crimes in the Darfur region by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2009. The NISS has extensive powers and influence, supervising the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. By Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC reporter The momentum is clearly with the protesters. They have forced out two powerful generals in just a matter of days. NISS, which Gen Gosh headed, exemplified the ruthlessness of security forces under Mr Bashir's regime. There is however anger that Gen Gosh is not being arrested for alleged human rights abuses. The SPA has called for the disbandment of NISS. And interestingly soon after Gen Gosh's resignation was announced, the SPA released the names of its negotiating team. In the past they said they would not publish any names for fear they would be targeted. The fact that they can do so now suggests there could be room for talks with the military council. But in his first address Gen Burhan insisted the council would govern for two years. This idea has been rejected by opposition groups who demand a civilian transitional government. They have asked for demonstrations to continue until this happens. He has also been indicted by the ICC on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. But the military council has said it will not extradite Mr Bashir, who denies the charges, although he may be put on trial in Sudan. What next for Sudan's 'master manipulator'? Mr Bashir's National Congress Party on Saturday called his overthrow unconstitutional, and demanded that the military council release the party's imprisoned members.

On Friday the new leader announced he was resigning and being replaced by Gen Burhan, who is seen as a less controversial figure. The new military leader, Lt-Gen Burhan, could be seen talking to demonstrators on Friday Protestors have called for the abolition of ""arbitrary decisions by leaders that do not represent the people"" and the detention of ""all symbols of the former regime who were involved in crimes against the people"". ""Until these demands are fully met, we must continue with our sit-in at the General Command of the Armed Forces,"" the SPA said. On Saturday, Sudanese TV reported the resignation of Gen Gosh, head of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) which has powerful forces within the capital. Gen Salah Gosh seen here in 2010 The general has been a key ally of Mr Bashir since the early 1990s and is among 17 Sudanese officials indicted for genocide, human right abuses and war crimes in the Darfur region by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2009. The NISS has extensive powers and influence, supervising the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. By Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC reporter The momentum is clearly with the protesters. They have forced out two powerful generals in just a matter of days. NISS, which Gen Gosh headed, exemplified the ruthlessness of security forces under Mr Bashir's regime. There is however anger that Gen Gosh is not being arrested for alleged human rights abuses. The SPA has called for the disbandment of NISS. And interestingly soon after Gen Gosh's resignation was announced, the SPA released the names of its negotiating team. In the past they said they would not publish any names for fear they would be targeted. The fact that they can do so now suggests there could be room for talks with the military council. But in his first address Gen Burhan insisted the council would govern for two years. This idea has been rejected by opposition groups who demand a civilian transitional government. They have asked for demonstrations to continue until this happens. He has also been indicted by the ICC on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. But the military council has said it will not extradite Mr Bashir, who denies the charges, although he may be put on trial in Sudan. What next for Sudan's 'master manipulator'? Mr Bashir's National Congress Party on Saturday called his overthrow unconstitutional, and demanded that the military council release the party's imprisoned members.

Brexit uncertainty 'will benefit resorts',"Will 2018's stunning summer, a weak pound and uncertainty tempt people to Wales? Holidaymakers look set to embrace staycations in Wales this year as Brexit sparks nervousness about European holidays, tourism chiefs say. The Easter holidays were due to be the first break after Britain left the European Union, before the government delayed the initial 29 March deadline. Tourism bosses say the weak pound and uncertainty could add to the 10 million annual overnight trips to Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance is positive there will be a ""Brexit bounce"". How Brexit might affect European holidays Will Brexit be a boon for tourists? The drop in the value of the pound has made foreign holidays more expensive and many operators in Wales are reporting greater interest as 2019's holiday season begins at the Easter break. About 90% of overnight trippers to Wales are from the UK staycation market and that could rise with a scorching summer similar to last year. Portmeirion is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Wales Tenby is one of Wales' most popular seaside resort ""People are understandably nervous about going to Europe,"" said Andrew Campbell, chairman of the Wales Tourism Alliance. ""There is also a lot of uncertainty and people are holding on to their cash."" The alliance, which represents more than 7,000 businesses, spoke to delegates in Pembrokeshire on Friday about the ""opportunities"" for Welsh tourism because of Brexit. ""Since the decision was made to leave the EU, the tourism industry has benefited,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism liaison manager Dennis O'Conner. What happens next in Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide South Wales main rail line shut over Easter ""We have received lots of international visitors because the pound is so low and more and more people are looking at staycations."" One holiday letting company, FBM Holidays, which has 300 properties across west Wales, is preparing for its busiest year for three years, while the 350-cottage Bluestone resort is already ahead of its 2018 summer occupancy rate with three months remaining. Wales has 45 Blue Flag beaches on its 1,680 miles (2,700km) of coastline Visitors spend more than Â£17m a day in Wales, about Â£6.3bn a year The Caravan Club in Wales, as well as across the rest of the UK, has recorded its best quarter in a decade while bookings at Mark Whitehouse's holiday park in Fishguard is up 25% for this summer. ""It has given us a small window of opportunity to introduce new customers to UK tourism,"" he said. ""The hysteria will settle down and people will start going abroad again but hopefully we will retain a proportion of them."" There is also a feeling in the industry that some holidaymakers are waiting to see the impact of Brexit before booking their summer break. ""People are holding their breath to see if there is going to be any impact on their income before they book their holidays,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism chair Jane Rees-Baynes, who runs Elm Grove Country House near Tenby. ""People maybe waiting to see if they need to worry about passport queues and things like car insurance on the continent. It will be a lot more last minute this year.""

'Most northerly' parrots cause flap in park,"This video can not be played About 20 or 30 of the birds have made their home in Glasgow's Victoria Park Glasgow's wild parakeet flock is colourful and popular with the locals but their days may be numbered. About 20 or 30 of the birds have made their home in Victoria Park in the west of the city. Stan Whitaker of Scottish Natural Heritage said he believed they were the most northerly flock of parrots in the world. ""Surprisingly parakeets seem to be very adaptable to different environmental conditions,"" Mr Whitaker said. ""Almost certainly parakeets were kept as pets and they have either escaped or perhaps been deliberately released."" A parakeet is any one of a large number of small to medium-sized species of parrot that generally have long tail feathers. Mr Whitaker toldBBC Scotland's The Nine programme: ""Invasive species cause impacts on native wildlife, the economy and the way that we live. ""Their droppings can also spread diseases. ""So we can't just think about what the impacts are at the moment, we have to look ahead 40, 50 years into the future and see what impacts are likely to be then."" A study is being carried out by government wildlife agency Scottish Natural Heritage to see if Scotland's only breeding colony of ring-necked parakeets will have to be removed. Mr Whitaker said: ""It would be feasible to catch them and potentially rehome them. ""If we allow it to get much bigger, certainly in London the way that the fruit farmers manage them there is by shooting."" Local resident Susan Harris is a fan of the birds. She said: ""On that day that I first saw a parakeet it really took my breath away. ""It's such a joyous bird. It's a beautiful green, it has a beautiful coral beak. It's just a joy to watch."" She said: ""I think to call them an invasive species, why not call them a successful species? ""They are adaptable. There is obviously a place for them in nature and they've come and they've taken advantage of it.""

"Brexit uncertainty 'will benefit resorts'Holidaymakers are set to shun foreign trips for Wales over Brexit ""nervousness"", tourism bosses say.Wales","Will 2018's stunning summer, a weak pound and uncertainty tempt people to Wales? Holidaymakers look set to embrace staycations in Wales this year as Brexit sparks nervousness about European holidays, tourism chiefs say. The Easter holidays were due to be the first break after Britain left the European Union, before the government delayed the initial 29 March deadline. Tourism bosses say the weak pound and uncertainty could add to the 10 million annual overnight trips to Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance is positive there will be a ""Brexit bounce"". How Brexit might affect European holidays Will Brexit be a boon for tourists? The drop in the value of the pound has made foreign holidays more expensive and many operators in Wales are reporting greater interest as 2019's holiday season begins at the Easter break. About 90% of overnight trippers to Wales are from the UK staycation market and that could rise with a scorching summer similar to last year. Portmeirion is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Wales Tenby is one of Wales' most popular seaside resort ""People are understandably nervous about going to Europe,"" said Andrew Campbell, chairman of the Wales Tourism Alliance. ""There is also a lot of uncertainty and people are holding on to their cash."" The alliance, which represents more than 7,000 businesses, spoke to delegates in Pembrokeshire on Friday about the ""opportunities"" for Welsh tourism because of Brexit. ""Since the decision was made to leave the EU, the tourism industry has benefited,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism liaison manager Dennis O'Conner. What happens next in Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide South Wales main rail line shut over Easter ""We have received lots of international visitors because the pound is so low and more and more people are looking at staycations."" One holiday letting company, FBM Holidays, which has 300 properties across west Wales, is preparing for its busiest year for three years, while the 350-cottage Bluestone resort is already ahead of its 2018 summer occupancy rate with three months remaining. Wales has 45 Blue Flag beaches on its 1,680 miles (2,700km) of coastline Visitors spend more than Â£17m a day in Wales, about Â£6.3bn a year The Caravan Club in Wales, as well as across the rest of the UK, has recorded its best quarter in a decade while bookings at Mark Whitehouse's holiday park in Fishguard is up 25% for this summer. ""It has given us a small window of opportunity to introduce new customers to UK tourism,"" he said. ""The hysteria will settle down and people will start going abroad again but hopefully we will retain a proportion of them."" There is also a feeling in the industry that some holidaymakers are waiting to see the impact of Brexit before booking their summer break. ""People are holding their breath to see if there is going to be any impact on their income before they book their holidays,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism chair Jane Rees-Baynes, who runs Elm Grove Country House near Tenby. ""People maybe waiting to see if they need to worry about passport queues and things like car insurance on the continent. It will be a lot more last minute this year.""

More GP appointments freed up by scheme,"An NHS scheme that has enabled GP practices to free up more time for doctors to see their patients is to be extended following a successful pilot. NHS England said the Time For Care scheme, tried out at certain sites since 2016, should be in place in three-quarters of GP practices by 2022. The scheme encourages practices to try innovations to cut bureaucracy. In 2018, 205,157 clinical hours - equivalent to GPs having 1.2 million more appointment slots - were freed up. NHS England said that represents close to Â£40m in time saved, as the average cost of an appointment is Â£30. The scheme also saved 330,096 administration hours in the past year. Missed GP appointments 'cost NHS Â£216m' Differences in GP access across England 'shocking' The GP substitute will see you now Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care and a south-east London GP, said the programme has had ""significant benefits for patients and GPs alike, freeing up doctors' time and NHS resources to ensure people get the care they need as quickly as possible. ""GP services will continue to be at the heart of our health service, and it makes sense to invest for another three years in a programme that is delivering so much for patients while helping us to be more efficient."" Routine GP appointment waiting times were reduced by 47% at Pickering Medical Practice in North Yorkshire after it took part in the scheme The surgery had an average waiting time of 19 days, which led to a greater demand for urgent appointments, as patients' conditions worsened during the time they had to wait Staff were stressed as there were high levels of patient complaints due to the long waiting time After a staff suggestion, patients are now offered a telephone appointment first, leading to a 12% increase in telephone appointments. This has reduced the number of patients seeing a GP face-to-face by 8% As patients are able to get the attention of a GP sooner, the demand for urgent care consultations has fallen from 48% of the total to 37% They also freed up GPs' time by appointing a clinical pharmacist to deal with medication tasks and recruited a new nurse practitioner to increase the number of nurse appointments available Helena Ebbs, a GP at the practice, said she was ""proud"" of the changes they'd made.  She said it has ""had a great impact on patients"" and ""energised"" her ""enthusiasm in a time of great pressure"" The scheme now aims to cover three-quarters of GP practices by 2022. Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, said the extension of the scheme was ""welcome"" as there was potential for the scheme to go much further ""with practices considering safe, effective automation within their systems in order to free up staff time and release time for care"". But he said ""much more needs to be done to reduce the day-to-day pressures on practices so that we can make general practice a positive environment for all staff to work in. ""Unsustainable workload pressures have been the number one concern for many GPs and their practice teams in recent years, and have been a main cause of the recruitment and retention crisis in general practice."" In January NHS bosses unveiled a new10-year planfocusing on prevention and early detection. GPs, mental health and community care will get the biggest funding increases to shift the focus away from hospitals. Phone consultations with patients can free up more face-to-face appointments Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""NHS England's evaluation of the Time for Care programme suggests it is making a real difference to some GP practices, and it is reassuring to know that NHS England are listening to our concerns about GP workload and taking action to help tackle this. ""However, most of our hard-working, hard-pressed GPs will still tell a different story of working longer and longer hours and seeing more patients per day to try and cope with demand, which continues to increase in both volume and complexity. ""The impact of Time for Care has to be seen as just one part of a much bigger solution that is needed."" She said the investment announced in the recent NHS long-term plan and GP contract framework will take time to be felt on the ground. ""We are pleased to have more trainees in general practice than ever before, but this trend must be sustained and built upon, as well as continued urgent action to boost the GP workforce in the short term. It is essential that the forthcoming workforce implementation plan launches effective strategies to boost the pipeline of GPs, protects and supports those who are struggling, and has robust solutions to expand the wider practice team - and that all this is properly funded.""

UK tulip firm stockpiles bulbs over Brexit,"The west Norfolk fields are the largest outdoor commercial tulip crop in the UK The UK's biggest outdoor commercial tulip grower has said it has been stockpiling bulbs as uncertainty over Brexit continues. Belmont Nurseries, near King's Lynn, said the future of the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU) was a cause of major concern. ""We're very much UK based, but we do also sell to Europe,"" nursery director Mark Eves said. There about about 17 varieties of tulips in the field of nearly 30 million stems ""In the four days before Motherâs Day we supplied nearly four million stems to UK supermarkets,"" Mark Eves said The nursery said it brought forward a lot of its Dutch imports to give itself a ""buffer"" while it awaits further movement in Brexit talks. Mr Eves said the decision was taken because of fears of any delays at British ports that could be caused by Brexit. How new Brexit delay has hit four firms ""If the lorry is held up at port for any length of time the bulbs simply won't get the fresh air they need blown across them during transport which means they won't flower - basically, they'd be ruined."" The EU has granted theUK a six-month extension, eliminating the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit. The heads are removed from the tulips so the flowering energy returns to the bulb to make it stronger Mr Eves said: ""We haven't got a problem with Brexit, we've got more problem with MPs not knowing how much sugars they want in their tea - let alone what they are doing to sort out trade deals. ""I appreciate the complexities, but the fact they can't agree with themselves - it's disappointing, to say the least."" The Belmont Nursery fields are the largest outdoor crop grown in the UK It takes about two year for this crop to go from bulb production to stems suitable for supermarket sales In 25 years, Belmont has reached the point where it is producing about 75 million bulbs a year. None of the millions of tulips in the field, which is not open to the public, make it to a vase - when the time is rightthe flowers are beheaded by giant mower-like machineto remove the petals. A rogue colour in a row looks beautiful, but it is not what the tulip producers want ""People still wonder why we take the heads off, saying it seems such a waste, but if we don't take the head off we don't get the higher quality bulb and this is all about getting the best quality bulb we can,"" Mr Eves said. ""It's a challenge every year with the weather- so to see them growing well is an absolute pleasure."" The rogue colours in the row are removed to ensure a consistent bulb stock goes back to the glasshouses . The blossom worth billions for Japan.

Woods storms into Masters contention,"This video can not be played Masters 2019: Vintage Tiger Woods asserts major claim on day two Masters second-round leaderboard -7:F Molinari (Ita), J Day (Aus), B Koepka (US), A Scott (Aus), L Oosthuizen (SA);-6:D Johnson (US), J Harding (SA), T Woods (US), X Schauffele (US);-5:I Poulter (Eng), J Rahm (Spa) Selected others: -4P Mickelson (US);-3:B DeChambeau (US), R Fowler (US);-2:T Fleetwood (Eng);-1:J Spieth (US), B Langer (Ger), P Reed (US);Level:R McIlroy (NI);+2:T Hatton (Eng);+3:E Pepperell (Eng)Full leaderboard Tiger Woods is in contention to win a first major since 2008 despite almost being injured in a bizarre incident on a rain-hit second day at the Masters. The four-time champion hit a four-under 68 to finish six under, one shot behind five halfway leaders - all of them major winners - including Open champion Francesco Molinari and US Open and US PGA winner Brooks Koepka. However, Woods was almost knocked over by a security guard who slipped on the damp grass and clipped his right ankle, causing the 43-year-old to hop forward to avoid a fall. Ian Poulteris the leading Englishman on five under, while Northern Ireland'sRory McIlroyshot a 71 that leaves him level par but world number oneJustin Rosebogeyed the last to miss the cut on four over. It is an exceptionally tight leaderboard though, with 22 players within four shots of the lead. The third round is live on BBC Two and the BBC Sport website from 19:30 BST with live coverage of featured groups on Connected TV and online from 15:15. Masters leaderboardandthird-round tee times Relive live text coverage of round two How to follow the Masters across the BBC The world number 12 had miscued his drive into the trees down the left of the 14th hole and after hitting his shot towards the green, a few enthusiastic patrons raced forward to see where it had gone. The mild panic caused a security guard to rush in to protect Woods but he lost his footing on the wet surface and slid straight into the back of the 14-time major champion's right heel. A startled Woods hopped forward a few paces but there appeared to be no serious damage done. In fact, Woods knocked in the birdie putt and then holed a 25-footer on the par-five 15th to get to six under. The roars that greeted them were reminiscent of Woods at his prime, echoing up from the bottom end of the course. The thousands that had followed him round every inch of the Augusta National clamoured for birdies on 17 and 18. Both putts missed by centimetres but Woods, who has overcome four operations on his back in recent years, was all smiles as he walked off to sign his card. ""Accidents happen, we move on,"" he said. ""Other than having four knee surgeries and four back surgeries I'm great. ""It's all good. I've had galleries run over me before. When you play in front of a lot of people things happen."" Woods, who last won at Augusta in 2005, showed a return to form last year, briefly leading The Open during the final round before pushing champion Koepka close at the US PGA Championship, and is again in position to add to his tally of major titles. This video can not be played Watch: Slips, trips and McIlroy's buggy ball Starting the day seven off the pace, the last thing McIlroy needed was an early bogey, but that's what he got at the par-five second after chunking his third into a greenside bunker. It was a frustrating start to what would go on to be a frustrating round for the world number three. A birdie at the sixth and an eagle three at the long eighth moved the 29-year-old to one under for the tournament. But his progress was halted on the 11th, which gave up just one birdie all day. McIlroy took two to get out of the greenside bunker and walked off with a bogey and another shot went at the 13th after he hit his ball into the creek protecting the green. More trouble followed for the four-time major champion on 15 after pushing his drive right and landing it  in a golf buggy. He eventually walked off with a par before holing a lengthy birdie putt on the 16th to get back to level par. ""I was staring bogey in the face at 15 and thinking I have to play the last three at even par just to make the cut,"" said McIlroy. ""To be here on the weekend and only be seven back, I'm actually pretty pleased."" World number one Rose, who started quickly with birdies on his first two holes, added two more birdies on the second nine. However, four bogeys on his card meant he was right on the cut mark at three over playing the 18th and the 38-year-old, who has twice finished runner-up in the past three years, bogeyed the last. It is the first time in his 14 Masters appearances that Rose has missed the cut and he is the first world number one to do so since Martin Kaymer in 2011. ""I've been playing terribly this week, but there's always pride in trying to make it,"" said Rose. After finding a fairway bunker with his opening tee shot and bogeying the first, Poulter birdied the par-five second and then went on a run of nine pars before successive birdies on the 12th and 13th briefly put him in a share of the lead on six under. However, a ""disappointing three-putt"" led to a bogey on the 14th and he finished with five pars. ""I'm just trying to be smart and not take myself out of the tournament, like I've done in the past,"" he said. ""I've got a 3% chance. It was a stat shown on television that 43-year-olds have got a 3% chance of winning this week."" Francesco Molinari (left) caddied for his older brother Edoardo Molinari at the 2006 Masters ItalianMolinari,36, had five birdies in a bogey-free 67 early on and was joined by AmericanKoepka,South AfricanLouis Oosthuizenand AustraliansJason DayandAdam Scott. Molinari is enjoying something of a purple patch in his career, with four wins in the past year, including becoming the first Italian to win a major with his victory at Carnoustie in July. But history is against Molinari: Only four players have won the Masters while Open champion - Arnold Palmer (1962), Seve Ballesteros (1980), Tom Watson (1981) and Tiger Woods (2001) - while his best performance at Augusta is a tie for 19th in 2012. Day, whose best Masters finish is second in 2011, was treated on the course by a physiotherapist for a bad back during Thursday's opening round. The healing hands helped the former US PGA champion post a two-under 70 and he followed it on Friday with six birdies and just one bogey. His fellow Australian Scott briefly led on eight under after an eagle on the par-five 15th but the 2013 champion three-putted the short 16th and eventually signed for a 68. Joint overnight leader Koepka had three birdies, two bogeys and a double bogey on an eventful first nine. A wayward tee shot on the par-five second into trees, followed by a second that clattered another tree and resulted in a penalty drop, led to a seven. However, a more solid second nine, with birdies on the 15th and 18th holes, moved the three-time major champion back into a share of the lead. They were joined late on by former Open champion Oosthuizen who had just one bogey as he posted a six-under 66.

He was joined by Woods and their fellow AmericanXander Schauffele,who had eight birdies in a seven-under 65 - the lowest round of the day. And unheralded South AfricanJustin Harding,who had five birdies on the second nine, posted a second successive 69 to also sit one off the lead. Spain'sJon Rahmput together a solid bogey-free two-under 70 and is just two off the lead on five under. Phil Mickelsonsaid playing his 100th competitive round at the Masters just meant he was ""getting old"". ""This is a spiritual place if you love golf the way we do,"" said the 48-year-old, who played his first round in 1991. The three-time champion started round two one off the pace on five under and ended it on four under. Joint overnight leaderBryson DeChambeausaid ""weird stuff started to happen with my wedges around the greens in wetter conditions"" after he slipped back to three under with a three-over 75. European Ryder Cup heroTommy Fleetwoodcarded his second one-under-par 71 to sit tied for 23rd heading into the weekend, five shots behind the leaders. AmericanJustin Thomaswas another to hit a bogey-free round as a 68 lifted him to level with DeChambeau andJordan Spiethalso posted 68 to improve to one under. Danny Willett,champion in 2016, and 2017 winnerSergio Garciawill both miss the weekend after bogeys at the last saw them finish on four over. And the par-three curse struck again with England'sMatt Wallace,who won Wednesday's traditional curtain-raiser, adding a 77 to his opening 75 to bow out on eight over. No player who has won the par-three contest has won the Masters in the same year.

Drink-driver spared jail 'for being woman',"If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman. Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine. Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man. Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues. The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog. Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a van's rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignia's wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash. He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire. Latest news from the West Midlands An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldn't be driving"", Mr Sapwell said. She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station. Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake. The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol."" But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since. ""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said. Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months. ""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said. She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling. If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate. ""If you don't comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added.

"New Star Wars movie title revealedThe Rise of Skywalker will see the return of villain Emperor Palpatine, the producers revealed.","Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, returns in The Rise of Skywalker The next Star Wars movie, episode IX, will be titled The Rise of Skywalker, it has been announced. The title was revealed at a Star Wars celebration event in Chicago, while a teaser trailer was posted on Twitter with the words: ""Every generation has a legend."" Director JJ Abrams said the movie is set some time after previous instalment The Last Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker is due to be released later this year. Despite his apparent death at the end of Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, Emperor Palpatine seems to be making a comeback. His sinister cackle is heard at the end of the trailer and Ian McDiarmid, who plays the character, strolled on stage to loud applause at the announcement. Allow Twitter content?

The two-minute trailer, the first footage seen from the new film, also features a brief glimpse of Princess Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher. She embraces Rey (Daisy Ridley), while Luke Skywalker's voice is heard saying: ""We'll always be with you. No one's ever really gone."" Fisher died in 2016 but the filmmakers were able to use previously unseen footage from The Force Awakens. Abrams told a US ""Star Wars Celebration"" event in Chicago it was a ""weird miracle"" to be able to continue Princess Leia's story. ""Every day it hits me that she's not here, but it's so surreal because we're working with her still,"" he said. ""She's so alive in the scenes and the craziest part is how not crazy it feels. Princess Leia lives in this film in a way that's kind of mind-blowing for me."" The Rise of Skywalker is the third episode of the third set of Star Wars films, which were started by filmmaker George Lucas in 1977. Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm - a subsidiary of Disney that makes the Star Wars films - agreed with the event's panel host Stephen Colbert it was ""unprecedented"" to tell a story in a nine-film arc. ""What's also fascinating is it's over 40 years,"" she told the event. ""To keep this relevant and meaningful to the characters and to the people experiencing this story, it has to feel like its of its time. ""We've taken to heart everything that inspired George [Lucas] and then I think the inspiration that JJ's [Abrams] brought to this has given it even more depth."" Carrie Fisher and Richard E Grant among Episode IX cast Fans welcomed the reappearance of Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, who is seen piloting the Millennium Falcon. The movie also features the return of John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron. The trailer opens with Rey on a desert planet as Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, says in a voiceover: ""We've passed on all we know. A thousand generations live in you now. But this is your fight."" She activates her lightsaber as a TIE fighter bears down on her, flying close to the ground. As it reaches her, she backflips over it. Then we see Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver, slicing through enemies in a blood-red forest. Lando Calrissian appears at the controls of the Millennium Falcon, putting it into hyperdrive as a title card says: ""The saga comes to an end."" Lando Calrissian is back after appearances in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Heroes including C-3PO are seen being chased across the desert planet in a low-flying craft before the trailer cuts to the shot of Rey hugging Leia. Then we see Rey, Finn, Poe, C-3PO, BB-8 and Chewbacca walking to the edge of a cliff by the sea. Across the water appears to be the wreckage of a Death Star. The trailer's final shot appears to show a wrecked Death Star The film is due to be released on 20 December.

Woods storms into Masters contentionTiger Woods is in contention to win the Masters despite almost being injured in a bizarre incident in an action-packed day at Augusta.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Masters 2019: Vintage Tiger Woods asserts major claim on day two Masters second-round leaderboard -7:F Molinari (Ita), J Day (Aus), B Koepka (US), A Scott (Aus), L Oosthuizen (SA);-6:D Johnson (US), J Harding (SA), T Woods (US), X Schauffele (US);-5:I Poulter (Eng), J Rahm (Spa) Selected others: -4P Mickelson (US);-3:B DeChambeau (US), R Fowler (US);-2:T Fleetwood (Eng);-1:J Spieth (US), B Langer (Ger), P Reed (US);Level:R McIlroy (NI);+2:T Hatton (Eng);+3:E Pepperell (Eng)Full leaderboard Tiger Woods is in contention to win a first major since 2008 despite almost being injured in a bizarre incident on a rain-hit second day at the Masters. The four-time champion hit a four-under 68 to finish six under, one shot behind five halfway leaders - all of them major winners - including Open champion Francesco Molinari and US Open and US PGA winner Brooks Koepka. However, Woods was almost knocked over by a security guard who slipped on the damp grass and clipped his right ankle, causing the 43-year-old to hop forward to avoid a fall. Ian Poulteris the leading Englishman on five under, while Northern Ireland'sRory McIlroyshot a 71 that leaves him level par but world number oneJustin Rosebogeyed the last to miss the cut on four over. It is an exceptionally tight leaderboard though, with 22 players within four shots of the lead. The third round is live on BBC Two and the BBC Sport website from 19:30 BST with live coverage of featured groups on Connected TV and online from 15:15. Masters leaderboardandthird-round tee times Relive live text coverage of round two How to follow the Masters across the BBC The world number 12 had miscued his drive into the trees down the left of the 14th hole and after hitting his shot towards the green, a few enthusiastic patrons raced forward to see where it had gone. The mild panic caused a security guard to rush in to protect Woods but he lost his footing on the wet surface and slid straight into the back of the 14-time major champion's right heel. A startled Woods hopped forward a few paces but there appeared to be no serious damage done. In fact, Woods knocked in the birdie putt and then holed a 25-footer on the par-five 15th to get to six under. The roars that greeted them were reminiscent of Woods at his prime, echoing up from the bottom end of the course. The thousands that had followed him round every inch of the Augusta National clamoured for birdies on 17 and 18. Both putts missed by centimetres but Woods, who has overcome four operations on his back in recent years, was all smiles as he walked off to sign his card. ""Accidents happen, we move on,"" he said. ""Other than having four knee surgeries and four back surgeries I'm great. ""It's all good. I've had galleries run over me before. When you play in front of a lot of people things happen."" Woods, who last won at Augusta in 2005, showed a return to form last year, briefly leading The Open during the final round before pushing champion Koepka close at the US PGA Championship, and is again in position to add to his tally of major titles. This video can not be played Watch: Slips, trips and McIlroy's buggy ball Starting the day seven off the pace, the last thing McIlroy needed was an early bogey, but that's what he got at the par-five second after chunking his third into a greenside bunker. It was a frustrating start to what would go on to be a frustrating round for the world number three. A birdie at the sixth and an eagle three at the long eighth moved the 29-year-old to one under for the tournament. But his progress was halted on the 11th, which gave up just one birdie all day. McIlroy took two to get out of the greenside bunker and walked off with a bogey and another shot went at the 13th after he hit his ball into the creek protecting the green. More trouble followed for the four-time major champion on 15 after pushing his drive right and landing it  in a golf buggy. He eventually walked off with a par before holing a lengthy birdie putt on the 16th to get back to level par. ""I was staring bogey in the face at 15 and thinking I have to play the last three at even par just to make the cut,"" said McIlroy. ""To be here on the weekend and only be seven back, I'm actually pretty pleased."" World number one Rose, who started quickly with birdies on his first two holes, added two more birdies on the second nine. However, four bogeys on his card meant he was right on the cut mark at three over playing the 18th and the 38-year-old, who has twice finished runner-up in the past three years, bogeyed the last. It is the first time in his 14 Masters appearances that Rose has missed the cut and he is the first world number one to do so since Martin Kaymer in 2011. ""I've been playing terribly this week, but there's always pride in trying to make it,"" said Rose. After finding a fairway bunker with his opening tee shot and bogeying the first, Poulter birdied the par-five second and then went on a run of nine pars before successive birdies on the 12th and 13th briefly put him in a share of the lead on six under. However, a ""disappointing three-putt"" led to a bogey on the 14th and he finished with five pars. ""I'm just trying to be smart and not take myself out of the tournament, like I've done in the past,"" he said. ""I've got a 3% chance. It was a stat shown on television that 43-year-olds have got a 3% chance of winning this week."" Francesco Molinari (left) caddied for his older brother Edoardo Molinari at the 2006 Masters ItalianMolinari,36, had five birdies in a bogey-free 67 early on and was joined by AmericanKoepka,South AfricanLouis Oosthuizenand AustraliansJason DayandAdam Scott. Molinari is enjoying something of a purple patch in his career, with four wins in the past year, including becoming the first Italian to win a major with his victory at Carnoustie in July. But history is against Molinari: Only four players have won the Masters while Open champion - Arnold Palmer (1962), Seve Ballesteros (1980), Tom Watson (1981) and Tiger Woods (2001) - while his best performance at Augusta is a tie for 19th in 2012. Day, whose best Masters finish is second in 2011, was treated on the course by a physiotherapist for a bad back during Thursday's opening round. The healing hands helped the former US PGA champion post a two-under 70 and he followed it on Friday with six birdies and just one bogey. His fellow Australian Scott briefly led on eight under after an eagle on the par-five 15th but the 2013 champion three-putted the short 16th and eventually signed for a 68. Joint overnight leader Koepka had three birdies, two bogeys and a double bogey on an eventful first nine. A wayward tee shot on the par-five second into trees, followed by a second that clattered another tree and resulted in a penalty drop, led to a seven. However, a more solid second nine, with birdies on the 15th and 18th holes, moved the three-time major champion back into a share of the lead. They were joined late on by former Open champion Oosthuizen who had just one bogey as he posted a six-under 66.

He was joined by Woods and their fellow AmericanXander Schauffele,who had eight birdies in a seven-under 65 - the lowest round of the day. And unheralded South AfricanJustin Harding,who had five birdies on the second nine, posted a second successive 69 to also sit one off the lead. Spain'sJon Rahmput together a solid bogey-free two-under 70 and is just two off the lead on five under. Phil Mickelsonsaid playing his 100th competitive round at the Masters just meant he was ""getting old"". ""This is a spiritual place if you love golf the way we do,"" said the 48-year-old, who played his first round in 1991. The three-time champion started round two one off the pace on five under and ended it on four under. Joint overnight leaderBryson DeChambeausaid ""weird stuff started to happen with my wedges around the greens in wetter conditions"" after he slipped back to three under with a three-over 75. European Ryder Cup heroTommy Fleetwoodcarded his second one-under-par 71 to sit tied for 23rd heading into the weekend, five shots behind the leaders. AmericanJustin Thomaswas another to hit a bogey-free round as a 68 lifted him to level with DeChambeau andJordan Spiethalso posted 68 to improve to one under. Danny Willett,champion in 2016, and 2017 winnerSergio Garciawill both miss the weekend after bogeys at the last saw them finish on four over. And the par-three curse struck again with England'sMatt Wallace,who won Wednesday's traditional curtain-raiser, adding a 77 to his opening 75 to bow out on eight over.

"Brexit uncertainty 'will benefit resorts'Holidaymakers are set to shun foreign trips for Wales over Brexit ""nervousness"", tourism bosses say.","Will 2018's stunning summer, a weak pound and uncertainty tempt people to Wales? Holidaymakers look set to embrace staycations in Wales this year as Brexit sparks nervousness about European holidays, tourism chiefs say. The Easter holidays were due to be the first break after Britain left the European Union, before the government delayed the initial 29 March deadline. Tourism bosses say the weak pound and uncertainty could add to the 10 million annual overnight trips to Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance is positive there will be a ""Brexit bounce"". How Brexit might affect European holidays Will Brexit be a boon for tourists? The drop in the value of the pound has made foreign holidays more expensive and many operators in Wales are reporting greater interest as 2019's holiday season begins at the Easter break. About 90% of overnight trippers to Wales are from the UK staycation market and that could rise with a scorching summer similar to last year. Portmeirion is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Wales Tenby is one of Wales' most popular seaside resort ""People are understandably nervous about going to Europe,"" said Andrew Campbell, chairman of the Wales Tourism Alliance. ""There is also a lot of uncertainty and people are holding on to their cash."" The alliance, which represents more than 7,000 businesses, spoke to delegates in Pembrokeshire on Friday about the ""opportunities"" for Welsh tourism because of Brexit. ""Since the decision was made to leave the EU, the tourism industry has benefited,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism liaison manager Dennis O'Conner. What happens next in Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide South Wales main rail line shut over Easter ""We have received lots of international visitors because the pound is so low and more and more people are looking at staycations."" One holiday letting company, FBM Holidays, which has 300 properties across west Wales, is preparing for its busiest year for three years, while the 350-cottage Bluestone resort is already ahead of its 2018 summer occupancy rate with three months remaining. Wales has 45 Blue Flag beaches on its 1,680 miles (2,700km) of coastline Visitors spend more than Â£17m a day in Wales, about Â£6.3bn a year The Caravan Club in Wales, as well as across the rest of the UK, has recorded its best quarter in a decade while bookings at Mark Whitehouse's holiday park in Fishguard is up 25% for this summer. ""It has given us a small window of opportunity to introduce new customers to UK tourism,"" he said. ""The hysteria will settle down and people will start going abroad again but hopefully we will retain a proportion of them."" There is also a feeling in the industry that some holidaymakers are waiting to see the impact of Brexit before booking their summer break. ""People are holding their breath to see if there is going to be any impact on their income before they book their holidays,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism chair Jane Rees-Baynes, who runs Elm Grove Country House near Tenby. ""People maybe waiting to see if they need to worry about passport queues and things like car insurance on the continent. It will be a lot more last minute this year.""

Drink-driver spared jail 'for being woman'A judge tells Victoria Parry she would have been sent straight to prison if she were a man.,"If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman. Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine. Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man. Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues. The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog. Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a van's rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignia's wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash. He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire. Latest news from the West Midlands An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldn't be driving"", Mr Sapwell said. She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station. Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake. The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol."" But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since. ""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said. Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months. ""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said. She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling. If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate. ""If you don't comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed it received a complaint about the remarks attributed to the judge.

"New Star Wars movie title revealedThe Rise of Skywalker will see the return of villain Emperor Palpatine, the producers revealed.Entertainment & Arts","Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, returns in The Rise of Skywalker The next Star Wars movie, episode IX, will be titled The Rise of Skywalker, it has been announced. The title was revealed at a Star Wars celebration event in Chicago, while a teaser trailer was posted on Twitter with the words: ""Every generation has a legend."" Director JJ Abrams said the movie is set some time after previous instalment The Last Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker is due to be released later this year. Despite his apparent death at the end of Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, Emperor Palpatine seems to be making a comeback. His sinister cackle is heard at the end of the trailer and Ian McDiarmid, who plays the character, strolled on stage to loud applause at the announcement. Allow Twitter content?

The two-minute trailer, the first footage seen from the new film, also features a brief glimpse of Princess Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher. She embraces Rey (Daisy Ridley), while Luke Skywalker's voice is heard saying: ""We'll always be with you. No one's ever really gone."" Fisher died in 2016 but the filmmakers were able to use previously unseen footage from The Force Awakens. Abrams told a US ""Star Wars Celebration"" event in Chicago it was a ""weird miracle"" to be able to continue Princess Leia's story. ""Every day it hits me that she's not here, but it's so surreal because we're working with her still,"" he said. ""She's so alive in the scenes and the craziest part is how not crazy it feels. Princess Leia lives in this film in a way that's kind of mind-blowing for me."" The Rise of Skywalker is the third episode of the third set of Star Wars films, which were started by filmmaker George Lucas in 1977. Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm - a subsidiary of Disney that makes the Star Wars films - agreed with the event's panel host Stephen Colbert it was ""unprecedented"" to tell a story in a nine-film arc. ""What's also fascinating is it's over 40 years,"" she told the event. ""To keep this relevant and meaningful to the characters and to the people experiencing this story, it has to feel like its of its time. ""We've taken to heart everything that inspired George [Lucas] and then I think the inspiration that JJ's [Abrams] brought to this has given it even more depth."" Carrie Fisher and Richard E Grant among Episode IX cast Fans welcomed the reappearance of Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, who is seen piloting the Millennium Falcon. The movie also features the return of John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron. The trailer opens with Rey on a desert planet as Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, says in a voiceover: ""We've passed on all we know. A thousand generations live in you now. But this is your fight."" She activates her lightsaber as a TIE fighter bears down on her, flying close to the ground. As it reaches her, she backflips over it. Then we see Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver, slicing through enemies in a blood-red forest. Lando Calrissian appears at the controls of the Millennium Falcon, putting it into hyperdrive as a title card says: ""The saga comes to an end."" Lando Calrissian is back after appearances in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Heroes including C-3PO are seen being chased across the desert planet in a low-flying craft before the trailer cuts to the shot of Rey hugging Leia. Then we see Rey, Finn, Poe, C-3PO, BB-8 and Chewbacca walking to the edge of a cliff by the sea. Across the water appears to be the wreckage of a Death Star. The trailer's final shot appears to show a wrecked Death Star The film is due to be released on 20 December.

Sweden must get priority on Assange - MPs,"More than 70 MPs and peers have signed a letter urging the home secretary to ensure Julian Assange faces authorities in Sweden if they want his extradition. The Wikileaks founder, who is now in UK custody, was arrested on Thursday after years in Ecuador's London embassy. Sweden is considering whether to reopen an investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against him. And the US is seeking his extradition in relation to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, in 2010. The whistle-blowing website Wikileaks has published thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and war. Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of sexual assault, which he has denied. At the time, the Australian-born 47-year-old said he had had entirely consensual sex with two women while on a trip to Stockholm, and that the Swedish claims against him were part of a smear campaign. Swedish prosecutors dropped a rape investigation into Assange in 2017 because they were unable to formally notify him of allegations while he stayed in the embassy. Two other charges of molestation and unlawful coercion had to be dropped in 2015 because time had run out. But Swedishprosecutors say they are now re-examining Assange's caseat the request of the lawyer acting for the alleged rape victim. In their letter to Sajid Javid, 70 parliamentarians - chiefly Labour MPs and peers - urged him to ""stand with the victims of sexual violence"" and ensure the rape claim against the Wikileaks founder could be ""properly investigated"". ""We do not presume guilt, of course, but we believe due process should be followed and the complainant should see justice be done,"" the letter said. Labour's Stella Creasytweeted a copy of the letter sent to Mr Javid.,external The same letter was also sent to shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK government should not extradite Julian Assange to the US. But speaking on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said he had made it ""very clear all along that if there are allegations which Julian Assange needs to answer, of sexual issues, sexual attacks that may or may not have taken place in Sweden, then it's a matter for the courts to decide - but I do think he should answer those questions"". He added: ""My objection was to his extradition to the United States because I do believe that Wikileaks told us the truth about what was actually happening in Afghanistan and in Iraq."" The Labour leader said it was now for Sweden to put forward proposals on the matter. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also said on Friday she was ""disgusted"" the US allegation had been ""allowed to eclipse"" the sex offence case. Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world Why Julian Assange is a wanted man Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in embassy One of the letter's signatories, Stephen Kinnock, told the BBC the events surrounding Assange had ""become politicised"", and that the letter was intended ""to underline the point that first and foremost Mr Assange is accused of rape and sexual violence in Sweden"". ""It is vital that doesn't get airbrushed out of the conversation."" Assange was dramatically arrested by UK police on Thursday after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum. Westminster Magistrates' Court found him guilty of a charge of breaching bail later that day. He faces up to 12 months in prison for that conviction. The letter from parliamentarians says both UK and US authorities seem to have been aware in advance of Ecuador's decision to rescind Mr Assange's political asylum, but said it was a matter of ""grave concern"" that Swedish authorities did not appear to be aware of the impending arrest. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London The United States alleges that Assange conspired with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. Documents published by Wikileaks relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents. The US has already charged Assange witha single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers,externalto reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. If found guilty, Assange could be jailed for up to five years. Extradition proceedings are dealt with by the courts. According to the Home Office, the home secretary can bring a limited number of factors into consideration when deciding whether to order a person's extradition. These include whether the person might be at risk of the death penalty or whether the requesting state might try to add additional charges it has not specified. Lawyer Rebecca Niblock said that, if Sweden made an extradition request, it would be for the home secretary to decide which would take precedence, considering factors such as which was made first and the seriousness of the offence. The rape allegation in Sweden has a limitation period which expires in August 2020; inquiries into claims of molestation and unlawful coercion have already been timed out. Assange is due to face a hearing over his possible extradition to the US on 2 May. His lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" for journalists publishing information about the US. The UN has called for his right to a fair trial to be respected during any extradition process.

More GP appointments freed up in new scheme,"An NHS scheme that has enabled GP practices to free up more time for doctors to see their patients is to be extended following a successful pilot. NHS England said the Time For Care scheme, tried out at certain sites since 2016, should be in place in three-quarters of GP practices by 2022. The scheme encourages practices to try innovations to cut bureaucracy. In 2018, 205,157 clinical hours - equivalent to GPs having 1.2 million more appointment slots - were freed up. NHS England said that represents close to Â£40m in time saved, as the average cost of an appointment is Â£30. The scheme also saved 330,096 administration hours in the past year. Missed GP appointments 'cost NHS Â£216m' Differences in GP access across England 'shocking' The GP substitute will see you now Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care and a south-east London GP, said the programme has had ""significant benefits for patients and GPs alike, freeing up doctors' time and NHS resources to ensure people get the care they need as quickly as possible. ""GP services will continue to be at the heart of our health service, and it makes sense to invest for another three years in a programme that is delivering so much for patients while helping us to be more efficient."" Routine GP appointment waiting times were reduced by 47% at Pickering Medical Practice in North Yorkshire after it took part in the scheme The surgery had an average waiting time of 19 days, which led to a greater demand for urgent appointments, as patients' conditions worsened during the time they had to wait Staff were stressed as there were high levels of patient complaints due to the long waiting time After a staff suggestion, patients are now offered a telephone appointment first, leading to a 12% increase in telephone appointments. This has reduced the number of patients seeing a GP face-to-face by 8% As patients are able to get the attention of a GP sooner, the demand for urgent care consultations has fallen from 48% of the total to 37% They also freed up GPs' time by appointing a clinical pharmacist to deal with medication tasks and recruited a new nurse practitioner to increase the number of nurse appointments available Helena Ebbs, a GP at the practice, said she was ""proud"" of the changes they'd made.  She said it has ""had a great impact on patients"" and ""energised"" her ""enthusiasm in a time of great pressure"" The scheme now aims to cover three-quarters of GP practices by 2022. Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, said the extension of the scheme was ""welcome"" as there was potential for the scheme to go much further ""with practices considering safe, effective automation within their systems in order to free up staff time and release time for care"". But he said ""much more needs to be done to reduce the day-to-day pressures on practices so that we can make general practice a positive environment for all staff to work in. ""Unsustainable workload pressures have been the number one concern for many GPs and their practice teams in recent years, and have been a main cause of the recruitment and retention crisis in general practice."" In January NHS bosses unveiled a new10-year planfocusing on prevention and early detection. GPs, mental health and community care will get the biggest funding increases to shift the focus away from hospitals. Phone consultations with patients can free up more face-to-face appointments Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""NHS England's evaluation of the Time for Care programme suggests it is making a real difference to some GP practices, and it is reassuring to know that NHS England are listening to our concerns about GP workload and taking action to help tackle this. ""However, most of our hard-working, hard-pressed GPs will still tell a different story of working longer and longer hours and seeing more patients per day to try and cope with demand, which continues to increase in both volume and complexity. ""The impact of Time for Care has to be seen as just one part of a much bigger solution that is needed."" She said the investment announced in the recent NHS long-term plan and GP contract framework will take time to be felt on the ground. ""We are pleased to have more trainees in general practice than ever before, but this trend must be sustained and built upon, as well as continued urgent action to boost the GP workforce in the short term. It is essential that the forthcoming workforce implementation plan launches effective strategies to boost the pipeline of GPs, protects and supports those who are struggling, and has robust solutions to expand the wider practice team - and that all this is properly funded.""
