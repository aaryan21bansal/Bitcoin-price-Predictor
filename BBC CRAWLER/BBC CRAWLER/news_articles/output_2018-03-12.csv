"Microplastics are 'littering' riverbedsMicroplastic particles contaminate the riverbeds throughout the UK, research suggests.7h7 hours agoScience & Environment","This video can not be played Watch: A look under the microscope to discover the hidden microplastics lurking in our waters Microscopic plastic beads, fragments and fibres are littering riverbeds across the UK - from rural streams to urban waterways. This is according to a study that analysed sediments from rivers in north-west England. Scientists from the University of Manchester tested river sediments at 40 sites throughout Greater Manchester and found ""microplastics everywhere"". There is evidence that such small particles can enter the food chain. Plastic microbeads, like these recovered from the River Mersey, are now banned in cosmetics in the UK The findings,published in the journal Nature Geoscience,external, are the first from a ""systematic basin-wide"" study, the researchers say. In a first round of tests, just one of the sites - in the upper reaches of the River Goyt, which is one of the tributaries of the River Mersey - contained no plastic. But when the researchers returned to that site to repeat their test, that area had become contaminated. ""I think that it is likely that there are even higher concentrations in some of the large rivers passing through global megacities,"" said lead researcher Dr Rachel Hurley. ""We just need to get out there and see. We still don't know the full scale of the microplastic problem,"" she told BBC News. ""Wherever you have people and industry, you will have high levels of microplastic,"" added Prof Jamie Woodward, from Manchester University's School of Geography. Some parts of the River Tame contained more than half a million plastic particles per square metre of riverbed To analyse river sediments, researchers isolated patches of riverbed and measured the concentration within those patches. Some urban ""hotspots"" contained hundreds of thousands of plastic particles per square metre. This included a site at the River Tame in Denton - a downstream, suburban stretch of river - that contained more than half a million plastic particles per square metre. ""According to our literature search on microplastics in the ocean, in sediments on beaches, in lakes - and the small amount of data on rivers elsewhere - this is currently the highest concentration found anywhere,"" said Prof Woodward. The scientists now want to investigate the specific sources of the plastic fibres, microbeads and fragments they found. One recent study in the US linked wastewater treatment plants with the release of plastic into the environment,external. And the scientists think that wastewater is likely to make a large contribution - particularly of microfibres from synthetic clothing and microbeads. ""We welcomed the ban on microbeads in personal care products introduced earlier this year,"" said Prof Woodward. ""And we want to monitor the effect of that ban. ""But microbeads are also used in industrial processes - in the moulding of larger plastic products. So there are likely to be multiple sources. ""In urban environments, microplastics may come from wastewater and sewer systems, from plastic litter that is broken up and fragmented, and even from the air. Sources may not be active all of the time, so they are difficult to track - but we are working on it!"" said Dr Hurley. Even rural stream beds are contaminated with microplastics The researchers gathered their first set of samples prior to the winter floods of 2015 and 2016. That extreme flooding was particularly severe in their river system - when weeks of heavy rain wreaked havoc in northern England, Northern Ireland and parts of Wales. The team returned to the sites to see if the levels of plastic had changed. This revealed that the floods had ""flushed out"" approximately 70% of the microplastics stored in these riverbeds, equivalent to almost a tonne of plastic, or nearly 50 billion particles. It also eradicated microbead contamination at seven sites. So the rivers are able to ""cleanse themselves"", the researchers explained. But, as Prof Woodward pointed out, ""all of that will ultimately end up in the ocean"". Dr James Rothwell added that, since many of the particles this study detected were so small, they would simply slip through the filtration nets that are used, as standard, to sift microplastics out of the ocean. ""The implications of that are that we might well be underestimating by several orders of magnitude how much microplastic is in the oceans that has been delivered by rivers - flushed out during flood events,"" he said.

Panda breeding programme suspended,"This video can not be played Giant panda breeding programme at Edinburgh Zoo suspended The giant panda breeding programme at Edinburgh Zoo has been suspended following years of failed attempts. Tian Tian and Yang Guang will not attempt to breed this year, the BBC Scotland news website has been told. Tian Tian has failed to produce a cub six times since moving to the Scottish zoo in 2011. Zoo officials said they wanted to make ""some enhancements to our giant panda enclosure"" before attempting future breeding. Tian Tian has failed to produce a cub since moving to Edinburgh Zoo in 2011 An Edinburgh Zoo spokeswoman said: ""We will not attempt to breed our giant pandas this year because we want to further assess the incredibly complex and unpredictable breeding process. ""This pause, which is supported by our giant panda team and other key specialists, will allow us further time to consider the scientific data, our own experiences and those of colleagues around the world, including the latest thinking on giant panda accommodation. ""In the meantime, the pause will also enable us to make some enhancements to our giant panda enclosure which would not have been practical either during or between breeding seasons. ""We very much hope Tian Tian has a cub in the future and will be thrilled if this happens. Even without breeding success as yet, RZSS is playing a crucial role in safeguarding this magnificent species by helping fund conservation projects in China alongside international partners."" Libby Anderson, animal welfare charity OneKind, said: ""OneKind is pleased to hear that the attempts to breed a cub in Edinburgh have been put on hold, and that the pandas will not be subjected to invasive artificial insemination procedures again this year. ""OneKind is opposed to breeding wild animals in captivity and we have always believed it was misguided to make repeated attempts to breed more captive pandas in Scotland. ""These individuals will never return to the wild, or improve protection for the wild population in their native habitat. ""We think that now is the time to leave the pandas in peace and we hope that the suspension will continue beyond the time required to improve their enclosure.""

Met Opera fires conductor amid abuse claims,"US conductor James Levine has called the allegations ""unfounded"" New York's Metropolitan Opera has fired eminent conductor James Levine, after an internal inquiry found ""credible evidence"" to support claims he sexually abused young male musicians. Mr Levine, who denies the allegations, was suspended in December when they were made public. The conductor, now 74, was music director at the Met for 40 years. He retired for health reasons in 2016, but had continued to work with the opera as music director emeritus. ""The investigation uncovered credible evidence that Mr Levine had engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct both before and during the period when he worked at the Met,""the opera house said in a statement,external. It said there was also evidence that the conductor abused and harassed ""vulnerable artists in the early stages of their careers"". The Met said more than 70 people were interviewed during its investigation. New York's Met is one of the world's most prestigious opera houses Four men have accused Mr Levine of sexually abusing them decades ago. Some say they were teenagers at the time. An Illinois police report, seen by the New York Times, said one of the alleged victims claimed that the abuse began in 1985 when he was 15 and Mr Levine was 41, and continued until 1993. The conductor has previously called the accusations ""unfounded."" ""As anyone who truly knows me will attest, I have not lived my life as an oppressor or an aggressor,"" he said in a statement. Conductor Levine denies sex claims Mr Levine is one the most high-profile figures in classical music to face claims of sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo movement. In December London'sRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra relieved its principal conductor and artistic director Charles Dutoit of his dutiesfollowing allegations against him, which he denies. Mr Levine has led more than 2,500 performances at the Met, one of the world's most illustrious opera houses, and is often named among America's top conductors. He has struggled with Parkinson's disease and other health issues and now conducts from a motorised wheelchair.

Nando's cries fowl over rival's brandingThe chicken giant claims an independent restaurant's branding is peri peri similar to its own.25m25 minutes agoBerkshire,"The Fernando's logo (left) is said to infringe the trademark of Nando's cockerel (right) An independent chicken shop says it is being ""bullied"" by Nando's because the chain is ""threatened"" by its success. The chicken giant has launched legal action, accusing Fernando's in Reading of copying its name and images. But the Berkshire eatery's director said TV show Take Me Out was the real inspiration behind the name. Nando's said it wants the smaller outlet to rebrand because ""we believe it is trying to benefit from some of the things that make us who we are"". Fernando's director Asam Aziz said he chose a variation of Portugal's traditional chicken symbol for his peri peri restaurant Fernando's director Asam Aziz said he received a letter from lawyers acting for Nando's, claiming he was infringing the chain's intellectual property rights. He told the BBC: ""They are bullying me. It's such a worry; I'm just an independent business owner. ""I thought I would start something new, a brand of my own but now this has created such a storm."" Nando's claims he is infringing on the chain's intellectual property rights in a letter from their lawyers Mr Aziz said he and two friends came up with the idea for a Portuguese-style chicken restaurant and they chose a variation of the country's traditional chicken symbol as a result. The restaurant opened seven months ago and Mr Aziz said he was overwhelmed by the positive reviews it had received.

Carragher suspended over spitting incident,"This video can not be played Carragher sorry for 'awful behaviour' Former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher has apologised again for the ""awful"" spitting incident which led to his suspension by Sky Sports. Carragher was filmed spitting from his car towards a girl in another vehicle after Liverpool's 2-1 Premier League loss at Manchester United on Saturday. Sky suspended the pundit, saying it takes the matter ""extremely seriously"". ""Hopefully I'm judged not right now but over a longer period of time,"" the 40-year-old told BBC Sport. ""Hopefully I'm given the opportunity to show people the real me, who they've seen for the last 20 years or so."" Carragher made 737 appearances for Liverpool and won 38 England caps. A Danish television channel has pulled himfrom its coverage of United's Champions League game against Sevilla at Old Trafford on Tuesday. The girl's parents have said they do not want Carragher to be sacked,according to the Mirror,external, with the father saying: ""He seems contrite. Everyone makes mistakes, we are all human."" This video can not be played Jamie Carragher caught on camera 'spitting' from his car In the video obtained bythe Mirror,,externalLiverpudlian Carragher exchanges waves with the girl's dad. Carragher then winds down his window while the girl's dad winds down his passenger-side window. The dad can then be heard shouting: ""Unlucky Jamie lad. Two, one."" Carragher reacts by leaning out of his window and spitting towards the car, hitting the girl, who is sitting in the front passenger seat. Read more: Why is spitting so bad? Listen: Spitting the lowest of the low - Savage He apologised on Twitter on Sunday, and said he was ""goaded three/four times while being filmed"" but there was ""no excuse"". Carragher has been a regular TV pundit since his retirement from football in 2013 Speaking to the BBC on Monday, he said: ""It looks awful and I accept that. It's not something I've done before and not something I'll do again. ""It's a stain on my character and I have to accept that."" Carragher, who has two children, said he would condemn someone else had they behaved in a similar way. ""If I was watching someone do that, I'd be commenting or tweeting about it myself,"" he said. ""There's not a person in the world who can condone spitting no matter what's gone on. ""I knew there was someone else in the car, and I knew it was a female, but I didn't know it was a young girl. ""When I lost it, my rage was focused on the man across me with a camera in his hand, but no matter what he was doing my reaction was unacceptable."" This video can not be played Carragher will 'apologise again' for spitting incident Greater Manchester Police said on Monday they were not investigating the incident, and had received no complaint from the man driving the car Carragher spat at. Carragher, who said he had apologised over the phone to the family involved, said he would accept any consequences. He said: ""I'm in no position to question or disagree if someone wants to have a pop or the police want to speak to me. I've done a bad thing and have to accept whatever comes my way. ""I'm upset for them, my family and everyone involved. It's been something we all could have done without but all I can do now is apologise."" Asked if he had explained the incident to his family yet, Carragher said he had not as he had travelled down to London early on Monday. ""They will be aware of the media storm,"" he said. ""I've let my family down but I've let the family in the car opposite me down. They're my main worry for yesterday and today. ""That family won't be used to the media storm and being dragged into it. ""I got in touch with them last night and today is about going public and apologising to the family and the public watching who were offended and rightly so."" Sky's statement did not say how long Carragher's suspension would last. Asked about his future with the company, he said: ""We've met up today and it was about finding out the facts. ""They're disappointed I've dragged their name through the mud. That's not what they're about and I've let them down big time. ""I love my job and would love the opportunity to stay. ""Hopefully I'll be judged not right now but over a longer period of time and this incident won't cloud all of it but it's a big incident and it won't go away."" Carragher was due to act as a pundit for Danish television channel TV3 Sport - which is part of the Modern Times Group media company - on Tuesday. MTG Sport executive vice-president Peter Norrelund said his company had sent an employee to speak to Carragher before deciding what further action to take. ""I want to listen to his version,"" he said. ""With the impact of the story there was no need to send him to Old Trafford for the game."" Former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville works alongside Carragher for Sky Sports, and believes his colleague should keep his role. ""I've just watched Jamie Carragher say sorry,""he said.,external""No excuses, he's made a big mistake. ""He's massively passionate about football and he's overstepped the mark and shouldn't have reacted. ""I've been on TV for three years with him and, in my opinion, this isolated incident shouldn't stop us working together."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch said Carragher's behaviour was ""disgusting"" and Sky Sports were right to suspend him. ""I think spitting is disgusting full stop,"" she said at the Checkatrade EFL Community Club of the Year Awards. ""I think it's right Sky Sports have taken the action. ""I know he's apologised, he's right to apologise, it was absolutely disgusting. ""He has said himself he's a father and he wouldn't be happy with someone spitting at his daughter.

Deal struck in university pensions row,"University staff will decide on Tuesday whether to back the deal announced by unions and employers An agreement has been reached by university union leaders and employers to end the strike over pension cuts. But there have been calls from some strikers to turn down the deal and push for a more ""decisive victory"". If the deal is backed by union representatives meeting on Tuesday, the strike will be suspended. The agreement would mean a new, independent re-evaluation of the pension deficit and temporary arrangements to tackle the funding gap. But an open letter has called the agreement ""completely unacceptable"" and wants university staff to reject the deal reached by the University and College Union's negotiators. Now in its fourth week, the strike has seen classes cancelled in more than 60 universities, with the threat of disruption for end-of-year exams and assessments. The universities minister Sam Gyimah had called for students to be given refunds on fees for lost teaching time. On Monday evening an agreement was announced by the UCU and Universities UK, after talks at the Acas conciliation service. The disputed changes to pensions would be put on hold - and a temporary deal would tackle the deficit, with talks to re-open on long-term pension arrangements from 2020. There would also be an independent re-evaluation of the size of the pension scheme's deficit. The agreement also indicates that universities would be expected to re-schedule classes disrupted by the strike. UCU representatives will meet on Tuesday - and if the deal is accepted, the strike will be suspended from Wednesday. But there have been calls on social media for university staff to reject the deal announced by their union's leadership. An open letter opposing the deal says that it is only postponing long-term decisions about the pension scheme and says university staff should continue to campaign to ""force a more decisive victory"". Universities UK has asked university vice chancellors to say whether they will back the deal by Wednesday afternoon. It seems likely that many university heads would support the deal agreed with the union. But the university representative body has told vice chancellors that if the agreement is not accepted the previous pensions proposal would be reinstated, with the ""likely outcome"" that there would be more strikes in April and May.

Teen jailed for string of acid attacks,"This video can not be played Derryck John was arrested after the stolen moped he was riding crashed A 17-year-old boy has been jailed for 10 and a half years for attacking six moped riders with acid while trying to steal their bikes. Derryck John, from Croydon, previously admitted carrying out the attacks in the north and east of London on 13 July last year. He sprayed the riders in the face with a noxious liquid, stole two mopeds and attempted to take another four. One of the victims was left with ""life-changing injuries"", police said. Judge Noel Lucas QC described John's ""grave crimes"" against members of the public as ""despicable and cowardly"". Derryck John appeared at Wood Green Crown Court via video-link Emergency crews and other moped drivers went to help John's victims on 13 July John appeared via video-link at Wood Green Crown Court where he previously pleaded guilty to 12 offences. These included six counts of throwing a corrosive liquid with intent to disable, burn, maim, disfigure or cause grievous bodily harm, two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted robbery. At the time Judge Lucas lifted restrictions identifying the teenager, saying there was an ""overwhelming, huge public interest"" in doing so. The substance used in the attacks was thought to have had a pH of one or two, an acidity level similar to battery acid. 21:30 - Liquid is splashed in the face of a 69-year-old moped driver at the junction of Penny Brookes Street and De Coubertin Street in Stratford. The victim flees but is chased by John and his accomplice along several streets before he is able to get away 22:25 - A 32-year-old man suffers injuries to his face and has his moped stolen after he is attacked on Hackney Road in Haggerston 22:49 - Acid is sprayed in the face of a 44-year-old moped rider on St Paul's Road in Islington. The attackers leave the scene empty handed 23:05 - A 52-year-old man is attacked on Shoreditch High Street. John and his accomplice fail to take his moped 23:18 - Police are called to Cazenove Road in Upper Clapton after a 24-year-old man has acid thrown on him, but again nothing is stolen 23:37 - A 33-year-old man is attacked and has his moped stolen as he waits in traffic on Chatsworth Road in Lower Clapton The judge told John that had he been sentencing him as an adult and had he been convicted after a trial as opposed to having pleaded guilty, the sentence would have been 22 years' imprisonment. Jabed Hussain, who suffered facial burns and breathing problems after he was attacked by John, said he had become a ""totally different"" person and was unable to return to work. He called for tougher sentences for people who carry out acid attacks and said he had written to the home secretary to review the law. CCTV images of John visiting a petrol station were ""key to his identification and conviction"", the Crown Prosecution Service said. John was filmed with an accomplice (right), who has never been found The judge said it was ""the second major corrosive fluid case"" he had dealt with ""in the past three months"". He had previously overseen theArthur Collins nightclub attack trial. ""It is clear to me that the carrying and use of corrosive liquids is rapidly becoming a serious and growing problem in London and in particular, in this part of London,"" he said. Ramesh Patel, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""One of the victims has lost 30 per cent of his eyesight which he will never recover. ""Others described searing pain and burning at the time and have been forced to leave their jobs as a result of their injuries. ""Had they not been wearing helmets their injuries could have been much more serious,"" he said. A second person who was captured on CCTV carrying out the attacks with John has never been found. Scotland Yard said the moped driver was wearing dark clothing and a black helmet and appealed for anybody with information to contact them.

Millennial railcard to launch nationwide,"A nationwide trial of the so-called millennial railcard begins on Tuesday but card numbers will be limited. The one-year railcard for 26 to 30-year-olds will cost Â£30 and offer a third off most fares in England, Wales and Scotland. Only 10,000 will be released - enough for one in 500 of the eligible population - and the cost of some peak time travel will not be reduced. The nationwide launch follows a trial across the Greater Anglia network. Another 10,000 railcards were sold during that trial. The new discount card was announced in Chancellor Philip Hammond's Budget in November, but receiveda mixed responsefrom its target audience. Railcards were first introduced as a way for train companies to help fill seats during off-peak times. The card for 16 to 25-year-olds has existed in one form or another since 1974. Anyone applying for the railcard will need to pay by card, have a proof of age, either through a driving licence or passport, and have a digital, passport-style photo. BBC Business has set up a new UK Facebook group all about affordable living. From tuition fees, paying off student loans, finding a job, and travelling to work to renting and saving for your first home - it is a space to share your experiences. Join theAffordable Living group here,external. Applications should be made on the26-30 railcard website,external, and holders will need to download an app before they can use the card. The discount for some during the morning commute is limited as a minimum fare of Â£12 applies to all journeys made before 10am, Monday to Friday. The Rail Delivery Group said discounts were not given on season tickets, but a weekly or monthly season ticket could still be the cheapest option for those in this age bracket who commuted frequently by train. Anthony Smith, chief executive of watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""The nationwide trial of the 26-30 railcard is welcome news for hard-pressed passengers and will help take some of the sting out of rising rail fares. ""With less than half of passengers satisfied with the value for money of their journey and even fewer young people satisfied, this will help make travelling by rail that little bit more affordable for young people.""

Civil servants rise since Brexit vote,"Thousands of extra civil servants are being employed to cope with the challenges posed by Brexit. New research carried out by the independentInstitute for Government (IFG),externalthink tank suggests that in some key departments, six years of austerity cuts have been reversed in less than two years since the Brexit referendum took place. The cost of getting the civil service ready for Brexit runs into billions of pounds. Brexit was always going to mean a massive workload for the civil service - not only in negotiating the UK's departure, but also in setting up new systems that will run independently of the EU in the future. Now we're beginning to see what that means in practice. Two new departments have been created since the referendum - the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) and the Department for International Trade (DIT). Between them they have about 1,500 staff devoted exclusively to Brexit. Some of them have transferred from elsewhere in the civil service - but that means other jobs have to be filled or other work isn't being done. At the time of the EU referendum, after years of austerity, the civil service was at its smallest since World War Two - and 20% smaller than it was when the coalition government took office in 2010. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, in 2010 there were 527,500 civil servants. By 2016 that number had fallen to 418,300. But in key departments dealing with Brexit, those staff reductions have largely been reversed. The numbers are most striking in the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) - the IFG says its headcount has increased by 65% since the referendum. By the end of this month Defra is due to have taken on an extra 1,200 people working directly on Brexit, as it seeks to replace the EU's Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies. Now comparisons are not exact, but let's look at the European Commission in Brussels. It employs 1,657 staff in three departments dealing with agriculture, fisheries and the environment - but that's for all 28 countries including the UK. Elsewhere in the UK civil service, the Home Office is planning to have hired an extra 1,500 Brexit staff by September, and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) between 3,000 and 5,000 extra staff by this time next year. Both these departments, and Defra, are seeing staffing levels return to pre-2010 levels. There's also been a big increase in agency staff and consultants working for the civil service - the Home Office for example is now employing 50% more agency staff than it was in the year before the referendum took place. As for the cost the IFG says its conservative estimate is that getting the civil service ready for Brexit will have cost as much as Â£2bn by the time the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year. The Treasury says that has already been budgeted for. But it's worth remembering the extra civil service spending would be on top of the divorce bill with the EU which the government says will be up to Â£39bn, but could be even higher. When asked by Reality Check about the numbers, the Treasury said it wants an orderly exit from the EU. ""The government is committed to ensuring that the right skills and resources are available to deliver a successful Brexit that works for all parts of the country. ""We continue to review the capability of all departments and recruit the brightest and the best talent from the public and private sectors to unlock the benefits and opportunities of leaving the EU.""

Actress and presenter Claire Sweeney, who was a support act for Dodd in theatres when she was a teenage singer, told the BBC: ""He was such an inspiration. Ken started my career off when I was just 14."" She added: ""The most precious thing you can give someone is advice and time. And he spans generations."" Tattyfilarious: 17 of Ken Dodd's best gags Tickling sticks and tears for Doddy Comedy legend Sir Ken Dodd dies, aged 90 The TV personality said Sir Ken recently offered to give advice and help to her three-year-old son. ""He told me: 'If he's got funny bones, send him to me - I'll tell him everything he needs to know.' Sweeney starred in West End musical Chicago ""At his 90th birthday party in November, his brain was so sharp - it was such a lovely tribute to him. What a send-off in a way! ""He didn't need TV to get exposure, he used to fill out stages. He's never been seen as uncool or out of fashion."" Sweeney added that his wife Anne was a huge support to him. ""When I was 14, we were performing at the Villa Marina in the Isle of Man - Anne would take notes of the jokes he'd made at the side of the stage. Behind every successful man is a strong woman. ""She was always there, she's a wonderful lady."" Garry met his comedy hero while making a documentary about the comedian BBC radio sports presenter Garry Richardson was a huge fan of Sir Ken and got to know him while makinga documentary, which was broadcast last November. I first saw Sir Ken Dodd perform in Blackpool in 1967 when I was 10 years old. I didn't understand all his jokes, but that's where my fascination began. Quite simply, Ken Dodd loved to make people laugh, and - in my opinion - he did it better than anyone else. I was privileged to make a documentary about his life and it was broadcast just a few days before his 90th birthday. He told me some wonderful stories about his life in show business. It was his Dad, Arthur, who introduced him to comedy. Ken worked as a door to door salesman selling buckets, pans, polish, soap powder etc and he told me that's where his "" real rapport with audiences first began."" He said: ""I would knock on the door and say ""Good morning, madam"", and the rest is history. By day he was a salesman and by night he was working as a part time comedian, performing at social clubs and working men's clubs. ""It was a great place to learn the trade,"" he pointed out in our chat. Ken made his BBC radio debut on 23 December 1954, and described it to me as ""frightening"". No recordings of that show exist, but I managed to get a copy of his script from the BBC archives. I asked Ken whether he could remember any of the jokes. ""No, of course not,"" he said. ""It was 64 years ago!""  I said: ""Well, I'm going to read a joke and see if you can do the punch line."" I read the joke and as quick as a flash Ken came back with the punch line. ""You remembered,"" I said. "" Yes,"" he replied ""I did the gag last week in Torquay."" As he pointed out, it was funny  60 years ago and its still funny now. The week before the I met him for the recording, I went to see him at one of his shows. The duration of each performance is legendary. On this particular night, he came on stage at seven o'clock and finished shortly after midnight. He was brilliant, and got a standing ovation from 1,700 people. I went backstage to meet him to confirm our arrangements for the interview. I was very conscious that he still had to travel over 200 miles home, but incredibly he was keen to tell me more jokes. It was just me and him in the dressing room. Minutes earlier, he had received a standing ovation. Now, he had an audience of one. I asked him in our interview why he had told me more jokes and he simply said: ""I love to make people laugh, and you were my audience."" I asked Sir Ken Dodd at the end of our interview how he would like to be remembered, and he simply said: ""If you want my epitaph - 'He tried and did his best.'"" Having watched him perform for over 50 years, I can say I thought he was the best. Sir Ken enjoyed a varied career Fellow Liverpudlian comic Tom O'Connor told the BBC: ""A great loss to entertainment. I feel sorry for any up-and-coming comedian who'll never have a chance of seeing his brilliance at work."" John Bishop, another Liverpool comedian,wrote on Instagram,external: ""True comedy legend. RIP Sir Ken Dodd."" Obituary: Ken Dodd Sir Ken's career in pictures 'Don't call me eccentric' BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker was also a big fan, commenting: ""Growing up I used to love it when Ken Dodd came on the telly. He was always mad and chaotic but he guaranteed a laugh. Sir Ken presented an award at the National Television Awards in January ""There were so many strings to his bow. Comedian, ventriloquist and - amazingly - in the 1960s his single Tears was the third highest-selling song in the UK. It was only outsold by two tunes from The Beatles! ""A cameraman friend tells a story about doing an interview with Ken many years ago. At the end, Mr Dodd put something in his top pocket and tapped it saying 'Thanks for that, have a drink on me'. It was a tea bag!"" Great British Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig said of Sir Ken: ""Best dinner companion I ever sat next to."" Allow Twitter content?

Microplastics are 'littering' riverbeds,"This video can not be played Watch: A look under the microscope to discover the hidden microplastics lurking in our waters Microscopic plastic beads, fragments and fibres are littering riverbeds across the UK - from rural streams to urban waterways. This is according to a study that analysed sediments from rivers in north-west England. Scientists from the University of Manchester tested river sediments at 40 sites throughout Greater Manchester and found ""microplastics everywhere"". There is evidence that such small particles can enter the food chain. Plastic microbeads, like these recovered from the River Mersey, are now banned in cosmetics in the UK The findings,published in the journal Nature Geoscience,external, are the first from a ""systematic basin-wide"" study, the researchers say. In a first round of tests, just one of the sites - in the upper reaches of the River Goyt, which is one of the tributaries of the River Mersey - contained no plastic. But when the researchers returned to that site to repeat their test, that area had become contaminated. ""I think that it is likely that there are even higher concentrations in some of the large rivers passing through global megacities,"" said lead researcher Dr Rachel Hurley. ""We just need to get out there and see. We still don't know the full scale of the microplastic problem,"" she told BBC News. ""Wherever you have people and industry, you will have high levels of microplastic,"" added Prof Jamie Woodward, from Manchester University's School of Geography. Some parts of the River Tame contained more than half a million plastic particles per square metre of riverbed To analyse river sediments, researchers isolated patches of riverbed and measured the concentration within those patches. Some urban ""hotspots"" contained hundreds of thousands of plastic particles per square metre. This included a site at the River Tame in Denton - a downstream, suburban stretch of river - that contained more than half a million plastic particles per square metre. ""According to our literature search on microplastics in the ocean, in sediments on beaches, in lakes - and the small amount of data on rivers elsewhere - this is currently the highest concentration found anywhere,"" said Prof Woodward. The scientists now want to investigate the specific sources of the plastic fibres, microbeads and fragments they found. One recent study in the US linked wastewater treatment plants with the release of plastic into the environment,external. And the scientists think that wastewater is likely to make a large contribution - particularly of microfibres from synthetic clothing and microbeads. ""We welcomed the ban on microbeads in personal care products introduced earlier this year,"" said Prof Woodward. ""And we want to monitor the effect of that ban. ""But microbeads are also used in industrial processes - in the moulding of larger plastic products. So there are likely to be multiple sources. ""In urban environments, microplastics may come from wastewater and sewer systems, from plastic litter that is broken up and fragmented, and even from the air. Sources may not be active all of the time, so they are difficult to track - but we are working on it!"" said Dr Hurley. Even rural stream beds are contaminated with microplastics The researchers gathered their first set of samples prior to the winter floods of 2015 and 2016. That extreme flooding was particularly severe in their river system - when weeks of heavy rain wreaked havoc in northern England, Northern Ireland and parts of Wales. The team returned to the sites to see if the levels of plastic had changed. This revealed that the floods had ""flushed out"" approximately 70% of the microplastics stored in these riverbeds, equivalent to almost a tonne of plastic, or nearly 50 billion particles. It also eradicated microbead contamination at seven sites. So the rivers are able to ""cleanse themselves"", the researchers explained. But, as Prof Woodward pointed out, ""all of that will ultimately end up in the ocean"". Dr James Rothwell added that, since many of the particles this study detected were so small, they would simply slip through the filtration nets that are used, as standard, to sift microplastics out of the ocean. ""The implications of that are that we might well be underestimating by several orders of magnitude how much microplastic is in the oceans that has been delivered by rivers - flushed out during flood events,"" he said.

Row over Corbyn spy response,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn urges action - but criticises the Tories for taking donations from ""Russian oligarchs"" A row has erupted over Jeremy Corbyn's response to Theresa May's latest statement on the poisoning of a former Russian spy. He said the attack had ""appalled the country"" and urged decisive action afterthe PM told the Commons it was ""highly likely "" Russia was to blame. But the Labour leader also criticised the Conservatives for accepting donations from ""Russian oligarchs"". Tory MPs accused him of trying to score political points. Some Labour MPs also suggested he had misjudged his response, urging MPs on all sides to get behind Theresa May. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital following the attack in Salisbury on 4 March. Mr Corbyn told MPs: ""We need to continue seeking a robust dialogue with Russia on all the issues dividing our countries, both domestic and international - rather than simply cutting off contact and simply letting tensions and divisions get worse, and potentially even more dangerous."" To cries of ""shame"" and ""disgrace"" from Conservative MPs, he added: ""We're all familiar with the way huge fortunes, often acquired in the most dubious circumstances in Russia, sometimes connected with criminal elements, have ended up sheltering in London and trying to buy political influence in British party politics. ""Meddling in elections, as the prime minister put it, and there has been over Â£800,000 worth of donations to the Conservative Party from Russian oligarchs and their associates."" In her reply, the prime minister said people should not ""tar with the same brush"" everyone of ""Russian extraction"" in the UK, and insisted her party complied with donation rules. This video can not be played Theresa May: Spy poisoned by ""military-grade nerve agent"" Mr Corbyn also claimed the government was resisting Labour's amendments to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, currently progressing through the House of Lords. But critics picked up on his call for ""dialogue"" with Russia and his criticism of Tory donations. Conservative MP Johnny Mercer said: ""I think I've just seen - and I look at my honourable friend opposite as I say this - the most shameful moment in this House of Commons in my time to date."" Labour former minister Chris Leslie - a party ""moderate"" who has criticised Mr Corbyn in the past - told MPs: ""There are certain circumstances, as (Mrs May) knows, that we take party political differences of opinion. ""But when our country is potentially under attack, that is just not appropriate."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fellow Labour MP John Woodcock, another Corbyn critic, drew cheers from the Tory benches after praising Mrs May's response. He said: ""It would put our national security at significant risk if we were led by anyone who did not understand the gravity of the threat which Russia poses to this nation."" Mr Woodcock told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday: ""Many of us thought Jeremy got the tone wrong yesterday, but the key moment in this is what our response will be to the set of actions announced by the prime minister tomorrow (Wednesday)."" Labour chair of the home affairs committee Yvette Cooper called for the ""whole House"" to ""come together behind"" the prime minister, to cries of ""hear hear"" from the Labour MPs around her. On Twitter, Mrs May's chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, contrasted Mr Corbyn's response to that of Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said: ""Cool heads certainly required but also a firm response. ""Russia simply cannot be allowed to launch attacks on our streets with impunity."" But supporters of Mr Corbyn, and some right-leaning commentators, defended his comments on Twitter, saying it was legitimate to raise the issue of Conservative donations, as it exposed the party's hypocrisy on the issue of Russian finance.

Accused 'blamed parents' deaths on West',"Ahmed Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing blamed Britain and America for the deaths of his parents in Iraq, the Old Bailey has heard. College lecturer Kayte Cable said Ahmed Hassan told her it was ""his duty to hate Britain"" because of what happened to his family. The court also heard he believed his father had been killed by US bombing. Mr Hassan, 18, denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. He allegedly packed a bucket with 400g (14oz) of TATP explosives and shrapnel and left it on the District Line train on 15 September 2017. It partially exploded causing a fireball to rip through a carriage during the morning rush hour, the Old Bailey has heard. Iraqi Mr Hassan arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker in October 2015. Ms Cable, a lecturer and mentor of his at Brooklands College in Weybridge, Surrey, said when he started there in April 2016 he was in ""the worst state"" she had seen a student. She said he seemed ""incredibly conflicted, frightened, confused"". Ms Cable said she could remember Mr Hassan telling her ""his father was blown up and his mother had been shot"". She said he talked about Tony Blair and events in Iraq, adding: ""I believe the anger was very clear. He referred to being angry several times."" Ms Cable recalled an occasion in August 2016 when she saw a What's App message on his phone which said: ""IS has accepted your donation."" On the same occasion, he allegedly told her: ""It's my duty to hate Britain."" This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball Ms Cable said Mr Hassan improved after finding a foster carer and was ""very clever"" - eventually being named student of the year in June 2017. However, eight days before the bombing at Parsons Green, Ms Cable said she became ""really concerned about his mental state"" when she saw him at a restaurant in Kingston, south-west London, and he told her it was better to be in Iraq. Then the day before the bombing, he came to see her bearing presents for children which she found ""strange"". The trial also heard from Barnardo's worker Youseff Habibi, who got to know Mr Hassan when he was living in a children's home in Surrey. Asked about the defendant's background, Mr Habibi told jurors: ""His father was a taxi driver and one morning he went to work and a bomb fell on him and he died. ""And his mum died when he was much younger. He said 'I don't remember my mum.'"" Prosecutor Alison Morgan asked: ""Did Mr Hassan ever say who he blamed for that?"" Mr Habibi replied: ""America. He said it was American soldiers and American army bombing."" The witness also said he once found Mr Hassan listening to an Arabic song on YouTube along the lines of ""coming to the slaughter in your own home"". The trial continues.

What is nerve agent Novichok?,"This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works The German government says Russia's opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. The most prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin was airlifted to Berlin for treatment after falling ill during a flight in Russia's Siberia region last month. He has been in a coma since. The name Novichok last made news in 2018, when Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked in the city of Salisbury in the UK. Russia has denied any role in Mr Navalny's predicament - or the Skripals' poisoning. So what do we know about this group of military-grade nerve agents? The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. They were known as fourth-generation chemical weapons and were developed under a Soviet programme codenamed Foliant. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He later defected to the US, where he published the chemical formula in his book, State Secrets. Alexei Navalny has been in a coma since the alleged attack last month In 1999,defence officials from the US travelled to Uzbekistan to help dismantle and decontaminate one of the former Soviet Union's largest chemical weapons testing facilities,external. According to Dr Mirzayanov, the Soviets used the plant to produce and test small batches of Novichok. These nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? What are nerve agents and what do they do? Some variants of Novichok are thought to be five to eight times more toxic than the VX nerve agent. ""This is a more dangerous and sophisticated agent than sarin or VX and is harder to identify,"" says Professor Gary Stephens, a pharmacology expert at the University of Reading. VX agent was the chemical used to kill the half-brother of Kim Jong-un in 2017, according to the US. Experts are divided on how long the nerve agent remains toxic. Dr Mirzayanov says it does not last for months. But Vladimir Uglev, a scientist who claims he invented the Novichok agent used in the Skripals' poisoning, says the substance is ""very stable"". Other experts say the chemicals are designed to be persistent and could last for months or years, particularly if they were kept in containers. ""They [Novichok nerve agents] don't evaporate, they don't break up in water,"" said Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London. One difficulty is that Novichok is less well studied and understood than other nerve agents, and there is no official scientific data on how long they last. While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also reported to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to transport, handle and store. Investigators working near Salisbury where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent. ""One of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list,"" says Prof Stephens. Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions would begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes. The main route of exposure is likely to be through inhalation or ingestion, though they could also be absorbed through the skin. Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. Dr Mirzayanov said the first sign to look out for was miosis, the excessive constriction of the pupils. A larger dose could cause convulsions and interrupted breathing, he said. ""[Then begins the] continuous convulsions and vomiting, and then a fatal outcome."" Dr Mirzayanov said there were antidotes - atropine and athene - that helped stop the action of the poison, but that they were not a cure. If a person is exposed to the nerve agent, their clothing should be removed and their skin washed with soap and water. Their eyes should be rinsed and they should be given oxygen. Dr Mirzayanov believes Russia had to have been behind the Skripal poisoning ""because Russia is the country that invented it, has the experience, turned it into a weapon... has fully mastered the cycle"". Russia's UN ambassador has said development work on Soviet-era nerve agents stopped in 1992, and that existing stockpiles were destroyed in 2017. In September 2017,the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed the full destruction of the 39,967 metric tons of chemical weapons possessed by Russia.,external But Novichoks were never declared to the OPCW, and the chemicals never formed part of any control regime partly because of uncertainty about their chemical structures, says Prof Alastair Hay at the University of Leeds. This video can not be played Retired Russian scientist Vladimir Uglev says he created a Novichok nerve agent. It is quite likely that some government laboratories made minute quantities and stored their characteristics in databases, so that their identity could be confirmed at a later stage if found as an unknown poison in someone's blood, he said.

Outrage as Ugandan MP says 'beat your wife',"Onesmus Twinamasiko later told the BBC slaps are ""fine"" but ""beatings which cause injuries or death"" are not. A Ugandan MP has been told to apologise to victims of domestic violence after saying men should ""beat"" their wives. Onesimus Twinamasiko said on Ugandan television channel NTV ""as a man, you need to discipline your wife. ""You need to touch her a bit, you tackle her, beat her somehow to really streamline her."" His words have met with strong criticism from social media users, with one leading women's rights group in Uganda saying he should seek therapy.

""He should do the honourable thing and withdraw that statement. It's really a shock that a member of parliament would justify violence in any way. This is about crime.""

In aninterview with BBC Focus on Africa, Mr Twinamasiko attempted to clarify his comments with reference to his own marriage, saying: ""I don't mean beatings which cause injuries or death - but a slap - I would feel fine! Because it's calling me to order. We would sit down and sort it out. ""I was slapped once by my wife and it was OK with me, because we sorted out our differences. I also slapped her once. She had wronged me."" But Ms Kagere said that Mr Twinamasiko's attitude was damaging. ""We believe there is no violent solution whatsoever. You never know how far a slap can go."" She says there are other ways to resolve conflict, including ""time out, speaking out and finding amicable solutions. ""As a couple they can go for couple's counselling,"" Ms Kagere says regarding the violence the MP describes in his own marriage. ""Many men... their own inner pride stops them from seeking our services, but we want to encourage them that it's OK to reach out for support in this matter. ""But the fact is that it is usually the man [who is the one] with power and authority who beats his wife."" She added that MPs like Mr Twinamasiko were the ""key bottlenecks"" preventing changes to marriage and divorce laws in Uganda. It appears that Mr Twinamasiko was responding to comments made last week by Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, who said men who beat their wives or girlfriends were ""cowards"".

French fashion icon Givenchy dies,"This video can not be played Watch: Some of Givenchy's most iconic designs through the decades French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, who created famous looks for Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Jackie Kennedy, has died at the age of 91. His partner Philippe Venet, a former couture designer, confirmed the news. The enduring appeal of Givenchy was showcased at this year's Oscars, where Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman wore a custom design. But the designer is best known for the ""little black dress"" worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. ""It was... an enormous help to know that I looked the part... Then the rest wasn't so tough anymore. Givenchy's lovely simple clothes [gave me] the feeling of being whoever I played,"" Hepburn said of their partnership. Audrey Hepburn's black sheath dress became a byword for elegant simplicity The friendship between Givenchy and Hepburn endured for 40 years, and helped cement his place in fashion - and cinema - history. She became his muse, and he designed her suits and woollen dresses for the musical Funny Face in 1957, and the light-hearted heist caper How to Steal a Million in 1966. Givenchy: A career in pictures The enduring appeal of Audrey Hepburn Audrey Hepburn collection up for grabs Givenchy came from an aristocratic background, and worked alongside the then unknown Pierre Balmain and Christian Dior after World War Two. He was employed by the avant-garde designer Elsa Schiaparelli before leaving to found his own fashion house in 1952. There he introduced the concept of ""separates"" - blouse, skirt, jacket and trouser combinations that could be mixed and matched. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Hubert de Givenchy was the most aristocratic of French designers, renowned for his own personal elegance and impeccable manners. He was born into a noble French family, and destined initially for the law. But at the end of World War Two, he persuaded his family to let him pursue his passion for clothes. Fame came in the 1950s, and for three decades, he dressed some of the most beautiful women in the world. He's credited with introducing the notion of separates to give women greater freedom to choose, and with being one of the first clothes designers to create his own perfume. In 1988, he sold his fashion house to the luxury brand LVMH, and a few years later he retired to a life of comfortable discretion. He came from a world of fashion which he acknowledged has now all but disappeared - an age of elegance, where clothes were created out of a unique personal relationship between client and couturier. The designer, who stood at a towering 1.98m (6ft 6in), won instant acclaim for his first collection at the age of 24. ""These dresses remind you of that first, best, glass of champagne,"" one admiring British fashion writer declared. Givenchy's friendship with Hepburn, who died in 1993, lasted for 40 years Givenchy swiftly ventured into menswear, and moved to New York to consolidate his success. There, his celebrity customers included US First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who wore one of his designs to President John F Kennedy's funeral in 1963. Screen legend Grace Kelly, who would become princess of Monaco, was another famous client. This Givenchy coat was made for Jacqueline Kennedy in 1959 In 1970, Givenchy branched out into furnishing fabrics, and designed interiors for hotels and even a Ford Continental car. A series of world-famous designers have held the creative reins at the fashion house since its founder retired in 1995. They included talented mavericks John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, and - from 2005 - Italian designer Riccardo Tisci, who introduced a more subversive aesthetic. In March 2017, Clare Waight Keller became the first woman to be named the brand's artistic director. Givenchy remains a popular choice for actors seeking awards season glamour - including Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot, who chose a gown from the label's Haute Couture collection for the 2018 Oscars. Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot in Givenchy couture at the Oscars Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman in custom Givenchy, also at the Oscars ""Hubert de Givenchy was a symbol of Parisian elegance for more than half a century,"" his label said on Monday. French business magnate Bernard Arnault, head of the luxury goods company LVMH which now owns Givenchy, called the designer ""one of the creators who put Paris at the summit of world fashion in the 1950s"". The designer had asked that his friends and admirers make a donation to the children's charity Unicef in his memory, instead of sending flowers. Allow Twitter content?

Dozens die in Kathmandu air crash,"This video can not be played Footage of the site where the US-Bangla plane came to rest A plane carrying 71 passengers and crew has crashed on landing at Nepal's Kathmandu airport, killing 49 people, according to police. Rescuers pulled bodies from the charred wreckage of the plane, operated by Bangladeshi airline US-Bangla, after a raging fire was put out. The airline has blamed air traffic control, but the airport says the plane approached from the wrong direction. Flight BS211 veered off the runway while landing on Monday afternoon. The exact cause of the crash remains unclear and Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli promised an immediate investigation. However, a recording of the conversation between the pilot and air traffic control minutes before the plane crashed suggests some misunderstanding over which end of the sole runway the plane was cleared to land on. Air disasters timeline Moments before the plane crash-landed, an air traffic controller is heard in the recording obtained by the BBC from air traffic monitor LiveATC telling the pilot: ""I say again, turn!"" Twenty-two people are being treated in hospital for injuries, police spokesperson Manoj Neupane told the BBC's Nepali service. The plane, which was flying from the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop and was 17 years old. The plane landed at 14:20 local time (08:35 GMT),according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24,external. A survivor said the plane had begun to behave strangely as it approached Kathmandu ""The aircraft was permitted to land from the southern side of the runway flying over Koteshwor, but it landed from the northern side,"" Sanjiv Gautam, director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. ""We are yet to ascertain the reason behind the unusual landing."" However, US-Bangla Airlines chief executive Imran Asif blamed Kathmandu air traffic control. ""There were wrong directions from the tower. Our pilot was not at fault,"" he told reporters at his office in Dhaka. ""Our pilot is an instructor of this Bombardier aircraft. His flight hours are over 5,000. There was a fumble from the control tower."" Airport general manager Raj Kumar Chettri told Reuters news agency that the plane hit the airport fence before touching ground. ""The plane should have come from the right direction,"" he said. Basanta Bohora, who escaped the plane, is recovering in hospital One of the survivors, Nepalese travel agent Basanta Bohora, described from his hospital bed what he had experienced. After a normal take-off from Dhaka, the plane had begun to behave strangely as it approached Kathmandu, he said. ""All of a sudden the plane shook violently and there was a loud bang afterwards,"",externalhe was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. ""I was seated near the window and was able to break out of the window,"" he added. ""I have no recollection after I got out of the plane, someone took me to Sinamangal hospital, and from there my friends brought me to Norvic [hospital]. I have injuries to my head and legs, but I am fortunate that I survived."" The plane was carrying 67 passengers and four crew. It is now known that 33 of the passengers were Nepalis, 32 were Bangladeshi, one was Chinese and one was from the Maldives. Among the 22 people injured, some are in a critical condition. An airline worker said he saw two or three people fall or jump from the windows of the burning plane. Its airline companies are banned from flying within the European Union. The plane reportedly hit a fence before touching down and crashing There have been many aviation incidents in Nepal, but this is the deadliest since a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed on approach in September 1992, killing all 167 on board. Earlier that same year, a Thai Airways plane crashed near the airport, leaving 113 people dead. Pilots say that landing at Kathmandu airport can be challenging because of the mountainous landscape. Recent aviation incidents in Nepal include: February 2016:Twenty-three people were killed when a small passenger plane crashed in mountainous western Nepal March 2015:Lucky escape for passengers after plane skids off runway in fog in Kathmandu February 2014: Bodies of all 18 people recovered after small plane crashes in western Nepal September 2012:Plane heading for Everest region crashes on the outskirts of Kathmandu, killing all 19 on board May 2012: Fifteen people die when a plane carrying Indian pilgrims crashes in northern Nepal September 2010:Sightseeing flight crashes into a hillside near Kathmandu September 2006:All 24 people on board a WWF helicopter die when it crashes in eastern Nepal The carrier launched in July 2014 and its slogan is ""Fly Fast, Fly Safe"". Its first international flight was in May 2016 - to Kathmandu. It now flies to airports in South and South East Asia and the Middle East.

"Panda breeding programme suspendedEdinburgh Zoo's Tian Tian and Yang Guang will not be bred this year, the BBC Scotland news website has learned.6m6 minutes agoEdinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","This video can not be played Giant panda breeding programme at Edinburgh Zoo suspended The giant panda breeding programme at Edinburgh Zoo has been suspended following years of failed attempts. Tian Tian and Yang Guang will not attempt to breed this year, the BBC Scotland news website has been told. Tian Tian has failed to produce a cub six times since moving to the Scottish zoo in 2011. Zoo officials said they wanted to make ""some enhancements to our giant panda enclosure"" before attempting future breeding. Tian Tian has failed to produce a cub since moving to Edinburgh Zoo in 2011 An Edinburgh Zoo spokeswoman said: ""We will not attempt to breed our giant pandas this year because we want to further assess the incredibly complex and unpredictable breeding process. ""This pause, which is supported by our giant panda team and other key specialists, will allow us further time to consider the scientific data, our own experiences and those of colleagues around the world, including the latest thinking on giant panda accommodation. ""In the meantime, the pause will also enable us to make some enhancements to our giant panda enclosure which would not have been practical either during or between breeding seasons.

Libby Anderson, animal welfare charity OneKind, said: ""OneKind is pleased to hear that the attempts to breed a cub in Edinburgh have been put on hold, and that the pandas will not be subjected to invasive artificial insemination procedures again this year. ""OneKind is opposed to breeding wild animals in captivity and we have always believed it was misguided to make repeated attempts to breed more captive pandas in Scotland. ""These individuals will never return to the wild, or improve protection for the wild population in their native habitat.

"Feed birds, but be aware of risks - scientists","Scientists are warning of the risks of wild birds spreading diseases when they gather at feeders in gardens. Experts led byZoological Society of London,externalsay people should continue to feed birds, especially in winter, but should be aware of the risks. If birds look sick, food should be withdrawn temporarily, they say. The review of 25 years' worth of data identified emerging threats to garden birds. Finches, doves and pigeons are vulnerable to a parasite infection. Meanwhile, a form of bird pox is becoming more common, causing warty-like lumps on the bodies of great tits and other birds. Other disease threats, such as salmonella, appear to be declining. ""Our study shows how three of the most common diseases that affect British garden birds have changed both dramatically and unpredictably over the past decade, both in terms of the species they affect and their patterns of occurrence,"" said Dr Becki Lawson from ZSL's Institute of Zoology. Common signs that a wild bird is ill include unusually fluffed-up plumage and lethargy. Diseases can be spread through droppings or regurgitated food around bird feeders. Finding out more about the changing pattern of diseases will help to ensure that garden birds can be fed safely, say the researchers. ZSL, working with experts from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), say people who notice sick birds should take practical steps to minimise risks: Report their observations to theGarden Wildlife Health Project,external Seek advice from a vet Withdraw food for a while to let birds disperse over a wider area Feed birds in moderation, clean bird feeders regularly, and rotate feeding sites. Co-researcher Kate Risely from the BTO said anyone who feeds wild birds should be aware of their responsibilities for preventing disease. She told BBC News: ""Be very vigilant - enjoy feeding the birds but educate yourself about what the risks are and what to do if you see signs of disease."" It was important to continue to feed wild birds, especially in winter, when they need lots of food to survive, she said. The review of evidence is published in the journal,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B,external. It found that patterns of infection in wild birds are changing. This may be influenced by wild birds congregating at bird feeders and coming into contact with species they don't encounter naturally in the wild. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Thanks for all the laughs."" Sir Ken's colourful tickling sticks were always a part of his show Sir Ken had been a comedian since 1954 and was born the son of a coal merchant in 1927. In the 1960s, he made it into the Guinness Book of Records for telling 1,500 jokes in three and a half hours. After making his name in the music halls, his career in television and radio took off, as he brought national appeal to his regional, perhaps parochial humour. He was a chart-topping singer too: his signature tune Happiness was released in 1964 and his single Tears was the third highest-selling song of the 1960s in Britain, beaten only by two Beatles singles. Sir Ken met Anne when she appeared in the Ken Dodd Christmas Show at the Manchester Opera House in 1961. Sir Ken, pictured with his wife Anne Jones, received a knighthood at Buckingham Palace in 2017 Reverend Julia Jesson said when she moved to Sir Ken's local church - St John's in Knotty Ash - her former parishioners were very amused when they found who one of her flock would be.

He was the perfect pick-me-up: daft, irrepressible, funny and silly in equal measure. We were all reduced to helpless, crying-with-laughter wrecks. Bravo! #legend."" Sir Ken made his first professional appearance in 1954 at the Theatre Royal, Stockport, but it would be another decade before he made his West End debut, topping the bill at the London Palladium. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, he was a regular face on TV and worked to a punishing schedule, which he kept throughout his career, seldom taking a holiday. He was famous for his wild hair, buck teeth, Diddymen and infamous ""tickling stick"" But in 1989 Sir Ken faced the possibility of a fall from grace when he was charged with eight counts of tax fraud spanning 15 years and involving more than Â£800,000. He was later acquitted after a 23-day trial, but the court heard a range of stories about his eccentricity, including hiding more than Â£300,000 in wardrobes, cupboards and under stairs. Taking up his career again on his acquittal, Sir Ken enjoyed another season at the London Palladium in 1990 and won a British Comedy Lifetime Achievement Award as well as being voted Top Variety Performer in 1993. In 2011, he unveiled a ""Comedy Carpet"" featuring the catchphrases, jokes and names of more than 1,000 comedians at the foot of Blackpool Tower. Allow Twitter content?

French fashion icon Givenchy dies aged 91,"This video can not be played Watch: Some of Givenchy's most iconic designs through the decades French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, who created famous looks for Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Jackie Kennedy, has died at the age of 91. His partner Philippe Venet, a former couture designer, confirmed the news. The enduring appeal of Givenchy was showcased at this year's Oscars, where Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman wore a custom design. But the designer is best known for the ""little black dress"" worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. ""It was... an enormous help to know that I looked the part... Then the rest wasn't so tough anymore. Givenchy's lovely simple clothes [gave me] the feeling of being whoever I played,"" Hepburn said of their partnership. Audrey Hepburn's black sheath dress became a byword for elegant simplicity The friendship between Givenchy and Hepburn endured for 40 years, and helped cement his place in fashion - and cinema - history. She became his muse, and he designed her suits and woollen dresses for the musical Funny Face in 1957, and the light-hearted heist caper How to Steal a Million in 1966. Givenchy: A career in pictures The enduring appeal of Audrey Hepburn Audrey Hepburn collection up for grabs Givenchy came from an aristocratic background, and worked alongside the then unknown Pierre Balmain and Christian Dior after World War Two. He was employed by the avant-garde designer Elsa Schiaparelli before leaving to found his own fashion house in 1952. There he introduced the concept of ""separates"" - blouse, skirt, jacket and trouser combinations that could be mixed and matched. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Hubert de Givenchy was the most aristocratic of French designers, renowned for his own personal elegance and impeccable manners. He was born into a noble French family, and destined initially for the law. But at the end of World War Two, he persuaded his family to let him pursue his passion for clothes. Fame came in the 1950s, and for three decades, he dressed some of the most beautiful women in the world. He's credited with introducing the notion of separates to give women greater freedom to choose, and with being one of the first clothes designers to create his own perfume. In 1988, he sold his fashion house to the luxury brand LVMH, and a few years later he retired to a life of comfortable discretion. He came from a world of fashion which he acknowledged has now all but disappeared - an age of elegance, where clothes were created out of a unique personal relationship between client and couturier. The designer, who stood at a towering 1.98m (6ft 6in), won instant acclaim for his first collection at the age of 24. ""These dresses remind you of that first, best, glass of champagne,"" one admiring British fashion writer declared. Givenchy's friendship with Hepburn, who died in 1993, lasted for 40 years Givenchy swiftly ventured into menswear, and moved to New York to consolidate his success. There, his celebrity customers included US First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who wore one of his designs to President John F Kennedy's funeral in 1963. Screen legend Grace Kelly, who would become princess of Monaco, was another famous client. This Givenchy coat was made for Jacqueline Kennedy in 1959 In 1970, Givenchy branched out into furnishing fabrics, and designed interiors for hotels and even a Ford Continental car. A series of world-famous designers have held the creative reins at the fashion house since its founder retired in 1995. They included talented mavericks John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, and - from 2005 - Italian designer Riccardo Tisci, who introduced a more subversive aesthetic. In March 2017, Clare Waight Keller became the first woman to be named the brand's artistic director. Givenchy remains a popular choice for actors seeking awards season glamour - including Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot, who chose a gown from the label's Haute Couture collection for the 2018 Oscars. Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot in Givenchy couture at the Oscars Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman in custom Givenchy, also at the Oscars ""Hubert de Givenchy was a symbol of Parisian elegance for more than half a century,"" his label said on Monday. French business magnate Bernard Arnault, head of the luxury goods company LVMH which now owns Givenchy, called the designer ""one of the creators who put Paris at the summit of world fashion in the 1950s"". The designer had asked that his friends and admirers make a donation to the children's charity Unicef in his memory, instead of sending flowers. Allow Twitter content?

Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister Theresa May were all at the service. The Duke of Edinburgh, who retired from public service last year, did not attend. The Queen, who is head of the Commonwealth, said: ""Through exchanging ideas, and seeing life from other perspectives, we grow in understanding and work more collaboratively towards a common future. ""There is a very special value in the insights we gain through the Commonwealth connection; shared inheritances help us overcome difference so that diversity is a cause for celebration rather than division.""

Teach children positives of no sex â Church,"Schools should promote celibacy and abstinence as ""positive life choices"", the Church of England says. The act of refraining from sexual activity is part of the Church's advice for sex education lessons. In a blog post,external, it also says pupils should be taught the importance of ""trust, loyalty and fidelity"" in relationships. Sex and relationships education was made compulsory in secondary schools in England last year. The Church of England believes marriage is ""the perfect context"" for any form of sexual expression. The blog, written by the Church's chief education officer, the Rev Nigel Genders, follows the Church's response to a government consultation on relationships and sex education. He said its guidelines stem from an understanding that healthy relationships and sex are ""good gifts from God and should bring joy"". Is it even possible to live a celibate life? The people who practice celibacy Young mums: Sex ed 'must cover respect' The Church believes that the role of relationships and sex education should ensure children will thrive within relationships ""of all kinds"". Rev Genders said: ""It should give children accurate information to equip them for life in the modern world and make sure they are not harmed or negatively influenced by unrealistic or dangerous materials and expectations."" Schools will be encouraged to reflect their own values but are warned to be mindful of the community, including the context of belief, faith, religion and culture. Rev Genders said schools have a ""vital role"" alongside parents to aid children's understanding. ""Taking that responsibility seriously means we are not prepared to leave their development to the distorted representations of sex and relationships that are just a few clicks away on their phones and computers, but will actively promote staying safe, developing healthy relationships, and protecting self-esteem and good mental health,"" he added. Rev Genders' comments come after a government consultation on what should be included in the teaching of sex education after the Department for Education said current guidelines were ""out of date"". There have been concerns that issues such as cyber-bullying, sexting and online safety were not being addressed in the advice. The Church has responded to the consultation,externalby highlighting the importance of healthy relationships, respecting others and sexuality. Last year, it issued guidance about transphobic and bullyingto schools. The advice said primary schoolchildren should be free to explore ""who they might be"" without comment from teachers or other pupils. The sexual health charity, FPA, says it is ""vital"" young people are given accurate information to promote healthy relationships and help them choose when and whether to have sex. Its policy and public affairs manager, Emily James, said: ""To be effective, it must be driven by what young people want and need, and is most successful when young people can relate to what they are taught and are offered lessons that are inclusive, positive and non-stigmatising.""

'Disabled women are human tooâ,"South Korea was celebrated for the way it hosted the Winter Olympics, but in the first edition of its volunteer handbook, published in January, it felt it necessary to remind volunteers, known as the Passion Crew, that ""a female disabled is also a female human being"". So is it ready to host the Paralympics? South Korea is famed for its technology and fast-pace, its difficult relationship with North Korea and of course K-Pop which burst on to the Western music scene with Gangnam Style. But it hasn't always been as forward-thinking when it comes to women, especially if they're disabled. ""Women could never be heroes,"" travel writer, Seoul-dweller and disability campaigner Seyoon Jane Hong, 30, says. ""Until the 20th Century, everything was male-centred. ""Even now if you are young, you may experience unfairness. When you're a woman, oppression is added. And if there is a disability, it is triple discrimination."" K-pop star Psy performing his global hit Gangnam Style It's something she and her friends face, but the country is in flux - divided by age, gender and ability - perhaps not too dissimilar to the UK. ""Baby Boomers and the older generation give more value to economic development than human rights, peace and equality,"" she says. ""To them, disabled people are patients who need help. ""Younger generations, on the other hand, are much more flexible. They acknowledge that various people live together in society and regard people as important rather than economic."" Hong has been in a wheelchair for 20 years after she contracted a spinal cord virus - aged 10. She spent years confined to Seoul, South Korea's capital, until she decided to travel alone when the first accessible express train, KTX was completed. She felt liberation and wanderlust - emotions that had never been experienced by disabled people older than her. Hong recalls elderly women telling her how their lives were stunted by the perception of their disability. They were dehumanised - forced to marry older men, or unsuitable disabled men, because remaining single was unacceptable. ""They have not been recognised for their femininity because they may have difficulty in bearing and nurturing children,"" she says. ""They experienced repression and frustration from the people around them. There was no opportunity."" She says expectations have changed and, in 2018, there is less emphasis on marriage and beauty, and those with disabilities are ""free to love and get married or spontaneously stay single"". As a United Nations member, South Korea follows theUN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,external. The convention includes the equal rights of women and children who are disabled. Since the 1990s, disabled children have attended mainstream school. Hong is young enough to have benefitted from this inclusive step forward, although she says her own experience was challenging. ""If the teacher had a strong understanding of the disability, it was easy to participate in the class. But if not, it was difficult."" Preconceptions have started to change, with talks and outreach programmes in place. There are many disabled students at university although youth unemployment is high and, for those with disabilities, it's even worse. The OECD, the club of industrialised nations, says 5% of South Korea's 50 million population are registered disabled and, of those, 64.5% are unemployed according toHuman Rights Korea,external. The government has tried to combat these high figures by taxing companies Â£637 annually if they don't employ 1.5 disabled people for every 50 people they hire. But according to theMinistry of Employment and Labor,external, more than half of all companies opt to pay the fine instead. Britain doesn't have a quota system but other European countries like Germany and Austria do - and are said to have a similar pushback from employers. Those in South Korea who are unable to find work can apply for benefits through a controversial grading system based entirely on medical assessments rather than factors such as whether someone lives rurally or in the city. Hong says the money is never enough and leaves many people ""having to rely on their families"". There are some spotlight areas of progress, most noticeably in the creative sector with disabled contributors featuring more in newspapers and on TV. KBS, the state-run broadcaster, made headlines around the world in 2011 when itemployed Lee Chang-hoon as a TV news anchor. Blind presenter Lee Chang-hoon in front of TV camera Chang-hoon lost his sight as a baby but, at the age of 27, he impressed the producers with his ability to read and write scripts quickly in Braille and became the first of a number of disabled presenters. In the online world, animator Laila - who is deaf - has made her mark with popular web comic I Am Deaf, which is about living in South Korea without hearing. An enthusiastic 9.4 million people read ""webtoons"" each day and Hong describes Laila's story as ""popular with everyone"". In one of its 200 episodes, the main character is mystified when asweet potato is thrown at them,external. It turns out to be hurled by a visitor when the character doesn't hear the doorbell. Despite the bizarre storyline, people seem to relate to these skits, with one person commenting: ""I can only hear from one side of the ear, but I could already identify a lot with you, I'm learning how to understand others through you."" Hong herself is the author of Europe, There's No Reason Not to Go, a guide which documents her wheelchair travels. She is passionate that all disabled people have the chance to explore internationally and says it's a route into social participation. Seyoon Jane Hong - who has been in a wheelchair since the age of 10 - on a mountain trail But overseas travel has highlighted the accessibility challenges she still has in her own country. About 70% of buses in Seoul do not have low floors - making them inaccessible for wheelchairs. Bus companies don't want to invest in a minority, and, with its many cars and illegal street parking, Seoul is unfriendly for blind people, Hong says. This jars a little with the country's adoption of the UN Convention which ""requires"" each signatory to ""identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers and ensure that disabled people can access their environment and transportation"". The world has been focused on Pyeongchang as a Winter Olympic and Paralympic host. We think of the host venues as cities, but this is a region - with a ski resort - and it has given the country chance to showcase how far it has come. A high-speed train, suitable for wheelchairs, will shuttle spectators to the Games - and the Paralympic committee has ensured there are parking areas, ramps and accessible accommodation. One of the venues for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Paralympic Games Hong sees Pyeongchang 2018 as an opportunity for people to communicate about the global future of disability and says South Korea is ready for the Winter Paralympics. ""You do not have to speak a foreign language in this age. You can talk as you and I do with a translator. What is important is meeting people in the world who share the same values. ""I want to meet more disabled people in the world. That way, you can apply better values back to Korea, and we can distribute the great value of Korea to others."" Despite requests for a statement on the wording in the volunteer handbook, the organisers of Pyeongchang 2018, did not respond to the BBC. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said it had requested the clumsy wording be updated and said the phrase may have been lost in translation. As per the IPC's request, the webpage containing a link to the booklet was ""temporarily [taken] down for system update"" - but this has remained the case for over a month and now the games are under way.

Trump backs off on assault rifle curbs,"This video can not be played This is why US gun laws probably won't change US President Donald Trump's plan to deter school shootings does not include his repeated calls to raise the age for buying semi-automatic rifles to 21. But he is moving ahead with his controversial proposal to provide firearms training to school employees. The president tweeted that there was not much political support for raising the minimum age on weapons sales. Americans must be 18 to buy a rifle or shotgun and 21 to buy a handgun from licensed dealers under federal law. Private, unlicensed sales are federally allowed at any age for rifles and shotguns, and 18 for handguns, accordingto the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,external. Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings One mother, two school shootings The White House unveiled its proposals on Sunday night, following an attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February. This video can not be played Parkland 17: Empty desks a memorial to students killed The 19-year-old suspect - who allegedly used a legally purchased semi-automatic rifle to attack Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School - is charged with 17 counts of murder. White House officials described Sunday's plan as a fulfilment of the president's call for action after Parkland. It proposes to: Fund programmes to train school staff to use firearms Encourage military veterans and retired police officers to become teachers Improve background and mental health checks The White House said a new federal commission on school safety would examine the age limit issue.

Mr Trump tweeted on Monday: ""On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. ""States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly)."" Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who will chair the new federal commission on school safety, said the proposals were ""meaningful actions, steps that can be taken right away to help protect students"". Speaking last month, the Republican president had suggested it was a problem that Americans can legally buy semi-automatic rifles from the age of 18, yet have to wait until 21 to buy handguns. This video can not be played Would we reduce the incentive to commit a mass shooting if we refused to report the killer? ""I mean, so they buy a revolver - a handgun - they buy at the age of 21,"" he told school officials. ""And yet, these other weapons that we talk about, they're allowed to buy them at 18. ""So how does that make sense? We're going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18."" He had also accused members of his own party of being ""petrified"" of the National Rifle Association (NRA). This video can not be played Trump: 'You're afraid of the NRA' The Republican president said the NRA has ""great power over you people"", but ""less power over me"". However, Mr Trump himself came under pressure from the country's top gun lobby not to change existing legislation.

Chuck Schumer, leader of the opposition Democrats in the Senate, tweeted that the White House's action plan amounts to ""baby steps"". Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said: ""Americans expecting real leadership to prevent gun violence will be disappointed and troubled by President Trump's dangerous retreat from his promise.""

Cafe Rouge owner reports Â£60m loss,"The owner of High Street food chains Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia has posted a sharp increase in losses, as the UK restaurant sector comes under pressure. Casual Dining Group said losses to May 2017 increased 18% to Â£60m, despite a 2.2% rise in like-for-like sales. It said it had faced challenging conditions ""due to consumer confidence levels and the broader impact on discretionary spending"". The firm also said it had seen a ""significant"" rise in costs. These cost increases included: The introduction of the National Living Wage and associated increases to it and the National Minimum Wage The introduction of the Apprenticeship Levy and increased Employer's Pension Contributions Food and drink cost inflation driven by the devaluation of the pound Revaluation of business rates and rent increases, particularly in central London The Â£60m loss included an exceptional cost of Â£24.4m related to additional financing arranged during the financial year. Total sales for the year were Â£329m, up 10% due to new site openings and sales growth from existing sites. Casual Dining is one of the UK's largest restaurant groups, employing more than 10,000 people across 300 locations. The group said it had opened seven new UK sites in the past nine months, and planned further expansion, with 17 new international openings scheduled for 2018, as well as further new UK openings and refurbishments. Its chief executive Steve Richards is one of a number of restaurant bosses who have written to the Chancellor Phillip Hammond, ahead of Tuesday's Spring Statement, calling for a dedicated minister to represent the industry and to work on a plan for growth. ""Our business, along with many others operating in the hospitality sector up and down the country, is set to be saddled with inflation-busting business rate hikes next month,"" he said. And he added that ""high business rates stifle the sector's growth potential and ability to create more jobs"". What's eating the restaurant trade? Restaurants warn over 'damaging closures' Six reasons behind the High Street crisis A string of chains including Jamie's Italian and Byron have closed outlets recently amid financial difficulties. Earlier this month pizza chain Prezzo became the latest to cut back, closing 94 outlets. That amounted to about a third of its outlets and included all of its TexMex chain Chimichanga.

"Promote celibacy in schools, Church says","Schools should promote celibacy and abstinence as ""positive life choices"", the Church of England says. The act of refraining from sexual activity is part of the Church's advice for sex education lessons. In a blog post,external, it also says pupils should be taught the importance of ""trust, loyalty and fidelity"" in relationships. Sex and relationships education was made compulsory in secondary schools in England last year. The Church of England believes marriage is ""the perfect context"" for any form of sexual expression. The blog, written by the Church's chief education officer, the Rev Nigel Genders, follows the Church's response to a government consultation on relationships and sex education. He said its guidelines stem from an understanding that healthy relationships and sex are ""good gifts from God and should bring joy"". Is it even possible to live a celibate life? The people who practice celibacy Young mums: Sex ed 'must cover respect' The Church believes that the role of relationships and sex education should ensure children will thrive within relationships ""of all kinds"". Rev Genders said: ""It should give children accurate information to equip them for life in the modern world and make sure they are not harmed or negatively influenced by unrealistic or dangerous materials and expectations."" Schools will be encouraged to reflect their own values but are warned to be mindful of the community, including the context of belief, faith, religion and culture. Rev Genders said schools have a ""vital role"" alongside parents to aid children's understanding. ""Taking that responsibility seriously means we are not prepared to leave their development to the distorted representations of sex and relationships that are just a few clicks away on their phones and computers, but will actively promote staying safe, developing healthy relationships, and protecting self-esteem and good mental health,"" he added. Rev Genders' comments come after a government consultation on what should be included in the teaching of sex education after the Department for Education said current guidelines were ""out of date"". There have been concerns that issues such as cyber-bullying, sexting and online safety were not being addressed in the advice. The Church has responded to the consultation,externalby highlighting the importance of healthy relationships, respecting others and sexuality. Last year, it issued guidance about transphobic and bullyingto schools. The advice said primary schoolchildren should be free to explore ""who they might be"" without comment from teachers or other pupils. The sexual health charity, FPA, says it is ""vital"" young people are given accurate information to promote healthy relationships and help them choose when and whether to have sex. Its policy and public affairs manager, Emily James, said: ""To be effective, it must be driven by what young people want and need, and is most successful when young people can relate to what they are taught and are offered lessons that are inclusive, positive and non-stigmatising.""

Cricketer Stokes denies affray charge,"Ben Stokes arriving at court in Bristol for a previous hearing England cricketer Ben Stokes has pleaded not guilty after being accused of fighting outside a Bristol nightclub in September. The 26-year-old Durham all-rounder is charged with affray. At Bristol Crown Court on Monday, Mr Stokes denied the charges via video link from New Zealand where he is on duty with the England squad. Mr Stokes is accused jointly with Ryan Hale and Ryan Aslam Ali. Mr Hale, 26, and 28-year-old Mr Ali, both from Bristol, also deny the same charge of affray. One man is alleged to have suffered a broken eye socket in the incident. The trial date has been set for 6 August and the three defendants were granted unconditional bail. Mr Stokes, Mr Hale and Mr Ali were detained early on 25 September following a disturbance in the Clifton Triangle area of the city - several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies. The charge of affray is made under the Public Order Act 1986 and effectively relates to fighting in public. It is a triable either-way offence, which means it can be heard in either the magistrates' court or the crown court. It carries a maximum penalty when tried summarily - in the magistrates' court - of a fine or up to six months in prison, and when tried on indictment - in the crown court - of up to three years in prison. As a result of the charge, Mr Stokes missed the Ashes series, which hosts Australia won 4-0, although he was allowed to play some domestic matches in New Zealand. England declared him available once more after he indicated a plea of not guilty at Bristol Magistrates' Court in February. Ben Stokes made his Test debut in Australia in 2013 England are due to play the first test match of a five-game series against India at Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham between 1-5 August, with Mr Stokes's trial due to start a day later. The trial is expected to last between five and seven days, which means there is a risk Mr Stokes could miss the second test which starts at Lord's Cricket Ground on 9 August. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said: ""We fully respect the legal process and the player's right to defend himself against the charge."" In January the ECB said that, ""given the potential length of time to trial"", it would not be ""fair, reasonable or proportionate for Ben Stokes to remain unavailable for a further indeterminate period"".

Row as Labour MP 'forced' to stand down,"A row has erupted at the top of the Labour party as a shadow cabinet minister said she had been removed from her post against her will. On Sunday, Labour said Debbie Abrahams had stepped down as spokeswoman on work and pensions while an ""employment issue"" is investigated. But Mrs Abrahams claims that she is the victim of a ""bullying culture of the worst kind"". She rejected the allegations against her ""in the strongest possible terms"". ""I have had no details about the complaint, who it is from, the process or timescales. I have not agreed to stand aside,"" she said in a statement. ""I will fight this spurious claim and do not rule out taking legal action."" Cable denies branding Brexit voters racist Momentum chief quits Labour race Downing Street 'concern' at bullying reports Her comments followed a statement issued by the party which said her deputy Margaret Greenwood would replace her while an inquiry was carried out. The details of the allegations against her are not known although it is understood she believes she is being accused of bullying - a claim she denies. Mrs Abrahams said she had been victim to ""aggressive, intimidating and wholly unprofessional"" treatment by ""certain individuals in the leader's office"" over the last 10 months. Debbie Abrahams became an MP in 2010 after winning a by-election ""My treatment in the last week has shown a bullying culture of the worst kind,"" she said. ""As such I am making a formal complaint to both the Labour party and parliamentary authorities."" Mrs Abrahams became the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth in 2010. She was promoted to the shadow cabinet after last year's general election. One of Mrs Abrahams' colleagues, shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith, said it was important that Labour followed due process and that Mrs Abrahams was made ""fully aware"" of the allegations against her. ""I think what is most important is that people are able to come forward if they do feel things are not right, and to report them,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour. ""But I think until a proper investigation is held it would be very wrong to apportion blame on any side."" She added: ""I hope very much that the party taking this forward will make sure that they do a thorough investigation of all sides and all of the issues that are involved in this particular case.""

Activists disrupt Crufts grand final,"This video can not be played Moment Crufts final disrupted by Peta animal activists Intruders disrupted the live broadcast of the Crufts dog show as the top prize was awarded. Two intruders, said by Crufts to be part of animal rights group Peta, ran into the show arena at Birmingham's NEC as the winner claimed her prize. Yvette Short, from Edinburgh, grabbed two-year-old whippet Tease as the protesters were wrestled to the ground amid boos from the audience. Crufts and the NEC said security would be reviewed as ""a matter of urgency"". Midlands Live: Brain surgeon's operations 'appalling'; Search resumes for remains of missing teen mother Two-year-old whippet Tease had just been named Best in Show when the protest began A Crufts spokesperson said the intruders ""scared the dogs and put the safety of both dogs and people at risk in a hugely irresponsible way"". Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) later tweeted the footage,external, where it described Crufts as ""canine eugenics"", and said the activists were protesting against ""extreme breeding"". In a statement the animal rights group said Crufts is a ""cruel beauty pageant"" that rewards breeders ""for producing dogs with 'ideal' physical traits with little or no regard for their welfare"". The protesters were apprehended by security staff ""Breeding pedigree dogs in abnormal shapes and sizes leaves them with genetic predispositions to epilepsy, heart disease, deafness, hip dysplasia, and numerous other health problems,"" it said, citing particular problems among bulldogs and pugs. No dogs were harmed during the incident. Ms Short said she felt ""absolutely ecstatic"" following the triumph, but was scared at the time and what happened ""spoilt it a little bit"". She said: ""It wasn't necessary... they're animal lovers and the animal lovers went and scared this little animal [Tease]... I've got no sympathy for them. ""I think she was a little bit scared... she was shaking, yeah, and it was our moment, but she's recovered."" Last year,a photographer settled a two-year legal battle with Peta over a ""monkey selfie"". The group had claimed a macaque monkey called Naruto - which took the picture on David Slater's camera - was the author and owner of the image and should therefore own the copyright.

Slovak journalist murder: Minister quits,"Protesters carry signs depicting PM Robert Fico, left, and Interior Minister Robert Kalinak Slovakia's Interior Minister Robert Kalinak has resigned amid a political scandal caused by the murder of a journalist and his fiancÃ©e. Prime Minister Robert Fico is fighting to keep his government together after Mr Kalinak bowed to pressure from a coalition partner, the Most-Hid party. Another coalition party called for elections should Mr Fico lose Most-Hid's support. Jan Kuciak was investigating government corruption when he was killed. His fiancÃ©e, Martina Kusnirova, was also murdered. The killings have gripped Slovakia, leading to calls for an investigation andanti-government protests in Bratislava on Fridaywhich were thought to be the largest in the country since the fall of communism in 1989. Slovakia grapples with murdered journalist's last story Slovakia shocked by killing of journalist and partner Mr Kuciak had been working on a piece linking high-level political corruption in Slovakia with Italian mafia before he was killed. Kuciak claimed that Italian businessmen with links to the Calabrian organised crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta had settled in eastern Slovakia, and had spent years embezzling EU funds. Slovakia's President Andrej Kiska called for a ""radical reconstruction"" of the government or fresh elections last weekto restore public faith, after all seven suspects arrested in connection with the murders were released without charge. The killing of the couple has triggered calls for fresh anti-corruption demonstrations One of the men released was an Italian who had done business deals with officials close to Mr Fico. The week before, Maria Troskova, the prime minister's chief state adviser, and Viliam Jasan, the secretary of the state security council, quit amid allegations about past dealings with the man. In a joint statement, the pair denied wrongdoing. They said they were stepping down during the investigation so their names would not be used in a political battle against Mr Fico. Mr Fico, with Mr Kalinak on his right, had offered â¬1m for information about the killings Mr Fico hit back at the president, saying any changes would depend on his party, Smer-SD, and its two coalition partners. ""We won't dance on the graves of two young people, unlike opposition, media and, now, the president,"" he said. However, Mr Fico's junior coalition partner, the Most-Hid group, demanded the resignation of Mr Kalinak in exchange for continued support of Smer-SD. Critics had claimed Mr Kalinak could not ensure an impartial investigation into the murders, in his role as overseer of the police. ""It's important for stability to be maintained,"" Mr Kalinak told reporters as he announced his resignation as both interior minister and deputy PM. Most-Hid welcomed Mr Kalinak's decision to step down, although the party did not indicate whether it would be enough for the coalition to maintain its support. ""The national council always decides,"" leader Bela Bugar told reporters, saying the group has ""the final word"" in such circumstances. The party's leadership plans to meet later on Monday. The third party in the coalition, the Slovak National Party, announced after the resignation that they would want early elections should Most-Hid stop supporting Mr Fico, or if Mr Fico lost his majority in parliament.

Liverpudlian comedian John Bishop wrote on Instagram: ""True comedy legend. RIP Sir Ken Dodd."" Actor David Morrissey, who is also from Knotty Ash, tweeted: ""Ken Dodd was such an important part of my life growing up in Knotty Ash. He was a great comic and a great man. Thanks for all the laughs."" Sir Ken's colourful tickling sticks were always a part of his show Sir Ken had been a comedian since 1954 and was born the son of a coal merchant in 1927. In the 1960s, he made it into the Guinness Book of Records for telling 1,500 jokes in three and a half hours. After making his name in the music halls, his career in television and radio took off, as he brought national appeal to his regional, perhaps parochial humour. He was a chart-topping singer too: his signature tune Happiness was released in 1964 and his single Tears was the third highest-selling song of the 1960s in Britain, beaten only by two Beatles singles. Sir Ken met Anne when she appeared in the Ken Dodd Christmas Show at the Manchester Opera House in 1961. Sir Ken, pictured with his wife Anne Jones, received a knighthood at Buckingham Palace in 2017 Reverend Julia Jesson said when she moved to Sir Ken's local church - St John's in Knotty Ash - her former parishioners were very amused when they found who one of her flock would be. ""Everyone knew about Knotty Ash thanks to Ken,"" she added. ""I met him several times and I was struck by what a Godly and humble man he was.""

Fans also paid their own tributes, one wrote on Twitter: ""After my father died in 1990 we took my mother to see #KenDodd at the Palladium. He was the perfect pick-me-up: daft, irrepressible, funny and silly in equal measure. We were all reduced to helpless, crying-with-laughter wrecks. Bravo! #legend."" Sir Ken made his first professional appearance in 1954 at the Theatre Royal, Stockport, but it would be another decade before he made his West End debut, topping the bill at the London Palladium. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, he was a regular face on TV and worked to a punishing schedule, which he kept throughout his career, seldom taking a holiday. He was famous for his wild hair, buck teeth, Diddymen and infamous ""tickling stick"" But in 1989 Sir Ken faced the possibility of a fall from grace when he was charged with eight counts of tax fraud spanning 15 years and involving more than Â£800,000. He was later acquitted after a 23-day trial, but the court heard a range of stories about his eccentricity, including hiding more than Â£300,000 in wardrobes, cupboards and under stairs. Taking up his career again on his acquittal, Sir Ken enjoyed another season at the London Palladium in 1990 and won a British Comedy Lifetime Achievement Award as well as being voted Top Variety Performer in 1993. In 2011, he unveiled a ""Comedy Carpet"" featuring the catchphrases, jokes and names of more than 1,000 comedians at the foot of Blackpool Tower. Allow Twitter content?

Pressure mounts on PM over spy poisoning,"This video can not be played Vladimir Putin is challenged by the BBC over the Skripal poisoning Theresa May is facing mounting pressure to take decisive action against whoever was behind the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter. Ex-national security advisor Lord Ricketts said ""firm action"" was needed once responsibility was confirmed. Asked whether Russia was to blame, President Vladimir Putin told the BBC: ""Get to the bottom of things there, then we'll discuss this."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain in a critical but stable condition. The 66-year-old retired military intelligence officer and his daughter, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill attending the pair, remains seriously ill in hospital but has been talking to his family. What are nerve agents? Labour to boycott Russia Today - McDonnell Russian spy: What we know so far What now for the UK/Russia relationship? Police activity continued on Monday afternoon, with officers - some wearing hazardous materials suits- removing a white van from the village of Winterslow, about six miles from Salisbury. A Sainsbury's car park in Salisbury was also sealed off by police. Earlier, Mrs May chaired a National Security Council meeting, held to discuss the latest information with ministers and intelligence and military chiefs. She is due to update MPs in the Commons on the investigation shortly. Foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme evidence was mounting against Russia and he ""would be surprised if she did not point the finger at the Kremlin"". Mr Skripal was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6 in 2004, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". This video can not be played Steve Cooper was in the pub where traces of a nerve agent have been found Lord Ricketts told Today he had ""little doubt that this had come from Russia"". ""The really difficult judgement is who authorised it and why - was it some sort of rogue element or was it centrally authorised? I suppose that does have some impact on the kind of reactions that we need,"" he said. However, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to President Putin, said: ""This incident happened on British soil and it doesn't have anything to do with the Russian Federation whatsoever, let alone the president."" By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent Vladimir Putin was on the campaign trail today in southern Russia. He visited a grain centre in Krasnodar. There, I asked him: ""Is Russia behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal?"" ""We're dealing here with agriculture,"" he told me, ""to create conditions for the lives of our people. And you talk to me about some tragedies. First, get to the bottom of what happened there and then we'll discuss this."" These are President Putin's first public comments on events in Salisbury. In recent days, Moscow has complained of what it sees as an ""anti-Russian campaign"" in the British media over the poisoning of the Skripals. Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""If we get to a position when we are able to attribute this attack then we will do so and the government will deliver an appropriate response."" In aninterview with the Evening Standard,external, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was not going to ""enter into a kind of great big tit-for-tat"" with Russia ""which is what they are longing I'm sure for us to do"". But she said the UK would consider strong measures if ""a hostile state"" were found guilty of the poisoning. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday with his daughter On Sunday, up to 500 Salisbury pub-goers and diners were told to wash their possessions as a precaution after trace amounts of the substance used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found on and around a table where they had eaten in Zizzi. The table has since been destroyed. Traces were also found at the Mill pub in the city, which like Zizzi remains closed. In a statement, Zizzi said it was ""shocked and saddened by the events"" and its priority was to ensure the wellbeing of its staff and customers. Diners at its Salisbury branch with concerns are being urged to call 0345 6022698. The man at centre of spy story Poisoning poses major challenge for MI6 Theadvice to wash clothing and disinfect items such as mobile phones,externalapplies to anyone in either venue between 13:30 GMT on Sunday 4 March to closing time on Monday. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said the advice was a ""belt and braces"" measure, adding: ""I am confident none of these customers or staff will have suffered harm."" But Steve Cooper, who was at the Mill pub with his wife, told the BBC he was ""outraged"" that the instructions were not given sooner, adding: ""I'd like to know what are the long-term implications to me and my wife."" This video can not be played Prof Dame Sally Davies said the risk of harm was ""low"" Former chief medical officer for England, Sir Liam Donaldson, said he had been a ""little surprised that the communication with the public has been in such general terms and slow to get off the ground... in a situation when there are so many unknowns about the risk"". Whitehall sources have acknowledged the government will need to pay more attention to the threat of chemical warfare following the Salisbury attack. Det Sgt Nick Bailey remains in hospital Meanwhile, a man from Salisbury who breached the cordon around the bench where Mr Skripal and his daughter were found, has been jailed for 16 weeks. Father-of-three Jamie Knight, 30, who pleaded guilty to assault, criminal damage and racially aggravated public disorder, was said to have been drunk when he shouted out abusive remarks about Russians, Swindon Magistrates' Court was told.

Jail pair fired for raising safety fears,"John Bromilow (left) and Harry Wildman took their concerns to the prison governor Two maintenance workers were sacked for raising concerns about health and safetyat troubled Liverpool Prison, the BBC has learned. John Bromilow and Harry Wildman, who worked at the jail for more than 20 years, were fired by Amey who had the contract for prison repairs. Amey claimed they brought the firm into disrepute by discussing new working practices with the prison governor. But an employment tribunal ruled that the men were unfairly dismissed. The tribunal, in Liverpool on Friday, said Mr Bromilow, 66, and Mr Wildman, 64, had acted in good faith. Employment judge Jonathan Holbrook, who headed the three-person panel, added he thought it was ""extraordinary"" that Amey had not taken into account the men's 45 years of collective service and their unblemished disciplinary record. Mr Wildman, an electrician, said the ruling was a ""vindication"" of what he had been fighting for since his dismissal in November 2016. ""The whole thing has been a nightmare,"" he told BBC Radio 4's File on 4. The men had complained about changes Amey introduced to the way they carried out repair work, painting jobs and other maintenance tasks in the prison. The company had taken over maintenance at Liverpool Prison in June 2015 as part of a government contract to provide facilities management in 60 jails. Under the changes, staff were required to carry out most jobs alone, rather than in pairs, as had been the practice for many years. The two men thought it was a safety risk because tools and equipment could be snatched by prisoners. ""I see it as a bag of tools, somebody else will see it as a bag of weapons,"" said Mr Bromilow, a painter-decorator. After unsuccessfully trying to reverse the measures through an internal grievance procedure, the two colleagues met the prison governor to inform him they were calling in the Health and Safety Executive. However, after two meetings with the governor, Amey suspended, then sacked, the men. Statements from Amey officials, submitted to the tribunal, claimed Mr Bromilow and Mr Wildman had been ""intent on making things difficult"" for the company, alleging their actions had ""the potential to be incredibly damaging"" to its reputation. The workers said an unattended bag of tools could become a 'bag of weapons' Jon Heath, the solicitor who represented the pair, said it was a ""scandalous"" case. ""To dismiss them for having explicitly raised those concerns is one of the more startling examples of an unfair dismissal that I have come across,"" he said. Responding to the tribunal decision, Amey said: ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our employees, and we have a robust whistleblowing policy in place which provides a number of channels for our employees to escalate concerns about their health and safety. ""We encourage all employees to follow these protocols so we can address their concerns in the most thorough and efficient way possible."" The tribunal will consider if the men can return to their jobs and the compensation they are entitled to at a hearing in June.

HGVs-in-bus-lanes plan 'may help traffic',"This video can not be played Haulage company boss Terry Hicks says safety is ""paramount"" Lorries could be allowed to use some bus lanes to improve traffic flow across Wales, if a review is agreed. Economy and Transport Secretary Ken Skates could consider letting HGVs into bus lanes in limited circumstances. Sustainable transport charity Sustrans said such a move could endanger lives, as cyclists use bus lanes, but haulage groups said it was a ""good idea"". The Welsh Government is to discuss the idea with highways and transport organisations over the next year. The idea was put forward byTraffic Commissioner for Wales Nick Jones in his first annual report,externalto the assembly, in which he said HGVs were ""essential for the economy and the provision of services"". Four in 10 parking ticket appeals succeed Newport 'Wales' most congested city' 2017 traffic jams 'cost drivers Â£280m' The Road Haulage Association (RHA), which represents transport operators, has welcomed the idea, but it stressed the need for a sustained programme of investment in roads and infrastructure. Sustrans Cymru said it was worried about the possible safety implications, claiming bus lanes form an important part of cycling infrastructure, reducing cyclists' exposure to traffic. Natasha Withey, from the group, said: ""To improve traffic flow, cities need to reduce the number of vehicles on the road through encouraging more people to use alternative means to get around, not discourage cyclists through making their dedicated infrastructure unsafe."" Hauliers say the recent heavy snow showed the effect of disruption to lorry deliveries The Freight Transport Association, which represents firms moving goods by road, rail, sea and air, said it was ""delighted to hear the Welsh Government is seriously considering this proposal"". A spokesman said: ""Making better use of valuable road space by allowing trucks to use bus lanes not only eases congestion, but helps to keep delivery costs down and ensures food and other vital supplies arrive on time at our shops and homes, something that benefits everyone."" An RHA spokesman said the move could help to reduce hold-ups, adding: ""Only last week during 'snowmageddon' we saw how quickly supermarket shelves emptied because trucks couldn't get through in time."" Discussions will be held with highways groups, including the Traffic Commissioner for Wales, who is responsible for licensing HGV operators and buses. The conclusions are due to be published by the Welsh Government in 2019.

Cable denies branding Brexit voters racist,"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable said too many older people who voted for Brexit were ""driven by nostalgia"" Sir Vince Cable has denied suggesting older Brexit voters were racist. In a speech at his party's spring conference, the Lib Dem leader said too many older people who voted Leave longed for a world where ""faces were white"" and were ""driven by nostalgia"". Tory MPs have labelled the comments as ""wrong"" and ""unwise"". But Sir Vince called it a ""simple truth of the matter"" that the majority of the older generation voted Leave while younger people favoured Remain. In his speech on Sunday, Sir Vince said a ""nostalgia for a world where passports were blue, faces were white and the map was coloured imperial pink"" had driven some older voters to Brexit. ""And it was their votes on one wet day in June which crushed the hopes and aspirations of young people for years to come,"" he added. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether he was suggesting older Brexit voters were racist, Sir Vince said: ""I didn't suggest that at all."" But he repeated his claim that ""nostalgia for that world"" was a factor in how people had voted. ""Why else has so much fuss been made about the change in the colour of the passport?"" he added. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Corbyn: Labour Brexit approach 'sensible' Conservative MPs have criticised the Lib Dem leader over his speech.

The Lib Dems are campaigning for a second referendum on the final Brexit deal, which the government opposes. Sir Vince told his audience in Southport: ""I've myself been on a journey. I confess that my own initial reaction to the referendum was to think maybe there was little choice but to pursue Brexit. ""I thought, you know, the public had voted to be poorer - well, that was their right. ""What changed my mind was the evidence that Brexit had overwhelmingly been the choice of the older generation. ""75% of under 25s voted to remain. But 70% of over 65s voted for Brexit,"" he said. Sir Vince also took a swipe at his own party's lack of diversity - it has had a lower proportion of non-white MPs and candidates than Labour or the Conservatives in recent years. ""Looking around the auditorium, we are very, very white,"" he told the party faithful. ""We must prioritise making our party more ethnically diverse.""

PM to meet ministers on spy latest,"This video can not be played Vladimir Putin is challenged by the BBC over the Skripal poisoning Theresa May is facing mounting pressure to take decisive action against whoever was behind the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter. Ex-national security advisor Lord Ricketts said ""firm action"" was needed once responsibility was confirmed. Asked whether Russia was to blame, President Vladimir Putin told the BBC: ""Get to the bottom of things there, then we'll discuss this."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain in a critical but stable condition. The 66-year-old retired military intelligence officer and his daughter, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill attending the pair, remains seriously ill in hospital but has been talking to his family. What are nerve agents? Labour to boycott Russia Today - McDonnell Russian spy: What we know so far What now for the UK/Russia relationship? Police activity continued on Monday afternoon, with officers - some wearing hazardous materials suits- removing a white van from the village of Winterslow, about six miles from Salisbury. A Sainsbury's car park in Salisbury was also sealed off by police. Earlier, Mrs May chaired a National Security Council meeting, held to discuss the latest information with ministers and intelligence and military chiefs. She is due to update MPs in the Commons on the investigation shortly. Foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme evidence was mounting against Russia and he ""would be surprised if she did not point the finger at the Kremlin"". Mr Skripal was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6 in 2004, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". This video can not be played Steve Cooper was in the pub where traces of a nerve agent have been found Lord Ricketts told Today he had ""little doubt that this had come from Russia"". ""The really difficult judgement is who authorised it and why - was it some sort of rogue element or was it centrally authorised? I suppose that does have some impact on the kind of reactions that we need,"" he said. However, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to President Putin, said: ""This incident happened on British soil and it doesn't have anything to do with the Russian Federation whatsoever, let alone the president."" By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent Vladimir Putin was on the campaign trail today in southern Russia. He visited a grain centre in Krasnodar. There, I asked him: ""Is Russia behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal?"" ""We're dealing here with agriculture,"" he told me, ""to create conditions for the lives of our people. And you talk to me about some tragedies. First, get to the bottom of what happened there and then we'll discuss this."" These are President Putin's first public comments on events in Salisbury. In recent days, Moscow has complained of what it sees as an ""anti-Russian campaign"" in the British media over the poisoning of the Skripals. Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""If we get to a position when we are able to attribute this attack then we will do so and the government will deliver an appropriate response."" In aninterview with the Evening Standard,external, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was not going to ""enter into a kind of great big tit-for-tat"" with Russia ""which is what they are longing I'm sure for us to do"". But she said the UK would consider strong measures if ""a hostile state"" were found guilty of the poisoning. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday with his daughter On Sunday, up to 500 Salisbury pub-goers and diners were told to wash their possessions as a precaution after trace amounts of the substance used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found on and around a table where they had eaten in Zizzi. The table has since been destroyed. Traces were also found at the Mill pub in the city, which like Zizzi remains closed. In a statement, Zizzi said it was ""shocked and saddened by the events"" and its priority was to ensure the wellbeing of its staff and customers. Diners at its Salisbury branch with concerns are being urged to call 0345 6022698.

Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said the advice was a ""belt and braces"" measure, adding: ""I am confident none of these customers or staff will have suffered harm."" But Steve Cooper, who was at the Mill pub with his wife, told the BBC he was ""outraged"" that the instructions were not given sooner, adding: ""I'd like to know what are the long-term implications to me and my wife."" This video can not be played Prof Dame Sally Davies said the risk of harm was ""low"" Former chief medical officer for England, Sir Liam Donaldson, said he had been a ""little surprised that the communication with the public has been in such general terms and slow to get off the ground... in a situation when there are so many unknowns about the risk"". Whitehall sources have acknowledged the government will need to pay more attention to the threat of chemical warfare following the Salisbury attack. Det Sgt Nick Bailey remains in hospital Meanwhile, a man from Salisbury who breached the cordon around the bench where Mr Skripal and his daughter were found, has been jailed for 16 weeks. Father-of-three Jamie Knight, 30, who pleaded guilty to assault, criminal damage and racially aggravated public disorder, was said to have been drunk when he shouted out abusive remarks about Russians, Swindon Magistrates' Court was told.

Plane crashes at Kathmandu airport,"This video can not be played Footage of the site where the US-Bangla plane came to rest A plane carrying 71 passengers and crew has crashed on landing at Nepal's Kathmandu airport, killing 49 people, according to police. Rescuers pulled bodies from the charred wreckage of the plane, operated by Bangladeshi airline US-Bangla, after a raging fire was put out. The airline has blamed air traffic control, but the airport says the plane approached from the wrong direction. Flight BS211 veered off the runway while landing on Monday afternoon. The exact cause of the crash remains unclear and Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli promised an immediate investigation. However, a recording of the conversation between the pilot and air traffic control minutes before the plane crashed suggests some misunderstanding over which end of the sole runway the plane was cleared to land on. Air disasters timeline Moments before the plane crash-landed, an air traffic controller is heard in the recording obtained by the BBC from air traffic monitor LiveATC telling the pilot: ""I say again, turn!"" Twenty-two people are being treated in hospital for injuries, police spokesperson Manoj Neupane told the BBC's Nepali service. The plane, which was flying from the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop and was 17 years old. The plane landed at 14:20 local time (08:35 GMT),according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24,external. A survivor said the plane had begun to behave strangely as it approached Kathmandu ""The aircraft was permitted to land from the southern side of the runway flying over Koteshwor, but it landed from the northern side,"" Sanjiv Gautam, director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. ""We are yet to ascertain the reason behind the unusual landing."" However, US-Bangla Airlines chief executive Imran Asif blamed Kathmandu air traffic control. ""There were wrong directions from the tower. Our pilot was not at fault,"" he told reporters at his office in Dhaka. ""Our pilot is an instructor of this Bombardier aircraft. His flight hours are over 5,000. There was a fumble from the control tower."" Airport general manager Raj Kumar Chettri told Reuters news agency that the plane hit the airport fence before touching ground. ""The plane should have come from the right direction,"" he said. Basanta Bohora, who escaped the plane, is recovering in hospital One of the survivors, Nepalese travel agent Basanta Bohora, described from his hospital bed what he had experienced. After a normal take-off from Dhaka, the plane had begun to behave strangely as it approached Kathmandu, he said. ""All of a sudden the plane shook violently and there was a loud bang afterwards,"",externalhe was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. ""I was seated near the window and was able to break out of the window,"" he added. ""I have no recollection after I got out of the plane, someone took me to Sinamangal hospital, and from there my friends brought me to Norvic [hospital]. I have injuries to my head and legs, but I am fortunate that I survived."" The plane was carrying 67 passengers and four crew. It is now known that 33 of the passengers were Nepalis, 32 were Bangladeshi, one was Chinese and one was from the Maldives. Among the 22 people injured, some are in a critical condition. An airline worker said he saw two or three people fall or jump from the windows of the burning plane. Its airline companies are banned from flying within the European Union. The plane reportedly hit a fence before touching down and crashing There have been many aviation incidents in Nepal, but this is the deadliest since a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed on approach in September 1992, killing all 167 on board. Earlier that same year, a Thai Airways plane crashed near the airport, leaving 113 people dead. Pilots say that landing at Kathmandu airport can be challenging because of the mountainous landscape. Recent aviation incidents in Nepal include: February 2016:Twenty-three people were killed when a small passenger plane crashed in mountainous western Nepal March 2015:Lucky escape for passengers after plane skids off runway in fog in Kathmandu February 2014: Bodies of all 18 people recovered after small plane crashes in western Nepal September 2012:Plane heading for Everest region crashes on the outskirts of Kathmandu, killing all 19 on board May 2012: Fifteen people die when a plane carrying Indian pilgrims crashes in northern Nepal September 2010:Sightseeing flight crashes into a hillside near Kathmandu September 2006:All 24 people on board a WWF helicopter die when it crashes in eastern Nepal The carrier launched in July 2014 and its slogan is ""Fly Fast, Fly Safe"".

UK military credibility 'at risk' over cuts,"This video can not be played UK military credibility 'at risk' over cuts The former commander of the UK's Maritime Forces has said Britain is in danger of losing its status as a ""credible military power"". Rear Admiral Alex Burton told the BBC that years of budget cuts and rising military threats meant the defence budget needed to be increased urgently. He said the ability to ""fight and win on the front line"" was being affected. And, if fresh spending wasn't announced, Britain would be morally poorer on the world stage. His comments come 24 hours before the Chancellor's Spring Statement on the state of the public finances. And the day after Philip Hammond said that there was ""light"" at the end of the austerity tunnel - possibly leaving some more headroom for spending increases. Rear Admiral Burton, who left the armed forces last autumn, told me: ""If you do not spend more on defence than we currently are as a percentage of GDP, then we put at risk the fact that we are currently a credible military power, and from that we put at risk our position on the global stage."" He said that military threats were increasing from countries like Russia, from cyber warfare and from terrorist organisations. What's happened to defence spending? Army chief warns over Russian threats Rear Admiral Burton, who was also NATO commander in charge of ""high readiness"" naval forces, argued that with Britain preparing to leave the European Union it was vital that defence spending was raised to at least 2.5% of GDP to support global trade. At present the government has a military spending target of 2% of GDP, set as the target for all members of NATO. An increase to 2.5% would mean spending an extra Â£7.7bn a year on defence. At present Russia spends more than 5% of its GDP on defence, and Britain now spends less on defence than under Tony Blair, when the figure was 2.7%. ""What worries me and worried me when I left the front line and was operating in headquarters is that some of the decisions we were making - and potentially over the next 12 months some of the decisions that will be made - will affect the ability to fight and win on the front line,"" he said, referring to the Modern Defence Programme Review which is looking at possible defence budget shortfalls over the next decade of Â£20bn. ""And the challenge is ensuring that we're still able to do that [fight and win] not just over the next 12 to 18 months, but that we're able to do that over the next 10 to 20 years."" The Rear Admiral is still very well connected in military circles and his comments come two weeks after General Sir Gordon Messenger, Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, said that a case should be made for a ""bigger defence budget"". Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, is also believed to have clashed with Mr Hammond over defence spending. The Spring Statement tomorrow is the second most important Parliamentary event on the economy after the Budget in the autumn. Mr Hammond will lay out the latest information on the state of the economy and public spending. It is expected that the public finances will be in better shape than forecast last year, with borrowing about Â£10bn below the expected level. That could give the Chancellor some increased headroom on spending though it has been made clear that the Spring Statement will not focus on new commitments. Rear Admiral Burton said that he understood the needs of the NHS and the police, for example, had to be balanced by the government and that after the financial crisis the Ministry of Defence had to become more efficient and show it could spend money wisely - which it had done. But he said military threats had to be taken seriously. ""Those threats are threats to our investments that we've got abroad,"" he said. ""So it would be easy for people to look at retired military people, of which I am one, and be critical - seeing us as defenders of totemic capabilities which have their lineage going back to the Second World War. ""Whether that's the Royal Marines, our amphibious capability, aircraft, tanks or regiments. ""But I believe that if we are to retain an edge for the military that we need, we need the sword upon which that edge can be had and that includes some of those capabilities that we've used since the Viking era and will continue to use many years ahead."" Without stronger military capabilities, Britain would be less able to stand ""toe-to-toe"" alongside our trading allies. ""Without them [the military] we will be unable to deter, we'll be unable to reassure and deliver retribution,"" he said. ""And as a sovereign nation - an increasingly sovereign nation - I think that's critically important. ""Our insurance policy, I believe, will be compromised and our ability to stand up for our beliefs and protect our interests will be weakened. ""And I think that that will make the UK of the late 2010s and early 2020s poorer, both morally and financially."" Rear Admiral Burton said he understood the need for the military to show that it could spend money sensibly, and that it was now much more efficient than it had been in the past. The Treasury said that defence spending was already growing to meet the ""ever changing threats"" and that it was the fastest growing budget in Whitehall. ""The UK maintains the biggest defence budget in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, already exceeding NATO's 2% spending target,"" a spokesperson said. ""Over the next three years, the defence budget is increasing by Â£1bn a year.""

"Degree courses to face gold rating marksUniversities are to be given ""no place to hide"" under a new pilot scheme, say ministers.8h8 hours agoFamily & Education","Degree courses are to be rated for quality, subject by subject, under a new pilot scheme which ministers say leaves universities ""no place to hide"". Individual subjects at different universities will be graded gold, silver or bronze by a new tool feeding in official data on teaching quality. But students will not be able to use the rankings to choose their courses until 2020, when the tool goes live. Universities say the assessment of subjects must be effective. The new system to rate teaching is part of the government's attempt to get tough on universities, which charge students nearly Â£30,000 for a three-year degree, and have come under fire for paying their senior managers very high salaries. The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""Prospective students deserve to know which courses deliver great teaching and great outcomes - and which ones are lagging behind. ""In the age of the student, universities will no longer be able to hide if their teaching quality is not up to the world-class standard that we expect."" The plans, which are to be piloted with 50 universities initially,builds on the new ranking system for universities overall. This is also supported by data from the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) which combines a range of data on course teaching to arrive at the ranking. And there will also be information on which jobs students go on to, how much they earn and how many drop out. A consultation on the way the new framework will operate is being launched and will last 10 weeks. How do you choose a uni course?  It's probably a complex mix of open days and surfing glossy, promotional videos on YouTube. By 2020 the government says information like drop-out rates and graduate earnings could allow comparisons between broadly similar courses at different universities. It will be based on research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the University of Cambridge linking information from school pupils, through student finance to tax records. Experimental statistics comparing universities have already been published.  But to be credible the will have to take a lot into account. One university might admit a lot of students with high grades and well off families who can support them through doing unpaid work experience when they leave. Another may recruit more students from low income families. Many universities recruit largely in their region, and earnings are higher in the south east of England than the North West.  So simple comparisons won't be easy, but the information could help some make a more informed decision. A spokesman for Universities UK said: ""TEF will stand or fall by whether it can provide accurate and meaningful information to inform student choice. ""The assessment of subjects needs to be effective and not overly burdensome."" It added that the independent review of fees, to be held in the next year, would be important in judging the success of the idea. The National Union of Students questioned the depth of the information covered by the grading system. NUS vice-president (higher education) Amatey Doku said: ""Unfortunately the Teaching Excellence Framework does little to measure teaching excellence and extending it to subject-level won't solve the problem. ""The metrics used tell us little about the quality of teaching but instead [it] opens the door for institutions to attempt to game their metrics rather than drive continuous improvement of their teaching practices. ""With the promised independent review into TEF still under way, it is an irresponsible move to make without the recommendations from the review or the input of students' voices.""

London mayor warns big tech on hate speech,"Sadiq Khan wants tech firms to take hate speech more seriously Stricter regulation, including large fines, is one option to force technology companies to take the issue of hate speech more seriously, the Mayor of London has said. ""We can't assume that tech companies will find the solutions by themselves,"" Sadiq Khan told the BBC. He said companies have to be ""chivvied and cajoled to take action"". On Monday, he will share examples of abuse he has personally received. The messages will form part of his keynote speech at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. He said the messages could deter people from entering politics or public life. ""If someone like me is receiving these sorts of messages in a public environment,"" he said. ""Imagine how you feel as a young person, if you're somebody who's putting your head above the parapet. ""You're going to think once, twice three times whether you want to do so."" The location of his speech is fitting - it was here where Twitter first gained popularity back in 2007. But in that decade, little has changed in the law. ""We have evolving economies, which means we should have evolving regulations. ""For too long politicians and policy makers have allowed this revolution to take place around us and we've had our heads in the sand."" In his speech he will reference rules put in place in Germany that allows fines of up to 50 million euros if hate speech is not removed in a timely fashion. ""Germany is an example of where the German government said 'Enough. Unless you take down hate messages, unless you take down fake news, we will fine you'. He added: ""I want to work with the tech companies, but you have to be responsible."" Mr Khan acknowledged that the rate of his abuse has been accelerated bytweets from President Donald Trump,externalthat mentioned the Mayor specifically in the wake of a London terror attack. In November, Mr Trump retweeted posts from Britain First, a far-right group that has now been banned from the platform. ""If you are the most powerful man in the western world, and you are amplifying messages from far-right groups, Britain First, that has an impact on many people. That group incites hatred. ""President Trump has lots of followers and some of them have shown interest in me. ""I'm a reluctant participant in any 'verbal fisticuffs' between the President of the USA and me. ""But I've got a responsibility as the Mayor of the most diverse city in the world to speak up for my residents."" But in talking at this extremely pro-tech event on this topic, the Mayor treads a fine line. Raising the possibility of stricter regulation, even fines, risks London gaining a reputation as being an anti-start-up city - a place where doing business on the internet could be riskier financially than in other parts of the the world. ""I want London to be the centre of disruptive technology, and businesses thinking of starting up, scaling up or giant tech companies coming to London,"" Mr Khan said. ""But, and there's a very important but, we as politicians and policy makers have got to work with you to make sure it works for everyone. ""What I don't want is a situation where we end up where Germany's ended up where because their citizens don't feel protected they're taking this sort of action. Germany is an example of what happens if companies don't self-regulate."" In a related attempt to clamp down on behaviour by some tech firms, Mr Khan saidrecent suggestions to tax tech companies on revenue, rather than profits, was a ""really interesting debate that is finally happening"". But he said he believed it was cooperation between countries that would have the most impact on how tech firms approached their tax affairs. ""What we want is joined-up-ness,"" he said. ""What we don't want is companies using an army of accountants to find the loopholes."" Mayor's bid to make London safer for women.

'No response' yet from N Korea on talks,"No word yet from Mr Kim on details of the summit South Korea says it has not received a response from Pyongyang on a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. In a surprise development, Mr Trump on Friday accepted North Korea's invitation to direct talks. South Korean officials said Mr Kim was prepared to give up his nuclear weapons. Details on the planned talks remain vague, with no agreement yet on the location or agenda. Analysts are sceptical about what can be achieved through talks given the complexity of the issues involved. ""We have not seen nor received an official response from the North Korean regime regarding the North Korea-US summit,"" a spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Unification said on Monday. ""I feel they're approaching this matter with caution and they need time to organise their stance."" South Korean President Moon Jae-in has described the chance to hold talks with North Korea as a ""precious chance"" to achieve ""permanent peace"". His country's officials who spoke to President Trump are now on the way to China and Japan to brief the leaders of each country on the upcoming talks. The North Korea talks in 400 words US 'knows the risks' of talks The political gamble of the 21st Century Pyongyang is better known for nuclear threats than peace offers South Korean President Moon Jae-in's top security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, is scheduled to meet China's President Xi Jinping. Meanwhile, Suh Hoon, chief of the intelligence agency, is headed to Tokyo to speak with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. While China is seen as North Korea's last remaining financial backer, Japan is the ally of Washington that along with the South has received the most military threats from Pyongyang. The surprise proposal for the summit comes after more than a year of heated rhetoric between North Korea and the US, and global concern that the hostilities might escalate into military confrontation. North Korea has conducted several nuclear tests over the past few years and has developed long-distance missiles it says can carry nuclear bombs as far as the US mainland. Talks between the countries would mark an unprecedented step in the conflict as no sitting US president has ever met with a North Korean leader. Still, details of the meeting remain unclear. ""Pyongyang probably wants to wait to see how the offer was received in Washington,"" Andray Abrahamian, Research Fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS, told the BBC. ""There's already been a bit of confusion in the messaging from the White House so it probably makes sense to get some of the ground rules established before go public with it,"" Mr Abrahamian said. If the summit goes ahead, Mr Trump is expected to meet the North Korean leader by the end of May, while South Korean President Moon and Mr Kim will hold separate talks ahead of that. Observers are divided on whether talks could pave the way to Pyongyang giving up its nuclear ambitions or whether North Korea is merely seeking a propaganda win and a break from years of crippling international sanctions. ""Their short term objectives will be to get some relief from the sanctions,"" Mr Abrahamin said. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies ""Many pundits seem vexed that Kim Jong-un will use a summit for propaganda. This should not be a big concern....[it] doesn't mean that the United States is giving approval to its political system, human rights record or weapons programmes,"" he added. CIA directorMike Pompeo on Sunday defended Donald Trump's decisionto meet with Mr Kim, saying the president understands the risks of the talks and the administration had its eyes ""wide open"" to the challenge of dealing with North Korea. The US president told supporters at a rally on Saturday that he believed North Korea wanted to ""make peace"" but said he might leave talks if no progress for nuclear disarmament could be made. According to US media reports, Mr Trump made the decision to meet Mr Kim without consulting key figures in his administration, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed to reporters the decision was one ""the president took himself"".

Brain surgeon's operations 'appalling',"This video can not be played Coventry brain surgeon explains 'safe' surgery on YouTube Surgeons have seriously criticised two brain surgery operations where the patients went on to die. Hussien El-Maghraby, a consultant neurosurgeon in Coventry, removed a healthy part of a brain instead of a tumour during one operation. The 51-year-old was stopped in September from performing two different surgical procedures, following a Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) inspection. Mr El-Maghraby said the General Medical Council (GMC) had examined five of his operations and ruled no further action was needed. Midlands Live: Activists disrupt Crufts grand final; Search resumes for remains of missing teen mother An expert who saw a video of the neurosurgeon's work on one of the patients told a BBC Inside Out investigation he was ""appalled"" and described it as ""rough surgery"". Stephen Bridgman, from Redditch, Worcestershire, died after Mr El-Maghraby operated on his benign brain tumour in 2016. Stephen Bridgman was left in a vegetative state following surgery The repercussions of the surgery left Mr Bridgman in a vegetative state, as his brain had been irreparably damaged following heavy bleeding. His widow Mandy Bridgman requested her husband's medical notes and found a short video was included showing parts of the surgery. 'I was awake during brain surgery' A day in the life of a child neurosurgeon Wrong patient given brain surgery Chris Adams, who was head of neurological surgery at the former Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, said: ""This is very, very rough surgery. In fact I'm appalled by it frankly. ""I have never seen this sort of tumour removed in this way - [it has] just been pulled out in one piece. ""It's just completely contrary to how one does neurosurgery."" ""There's no words for it. He did not need to die,"" Mrs Bridgman said. Two other independent neurosurgeons spoken to by BBC Inside Out also expressed concerns over Mr Bridgman's surgery. Mr El-Maghraby, who is employed by University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, said the video had only covered 20 minutes of the operation that had lasted three hours. The hospital trust asked for the video to be looked at by its own independent expert, who noted the tumour was removed ""very quickly"" but said it had been detached from the skull in ""a reasonable manner"". Four years earlier, a colleague of Mr El-Maghraby, Munchi Choksey, had raised concerns about some spinal procedures and two operations where Mr El Maghraby had removed brain tissue instead of tumour. Pathology reports show a large healthy chunk of Doreen Dunn's brain was taken out instead of a benign brain tumour. A few days later Mrs Dunn, from Coventry, died. Mr Choksey viewed the scans and said: ""It is a colossal error for any neurosurgeon to make."" Doreen Dunn, pictured with her two granddaughters in 2010, died days after a healthy part of her brain was removed in 2014 Mrs Dunn's family were not aware of details of the operation until the BBC contacted her daughter Cathy. ""You go to these places and you trust that the people know what they are doing,"" she said. ""They are the experts. So to find that something like that was not done properly... it's a shock."" Mr El-Maghraby, who says he has performed more than 3,000 operations, told the BBC Mrs Dunn's case was one of the five examined by the GMC. He made a formal allegation of bullying against Mr Choksey. In September, the RCS was asked to review four cases, including Mr Bridgman's. The trust told the BBC Mr El-Maghraby should refrain from carrying out two specific surgical procedures pending further training and mentorship. The two procedures stopped in October were complex spinal operations and brain surgery while the patient is awake. The review identified no issues with routine brain cancer surgery. Mrs Bridgman said Mr El-Maghraby ""shouldn't be operating"". ""I'm just so angry now that it seems like a lot of people have known about this and they've still let him carry on.""

UK military credibility 'at risk' over cutsThe former commander of the UKâs Maritime Forces tells the BBC that defence spending should be increased.7h7 hours agoBusiness,"This video can not be played UK military credibility 'at risk' over cuts The former commander of the UK's Maritime Forces has said Britain is in danger of losing its status as a ""credible military power"". Rear Admiral Alex Burton told the BBC that years of budget cuts and rising military threats meant the defence budget needed to be increased urgently. He said the ability to ""fight and win on the front line"" was being affected. And, if fresh spending wasn't announced, Britain would be morally poorer on the world stage. His comments come 24 hours before the Chancellor's Spring Statement on the state of the public finances. And the day after Philip Hammond said that there was ""light"" at the end of the austerity tunnel - possibly leaving some more headroom for spending increases. Rear Admiral Burton, who left the armed forces last autumn, told me: ""If you do not spend more on defence than we currently are as a percentage of GDP, then we put at risk the fact that we are currently a credible military power, and from that we put at risk our position on the global stage."" He said that military threats were increasing from countries like Russia, from cyber warfare and from terrorist organisations. What's happened to defence spending? Army chief warns over Russian threats Rear Admiral Burton, who was also NATO commander in charge of ""high readiness"" naval forces, argued that with Britain preparing to leave the European Union it was vital that defence spending was raised to at least 2.5% of GDP to support global trade. At present the government has a military spending target of 2% of GDP, set as the target for all members of NATO. An increase to 2.5% would mean spending an extra Â£7.7bn a year on defence. At present Russia spends more than 5% of its GDP on defence, and Britain now spends less on defence than under Tony Blair, when the figure was 2.7%. ""What worries me and worried me when I left the front line and was operating in headquarters is that some of the decisions we were making - and potentially over the next 12 months some of the decisions that will be made - will affect the ability to fight and win on the front line,"" he said, referring to the Modern Defence Programme Review which is looking at possible defence budget shortfalls over the next decade of Â£20bn. ""And the challenge is ensuring that we're still able to do that [fight and win] not just over the next 12 to 18 months, but that we're able to do that over the next 10 to 20 years."" The Rear Admiral is still very well connected in military circles and his comments come two weeks after General Sir Gordon Messenger, Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, said that a case should be made for a ""bigger defence budget"". Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, is also believed to have clashed with Mr Hammond over defence spending. The Spring Statement tomorrow is the second most important Parliamentary event on the economy after the Budget in the autumn. Mr Hammond will lay out the latest information on the state of the economy and public spending. It is expected that the public finances will be in better shape than forecast last year, with borrowing about Â£10bn below the expected level. That could give the Chancellor some increased headroom on spending though it has been made clear that the Spring Statement will not focus on new commitments. Rear Admiral Burton said that he understood the needs of the NHS and the police, for example, had to be balanced by the government and that after the financial crisis the Ministry of Defence had to become more efficient and show it could spend money wisely - which it had done. But he said military threats had to be taken seriously. ""Those threats are threats to our investments that we've got abroad,"" he said. ""So it would be easy for people to look at retired military people, of which I am one, and be critical - seeing us as defenders of totemic capabilities which have their lineage going back to the Second World War. ""Whether that's the Royal Marines, our amphibious capability, aircraft, tanks or regiments. ""But I believe that if we are to retain an edge for the military that we need, we need the sword upon which that edge can be had and that includes some of those capabilities that we've used since the Viking era and will continue to use many years ahead."" Without stronger military capabilities, Britain would be less able to stand ""toe-to-toe"" alongside our trading allies. ""Without them [the military] we will be unable to deter, we'll be unable to reassure and deliver retribution,"" he said. ""And as a sovereign nation - an increasingly sovereign nation - I think that's critically important. ""Our insurance policy, I believe, will be compromised and our ability to stand up for our beliefs and protect our interests will be weakened. ""And I think that that will make the UK of the late 2010s and early 2020s poorer, both morally and financially."" Rear Admiral Burton said he understood the need for the military to show that it could spend money sensibly, and that it was now much more efficient than it had been in the past. The Treasury said that defence spending was already growing to meet the ""ever changing threats"" and that it was the fastest growing budget in Whitehall. ""The UK maintains the biggest defence budget in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, already exceeding NATO's 2% spending target,"" a spokesperson said. ""Over the next three years, the defence budget is increasing by Â£1bn a year.""

BBC appeals to UN over Iran harassment,"More than 20 BBC Persian service staff or family members have received death threats The BBC is making an unprecedented appeal to the UN to stop Iran from harassing its Persian service staff in London and their families in Iran. It says Iran has stepped up a campaign of intimidation, including threats, arrests of relatives and travel bans. Iran began targeting the BBC's Persian service after the disputed 2009 presidential election, when Tehran accused foreign powers of interference. The appeal will be made at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Iran's government has said the allegations are incorrect and accused BBC Persian of spreading false information to encourage the overthrow of the Iranian system. In October last year, BBC Persian journalists gathered at a memorial service for someone most had never met. They were there to support a colleague whose father had just died in Iran. He had received a call a week before to say his father had been taken ill. In normal circumstances, he might have jumped on a plane and rushed to the hospital to be with his father. But BBC Persian staff are unable to travel back to Iran for fear of arrest, so the best he could do was to contact his father via the Skype messaging service. A week later, his father died. Unable to attend the real memorial service in Iran where people who knew his father could share their grief and memories, our colleague had to make do with the compassion of workmates over pastries in a room in central London. Iran 'detains alleged BBC Persian journalists' UN urges Iran to stop harassing BBC staff It is an all too familiar story for BBC Persian, where more than 30 staff have lost parents and been unable to say goodbye in the past decade. Criminalised by the Iranian government as subversives or foreign spies, BBC Persian journalists live in dread of that phone call - the one that tells them a family member is ill or dying, or that someone they know and love has been called in for questioning. Another BBC Persian journalist received demands via Skype that she stop working for the broadcaster - or at least agree to spy on her colleagues - in return for the freedom of her 27-year-old sister. Her sister was taken by security agents during a night raid on her father's home in Tehran, and was held in Iran's notorious Evin prison. ""When I said no, they kept my sister in solitary confinement for 17 days,"" she said. She recorded the conversations with the intelligence agents. Iranian government supporters have protested against BBC news coverage Another young female presenter at BBC Persian television was sent an anonymous email demanding that she too stop working for the corporation. Those making the demands said they knew which school her 10-year-old son attended. A senior producer's elderly mother was called in for questioning in Tehran by one of the many intelligence agencies. She was told that her son could have a car accident in London if he continued working for the BBC. She took the threat very seriously - as did the counter-terrorism police in London, who immediately made arrangements for his protection. Iran freezes assets of BBC employees More than 20 Persian service journalists or family members have received death threats - a number of which have warranted police protection in the UK. After years of harassment and persecution of its staff, the BBC is now appealing to the international community by taking its complaint directly to the UN. ""The BBC is taking the unprecedented step of appealing to the United Nations because our own attempts to persuade the Iranian authorities to end their harassment have been completely ignored,"" said BBC Director General Tony Hall. A court order to freeze the assets of BBC staff named 152 individuals The call comes after the latest move by Iran to escalate its campaign against BBC Persian service journalists. It has accused 152 current and former staff and contributors of ""conspiracy against national security"" and initiated criminal investigations. Iran has also slapped an asset freeze on many of the journalists. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called on Iran to cease all legal action against the BBC staff and their families, and against ""independent journalism, whether affiliated to the BBC or not"". An estimated 18 million Iranians, a quarter of the population of Iran, regularly use the BBC's Persian service online, on radio or on satellite television. Some 12 million people regularly watch its TV programmes, which include news, current affairs and entertainment. ""Iranians are turning to BBC Persian in huge numbers because they cannot get reliable and impartial news and analysis from the Iranian media which is heavily censored,"" said Rozita Lotfi, head of BBC Persian. BBC condemns Iran over 'harassment' BBC accuses Iran of intimidation In 2009, in the aftermath of the presidential elections, millions of Iranians took to the streets claiming their votes had been stolen. Allegations of fraud led to months of unrest, which the authorities blamed on the US, the UK and other Western governments - and the BBC. This video can not be played Iran's actions are a grave threat to freedom of speech, says the BBC's Tarik Kafala The BBC correspondent in Tehran at the time, Jon Leyne, was expelled along with other journalists working for the international media. Iran's harassment has continued ever since. In October 2017, the UN's special rapporteurs on freedom of expression and the human rights in Iran wrote to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif raising the issue of BBC Persian staff. They asked him to explain what evidence underpinned the accusation of conspiracy against national security brought against the journalists. They also asked him to explain how working for the BBC amounted to a threat to national security. More than four months later, the letter remains unanswered. Iran's permanent mission to the UN in Geneva told the Human Rights Council on Monday that the allegations of harassment and threats were ""incorrect"". ""BBC Persian is not an independent media network,"" the mission said. ""Its financial and political affiliation with the ministry of foreign affairs and the British security agencies has been very serious."" Tony Hall said: ""This is not just about the BBC as we are not the only media organisation to have been harassed or forced to compromise when dealing with Iran."" ""In truth, this story is much wider: it is a story about fundamental human rights.""

PM to meet ministers on spy latestTheresa May to chair the National Security Council as hundreds told to wash clothes in case of contamination.1m2 minutes agoUK,"This video can not be played Vladimir Putin is challenged by the BBC over the Skripal poisoning Theresa May is facing mounting pressure to take decisive action against whoever was behind the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter. Ex-national security advisor Lord Ricketts said ""firm action"" was needed once responsibility was confirmed. Asked whether Russia was to blame, President Vladimir Putin told the BBC: ""Get to the bottom of things there, then we'll discuss this."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain in a critical but stable condition. The 66-year-old retired military intelligence officer and his daughter, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March.

Police activity continued on Monday afternoon, with officers - some wearing hazardous materials suits- removing a white van from the village of Winterslow, about six miles from Salisbury. A Sainsbury's car park in Salisbury was also sealed off by police. Earlier, Mrs May chaired a National Security Council meeting, held to discuss the latest information with ministers and intelligence and military chiefs. She is due to update MPs in the Commons on the investigation shortly. Foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme evidence was mounting against Russia and he ""would be surprised if she did not point the finger at the Kremlin"".

""The really difficult judgement is who authorised it and why - was it some sort of rogue element or was it centrally authorised?

However, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to President Putin, said: ""This incident happened on British soil and it doesn't have anything to do with the Russian Federation whatsoever, let alone the president."" By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent Vladimir Putin was on the campaign trail today in southern Russia. He visited a grain centre in Krasnodar. There, I asked him: ""Is Russia behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal?"" ""We're dealing here with agriculture,"" he told me, ""to create conditions for the lives of our people. And you talk to me about some tragedies. First, get to the bottom of what happened there and then we'll discuss this."" These are President Putin's first public comments on events in Salisbury. In recent days, Moscow has complained of what it sees as an ""anti-Russian campaign"" in the British media over the poisoning of the Skripals. Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""If we get to a position when we are able to attribute this attack then we will do so and the government will deliver an appropriate response."" In aninterview with the Evening Standard,external, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was not going to ""enter into a kind of great big tit-for-tat"" with Russia ""which is what they are longing I'm sure for us to do"".

The table, along with other items, has been removed and destroyed. Scientists have advised police it could take weeks for the premises to reopen.

He said he would now wash his shoes, watch and phone but feared using baby wipes would not get rid of a nerve agent. Some of his friends, who had been in the pub at the same time and seen Mr Skripal head to the toilet, could not remember what they had been wearing that day, he added.

Jail pair fired for raising safety fearsTwo maintenance men were sacked by a prison contractor for raising safety concerns with its governor.3m3 minutes agoLiverpool,"John Bromilow (left) and Harry Wildman took their concerns to the prison governor Two maintenance workers were sacked for raising concerns about health and safetyat troubled Liverpool Prison, the BBC has learned. John Bromilow and Harry Wildman, who worked at the jail for more than 20 years, were fired by Amey who had the contract for prison repairs. Amey claimed they brought the firm into disrepute by discussing new working practices with the prison governor. But an employment tribunal ruled that the men were unfairly dismissed. The tribunal, in Liverpool on Friday, said Mr Bromilow, 66, and Mr Wildman, 64, had acted in good faith. Employment judge Jonathan Holbrook, who headed the three-person panel, added he thought it was ""extraordinary"" that Amey had not taken into account the men's 45 years of collective service and their unblemished disciplinary record. Mr Wildman, an electrician, said the ruling was a ""vindication"" of what he had been fighting for since his dismissal in November 2016. ""The whole thing has been a nightmare,"" he told BBC Radio 4's File on 4. The men had complained about changes Amey introduced to the way they carried out repair work, painting jobs and other maintenance tasks in the prison. The company had taken over maintenance at Liverpool Prison in June 2015 as part of a government contract to provide facilities management in 60 jails. Under the changes, staff were required to carry out most jobs alone, rather than in pairs, as had been the practice for many years. The two men thought it was a safety risk because tools and equipment could be snatched by prisoners. ""I see it as a bag of tools, somebody else will see it as a bag of weapons,"" said Mr Bromilow, a painter-decorator. After unsuccessfully trying to reverse the measures through an internal grievance procedure, the two colleagues met the prison governor to inform him they were calling in the Health and Safety Executive. However, after two meetings with the governor, Amey suspended, then sacked, the men. Statements from Amey officials, submitted to the tribunal, claimed Mr Bromilow and Mr Wildman had been ""intent on making things difficult"" for the company, alleging their actions had ""the potential to be incredibly damaging"" to its reputation. The workers said an unattended bag of tools could become a 'bag of weapons' Jon Heath, the solicitor who represented the pair, said it was a ""scandalous"" case. ""To dismiss them for having explicitly raised those concerns is one of the more startling examples of an unfair dismissal that I have come across,"" he said. Responding to the tribunal decision, Amey said: ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our employees, and we have a robust whistleblowing policy in place which provides a number of channels for our employees to escalate concerns about their health and safety. ""We encourage all employees to follow these protocols so we can address their concerns in the most thorough and efficient way possible."" The tribunal will consider if the men can return to their jobs and the compensation they are entitled to at a hearing in June.

Backlash for Cable over Brexit commentThe Liberal Democrat leader said older Leave voters were nostalgic for a 'white' Britain.6h6 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable said too many older people who voted for Brexit were ""driven by nostalgia"" Sir Vince Cable has denied suggesting older Brexit voters were racist. In a speech at his party's spring conference, the Lib Dem leader said too many older people who voted Leave longed for a world where ""faces were white"" and were ""driven by nostalgia"". Tory MPs have labelled the comments as ""wrong"" and ""unwise"". But Sir Vince called it a ""simple truth of the matter"" that the majority of the older generation voted Leave while younger people favoured Remain. In his speech on Sunday, Sir Vince said a ""nostalgia for a world where passports were blue, faces were white and the map was coloured imperial pink"" had driven some older voters to Brexit. ""And it was their votes on one wet day in June which crushed the hopes and aspirations of young people for years to come,"" he added. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether he was suggesting older Brexit voters were racist, Sir Vince said: ""I didn't suggest that at all."" But he repeated his claim that ""nostalgia for that world"" was a factor in how people had voted. ""Why else has so much fuss been made about the change in the colour of the passport?"" he added. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Corbyn: Labour Brexit approach 'sensible' Conservative MPs have criticised the Lib Dem leader over his speech. Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Sir Vince should be trying to bring country together, not seeking to tear it apart."" Tory party chair Brandon Lewis said his comments were ""rude"" and ""offensive"". Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said ""calling 17.4 million people racists is unfair and unwise"" and the deputy chairman of the Conservatives, James Cleverly, said ""not liking brown faces"" was not the reason he voted Brexit.

The Lib Dems are campaigning for a second referendum on the final Brexit deal, which the government opposes. Sir Vince told his audience in Southport: ""I've myself been on a journey. I confess that my own initial reaction to the referendum was to think maybe there was little choice but to pursue Brexit. ""I thought, you know, the public had voted to be poorer - well, that was their right. ""What changed my mind was the evidence that Brexit had overwhelmingly been the choice of the older generation. ""75% of under 25s voted to remain. But 70% of over 65s voted for Brexit,"" he said. Sir Vince also took a swipe at his own party's lack of diversity - it has had a lower proportion of non-white MPs and candidates than Labour or the Conservatives in recent years.

'Spiritual abuse' vicar banned by churchThe Reverend Timothy Davis's ban comes after he held private prayer sessions in the boy's bedroom.5h5 hours agoOxford,"The Reverend Timothy Davis was suspended in 2016 A Church of England vicar who ""spiritually abused"" a boy has been banned from ministry for two years. The Reverend Timothy Davis is understood to be the first priest to have been convicted of such abuse by the Bishop's Disciplinary Tribunal. Mr Davis, of Christ Church, Abingdon, held two-hour private prayer sessions in the teenager's bedroom after moving in with his family in 2013. He also told his victim his girlfriend was ""evil"" and a ""bad seed"". Mr Davis lived with the family, who were members of his congregation, for six months after meeting the boy during a mentoring programme. During the prayer sessions they had laid hands on each other's head, shoulders, chest and back, although the tribunal ruled in January that there was no ""sexual touching"". In its judgement in January,the tribunal said,externalthe boy was ""scared"" and ""overcome by the intensity of what Mr Davis was doing"". As well as the prayer sessions, the tribunal heard Mr Davis had sent him text messages about his girlfriend in a bid to end their relationship. It said the vicar's ""domination"" of the boy amounted to ""misconduct which was unbecoming and inappropriate to the work and office of a Clerk in Holy Orders."" The vicar met the teenager during a mentoring programme at his church Mr Davis, who is aged in his 50s, was suspended from his position in 2016. He will need to undergo a risk assessment if he wants to return to ministry after serving the ban. After the judgement, a spokesman for the Diocese of Oxford said: ""Tim Davis betrayed the trust of everyone involved in a youth mentoring program at Christ Church Abingdon."" The vicar's behaviour was ""in no way reflective of acceptable church practice"", the spokesman said.

Obituary: Ken Dodd,"His swept-up hair, protruding teeth and expression of lunatic bewilderment made Sir Ken Dodd one of Britain's most recognisable entertainers. He was one of the most popular artists of his time, topping the record charts, filling theatres and starring on TV. An old-fashioned variety performer with his roots in music hall, he added a unique dash of surrealism to his act, Even allegations of tax fraud failed to diminish his standing with his adoring public. Kenneth Arthur Dodd was born on 8 November 1927 in the Liverpool suburb of Knotty Ash, the son of a coal merchant. His birthplace would play a central part in his later stage show as he wove surreal tales around Knotty Ash and its inhabitants the Diddy people, with their jam butty mines and black pudding plantation. As a child he showed an early talent for clowning but without any thought of making it a career. However one prank went wrong when he tried riding his bike with his eyes closed and sustained injuries to his mouth that resulted in his distinctive toothy appearance. His appearances on The Good Old Days reflected his music hall roots Despite getting a scholarship to grammar school, he left at 14 and got himself a little cart with which he went round the outskirts of Liverpool, selling pots and pans. As he used to say in later years: ""If you can sell pots and pans to housewives on their washing day, you can sell anything, even jokes."" But the stage beckoned and, after sending off for a book on how to be a ventriloquist, he set out to entertain the public in local clubs and halls with a dummy given to him by his father. He served a long apprenticeship as an amateur performer before making his first professional appearance as Professor Yaffle Chucklebutty, Operatic Tenor and Sausage Knotter, in Nottingham in 1954. ""At least they didn't boo me off,"" he later recalled. A year later he appeared in Blackpool, and by 1958 had gained top billing in the seaside resort which has been the making - and sometimes breaking - of a host of variety acts. During the next decade he gained a steadily-increasing reputation in the northern music halls, and became well known to a wider public for his broadcasts and his recordings of popular songs, like 'Happiness'. But his debut in the West End of London was deferred until 1965, when he topped the bill at the Palladium in an extraordinarily successful 42-week run. In the same year, he topped the charts with 'Tears'. The Diddymen were a central part of his act Ken Dodd was devoted to his work, and seldom, if ever, took a holiday. He recorded all his jokes - and the public reaction to them - in a series of little black notebooks, and rehearsed and re-rehearsed his every word and gesture. Set down in print, much of his material may seem commonplace. It was the way he put it across that counted. Uttered by him, a phrase such as ""Good Morning"" became charged with outrageous innuendo, and - backed by appropriate pantomime - would throw an audience into paroxysms of laughter. Dodd's catchphrases, most famously ""How tickled I am!"", were quoted everywhere. At a Liverpool theatre in 1974 he told jokes at a rate of 10 a minute for more than three hours - a feat that gained him a place in the Guinness Book of Records. The last of the old time music hall entertainers Throughout the 1970s and 80s he was a firm favourite on television and radio, and kept up a punishing schedule of stage appearances. But in 1989, Ken Dodd faced the possibility of disgrace, when he stood trial at Liverpool Crown Court on eight charges of tax fraud spanning a period of 15 years and involving Â£825,000. The trial abounded with stories of his eccentricity. He had claimed to live on Â£3,500 a year, while his personal wealth ran into millions, and he did not take a holiday until he was 51. It also emerged that he had 20 bank accounts in Jersey and the Isle of Man, and made regular 'cash and carry' flights to deposit money in them which was not declared to the Inland Revenue. He also had Â£336,000 hidden in wardrobes, cupboards and under stairs. The jury was swayed by Dodd's defence counsel George Carman QC,  who remarked: ""Some accountants are comedians but comedians are never accountants"". Dodd was acquitted, although he faced a reported Â£2m bill for legal fees and tax he had previously promised to pay. He took up his career again and later made light of his court ordeal, quipping ""I told the Inland Revenue I didn't owe them a penny because I lived near the seaside."" He had another season at the London Palladium in 1990, and was given a British Comedy Lifetime Achievement Award and voted Top Variety Performer in 1993. He was still performing four-hour shows in his 80s And the TV special, An Audience With Ken Dodd, proved a huge hit, showcasing Dodd's comic brilliance for a younger audience. He was still touring in his ninth decade with his shows sometimes lasting into the early hours of the morning. ""Some of you are optimists,"" he'd tell his audience at the start of a show, ""you've booked your taxis for half-past 12 But they say the breakfast here is good."" Behind the banter Ken Dodd was a private man, and a serious student of comic theory. As he once put it: ""Freud said that laughter is the outward expression of the psyche. But Freud never had to play the Glasgow Empire."" He rejected suggestions that many of his gags, particularly those revolving around blondes, were sexist. ""I think in every comedian there is a streak of anarchy. We don't take kindly to people telling us what we should say. But I don't like vulgarity and obscenity - the great comedians never did anything like that, they didn't need to."" Dodd married his partner of 40 years, Anne Jones, two days before he died. Although the pair had a lengthy engagement, Jones - a singer, pianist and flautist - was the support act on his tour. In December 2016, to the delight of his legions of fans, it was announced that Doddy was to be awarded a knighthood in the New Year Honours. Ken Dodd was the UK's last great music hall entertainer, from an age when comedians trudged from venue to venue plying their trade of laughter. ""My job,"" he once told the Daily Telegraph, "" isn't to educate people or even do politics, I've got to make people feel good, I want to make them happy.""

Ken Dodd: Don't call me eccentric,"Ken Dodd has opened an exhibition of photographs taken during his career Ken Dodd is the last star comedian from the variety era. Now 86, he is still drawing crowds for his five-hour stage shows. Opening an exhibition about his career, he gets serious about life and laughter - and why he does not like being called eccentric. He is the king of the diddymen, the squire of Knotty Ash, the clown with the tickling stick and the owner of the most famous front teeth in the land. If the number of catchphrases is a mark of a comedian's success, Ken Dodd has done well, with such trademark sayings as ""how tickled I am"" and ""by jove missus"" and nonsense concoctions like ""tattyfilarious"" and ""discomknockerated"". At the Museum of Liverpool to launch an exhibition of photographs taken during his career, he fluffs up his hair for the cameras and wields a discomknockeratingly large tickling stick. This is his 60th year as a professional comedian - so has the eccentric image helped his career? The exhibition features photos by the Liverpool Echo's Stephen Shakeshaft ""I'm not eccentric,"" he protests. ""Not in the least."" The funny thing is, he does not appear to be joking. In fact, he seems to take offence at the suggestion. Until now, the interview has been conducted with Dodd, eyes half-closed, recalling early BBC broadcasts from clubs and music halls in the 1950s. But now he is upright, looking me square in the eye. ""I'm better dressed than you. You're wearing denim trousers. You look like an out-of-work plumber. ""I'm not eccentric. Why am I eccentric?"" There is the hair, the outfits, the tickling sticks, I suggest. ""The hair bit - when I was a little boy I always wanted curly hair,"" he replies. ""And part of it is a slight - only a very slight - rebellion. ""I think all comedians are rebellious in various degrees. But I don't think I'm eccentric, no. Not in the least. I think I'm a very, very staid person. Very, very conservative."" Not eccentric? Pull the other one, Doddy. He has cultivated the persona of the daffy professor of comedy since making his professional stage debut in 1954, inspired by the entertainers he saw while growing up in Liverpool. When Dodd was just seven or eight, his parents would take him and his brother and sister on weekly trips to variety theatres in the city. ""Slowly this curtain would go up and you'd be transported into a magical world,"" he recalls. ""Everything was rosy glow. Everything looked wonderful, happy. ""This man came on - he'd wear a check suit with a red face and he'd shout at the audience. He would say things and everybody would fall about laughing. I thought, that's a good job, that's what I want to be."" Today, his live sets are stuffed with affably absurd rapid-fire gags (""On Friday, there was a tap on the front door. That plumber's got a funny sense of humour""), plus slow-building storytelling and sentimental songs, to which he adds humorous lyrics. Dodd became a star on BBC TV and radio in the 1950s At times, his humour is masterful and timeless. At others, it is musty and old-fashioned, often based on ""oo-er-missus"" innuendo or creaky stereotypes of her indoors versus a useless husband. His crowds, largely made up of fans of a certain vintage, do not seem to mind, and the performances on his seemingly never-ending tour still regularly last five hours and more. ""Comedians are jesters and jesters have a fools' licence,"" he says. ""Political correctness doesn't apply to us. We are encouraged to say things that everybody would love to say but are scared stiff of saying. A jester is part-entertainer, part Mr Happy, part-anarchist."" The star often speaks of how there are two Ken Dodds - the comedian and the real man. Asked what the private Ken Dodd does on his days off, he paints a picture of someone who is more serious than his on-stage image might suggest. ""I can sum it up in one word - thinking,"" he replies. ""As you go through life, you're given this wonderful brain to think with. Everybody wants to know the meaning of life. Where we've come from, where we're going to, what we do while we're here. Yeah, there's a lot of philosopher in every person's private life."" Dodd also spends a lot of time researching the history and workings of humour. Dodd will mark 60 years as a professional comedian in 2014 He used to visit a library in every town in which he performed, scouring books about comedy and comedians. ""There are about 22 different rules for creating gags, comedy, jokes,"" he explains. At one point, Dodd mentions in passing how ""the audience are my family"". This is a reference to the fact that has never had children. He has also never married, although he has a long-term fiancee, Anne Jones, a singer, pianist and flautist who is the support act on his tour. The star says he was always ambivalent about having a family of his own, but has recently been reflecting on the subject while thinking about his own parents, who he describes as ""the best mum and dad in the world"". ""I was driving the car about a year ago and suddenly the thought swept over me - by what right did I have to demand that two people, my mother and father, should take care of me, look after me, feed me, clothe me, nurse me when I'm ill? ""We don't have any right to this. The more I think about this, this one word keeps popping up, a word that's much abused and maligned, but the word has been there for centuries - love. ""There are all different kinds of love. Parents must love their children. I don't know. I suppose I would."" In other words, he would have loved his children. He takes a rare pause for thought. ""I love my dog. I love him very, very much,"" he goes on. ""And all the dogs I've ever had, I've always loved them. So I must have the capacity to do it."" The interview time is up and the real Ken Dodd retreats again. Eccentric? Yes. But there is more to him than meets the eye. The exhibition, titled By Jove! It's Ken Dodd!, features photographs by Stephen Shakeshaft and runs at the Museum of Liverpool until 21 April. Dodd 'third best seller of 1960s' By Jove!

Row as Labour MP 'forced' to stand downWork and pensions spokeswoman Debbie Abrahams considers legal action after her party removed her from the front bench.6m7 minutes agoUK Politics,"A row has erupted at the top of the Labour party as a shadow cabinet minister said she had been removed from her post against her will. On Sunday, Labour said Debbie Abrahams had stepped down as spokeswoman on work and pensions while an ""employment issue"" is investigated. But Mrs Abrahams claims that she is the victim of a ""bullying culture of the worst kind"". She rejected the allegations against her ""in the strongest possible terms"". ""I have had no details about the complaint, who it is from, the process or timescales. I have not agreed to stand aside,"" she said in a statement. ""I will fight this spurious claim and do not rule out taking legal action."" Cable denies branding Brexit voters racist Momentum chief quits Labour race Downing Street 'concern' at bullying reports Her comments followed a statement issued by the party which said her deputy Margaret Greenwood would replace her while an inquiry was carried out. The details of the allegations against her are not known although it is understood she believes she is being accused of bullying - a claim she denies. Mrs Abrahams said she had been victim to ""aggressive, intimidating and wholly unprofessional"" treatment by ""certain individuals in the leader's office"" over the last 10 months. Debbie Abrahams became an MP in 2010 after winning a by-election ""My treatment in the last week has shown a bullying culture of the worst kind,"" she said. ""As such I am making a formal complaint to both the Labour party and parliamentary authorities."" Mrs Abrahams became the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth in 2010. She was promoted to the shadow cabinet after last year's general election. One of Mrs Abrahams' colleagues, shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith, said it was important that Labour followed due process and that Mrs Abrahams was made ""fully aware"" of the allegations against her. ""I think what is most important is that people are able to come forward if they do feel things are not right, and to report them,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour. ""But I think until a proper investigation is held it would be very wrong to apportion blame on any side."" She added: ""I hope very much that the party taking this forward will make sure that they do a thorough investigation of all sides and all of the issues that are involved in this particular case.""

Dog 'hanging' video appears on FacebookThe PSNI in north Belfast have appealed for witnesses after the video appeared on Facebook.4h4 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"Buster's owner said he contacted the police because he has nothing to hide A dog owner has spoken of his distress after police investigated claims he hanged his pet. A video posted on social media appeared to show a dog being hanged outside a house in north Belfast. The original story emerged on Sunday, when a video was posted on Facebook. At the time, police described the dog's treatment as a ""horrible crime"" but on Monday they clarified they had visited the owner and the dog was not abused. The 21-second video, taken from behind railings, is thought to have been captured by a passer-by. The man who owns the dog, who wishes only to be known by his first name Andre, contacted the police on Monday morning when a friend told him the police were looking for him. ""Because I have nothing to hide the first thing I did this morning was contact the police,"" he said. A police officer along with an animal welfare officer called to his home, and after showing them the dog they informed him there would be no investigation. Buster is an American bulldog Andre is very disappointed at how this issue has been handled. He strongly believes that if the woman thought he was abusing his dog she should've called the police ""then and there"" instead of uploading a video to social media. He said a group of people came to his home on Sunday evening as they had seen the video on Facebook. ""I showed my dog to the group, and I was able to show them videos of me training my dog, and they then apologised to me. ""I do wonder, if I didn't have my dog with me I might not have been able to explain the situation,"" he said. The woman who recorded the footage claimed the dog was hanging from this frame Andre got Buster when he was a four-month old pup and says he has a passion for the American bulldog breed. ""I got my dog as a companion. Training my dog introduces me to new friends and a new social network. ""Having a dog gives me a purpose - it improves my mental health,"" he added. ""Buster is my best friend. It breaks my heart even being accused of abusing him."" In a Facebook post on Sunday, PSNI North Belfast said the video was ""hard to watch"" and they appealed for witnesses to come forward. However, PSNI Ch Insp Kelly Moore said police visited the dog's owner on Monday morning, along with animal welfare staff from Belfast City Council. ""I can confirm after the visit that the dog is in good health and no abuse had taken place. Rather the dog was being trained and was playing with a toy. ""We are satisfied that no crime has taken place and that the animal is well looked after,"" she added.

Throughout the 1970s and 80s, he was a regular face on TV and worked to a punishing schedule, which he kept throughout his career, seldom taking a holiday. He was famous for his wild hair, buck teeth, Diddymen and infamous ""tickling stick"" But in 1989 Sir Ken faced the possibility of a fall from grace when he was charged with eight counts of tax fraud spanning 15 years and involving more than Â£800,000. He was later acquitted after a 23-day trial, but the court heard a range of stories about his eccentricity, including hiding more than Â£300,000 in wardrobes, cupboards and under stairs. Taking up his career again on his acquittal, Sir Ken enjoyed another season at the London Palladium in 1990 and won a British Comedy Lifetime Achievement Award as well as being voted Top Variety Performer in 1993. In 2011, he unveiled a ""Comedy Carpet"" featuring the catchphrases, jokes and names of more than 1,000 comedians at the foot of Blackpool Tower. Allow Twitter content?

The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit,"How do you get ready for unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men. And is there time? Back in September, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to ""tame"" Donald Trump, deriding the president as a ""mentally deranged US dotard"". President Trump replied by calling Mr Kim a ""maniac"" and a ""madman"", and warning he would be ""tested like never before"". Later they traded barbs over who had a bigger nuclear button. Six months on, those high-stakes playground spats form part of a bizarre diplomatic backdrop to a summit no-one saw coming. Mr Trump surprised the world on Thursday when he announced, via a South Korean official, that he had agreed to meet Mr Kim. The major negotiating point of their meeting will be de-nuclearisation of the North Korean regime. Beyond that, little is yet known about potential objectives and concessions on either side. It is a remarkable gamble by the US president, one that would make him the first American leader to meet a North Korean counterpart. The careful choreography and delicate diplomacy required by international talks have not always come naturally to the Trump team, and now its staff have on their hands one of the most high-profile bilateral summits in US history. The talks are scheduled to take place within two months. For both sides, preparation will be key, but how do you prepare for an unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men? Reading between the lines of talks announcement The South Korean envoys behind a diplomatic breakthrough Kim's concern for South Korean leader's welfare The US will begin with key Korea positions in the state department vacant. Chief North Korea envoy Joseph Yun resigned in February and the widely expected appointment of Victor Cha as ambassador to Seoul fell through the same month, over a policy disagreement. ""I expect they are going to face a few problems,"" said Jim Hoare, a former British charge d'affaires in Pyongyang, of the American effort. ""If they had a proper apparatus to deal with East Asia, it might be different. But they have only an acting officer in charge of East Asian matters, the state department has been battered and there's no ambassador in South Korea. So I don't know who Trump is talking to about North Korea, I'm not sure anybody does."" The decision to agree to the historic meeting is said to have unfolded in an impulsive and haphazard way not uncommon to the new administration. The New York Times reports that the president, upon hearing that South Korean official Chung Eui-yong was in the White House, summoned Mr Chung to the Oval office and asked about Mr Kim. This video can not be played The South's Chung Eui-yong talks to reporters at the White House When Mr Chung said the North Korean leader wanted to meet Mr Trump, the president immediately agreed and told the South Korean official to make the announcement to the press. Not for the first time, Mr Trump's own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, was caught on the hop. ""In terms of direct talks... we're a long ways from negotiations,"" Mr Tillerson had told reporters just hours before the surprise announcement. Previous presidents have resisted visiting North Korea, leery of conferring prestige on the regime. Bill Clinton reportedly considered a trip to Pyongyang in late 2000, shortly after a visit by then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had laid potential groundwork, but ultimately focused on late-term priorities elsewhere. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un ""A meeting with the US president is the coin of the realm,"" said Christopher Hill, a former US ambassador to South Korea, ""and here we have a president just prepared to do it without too many details of what the North Koreans have in mind."" But the president's oft-derided impulsiveness may prove to be an asset in this case, said Stephen Hadley, a former national security adviser to George W Bush. ""His style has already produced a breakthrough,"" said Mr Hadley. ""He was much criticised for rhetoric on North Korea that was viewed as irresponsible and bellicose but it got both North Korea's attention and China's attention. ""The trick now is to convince China that the status quo is not sustainable and convince North Korea that holding on to nuclear weapons might be more of a risk to their security than giving them up. ""And I think Trump's approach has had a pretty good impact in both of those directions already."" The speed of the decision leaves significant details up in the air. The location presents an interesting conundrum. Mr Kim has not left North Korea since becoming leader and is unlikely to accept an invitation to Washington. A visit by Mr Trump to Pyongyang would be a considerable PR gift to the North Koreans and is equally unlikely. ""It's going to be difficult getting the protocol right, who defers to who and under what circumstances etc, so it's important to find a place that's neutral,"" said Mr Hoare. Possible contenders include China, the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas and somewhere in international waters. In 1989, George HW Bush met the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on a Soviet cruise ship off the coast of Malta. More important still than the location for Mr Trump will be a meticulous understanding of both the US and North Korean objectives. For a president known to struggle with dense briefing papers - preferring instead short, image-led presentations - preparation could be a challenge. ""If he doesn't do the homework he's going to have a problem,"" said Mr Hoare. ""He will be facing people who have been working on US matters for years and years and years. They won't speak but they will have briefed Mr Kim very thoroughly."" Another key consideration will be the way things look. The summit will take place in a media ecosystem completely different to that of 1961, when President John Kennedy met Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, or of 1972 when Richard Nixon made his famous overture to China. Every word will be covered in real time on cable news, every stray bit of body language subjected to rigorous analysis. But if Mr Trump can avoid diplomatic gaffes and get along well enough with Mr Kim, his straight-shooting style of politics may prove to be as much of an asset in dealing with North Korea as it has been a liability elsewhere. ""He has already surprised a lot of people by bringing Kim to the table,"" said Mr Hadley. ""It just might be that his unconventional style produces a surprising result from the meeting.""

Momentum chief quits Labour raceJon Lansman is thought to have come under pressure from Jeremy Corbyn to drop general secretary bid.8h8 hours agoUK Politics,"Momentum founder Jon Lansman has dropped his bid for the vacant post of Labour's general secretary. On Twitter, he said he had ""decided to step back from the race"",externalto focus on his role on the party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC). He said he had achieved his aim of sparking debate about the party's governance and encouraging others to stand for general secretary. The Labour leadership favours Unite official Jennie Formby for the role. Mr Lansman is understood to have come under pressure from Jeremy Corbyn to pull out of the race. His surprise entry into the contest to replace Iain McNicol as general secretary sparked concerns about a power struggle between Unite, which is Labour's biggest financial backer, and Momentum, the campaign group set up to support Mr Corbyn's leadership. Mr Lansman has argued for a much greater say for Labour members in the running of the party, including whether the general secretary should be elected by the membership, rather than chosen by the NEC. According the Observer,external, Ms Formby was the ""frontrunner"" for the post but her allies were attempting to calm concerns she would launch a ""clear-out"" of Labour staff deemed to be insufficiently supportive of the leader. In his statement, Mr Lansman said his main aim had been to open the contest up to other contenders. ""Over the last few days, in spite of media reports to the contrary including misogynist attacks on Jennie Formby in today's Observer, NEC members have begun a productive, comradely debate about the future of the party. ""Whether the general secretary should be elected and what a transformed, member-led Labour party would look like are big, urgent questions - and I'm heartened to see members across the country openly debating them."" He said ""a number of party members"" had been in touch with him to say they were considering a bid for the general secretary role. He said would give his ""full support"" to whoever took up the post. But he called for an end to the era of centralised ""command and control"" in the Labour Party, in which the views of members were ""too often ignored"" and over-ruled at the party conference. Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is a member of Labour's NEC, told ITV's Peston on Sunday Labour needed a general secretary that did not just represent one wing of the party. ""We want to see the full suite of candidates and we'll make an informed decision at the time,"" she added.

Degree courses to face gold rating marks,"Degree courses are to be rated for quality, subject by subject, under a new pilot scheme which ministers say leaves universities ""no place to hide"". Individual subjects at different universities will be graded gold, silver or bronze by a new tool feeding in official data on teaching quality. But students will not be able to use the rankings to choose their courses until 2020, when the tool goes live. Universities say the assessment of subjects must be effective. The new system to rate teaching is part of the government's attempt to get tough on universities, which charge students nearly Â£30,000 for a three-year degree, and have come under fire for paying their senior managers very high salaries. The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""Prospective students deserve to know which courses deliver great teaching and great outcomes - and which ones are lagging behind. ""In the age of the student, universities will no longer be able to hide if their teaching quality is not up to the world-class standard that we expect."" The plans, which are to be piloted with 50 universities initially,builds on the new ranking system for universities overall. This is also supported by data from the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) which combines a range of data on course teaching to arrive at the ranking. And there will also be information on which jobs students go on to, how much they earn and how many drop out. A consultation on the way the new framework will operate is being launched and will last 10 weeks. How do you choose a uni course?  It's probably a complex mix of open days and surfing glossy, promotional videos on YouTube. By 2020 the government says information like drop-out rates and graduate earnings could allow comparisons between broadly similar courses at different universities. It will be based on research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the University of Cambridge linking information from school pupils, through student finance to tax records. Experimental statistics comparing universities have already been published.  But to be credible the will have to take a lot into account. One university might admit a lot of students with high grades and well off families who can support them through doing unpaid work experience when they leave. Another may recruit more students from low income families. Many universities recruit largely in their region, and earnings are higher in the south east of England than the North West.  So simple comparisons won't be easy, but the information could help some make a more informed decision. A spokesman for Universities UK said: ""TEF will stand or fall by whether it can provide accurate and meaningful information to inform student choice. ""The assessment of subjects needs to be effective and not overly burdensome."" It added that the independent review of fees, to be held in the next year, would be important in judging the success of the idea. The National Union of Students questioned the depth of the information covered by the grading system. NUS vice-president (higher education) Amatey Doku said: ""Unfortunately the Teaching Excellence Framework does little to measure teaching excellence and extending it to subject-level won't solve the problem. ""The metrics used tell us little about the quality of teaching but instead [it] opens the door for institutions to attempt to game their metrics rather than drive continuous improvement of their teaching practices. ""With the promised independent review into TEF still under way, it is an irresponsible move to make without the recommendations from the review or the input of students' voices.""

Helicopter crashes in New York City riverAt least two people are dead after a light helicopter hit the water near Roosevelt Island.2m3 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played A passer-by filmed as a helicopter crashed into the East River in New York Five people were killed when a helicopter crashed into the East River of New York City on Sunday evening. Divers pulled the five passengers from the aircraft, but two died at the scene while the other three died in hospital. The pilot managed to free himself and was rescued by a passing tugboat after the helicopter crashed near Roosevelt Island. US media report that a passenger's bag may have accidentally hit the fuel shutoff button of the helicopter. Police commissioner James O'Neill told reporters it had been privately leased by a group of photographers. Divers from the emergency services pulled people from the water Video posted on social media showed a red helicopter appearing to make a semi-controlled descent at around 19:00 (23:00 GMT) before landing with some force in the water. It then began to tip over, its rotors still spinning and slicing into the water. New York media identified the pilot as Richard Vance, 33, who was treated and released from hospital. Just before it crashed, the helicopter was pictured over the Statue of Liberty Carla Vallejos Blanco was confirmed by the Argentina consulate to be among the dead He had worked for the New Jersey-based company Liberty Helicopters for ""a couple years"", his father Anthony Vance told the New York Post. According to the company website, Liberty Helicopters is the only helicopter charter in New York City that has a special federal aviation authorisation to fly within 1,000ft (304m) of the Statue of Liberty. New York media named the five dead as Trevor Cadigan, a video journalist from Dallas, Texas, Brian McDaniel, a Texas fireman, Argentine tourist Carla Vallejos Blanco, and two helicopter employees, Daniel Thompson and Tristan Hill. Cadigan (left) had recently moved to New York for a job McDaniel had worked as a firefighter in Texas At a press conference, New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro called the crash a ""great tragedy"".

We're not out of the tunnel yet - HammondThe chancellor says he will not relax his grip on public spending in his spring statement on Tuesday.13h13 hours ago,"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel"" Chancellor Philip Hammond has rejected calls by Labour and some Conservatives to announce the end of austerity in his spring statement on Tuesday. He is expected to unveil the smallest budget deficit since 2002, thanks to better than expected public finances. But he told the BBC national debt was still too high, adding: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel... but we are still in the tunnel at the moment."" Labour has urged him toend the ""pain and misery"" of public spending cuts. Mr Hammond told the Andrew Marr Show it would be wrong to pour ""every penny"" into additional public spending. What not to expect from the spring statement Why is there no Budget this March? UK economic growth exceeds forecasts He said it was ""very important moment"" to see debt starting to fall after growing for 17 continuous years. But he said: ""We should be very careful looking at single sets of figures - one quarter or two quarters - we need to look at what's happening sustainably in the economy."" The day-to-day deficit has been eliminated, it emerged earlier this month, two years later than former chancellor George Osborne had wanted when he set out in 2010. The UK is now running a surplus of Â£3.8bn in its current budget - the money borrowed to fund day-to-day spending rather than long-term investment - according to the Office for National Statistics. ""We have a debt of Â£1.8 trillion - 86.5% of our GDP,"" Mr Hammond said. ""All the international organisations recognise that is higher than the safe level."" Mr Hammond told the BBC that ""we need to get our debt lower"". ""I think most people in this country would be horrified to be reminded that we have Â£65,000 worth of public debt for every household in this country,"" he said. The chancellor is due to announce a half-yearly update of Britain's public finance figures on Tuesday, but confirmed he would not be delivering any new tax or spending measures. ""If there is the flexibility and the space to do something, then we will decide in the autumn how we are going to use that,"" he said. Economists expect the chancellor will announce borrowing is set to be around Â£7bn lower in 2017-18 than had been predicted, when he unveils the latest forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Also appearing on Andrew Marr, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called on the government to end its austerity programme. He said recent economic figures were ""not a matter for celebration"" - and said the chancellor ""should be coming into the real world"". He said Mr Hammond had ""shifted the deficit onto the shoulders of NHS managers, headteachers and onto the shoulders of local government leaders. ""They're facing a financial crisis because of government cutbacks,"" he told Marr. This video can not be played John McDonnell says he won't appear on Russia Today He called thegovernment's plans for an NHS pay deal""miserly and mean-spirited"". ""Pay is at the moment just about matching inflation, that's all,"" he added. Mr McDonnell has called on the government to use its spring statement to end what Labour called an ""immediate crisis"" in public services. But Mr Hammond vowed to ""look at the numbers"" in the autumn Budget. He said: ""Local authorities have done an incredible job in delivering efficiencies,"" adding: ""Of course they're under some pressures"".
