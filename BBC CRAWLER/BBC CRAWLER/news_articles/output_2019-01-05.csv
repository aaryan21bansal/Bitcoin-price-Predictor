'Baby born to vegetative patient' inquiry,"Police in the US state of Arizona have launched a sexual assault investigation amid reports a patient in a vegetative state for a decade gave birth. The woman is a patient in a clinic run by Hacienda HealthCare near Phoenix. Hacienda HealthCare gave no details but said it was aware of a ""deeply disturbing incident"". A local CBS station said the baby was healthy and quoted a source as saying that staff had been unaware the woman was pregnant. The woman has not been identified. A Phoenix police spokesman said that ""the matter is currently under investigation"" but declined to say when the inquiry had started or to give any details of the case. The CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV said the woman had given birth on 29 December. It quoted a source as saying: ""None of the staff were aware that she was pregnant until she was pretty much giving birth."" The source said the woman required round-the-clock care and many people had access to her room. Protocol had changed, the source said, and now men have to be accompanied by a woman on entering the room of a female patient. A Hacienda HealthCare statement read that it had ""recently become aware of a deeply disturbing incident involving the health and safety of a Hacienda resident"". It said it was fully co-operating with the authorities. Hacienda Healthcare spokesman David Leibowitz added that the group was ""fully committed to getting to the truth of what, for us, represents an unprecedented matter"". The Arizona Department of Health Services said it had sent inspectors to check on patients at the facility and had implemented ""heightened safety measures"". On its website, Hacienda HealthCare says,externalit provides care for ""medically fragile and chronically ill infants, children, teens, and young adults as well as those with intellectual and developmental disabilities"".

China's population 'to peak at 1.44bn',"China relaxed its one-child policy in 2015 to combat an ageing population China's population will peak in 2029 at 1.44 billion before beginning a period of ""unstoppable"" decline, a government report says. The China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) study,externalsays the country must implement policies to handle a smaller workforce and an older population. Both changes combined could cause ""very unfavourable social and economic consequences"", the report says. Latest UN estimates say China has a population of 1.41 billion,external. In 2015 the world's most populous country ended its one-child policyin a bid to tackle the problems. What was China's one-child policy? China hints at three-child policy with 'happy family' stamps The study appears in CASS's Green Book of Population and Labour. Working population numbers were now stagnating, it said, with a low fertility rate set to cause further issues. By the middle of the century, China's population is expected to drop to 1.36 billion - a fall in the labour force of close to 200 million. If fertility rates stay low, the population could drop as low as 1.17 billion by 2065. The study also predicted a rise in the dependency rate, meaning the proportion of non-working people like the elderly and children. While relaxing the one-child policy will help long-term, in the short term it will create more dependents, according to the report. Previous forecasts reportedly suggest China's elderly population could hit 400 million by 2035, up from 240 million in 2017. 'Remarkable' decline in fertility rates Mothers, China needs you!

Saudi women to get divorce notice by text,"Saudi women are subject to male guardianship laws A new regulation in Saudi Arabia is set to stop Saudi women from being divorced without their knowledge. Starting from Sunday, courts will be required to notify women by text on rulings confirming their divorces. Local female lawyers suggest the measure will end what are known as secret divorces - cases where men end a marriage without telling their wives. The directive would ensure women are fully aware of their marital status and can protect rights such as alimony. Last year,a decades-old driving ban on women was lifted in Saudi Arabia. However, women still remain subject to male guardianship laws. Saudi women in 'inside-out abaya' protest 'I can't believe I'm driving in Saudi Arabia' Saudi women on what life's really like ""The new measure ensures women get their [alimony] rights when they're divorced,external,"" Saudi lawyer Nisreen al-Ghamdi told Bloomberg. ""It also ensures that any powers of attorney issued before the divorce are not misused."" Many women have filed appeals to courts over being divorced without their knowledge, lawyer Samia al-Hindi told local newspaper Okaz. The new step is said to be part of economic and social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, such as allowing women to attend football matches and work in jobs traditionally reserved for men. There are many things that Saudi women are unable to do without permission from a male guardian, usually a husband, father, brother or son. These things include, but are not limited to: Applying for passports Travelling abroad Getting married Opening a bank account Starting certain businesses Getting elective surgery Leaving prison The guardianship system has helped create one of the most gender unequal countries in the Middle East.

Germany defends handling of data attack,"Angela Merkel, Greens leader Robert Habeck and TV satirist Jan BÃ¶hmermann have all been targeted by the attack Germany's cybersecurity authority has defended its handling of a mass data attack on hundreds of politicians, after criticism it did not tell the police about the breach for weeks. The agency says it was not aware of the full extent of a systematic leak of information until Thursday night. Journalists, celebrities and politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, are among those whose personal data was published online. It is unclear who was responsible. The attacks took place throughout December, but did not become public knowledge until Friday. Hacking of German ministries 'ongoing' Russia 'behind German parliament hack' Data: 'The end of truth as we know it?' The contacts, private chats and financial details of figures from every political party - except the far-right AfD - were posted on Twitter. The interior ministry says there is no evidence that parliamentary or government systems have been compromised - and it is not clear whether the attack was the result of hacking - or someone with access leaking the data. The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) came under fire,externalafter it emerged that they knew about the leak since December, while the Federal Crime Office was only notified on Friday. BSI president Arne Schoenbohm told broadcaster Phoenix that his team ""had already held corresponding talks very early in December with certain members of parliament who were affected"", and launched a ""mobile incident response team"". On Saturday however,the BSI said in a statement it had only known about five isolated cases for weeks,external, and could not connect the dots until Thursday. Dietmar Bartsch, an MP from Die Linke, expressed outrage Earlier, Dietmar Bartsch, parliamentary head of the left-wing Die Linke party, had called the perceived secrecy ""completely unacceptable"" and asked if the office had ""something to hide"". Meanwhile, lawmaker AndrÃ© Han said: ""It makes me unbelievably cross that yet again I've found out about such things from the media - even though I'm a member of the parliamentary monitoring group... the federal government's duty to keep parliament informed still applies between Christmas and the new year."" National and local political figures as well as some TV personalities had their details stolen: Chancellor Angela Merkel: her email address and several letters to and from the chancellor appear to have been published The main parliamentary groups including the ruling centre-right and centre-left parties, as well as The Greens, left-wing Die Linke and FDP. Only AfD appears to have escaped Greens leader Robert Habeck, who had private chats with family members and credit card details posted online Journalists from public broadcasters ARD and ZDF as well as TV satirists Jan BÃ¶hmermann and Christian Ehring, rapper Marteria and rap group K.I.Z, reports say The true extent of damage caused by the leak is not yet known although Justice Minister Katarina Barley said it was a ""serious attack"". ""The people behind this want to damage confidence in our democracy and institutions,"" she said. It is not clear who was behind the attack, although suspicion has fallen on right-wing groups in Germany, as well as Russia. Russia has been accused of cyber-attacks in Germany before, including an attack on the government's IT network last year.

French ministry targeted amid protests,"Barricades, bins and motorcycles were burned during the protests A  French government spokesman was evacuated from his office as violence broke out during ""yellow vests"" protests in Paris and other cities. Benjamin Griveaux said he and his team had had to escape through a back door after a construction vehicle was used to ram the building's entrance. There were clashes between police and protesters on what was the first protest of the new year. President Emmanuel Macron condemned the violence, urging ""debate and dialogue"". What began as a protest about a fuel tax back in November has escalated into widespread anger at rising living costs. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Les gilet jaunes: The full story Scattered 'yellow-vest' protests in France The march in Paris began peacefully but scuffles broke out in the afternoon, with protesters throwing projectiles at riot police who responded with tear gas. Motorcycles and bins were set ablaze, and a river boat caught fire. Mr Griveaux said around a dozen individuals - some wearing black, some in yellow vests - used a small construction vehicle they found in the street to break through the door into the government compound. They also broke some windows and damaged some cars. The door to Mr Griveaux's offices was rammed He and his team were led through a back entrance and took refuge in a hotel nearby. PresidentMacron tweeted his condemnation,external, saying France's ""guardians, its representatives, its symbols"" were being attacked. Protests were also held in La Rochelle (pictured), Bordeaux and Nantes among others Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said some 50,000 people had protested across France on Saturday - higher than last week but smaller than the 280,000 who turned out in November. The protest began as a grassroots French provincial movement with people donning high-visibility jackets, which by law must be carried by every vehicle in France. The movement, which became known as the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vests), broadened to include issues involving families' struggle to make ends meet, with calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. Bigprotests in central Paris in November turned violent. Mr Macron made a raft of economic concessions in December to appease the protesters. But he struck adefiant tone in his new year addressto the nation, saying the government would push on with its reform programme, and would ""make no allowances in guaranteeing public order."" Earlier this week,Eric Drouet, one of the leading public figures in the protests, was arrestedfor a second time on suspicion of organising an unofficial protest in Paris. His arrest prompted one political leader to call it an ""abuse of power"" by the government. He was released the following day. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?

Russia rules out swap deal for spy suspect,"The Whelan family released an undated photo of Paul Whelan Russia has dismissed suggestions that a former US marine accused of spying could be involved in a prisoner swap. Paul Whelan, 48, was detained in Moscow last month. His family says he was simply visiting Russia to attend a wedding. His lawyer had raised the possibility of a prisoner exchange, telling ABC News that ""it is not excluded"" as a means of resolving the case. But a Russian minister now says that it was ""incorrect"" to suggest this idea. ""It is impossible and incorrect to raise the issue in this way, when official charges have not even been put forward yet,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the RIA Novosti news agency on Friday. He added that the situation was ""very serious"". Who is the ex-US Marine arrested in Russia? Russian news agencies, and Mr Whelan's Russian lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, had previously said that the ex-marine had been charged, On Thursday,Mr Zherebenkov also appeared to suggest that a prisoner swap would be possible.,external ""The thing is that in this category of cases, exchanges often happen,"" he told ABC News. ""It is not excluded - such a practice exists. It exists and there are a lot of Russian citizens being held in America."" This video can not be played David Whelan comments on his brother's arrest by Russian authorities Mr Whelan was born in Canada to British parents but moved to the US as a child. He is currently director of global security for Michigan-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner. He is a citizen of four countries - the US, the UK, Canada, and the Irish Republic. Mr Whelan joined the Marine Reserves in 1994 and rose to the rank of staff sergeant in 2004. He served in Iraq for several months in 2004 and 2006. He was convicted in a 2008 court martial on charges related to larceny and received a bad-conduct discharge. Details of the charges have not been made public. His twin brother David Whelan said he had been visiting Russia for business and pleasure since 2007. Mr Whelan arrived in Russia on 22 December to attend a wedding and had planned to visit Russia's second city, St Petersburg, in addition to Moscow before flying home on 6 January, his brother said. He was arrested in Moscow on 28 December, having taken a group of wedding guests on a tour of the Kremlin museums in the morning. He was last heard from in the early evening and failed to show up for the wedding, David Whelan said. He has been charged with espionage and, if found guilty, he could face up to 20 years in jail. Russia's FSB state security agency has given few details, saying only that he was detained ""during an act of espionage"", a wording which implies that he was caught red-handed, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports. Spy scandals have erupted between Russia and America at regular intervals since the Cold War, while Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014, andallegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, have led to strained relations. Meanwhile, Russia has complained that it was not informed when the FBI arrested a Russian man in the Northern Mariana Islands in the north-west Pacific, a US self-governing territory, a week ago.

The Trump of the Tropics?Harbin's beautiful ice festival - in picturesOne of the world's largest ice festivals has opened in north-eastern China.China," The candidate floated above the crowds, carried on their shoulders. The main commercial street in the south-eastern city of Juiz de Fora was packed for his rally. He wore a yellow T-shirt with green block letters - “My party is Brazil”. It was 6 September, three weeks into the most unpredictable presidential campaign in Brazil’s recent history. Jair Bolsonaro had given a thumbs-up to the crowd - smiling at chants of “the captain is back”. Suddenly he clutched his stomach with both hands. Grimacing in pain, he slowly slipped to the ground. Bolsonaro had just been stabbed with a 20cm kitchen knife. A man called Adelio Bispo de Oliveira was nearly lynched by the crowd. The suspect would reportedly later tell police he had acted on “God’s command”. Videos of the attack were watched over and over again by Brazilians. Bolsonaro’s abdomen was punctured and he lost two litres of blood. But as awful as the attack was, it proved to be a turning point for his campaign. Image posted by Bolsonaro's son Flávio on Twitter “You have just elected the president,” his eldest son, Flávio Bolsonaro, wrote on Twitter. A defiant picture showed his father lying in a hospital bed in a blue gown, with tubes sticking into his nose. The candidate did his trademark gesture, pointing his fingers, like pistols. Bolsonaro had been considered too extreme by many, with his broadsides against women, gay people, black people and even democracy, his violent rhetoric against his opponents and his nostalgia for Brazil’s military dictatorship. But he was now the victim of an assassination attempt. The breaking news story was not covered by the media regulations imposed during the campaign. Flávio Bolsonaro outside Santa Casa hospital Under normal circumstances, Bolsonaro and his small Social Liberal Party (PSL) would only have been entitled to very brief TV campaign ads - just eight seconds. But now he was all over the airwaves. “Look what a holy stab that was. It changed everything,” influential pastor Silas Malafaia recalls telling him in a hospital visit. “All people talk about is you.” His contenders were “dying of envy”. According to Malafaia, Bolsonaro chuckled but held back his laughter. It made his stitches hurt. Being injured did something else. It meant Bolsonaro could not take part in televised debates against his rivals. At first this was following clear doctors’ orders - he had suffered very serious injuries. But things didn’t change even after doctors recognised his improvement and said it was his call - the surgeon advised that although he could not stand for long periods he could do a shorter debate while sitting in a comfortable chair. Bolsonaro's campaign pointed out that he still had health problems and discomfort from having a colostomy bag. Bolsonaro avoided additional exposure when he was already leading in the polls. Brazilians elected a president in a run-off vote without ever having seen a face-off between the two final candidates. So how did he get there? Results of Brazil's 2018 presidential election In 1970, troops arrived in the scenic Ribeira Valley in the state of São Paulo, hunting for enemies of the military regime in the woods and farmland around the town of Eldorado. It was the most violent phase of a dictatorship that had started six years earlier with a military coup against President João Goulart. The soldiers in the Ribeira Valley were looking for Carlos Lamarca. The former captain had deserted the army a year earlier to join a leftist guerrilla group and became one of the leaders of the armed struggle against the regime. He had come to Eldorado to set up a training ground in the valley. President Joao Goulart (L) and President Kennedy (R) leaving the White House, 1962 It was Bolsonaro’s home town - he was 15 years old. “[Lamarca] was in the region and injured six soldiers,” Bolsonaro recalled in a 2017 interview. ""He took one of them... as a hostage, and then killed him with strikes of a rifle butt - cowardly.” As the war between the military regime and left-wing guerrilla fighters came near his door, the young Bolsonaro chose his side. “I knew everything in those woods and I passed on information to the soldiers about the places,” he said. He and other young men in the region offered guidance to the army to help find Lamarca’s hideaway. The guerrilla managed to escape, but was killed a year later. As for the boy, he decided to join the army. At 18, Bolsonaro enrolled in the preparatory school for cadets. It was the start of a military career that would mould Bolsonaro’s beliefs. Our Lady of Guidance Church, Eldorado He had been born into a family of six children, descended mostly from Italian immigrants - the surname came from his Venetian great-grandfather, initially spelled Bolzonaro. His father was a dentist, the only one in town, and his mother a housewife. They were not wealthy and rented a simple house by the Ribeira do Iguape river. The young Bolsonaro used to go fishing on the river and extracted heart of palm in the woods to make some money. Palmito, as the inner core of palms is called in Portuguese, was one of his nicknames - he was long, lean and very light-skinned. He helped his father produce dentures for his clinic. And he liked shooting birds with pellet guns and going on hunts for gold in areas that had been mined in the past. Celso Luiz Leite and his wife Maria do Carmo Ferreira Leite Those close to him remember him as a serious young man, a dedicated student. “He wasn’t the party type. He liked doing sports and going fishing,” says Celso Luiz Leite, 63, whose sister is married to one of Bolsonaro’s brothers. “A friend of his told me Jair always said he wanted to be the president of Brazil.” Today the region mostly survives off its abundant banana plantations and some tourism. Bolsonaro’s siblings still live there and are a lot better off - his family now own a number of furniture and construction suppliers. People in Eldorado hope that now he’s president, Bolsonaro won’t forget them. “We have good expectations,” says Antonio Carlos de Melo Cunha, 64, who used to go to school with Bolsonaro. “If he stops all this stealing in politics it’s already an important mark. And I believe he may bring some benefits to our region.” Agulhas Negras Military Academy In 1977, Bolsonaro graduated from Brazil’s Agulhas Negras academy for army officers, three hours away from Rio, in the city of Resende. The writing on the school’s facade summarises their philosophy: “Cadet! You will command. Learn to obey.” There he quickly stood out as an athlete. His speed on the running track and strength in the military pentathlon team earned him the nickname of Cavalão (“Big Horse”). His training continued at the army’s physical education school and then with the Paratrooper Brigade in Rio de Janeiro, where Bolsonaro settled. He rose to the rank of captain. But then he did something officers were not allowed to do - he spoke out. In 1986, he used an article in a news magazine to argue that colleagues were giving up their careers because of inadequate wages. A year later, he came under investigation over graver allegations. The same magazine accused Bolsonaro and a colleague of a plot to plant small explosive devices in military bases - supposedly designed to make a commotion and pressure government officials into raising salaries. Bolsonaro denied the plot. A military council initially ruled that he should be stripped of his post but when his case was sent to the Supreme Military Court he was acquitted. Despite that, his military career was effectively over. And his relationship with the media hadn’t started off well. “He lost his position in the armed forces because of fallacies published by the press,” says journalist Waldir Luiz Ferraz, who has worked with him ever since. “He stood no chance of pursuing a successful military career. So he was advised to go into politics.” Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, 1991 Brazil’s 21-year dictatorship came to an end in 1985 and a new constitution was proclaimed in 1988. It became known as the “citizens’ constitution”. That was also the year Bolsonaro was elected to Rio’s city council. Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, 1991 The former captain’s outspoken demands for higher pay had given him fame among his peers, and earned him support from the military community. “The campaign took lots of hard work,” recalls Ferraz, who did his public relations from then on. “We’d always be up at dawn slipping leaflets under the doors of military houses.” In 1991, Bolsonaro moved on to the lower house of Congress, again boosted by voters from the military. Congressman Chico Alencar entered Rio’s city council in the same year as him and came to have a parallel trajectory in Congress, but on the left. “From the beginning, Bolsonaro emerged as a dictatorship nostalgic and a defender of the military. He was obsessed with attacking what he referred to as subversives from the left,” recalls Alencar, a history teacher as well as a politician. In 1993, Bolsonaro rose to the Congress podium to proclaim: “I am in favour of a dictatorship. We will never resolve serious national problems with this irresponsible democracy.” He was depicted on the front page of O Globo, the Rio newspaper, as a dinosaur in army boots - Stupidosaurus, according to the cartoon. Front page of the O Globo newspaper, 1993 “His views were always very narrow, sectarian,” says Alencar. “He was seen as an eccentric figure - rude, authoritarian, always saying the same things.” Bolsonaro has been married three times, and has five children. His first wife, Rogeria Bolsonaro, was elected a councillor in Rio shortly after he went to Congress. Bolsonaro with three of his sons (L-R): Flávio, Eduardo and Carlos His three older sons, Flavio, Carlos and Eduardo, have followed his steps to form a Bolsonaro political clan. They were all elected lawmakers at early ages. Carlos, now 36, became a city councillor aged 17. “He used to joke and tell me that one day the Bolsonaros would be bigger than [my] PSOL,” says Alencar, referring to his own small Socialism and Liberty Party. Maria do Rosário (L) and Bolsonaro (R) clash once again during a debate at the Brazilian parliament, 2016 It was 2003, Maria do Rosário’s first year as a deputy in Congress, and she had a press interview about her work heading a commission that fought the sexual abuse of children. Bolsonaro was being interviewed before her, inside the Congress building. He was arguing for the reduction of the age of criminal responsibility, based on a recent case of a teenager who had murdered a young couple. But his words had a belligerent tone that shocked Maria do Rosario, she recalls. According to her version, she told him he should calm down, arguing that violence begets more violence. He was enraged. Bolsonaro and Maria do Rosário during an interview on RedeTV!, 2003 “Are you calling me a rapist?” he said, turning to the camera. “She’s calling me a rapist!” And he looked at her: “I would never rape you because you don’t deserve it.” She told him she would slap him if he made any such move. “Do it and I will slap you back,” he shouted, repeating the sentence six times as he pushed her and called hervagabunda- a whore. The episode was one of a long list of past outbursts seized on by critics of Bolsonaro during the presidential election campaign. Bolsonaro during a debate on violence against women in the Brazilianparliament, 2016 Bolsonaro has said he was “proud to be homophobic” and that he’d rather see a son die in an accident than appear with a “moustached” partner. He said he wouldn’t hire a woman for the same salary as a man since they get pregnant. He described “quilombolas”, as descendants of African former slaves are known, as people who “did nothing” and were too fat “even to breed”, criticising how much they cost the government in welfare programmes. Bolsonaro said that Brazil would be a better country if the dictatorship had killed more people, including former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He had also vowed he would shut down Congress “on the same day” if he were ever elected president, referring to parliament as “useless” in a 1999 interview. “Let’s do the coup, already. Let’s go straight to the dictatorship,” he said at the time. Who would elect a president like that, his opponents asked. Pro-Bolsonaro Women's March, 2018 But he struck a chord with supporters - his unfiltered remarks conveyed a frank, no-nonsense image. Like US President Donald Trump, they saw him as someone who spoke his mind - and at times said things many people thought, but were too afraid to say. “Bolsonaro managed to capture a social feeling that was out there,” notes sociologist Esther Solano, a professor at the Federal University of São Paulo and organiser of the book of essays Hate as Politics: The Reinvention of the Right in Brazil, published in Brazil in 2018. “When he makes homophobic or racist jokes, he knows this will raise controversy, but he also knows that many in his ‘base’ will nod approvingly,” says Solano, underlining how conservative many people in Brazil are when it comes to gender, race and class divisions. Electing a president like Bolsonaro might not have been possible a few years ago in Brazil, she says - but after Trump, a new way of doing politics was established. Anti-Bolsonaro's Women's March, 2018 Emphasis on the politically incorrect and on controversy became a form of campaigning. “Trump opened the door to others who wanted to follow,” says Solano. During the campaign, feminist groups organised under the motto #EleNão, “Not Him”, urging voters to choose other candidates. Huge protests were held a week ahead of the first round of votes in over a hundred Brazilian cities. #EleNao, or Not Him, the hashtag of the anti-Bolsonaro Women's March, 2018 Bolsonaro’s allies say the media is hostile towards him and distorts his words, taking them out of context. Joice Hasselmann, a former TV and radio presenter who ran for Congress in 2018 under Bolsonaro’s umbrella, used to think he went too far - until they met four years ago and there was “immediate empathy”. “He’s very different from what you think from what you see on the news,” she says. “He is a big man with a boy’s heart. He’s very sweet and humorous. “Jair is not a good communicator. Sometimes he gets trampled by his words.” Bolsonaro with Joice Hasselmann Lawmaker Alberto Fraga, who was in the same class as Bolsonaro at the army’s physical education school and has shared much of his time in Congress, says “people exaggerate”. “His positions are very clear. But they are also very firm. If he doesn’t agree with something, that’s that. He doesn’t even let the conversation go on,” Fraga says. Congressman Alberto Fraga He describes him as a playful and popular character, who would stop to take pictures with fans in Congress and always had lunch in the cafeteria along with the general staff. Fraga says he witnessed the row between Bolsonaro and Maria do Rosario back in 2003. “She’s the one who called him a rapist. She’s the one who said she would hit him. He said he would hit her back,” he says in his defence. Bolsonaro during a debate in the Brazilian parliament, 2016 “He is like a snake,” says his long-time PR agent Waldir Luiz Ferraz. “When he is attacked, he attacks back. As long as he’s not attacked, he’s really easygoing.” But Do Rosário denies ever having called him a rapist, and says she still suffers attacks from his supporters on the internet. “He adopted the same attitude as men who attack women and then say they are to blame, saying they did it because she deserved it. I’m not willing to accept that,” she says. “He wins discussions by shouting, and that’s how he got elected.” In a green T-shirt, with a backdrop of bushes and clothes lines covered with washing, Bolsonaro started an impassioned campaign speech as birds chirped in the sunny backyard of his home. It was a week before the final vote of the 2018 presidential elections. He shouted into a smartphone while someone filmed him with another. His audience was 500km away from Rio - thousands of followers gathering in São Paulo’s iconic Paulista Avenue. Paulista Avenue “This time, the clean-up will be even greater. This group, if they want to stay, will have to abide by our laws,” he roared. “These red outlaws will be banned from our homeland. Either they go overseas, or they go to jail.” The speech was rapidly shared, and went down with dread or delight, depending on which side of a divided Brazil was watching. The “reds” were the Workers’ Party - the PT - and demonising the left-wing group was a key part of his campaign strategy. Heavy unemployment, economic crises, escalating violence and a series of corruption scandals that discredited the whole political system all provided fertile ground for Bolsonaro. “We have to change all this,” became his informal trademark phrase. “This” included the PT. After winning four presidential elections, the party was tainted by corruption scandals revealed byOperation Car Wash, the investigation which has uncovered a series of kickback schemes involving a number of political parties. To many Brazilians, enthusiasm for the period of growth under former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has long been forgotten, and the PT has become synonymous with corruption and economic crisis as inequality and poverty levels rose. Lula himself was charged with corruption and jailed for 12 years in April 2018. He denies the charges. The economy derailed under Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budget laws. She denies any wrongdoing. The PT offered former São Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad as candidate for 2018’s election - but a big chunk of voters just didn’t want the PT back. Presidential candidate Fernando Haddad (C) Rousseff had been ousted in a controversial process that the left called a “parliamentary coup”, and which deepened social divides between left and right. The mass protests calling for her to be removed were a platform for right-wing groups in Brazil. They grew and became organised, adopting the patriotic green and yellow of the Brazilian flag. Anti-corruption protesters sing the national anthem along Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro Still, Bolsonaro was running for a tiny party and was seen as an unimportant politician who in 27 years in Congress had only approved two minor bills and had rotated between different parties. His ideas were considered too extreme for a viable candidacy at first, but that changed in a time of disillusionment. Other centre-right candidates failed to gain support, and Bolsonaro started to appear as the only right-wing candidate who could beat the Workers’ Party. “Brazilian democracy opened a number of doors and Bolsonaro was able to walk through,” says Timothy Power, director of the Brazilian Studies Programme at the University of Oxford. “You have to give him credit for having very good political instincts. He knew this was the year. His support base was very narrow, but he smelled the blood in the water after the impeachment. “The political system was vulnerable to a clever populist who could create an anti-system and an anti-PT message.” Bolsonaro ran a highly unconventional campaign. He had a small party machine and a paltry campaign budget. He resorted to the power of social media and his knack of speaking directly to his voters in blunt, simple language. Press reports outside Brazil nicknamed him the “Trump of the Tropics”. With a multitude of Tweets and Facebook live videos, he built a solid base of followers - called “Bolsominions” by opponents. He talked about everything - from politics and the electoral race to his recovery in hospital and attacks against the “fake news” media and his opponents. Microphones placed on top of a bodyboard at a press conference held at Bolsonaro's home There were snapshots of his everyday life - like a picture of him seated at a messy breakfast table covered in breadcrumbs, using a can of condensed milk (a national favourite) to spread on bread. “In a period where politicians were being rejected left and right, he got some brownie points for conveying authenticity and for having a very simple set of messages: ‘I’m against corruption. I’m against politicians. I’m against crime, drugs and gangs.’ These things resonate with the public,” says Power. But critics complained about a wave of “fake news” during the campaign, with rumours swirling online - particularly on WhatsApp - about his opponents. Bolsonaro knew things were going well. At every town he travelled to, he was greeted by crowds of frenzied supporters at the airport. I was at one of these receptions and saw him carried on his voters’ shoulders to the chants of “myth”, wrapped in a presidential sash, seven months ahead of the elections. His candidacy was backed by supportive groups in Congress, notably the BBB - the Bible, Bull and Bullet triumvirate - representing the evangelical churches, agribusiness and pro-gun lobbyists. Bolsonaro pledged to ease gun control, so that “honest citizens” could own weapons, and to interrupt demarcation of indigenous land reserves, which scored points with the rural sector. And he embraced a conservative moral agenda together with evangelical groups in Congress, standing for the values of the “traditional family” and “the innocence of children”. This alliance had been strengthened when Bolsonaro and pastors in Congress joined to condemn a package of educational material that the Dilma Rousseff government tried to introduce in 2011, to tackle homophobia in schools. They called it the “gay kit” and said it would teach children how to be homosexuals. The material ended up being dropped. Bolsonaro was raised a Catholic, but was symbolically baptised in Israel’s Jordan River by an evangelical pastor in 2017. His campaign motto was: “Brazil above all, God above everyone.” “We share the same views and the same agendas,” says pastor Silas Malafaia, who performed Bolsonaro’s wedding ceremony to the now first lady Michelle Bolsonaro in 2013. First lady Michelle and the president “We’re all against abortion, gender ideology, gay marriage. The left-wing governments were attacking our moral values,” he says. As the race progressed, Bolsonaro started to appear as the only right-wing candidate who could beat the Workers’ Party. Winning over business leaders was largely down to his economic guru, Paulo Guedes, a free-market advocate who earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago. Guedes, now minister of economy, made Bolsonaro appeal to Brazilians who wanted to see liberal economic policies implemented. Bolsonaro himself admits he doesn’t understand economics. “He knows his limitations. He’s a very humble and simple man,” says pastor Malafaia. After Bolsonaro won, he recalls his words to him. “I’m like the Beetle that made it into a Formula 1 race and won. The improbable of the improbable,” he told the pastor. They both laughed. Bolsonaro and his wife Michelle arrive at the Planalto presidential palace On 28 October, as soon as Bolsonaro learned he had won, he did a Facebook live. At his home in Rio, he sat with his wife on one side, a sign language interpreter on the other, and carefully chosen books on the desk: The Bible, Brazil’s constitution, World War II memoirs by Winston Churchill and a collection of articles by Olavo de Carvalho, a self-taught philosopher who has become a guru to Brazil’s right-wing. He thanked God, the medical team that had “operated a miracle” in saving his life, and his loyal followers on the internet. He hadn’t gone for the presidency out of personal ambition, “but out of the certainty that we could change Brazil’s destiny,” he said. Maintaining a stern expression, he declared: “God clearly has a purpose for me and for all of us in Brazil.” He then prayed in a circle with his allies. Only after that did he make an official, nationwide TV-address. Bolsonaro’s first moments as president-elect reflected his strong allegiance to his followers both on social media and in evangelical groups. But in an attempt to dispel fears raised by his controversial history, he vowed to respect the constitution and democratic rule, and to govern for the country as a whole. “We will offer you a decent government, which will truly work for all Brazilians.” Celebrations outside Bolsonaro's house in Rio. Placard reads: ""Bolsonaro you're the man"" Outside his house in Rio, on the beachfront, the party exploded. Supporters lit fireworks, sang the national anthem and wrapped themselves in the Brazilian flag. Vendors sold inflatable dolls depicting former President Lula in a black and white prison uniform, and key rings showing Bolsonaro wearing sunglasses, a presidential sash and pointing his fingers. “We are just so thrilled that he won. We defeated communism!” a woman told me in the middle of the crowd outside, waving a flag and wearing a T-shirt with the slogan BolsoMito - “BolsoMyth”. Over the past months, Brazilians have watched as Bolsonaro made his first moves as a president who promised to change the way politics is conducted in Brazil. One by one, he announced his ministers on Twitter. He had promised to reduce his cabinet from 29 to 15 ministries - he ended up stopping at 22 in total. The cabinet he built around him reflects his views about the military, his moral values and his contempt for the left-wing governments of the PT. It includes a Ministry for Women, Family and Human Rights, led by a female, anti-abortion evangelical pastor; an environment minister who says global warming is a “secondary issue”; and a foreign minister who has promised to “help Brazil and the world liberate themselves from globalist ideology”. Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights Damares Alves After South America’s wave of left-wing governments in the mid-2000s, Bolsonaro’s foreign policy now signals an alignment with an emerging global right. Trump called to congratulate Bolsonaro straight after his election and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu andHungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbántravelled to the presidential inauguration on 1 January. As well as Bolsonaro himself, seven of his ministers and his vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, have military backgrounds. First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro (L), Jair Bolsonaro (C) and Vice-President Hamilton Mourão (R) during their inauguration ceremony Appointed head of the presidential office for national security, retired Army General Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira says in no way does this make it a “military government”. “I hope people understand that he is a president for all Brazilians,” says the general, who commanded a UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti and is an old friend of Bolsonaro’s. Newly appointed Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni (L) and head of the Office for National Security, retired army general Augusto Heleno (R) Bolsonaro takes on the post with huge challenges ahead for Brazil. The country has seen a sluggish recovery from recession and growth is expected to stay at 1% this year. Its debt is among the highest in any emerging economy. Unemployment has reached 12 million and crime rates have been rising year after year - with 63,000 homicides across the country in 2017. Bolsonaro has pledged to implement pension reform to reduce government spending and achieve fiscal balance. But this is a highly unpopular measure that requires two-thirds support in Congress - and he has kept to a campaign promise of not distributing seats to potential allies in parliament, which may create challenges for governance in the future. “He will now have to make alliances, form coalitions, work with different parties on the floor of Congress,” says Timothy Power. If part of Brazil has high hopes for the former captain, another part is deeply worried about how his ideas will play out into policies. On his first day in office, Bolsonaro adjusted Brazil’s minimum wage, with an increase that was slightly lower than expected - reflecting new inflation estimates. He made it harder to create reserves for indigenous communities and descendants of slaves. He removed any mention of LGBT concerns from national human rights directives. Bolsonaro receives the presidential sash Brazil’s stock market closed at an all-time high on the next day, after ministers reinforced their pledge to privatise state-owned companies and with hopes of a turnaround in Latin America’s biggest economy. Areas of special concern include the environment and the protection of the rainforest and of Brazil’s indigenous people, human rights, social benefits, education, and the freedom of press, schools and academia. With his attacks against the “fake news media” and pledges to tackle “political indoctrination” by school teachers, there are fears of restrictions in freedom of thought. There is also anxiety about whether his government could impact the rights of women, black people, LGBT people, and indigenous people. During the campaign he said minorities would have to “bow to the majority… or disappear”. Crowds gather for Bolsonaro's swearing-in ceremony “A campaign is a campaign,” says General Augusto Heleno. “Now it’s important to think positive, especially with the situation Brazil is in. The country was put on the verge of the abyss economically, politically and socially. We need to rebuild Brazil. “I hope he may surprise the part of the population that did not vote for him.” Correction: This story has been amended to reflect that the minimum wage was not reduced;it wasincreased by a slightly lower than anticipated amount.

German mass data attack 'known for weeks',"Angela Merkel, Greens leader Robert Habeck and TV satirist Jan BÃ¶hmermann have all been targeted by the attack Germany's cybersecurity authority has defended its handling of a mass data attack on hundreds of politicians, after criticism it did not tell the police about the breach for weeks. The agency says it was not aware of the full extent of a systematic leak of information until Thursday night. Journalists, celebrities and politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, are among those whose personal data was published online. It is unclear who was responsible. The attacks took place throughout December, but did not become public knowledge until Friday. Hacking of German ministries 'ongoing' Russia 'behind German parliament hack' Data: 'The end of truth as we know it?' The contacts, private chats and financial details of figures from every political party - except the far-right AfD - were posted on Twitter. The interior ministry says there is no evidence that parliamentary or government systems have been compromised - and it is not clear whether the attack was the result of hacking - or someone with access leaking the data. The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) came under fire,externalafter it emerged that they knew about the leak since December, while the Federal Crime Office was only notified on Friday. BSI president Arne Schoenbohm told broadcaster Phoenix that his team ""had already held corresponding talks very early in December with certain members of parliament who were affected"", and launched a ""mobile incident response team"". On Saturday however,the BSI said in a statement it had only known about five isolated cases for weeks,external, and could not connect the dots until Thursday. Dietmar Bartsch, an MP from Die Linke, expressed outrage Earlier, Dietmar Bartsch, parliamentary head of the left-wing Die Linke party, had called the perceived secrecy ""completely unacceptable"" and asked if the office had ""something to hide"". Meanwhile, lawmaker AndrÃ© Han said: ""It makes me unbelievably cross that yet again I've found out about such things from the media - even though I'm a member of the parliamentary monitoring group... the federal government's duty to keep parliament informed still applies between Christmas and the new year."" National and local political figures as well as some TV personalities had their details stolen: Chancellor Angela Merkel: her email address and several letters to and from the chancellor appear to have been published The main parliamentary groups including the ruling centre-right and centre-left parties, as well as The Greens, left-wing Die Linke and FDP. Only AfD appears to have escaped Greens leader Robert Habeck, who had private chats with family members and credit card details posted online Journalists from public broadcasters ARD and ZDF as well as TV satirists Jan BÃ¶hmermann and Christian Ehring, rapper Marteria and rap group K.I.Z, reports say The true extent of damage caused by the leak is not yet known although Justice Minister Katarina Barley said it was a ""serious attack"".

Japan sushi boss pays record tuna price,"This video can not be played ""Tuna King"" Kiyoshi Kimura on his most expensive fish A Japanese sushi boss has paid a record $3.1m (Â£2.5m) for a giant tuna at the first new year's auction in Tokyo's new fish market. Self-styled ""Tuna King"" Kiyoshi Kimura bought the 278kg (612lbs) bluefin tuna, which is an endangered species. He spent more than twice the previous record of $1.4m, which he paid in 2013. Wholesalers and sushi company owners often pay high prices for the best fish at the first pre-dawn auction of the new year. ""I bought a good tuna,"" Mr Kimura told AFP after the auction. Warming seas linked to UK bluefin tuna surge 'I battled giant tuna for four hours and let it go' ""The price was higher than originally thought, but I hope our customers will eat this excellent tuna."" Mr Kimura has been the highest bidder at the new year auction for seven of the past eight years. By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo On a normal day a similar sized fish would sell for around $60,000. Today's record is in part about status - and it creates a lot of publicity for Mr Kimura and his sushi empire. But it is also a reflection of the scarcity of large Pacific bluefin tuna. They are officially listed by the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) as an endangered species. In 2018 catches off the coast of Japan were significantly down, and since the middle of last year prices in Tokyo have climbed by more than 40%. The 2019 auction is the first new year sale to take place at the new fish market on the site of a former gas plant in Toyosu, which opened in October. The first auction of the new year sees the best fish command high prices The previous site at Tsukiji opened in 1935 and became the world's biggest fish market and a popular tourist attraction. However issues including concerns about outdated fire regulations and hygiene controls prompted the market to be moved to a larger and more modern site. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike attended the new year market at Toyosu The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species says Atlantic Bluefin are endangered while the Pacific Bluefin are vulnerable. Last monthJapan announced it would restart commercial whaling. The country said it would withdraw from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which banned commercial whaling in 1986 after some species were driven almost to extinction. Conservation groups have warned that the move will have serious consequences.

Out with a Wimpy - city says goodbye to burger joint,"Akram Malik has worked at the Broadmarsh branch since 1983 People are saying an emotional farewell to a fast food restaurant which has been a Nottingham landmark for decades. Wimpy opened in the Broadmarsh shopping centre in 1975 and has been run by the same manager, Akram Malik, since 1983. Loyal customers have expressed their sadness, with one revealing he had proposed to his wife there. Mr Malik, who said he would miss the crowds and atmosphere, said the move is due to wider redevelopment plans and other branches remain open. ""People have grown up coming here, they have moved away, worked abroad, come back and said 'oh God, Wimpy is still here',"" Mr Malik said. ""It might not be the end, maybe the end for me here but maybe it will be coming back."" A small number of customers came out to visit the branch on Saturday before it closed Apost about the closure,externalon the BBC Radio Nottingham Facebook page has attracted hundreds of comments, most reflecting the part it had played in their lives and wishing Mr Malik well. But few have the sentimental connection of Barry and Jayne Pickard, who had memorable afternoon 27 years ago. Mr Pickard said: ""We had gone for some shopping and me and Jayne had been together for a couple of months. ""I decided I would get a ring and propose, and where better to do it than the Wimpy in the Broadmarsh? ""I had my two daughters with me and I thought it was best to do it there and then and then I could decide whether I paid for her Wimpy or not."" Wimpy has been serving burgers in the UK since 1954 Wimpy opened in the UK in 1954 at Lyon's Corner House in London During the 1970s, it had more than 1,000 branches across 23 countries It became the first major fast food chain to offer a meat or fish-free burger in 1985 There are 67 branches still open in England Essex has the most locations with 18 A high street staple up and down the country - Wimpy Margate in 2011 Wimpy has been asked to move by the centre's owners, Intu, ahead of a redevelopment of the site.

Trump threatens 'national emergency'The US president says he could use the measure to bypass Congress and build a border wall.US & Canada,"This video can not be played President Trump confirms he's prepared to shut down the government for months or years US President Donald Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a US-Mexico border wall without the approval of Congress. It came after he met senior Democrats, who refused his requests for funding. The stand-off has seen Mr Trump withhold support for a bill to fully fund the government until he gets money for the border wall. He said he was prepared for the partial government shutdown - now in its third week - to last years. Around 800,000 federal workers have been without pay since 22 December. The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress Trump aides and lawmakers will meet later on Saturday in a fresh bid to resolve the impasse. The Republican president initially gave a positive account of the 90-minute meeting at the White House, describing it as ""very productive"". But when asked whether he had considered using emergency presidential powers to bypass congressional approval of funding, Mr Trump said he had. ""I may do it. We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That's another way of doing it."" Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walk out of the West Wing ""I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing,"" the president added. ""I don't call it a shutdown, I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and safety of our country."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday's meeting had been ""contentious"", while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""We told the president we needed the government open. He resisted."" Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington Donald Trump says he can declare a ""national emergency"" and build his promised wall along the border without congressional approval. If that's the case, the question becomes why he doesn't go ahead and do that. Why put federal workers through the pain of forgoing pay and hamstring key government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, if he could bypass Democratic objections with the snap of his presidential fingers? The answer is because the solution isn't that simple. There are provisions of US law that allow the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from Defence Department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes. Such a move may prompt Congress, including Republicans, to push back. Then there's the inevitable legal challenge from Democrats to such an exercise of presidential authority. Any presidential order to build a wall would be met by an equally imposing wall of court filings blocking its construction. The president's latest suggestions are best viewed as simply another attempt to gain the upper hand in negotiations with Democrats. This may not be a threat, more a bluff. Democrats, who now hold the majority in the House, passed spending bills on Thursday to reopen the government, including $1.3bn (Â£1bn) of border security funds until 8 February. But the legislation cannot take effect unless it passes the Republican-controlled Senate, where leader Mitch McConnell said his party would not back any measure without the president's support. This video can not be played Five historic moments as new US Congress opens The Kentucky senator called the Democratic budget ""a time-wasting act of political posturing"". In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump also told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 raise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown. The fiscal fiasco began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Two vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 - Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine - have broken ranks to back approving the budget and ending the shutdown. The White House is again floating the idea of a deal for ""Dreamers"" - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding. Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being ""talked about"", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible ""without a wall"".

Watson 'optimistic' at Time's Up progress,"Actress Emma Watson says she is ""optimistic"" about a ""fairer future"" for women - a year after backing an initiative to combat sexual harassment. In anInstagram post,external, the British star said she has been ""so inspired"" by the achievements of Time's Up. More than 300 actresses, writers and directors launched the project last January in the wake of allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Its fund provides legal help to US women targeted in the workplace. Stars' #MeToo fund gives Â£1m to UK victims Hollywood women launch anti-abuse campaign Mr Weinstein faces charges in New York involving alleged sex assaults on two women, which he denies. He has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women and also faces additional investigations by the US federal government. Watson, who starred in the Harry Potter films and Disney's Beauty and the Beast, is pictured wearing a Time's Up T-shirt in her post. Allow Instagram content?

""Gender equality can only become a reality if we harness the transformative power of solidarity across professions and across borders. ""There's still a long way to go, but the achievements so far make me optimistic for a fairer future. 2018 was just the beginning."" Mr Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex As of December,Time's Up,externalhad attracted $22m (Â£17m) in donations, and the services of hundreds of volunteer lawyers. The campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria, Emma Stone and America Ferrera, was announced via a full-page advert printed in the New York Times on 1 January 2018. It is aimed primarily at those victims of sexual harassment unable to pay for legal support themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses. Time's Up also calls for ""gender inequality and the imbalance of power"" to be addressed, emphasising the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay. Watson, 28, has been a prominent supporter of the organisation since its inception. In February, shealso donated Â£1m to a UK version of the campaign, and at the Oscars ceremony a month later,showed off a fake Time's Up tattoo- complete with typo - on her arm. 2017 saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment. The term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity.

I don't think it was a deliberate attempt to foul but it is one that you can give a red card for and the referee had no choice. ""The only positive that you get from the game is that you actually win it in the end. You spend 90 minutes bashing your head at the wall. It doesn't make for the greatest spectacle or for the best viewing for a coach on the sidelines. ""But we did keep trying.

The Trump of the Tropics?," The candidate floated above the crowds, carried on their shoulders. The main commercial street in the south-eastern city of Juiz de Fora was packed for his rally. He wore a yellow T-shirt with green block letters - “My party is Brazil”. It was 6 September, three weeks into the most unpredictable presidential campaign in Brazil’s recent history. Jair Bolsonaro had given a thumbs-up to the crowd - smiling at chants of “the captain is back”. Suddenly he clutched his stomach with both hands. Grimacing in pain, he slowly slipped to the ground. Bolsonaro had just been stabbed with a 20cm kitchen knife. A man called Adelio Bispo de Oliveira was nearly lynched by the crowd. The suspect would reportedly later tell police he had acted on “God’s command”. Videos of the attack were watched over and over again by Brazilians. Bolsonaro’s abdomen was punctured and he lost two litres of blood. But as awful as the attack was, it proved to be a turning point for his campaign. Image posted by Bolsonaro's son Flávio on Twitter “You have just elected the president,” his eldest son, Flávio Bolsonaro, wrote on Twitter. A defiant picture showed his father lying in a hospital bed in a blue gown, with tubes sticking into his nose. The candidate did his trademark gesture, pointing his fingers, like pistols. Bolsonaro had been considered too extreme by many, with his broadsides against women, gay people, black people and even democracy, his violent rhetoric against his opponents and his nostalgia for Brazil’s military dictatorship. But he was now the victim of an assassination attempt. The breaking news story was not covered by the media regulations imposed during the campaign. Flávio Bolsonaro outside Santa Casa hospital Under normal circumstances, Bolsonaro and his small Social Liberal Party (PSL) would only have been entitled to very brief TV campaign ads - just eight seconds. But now he was all over the airwaves. “Look what a holy stab that was. It changed everything,” influential pastor Silas Malafaia recalls telling him in a hospital visit. “All people talk about is you.” His contenders were “dying of envy”. According to Malafaia, Bolsonaro chuckled but held back his laughter. It made his stitches hurt. Being injured did something else. It meant Bolsonaro could not take part in televised debates against his rivals. At first this was following clear doctors’ orders - he had suffered very serious injuries. But things didn’t change even after doctors recognised his improvement and said it was his call - the surgeon advised that although he could not stand for long periods he could do a shorter debate while sitting in a comfortable chair. Bolsonaro's campaign pointed out that he still had health problems and discomfort from having a colostomy bag. Bolsonaro avoided additional exposure when he was already leading in the polls. Brazilians elected a president in a run-off vote without ever having seen a face-off between the two final candidates. So how did he get there? Results of Brazil's 2018 presidential election In 1970, troops arrived in the scenic Ribeira Valley in the state of São Paulo, hunting for enemies of the military regime in the woods and farmland around the town of Eldorado. It was the most violent phase of a dictatorship that had started six years earlier with a military coup against President João Goulart. The soldiers in the Ribeira Valley were looking for Carlos Lamarca. The former captain had deserted the army a year earlier to join a leftist guerrilla group and became one of the leaders of the armed struggle against the regime. He had come to Eldorado to set up a training ground in the valley. President Joao Goulart (L) and President Kennedy (R) leaving the White House, 1962 It was Bolsonaro’s home town - he was 15 years old. “[Lamarca] was in the region and injured six soldiers,” Bolsonaro recalled in a 2017 interview. ""He took one of them... as a hostage, and then killed him with strikes of a rifle butt - cowardly.” As the war between the military regime and left-wing guerrilla fighters came near his door, the young Bolsonaro chose his side. “I knew everything in those woods and I passed on information to the soldiers about the places,” he said. He and other young men in the region offered guidance to the army to help find Lamarca’s hideaway. The guerrilla managed to escape, but was killed a year later. As for the boy, he decided to join the army. At 18, Bolsonaro enrolled in the preparatory school for cadets. It was the start of a military career that would mould Bolsonaro’s beliefs. Our Lady of Guidance Church, Eldorado He had been born into a family of six children, descended mostly from Italian immigrants - the surname came from his Venetian great-grandfather, initially spelled Bolzonaro. His father was a dentist, the only one in town, and his mother a housewife. They were not wealthy and rented a simple house by the Ribeira do Iguape river. The young Bolsonaro used to go fishing on the river and extracted heart of palm in the woods to make some money. Palmito, as the inner core of palms is called in Portuguese, was one of his nicknames - he was long, lean and very light-skinned. He helped his father produce dentures for his clinic. And he liked shooting birds with pellet guns and going on hunts for gold in areas that had been mined in the past. Celso Luiz Leite and his wife Maria do Carmo Ferreira Leite Those close to him remember him as a serious young man, a dedicated student. “He wasn’t the party type. He liked doing sports and going fishing,” says Celso Luiz Leite, 63, whose sister is married to one of Bolsonaro’s brothers. “A friend of his told me Jair always said he wanted to be the president of Brazil.” Today the region mostly survives off its abundant banana plantations and some tourism. Bolsonaro’s siblings still live there and are a lot better off - his family now own a number of furniture and construction suppliers. People in Eldorado hope that now he’s president, Bolsonaro won’t forget them. “We have good expectations,” says Antonio Carlos de Melo Cunha, 64, who used to go to school with Bolsonaro. “If he stops all this stealing in politics it’s already an important mark. And I believe he may bring some benefits to our region.” Agulhas Negras Military Academy In 1977, Bolsonaro graduated from Brazil’s Agulhas Negras academy for army officers, three hours away from Rio, in the city of Resende. The writing on the school’s facade summarises their philosophy: “Cadet! You will command. Learn to obey.” There he quickly stood out as an athlete. His speed on the running track and strength in the military pentathlon team earned him the nickname of Cavalão (“Big Horse”). His training continued at the army’s physical education school and then with the Paratrooper Brigade in Rio de Janeiro, where Bolsonaro settled. He rose to the rank of captain. But then he did something officers were not allowed to do - he spoke out. In 1986, he used an article in a news magazine to argue that colleagues were giving up their careers because of inadequate wages. A year later, he came under investigation over graver allegations. The same magazine accused Bolsonaro and a colleague of a plot to plant small explosive devices in military bases - supposedly designed to make a commotion and pressure government officials into raising salaries. Bolsonaro denied the plot. A military council initially ruled that he should be stripped of his post but when his case was sent to the Supreme Military Court he was acquitted. Despite that, his military career was effectively over. And his relationship with the media hadn’t started off well. “He lost his position in the armed forces because of fallacies published by the press,” says journalist Waldir Luiz Ferraz, who has worked with him ever since. “He stood no chance of pursuing a successful military career. So he was advised to go into politics.” Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, 1991 Brazil’s 21-year dictatorship came to an end in 1985 and a new constitution was proclaimed in 1988. It became known as the “citizens’ constitution”. That was also the year Bolsonaro was elected to Rio’s city council. Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, 1991 The former captain’s outspoken demands for higher pay had given him fame among his peers, and earned him support from the military community. “The campaign took lots of hard work,” recalls Ferraz, who did his public relations from then on. “We’d always be up at dawn slipping leaflets under the doors of military houses.” In 1991, Bolsonaro moved on to the lower house of Congress, again boosted by voters from the military. Congressman Chico Alencar entered Rio’s city council in the same year as him and came to have a parallel trajectory in Congress, but on the left. “From the beginning, Bolsonaro emerged as a dictatorship nostalgic and a defender of the military. He was obsessed with attacking what he referred to as subversives from the left,” recalls Alencar, a history teacher as well as a politician. In 1993, Bolsonaro rose to the Congress podium to proclaim: “I am in favour of a dictatorship. We will never resolve serious national problems with this irresponsible democracy.” He was depicted on the front page of O Globo, the Rio newspaper, as a dinosaur in army boots - Stupidosaurus, according to the cartoon. Front page of the O Globo newspaper, 1993 “His views were always very narrow, sectarian,” says Alencar. “He was seen as an eccentric figure - rude, authoritarian, always saying the same things.” Bolsonaro has been married three times, and has five children. His first wife, Rogeria Bolsonaro, was elected a councillor in Rio shortly after he went to Congress. Bolsonaro with three of his sons (L-R): Flávio, Eduardo and Carlos His three older sons, Flavio, Carlos and Eduardo, have followed his steps to form a Bolsonaro political clan. They were all elected lawmakers at early ages. Carlos, now 36, became a city councillor aged 17. “He used to joke and tell me that one day the Bolsonaros would be bigger than [my] PSOL,” says Alencar, referring to his own small Socialism and Liberty Party. Maria do Rosário (L) and Bolsonaro (R) clash once again during a debate at the Brazilian parliament, 2016 It was 2003, Maria do Rosário’s first year as a deputy in Congress, and she had a press interview about her work heading a commission that fought the sexual abuse of children. Bolsonaro was being interviewed before her, inside the Congress building. He was arguing for the reduction of the age of criminal responsibility, based on a recent case of a teenager who had murdered a young couple. But his words had a belligerent tone that shocked Maria do Rosario, she recalls. According to her version, she told him he should calm down, arguing that violence begets more violence. He was enraged. Bolsonaro and Maria do Rosário during an interview on RedeTV!, 2003 “Are you calling me a rapist?” he said, turning to the camera. “She’s calling me a rapist!” And he looked at her: “I would never rape you because you don’t deserve it.” She told him she would slap him if he made any such move. “Do it and I will slap you back,” he shouted, repeating the sentence six times as he pushed her and called hervagabunda- a whore. The episode was one of a long list of past outbursts seized on by critics of Bolsonaro during the presidential election campaign. Bolsonaro during a debate on violence against women in the Brazilianparliament, 2016 Bolsonaro has said he was “proud to be homophobic” and that he’d rather see a son die in an accident than appear with a “moustached” partner. He said he wouldn’t hire a woman for the same salary as a man since they get pregnant. He described “quilombolas”, as descendants of African former slaves are known, as people who “did nothing” and were too fat “even to breed”, criticising how much they cost the government in welfare programmes. Bolsonaro said that Brazil would be a better country if the dictatorship had killed more people, including former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He had also vowed he would shut down Congress “on the same day” if he were ever elected president, referring to parliament as “useless” in a 1999 interview. “Let’s do the coup, already. Let’s go straight to the dictatorship,” he said at the time. Who would elect a president like that, his opponents asked. Pro-Bolsonaro Women's March, 2018 But he struck a chord with supporters - his unfiltered remarks conveyed a frank, no-nonsense image. Like US President Donald Trump, they saw him as someone who spoke his mind - and at times said things many people thought, but were too afraid to say. “Bolsonaro managed to capture a social feeling that was out there,” notes sociologist Esther Solano, a professor at the Federal University of São Paulo and organiser of the book of essays Hate as Politics: The Reinvention of the Right in Brazil, published in Brazil in 2018. “When he makes homophobic or racist jokes, he knows this will raise controversy, but he also knows that many in his ‘base’ will nod approvingly,” says Solano, underlining how conservative many people in Brazil are when it comes to gender, race and class divisions. Electing a president like Bolsonaro might not have been possible a few years ago in Brazil, she says - but after Trump, a new way of doing politics was established. Anti-Bolsonaro's Women's March, 2018 Emphasis on the politically incorrect and on controversy became a form of campaigning. “Trump opened the door to others who wanted to follow,” says Solano. During the campaign, feminist groups organised under the motto #EleNão, “Not Him”, urging voters to choose other candidates. Huge protests were held a week ahead of the first round of votes in over a hundred Brazilian cities. #EleNao, or Not Him, the hashtag of the anti-Bolsonaro Women's March, 2018 Bolsonaro’s allies say the media is hostile towards him and distorts his words, taking them out of context. Joice Hasselmann, a former TV and radio presenter who ran for Congress in 2018 under Bolsonaro’s umbrella, used to think he went too far - until they met four years ago and there was “immediate empathy”. “He’s very different from what you think from what you see on the news,” she says. “He is a big man with a boy’s heart. He’s very sweet and humorous. “Jair is not a good communicator. Sometimes he gets trampled by his words.” Bolsonaro with Joice Hasselmann Lawmaker Alberto Fraga, who was in the same class as Bolsonaro at the army’s physical education school and has shared much of his time in Congress, says “people exaggerate”. “His positions are very clear. But they are also very firm. If he doesn’t agree with something, that’s that. He doesn’t even let the conversation go on,” Fraga says. Congressman Alberto Fraga He describes him as a playful and popular character, who would stop to take pictures with fans in Congress and always had lunch in the cafeteria along with the general staff. Fraga says he witnessed the row between Bolsonaro and Maria do Rosario back in 2003. “She’s the one who called him a rapist. She’s the one who said she would hit him. He said he would hit her back,” he says in his defence. Bolsonaro during a debate in the Brazilian parliament, 2016 “He is like a snake,” says his long-time PR agent Waldir Luiz Ferraz. “When he is attacked, he attacks back. As long as he’s not attacked, he’s really easygoing.” But Do Rosário denies ever having called him a rapist, and says she still suffers attacks from his supporters on the internet. “He adopted the same attitude as men who attack women and then say they are to blame, saying they did it because she deserved it. I’m not willing to accept that,” she says. “He wins discussions by shouting, and that’s how he got elected.” In a green T-shirt, with a backdrop of bushes and clothes lines covered with washing, Bolsonaro started an impassioned campaign speech as birds chirped in the sunny backyard of his home. It was a week before the final vote of the 2018 presidential elections. He shouted into a smartphone while someone filmed him with another. His audience was 500km away from Rio - thousands of followers gathering in São Paulo’s iconic Paulista Avenue. Paulista Avenue “This time, the clean-up will be even greater. This group, if they want to stay, will have to abide by our laws,” he roared. “These red outlaws will be banned from our homeland. Either they go overseas, or they go to jail.” The speech was rapidly shared, and went down with dread or delight, depending on which side of a divided Brazil was watching. The “reds” were the Workers’ Party - the PT - and demonising the left-wing group was a key part of his campaign strategy. Heavy unemployment, economic crises, escalating violence and a series of corruption scandals that discredited the whole political system all provided fertile ground for Bolsonaro. “We have to change all this,” became his informal trademark phrase. “This” included the PT. After winning four presidential elections, the party was tainted by corruption scandals revealed byOperation Car Wash, the investigation which has uncovered a series of kickback schemes involving a number of political parties. To many Brazilians, enthusiasm for the period of growth under former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has long been forgotten, and the PT has become synonymous with corruption and economic crisis as inequality and poverty levels rose. Lula himself was charged with corruption and jailed for 12 years in April 2018. He denies the charges. The economy derailed under Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budget laws. She denies any wrongdoing. The PT offered former São Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad as candidate for 2018’s election - but a big chunk of voters just didn’t want the PT back. Presidential candidate Fernando Haddad (C) Rousseff had been ousted in a controversial process that the left called a “parliamentary coup”, and which deepened social divides between left and right. The mass protests calling for her to be removed were a platform for right-wing groups in Brazil. They grew and became organised, adopting the patriotic green and yellow of the Brazilian flag. Anti-corruption protesters sing the national anthem along Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro Still, Bolsonaro was running for a tiny party and was seen as an unimportant politician who in 27 years in Congress had only approved two minor bills and had rotated between different parties. His ideas were considered too extreme for a viable candidacy at first, but that changed in a time of disillusionment. Other centre-right candidates failed to gain support, and Bolsonaro started to appear as the only right-wing candidate who could beat the Workers’ Party. “Brazilian democracy opened a number of doors and Bolsonaro was able to walk through,” says Timothy Power, director of the Brazilian Studies Programme at the University of Oxford. “You have to give him credit for having very good political instincts. He knew this was the year. His support base was very narrow, but he smelled the blood in the water after the impeachment. “The political system was vulnerable to a clever populist who could create an anti-system and an anti-PT message.” Bolsonaro ran a highly unconventional campaign. He had a small party machine and a paltry campaign budget. He resorted to the power of social media and his knack of speaking directly to his voters in blunt, simple language. Press reports outside Brazil nicknamed him the “Trump of the Tropics”. With a multitude of Tweets and Facebook live videos, he built a solid base of followers - called “Bolsominions” by opponents. He talked about everything - from politics and the electoral race to his recovery in hospital and attacks against the “fake news” media and his opponents. Microphones placed on top of a bodyboard at a press conference held at Bolsonaro's home There were snapshots of his everyday life - like a picture of him seated at a messy breakfast table covered in breadcrumbs, using a can of condensed milk (a national favourite) to spread on bread. “In a period where politicians were being rejected left and right, he got some brownie points for conveying authenticity and for having a very simple set of messages: ‘I’m against corruption. I’m against politicians. I’m against crime, drugs and gangs.’ These things resonate with the public,” says Power. But critics complained about a wave of “fake news” during the campaign, with rumours swirling online - particularly on WhatsApp - about his opponents. Bolsonaro knew things were going well. At every town he travelled to, he was greeted by crowds of frenzied supporters at the airport. I was at one of these receptions and saw him carried on his voters’ shoulders to the chants of “myth”, wrapped in a presidential sash, seven months ahead of the elections. His candidacy was backed by supportive groups in Congress, notably the BBB - the Bible, Bull and Bullet triumvirate - representing the evangelical churches, agribusiness and pro-gun lobbyists. Bolsonaro pledged to ease gun control, so that “honest citizens” could own weapons, and to interrupt demarcation of indigenous land reserves, which scored points with the rural sector. And he embraced a conservative moral agenda together with evangelical groups in Congress, standing for the values of the “traditional family” and “the innocence of children”. This alliance had been strengthened when Bolsonaro and pastors in Congress joined to condemn a package of educational material that the Dilma Rousseff government tried to introduce in 2011, to tackle homophobia in schools. They called it the “gay kit” and said it would teach children how to be homosexuals. The material ended up being dropped. Bolsonaro was raised a Catholic, but was symbolically baptised in Israel’s Jordan River by an evangelical pastor in 2017. His campaign motto was: “Brazil above all, God above everyone.” “We share the same views and the same agendas,” says pastor Silas Malafaia, who performed Bolsonaro’s wedding ceremony to the now first lady Michelle Bolsonaro in 2013. First lady Michelle and the president “We’re all against abortion, gender ideology, gay marriage. The left-wing governments were attacking our moral values,” he says. As the race progressed, Bolsonaro started to appear as the only right-wing candidate who could beat the Workers’ Party. Winning over business leaders was largely down to his economic guru, Paulo Guedes, a free-market advocate who earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago. Guedes, now minister of economy, made Bolsonaro appeal to Brazilians who wanted to see liberal economic policies implemented. Bolsonaro himself admits he doesn’t understand economics. “He knows his limitations. He’s a very humble and simple man,” says pastor Malafaia. After Bolsonaro won, he recalls his words to him. “I’m like the Beetle that made it into a Formula 1 race and won. The improbable of the improbable,” he told the pastor. They both laughed. Bolsonaro and his wife Michelle arrive at the Planalto presidential palace On 28 October, as soon as Bolsonaro learned he had won, he did a Facebook live. At his home in Rio, he sat with his wife on one side, a sign language interpreter on the other, and carefully chosen books on the desk: The Bible, Brazil’s constitution, World War II memoirs by Winston Churchill and a collection of articles by Olavo de Carvalho, a self-taught philosopher who has become a guru to Brazil’s right-wing. He thanked God, the medical team that had “operated a miracle” in saving his life, and his loyal followers on the internet. He hadn’t gone for the presidency out of personal ambition, “but out of the certainty that we could change Brazil’s destiny,” he said. Maintaining a stern expression, he declared: “God clearly has a purpose for me and for all of us in Brazil.” He then prayed in a circle with his allies. Only after that did he make an official, nationwide TV-address. Bolsonaro’s first moments as president-elect reflected his strong allegiance to his followers both on social media and in evangelical groups. But in an attempt to dispel fears raised by his controversial history, he vowed to respect the constitution and democratic rule, and to govern for the country as a whole. “We will offer you a decent government, which will truly work for all Brazilians.” Celebrations outside Bolsonaro's house in Rio. Placard reads: ""Bolsonaro you're the man"" Outside his house in Rio, on the beachfront, the party exploded. Supporters lit fireworks, sang the national anthem and wrapped themselves in the Brazilian flag. Vendors sold inflatable dolls depicting former President Lula in a black and white prison uniform, and key rings showing Bolsonaro wearing sunglasses, a presidential sash and pointing his fingers. “We are just so thrilled that he won. We defeated communism!” a woman told me in the middle of the crowd outside, waving a flag and wearing a T-shirt with the slogan BolsoMito - “BolsoMyth”. Over the past months, Brazilians have watched as Bolsonaro made his first moves as a president who promised to change the way politics is conducted in Brazil. One by one, he announced his ministers on Twitter. He had promised to reduce his cabinet from 29 to 15 ministries - he ended up stopping at 22 in total. The cabinet he built around him reflects his views about the military, his moral values and his contempt for the left-wing governments of the PT. It includes a Ministry for Women, Family and Human Rights, led by a female, anti-abortion evangelical pastor; an environment minister who says global warming is a “secondary issue”; and a foreign minister who has promised to “help Brazil and the world liberate themselves from globalist ideology”. Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights Damares Alves After South America’s wave of left-wing governments in the mid-2000s, Bolsonaro’s foreign policy now signals an alignment with an emerging global right. Trump called to congratulate Bolsonaro straight after his election and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu andHungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbántravelled to the presidential inauguration on 1 January. As well as Bolsonaro himself, seven of his ministers and his vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, have military backgrounds. First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro (L), Jair Bolsonaro (C) and Vice-President Hamilton Mourão (R) during their inauguration ceremony Appointed head of the presidential office for national security, retired Army General Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira says in no way does this make it a “military government”. “I hope people understand that he is a president for all Brazilians,” says the general, who commanded a UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti and is an old friend of Bolsonaro’s. Newly appointed Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni (L) and head of the Office for National Security, retired army general Augusto Heleno (R) Bolsonaro takes on the post with huge challenges ahead for Brazil. The country has seen a sluggish recovery from recession and growth is expected to stay at 1% this year. Its debt is among the highest in any emerging economy. Unemployment has reached 12 million and crime rates have been rising year after year - with 63,000 homicides across the country in 2017. Bolsonaro has pledged to implement pension reform to reduce government spending and achieve fiscal balance. But this is a highly unpopular measure that requires two-thirds support in Congress - and he has kept to a campaign promise of not distributing seats to potential allies in parliament, which may create challenges for governance in the future. “He will now have to make alliances, form coalitions, work with different parties on the floor of Congress,” says Timothy Power. If part of Brazil has high hopes for the former captain, another part is deeply worried about how his ideas will play out into policies. On his first day in office, Bolsonaro adjusted Brazil’s minimum wage, with an increase that was slightly lower than expected - reflecting new inflation estimates. He made it harder to create reserves for indigenous communities and descendants of slaves. He removed any mention of LGBT concerns from national human rights directives. Bolsonaro receives the presidential sash Brazil’s stock market closed at an all-time high on the next day, after ministers reinforced their pledge to privatise state-owned companies and with hopes of a turnaround in Latin America’s biggest economy. Areas of special concern include the environment and the protection of the rainforest and of Brazil’s indigenous people, human rights, social benefits, education, and the freedom of press, schools and academia. With his attacks against the “fake news media” and pledges to tackle “political indoctrination” by school teachers, there are fears of restrictions in freedom of thought. There is also anxiety about whether his government could impact the rights of women, black people, LGBT people, and indigenous people. During the campaign he said minorities would have to “bow to the majority… or disappear”. Crowds gather for Bolsonaro's swearing-in ceremony “A campaign is a campaign,” says General Augusto Heleno. “Now it’s important to think positive, especially with the situation Brazil is in. The country was put on the verge of the abyss economically, politically and socially. We need to rebuild Brazil. “I hope he may surprise the part of the population that did not vote for him.” Correction: This story has been amended to reflect that the minimum wage was not reduced;it wasincreased by a slightly lower than anticipated amount.

Smokers in hospital to be helped to quitThey will be given targeted advice in order to reduce ill health as well as demands on the NHS.Health,"Smokers and problem drinkers who are admitted to hospital in England will be given help to quit or cut down, to reduce demands on the health service. The measures are part of along-term planto be announced over the next few days by NHS England. It said addiction to alcohol and tobacco were two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death. And the right support could save lives and help people stay fitter for longer. Health charity Ash said it was delighted by the plans and Public Health England called the move ""smart"", saying it would save thousands of lives and help the NHS survive into the future. Alcohol-related harm costs the NHS in England around Â£3.5bn each year - admissions to hospitals have increased by 17% in the past decade to just over 2% of the total number. But the use of specialist Alcohol Care Teams has seen a significant reduction in A&E attendances, ambulance callouts and readmissions. The teams offer specialist help to patients on how to give up drinking and support to stay off it, which includes written advice, as well as counselling. That scheme is already running in Bolton, Salford, Nottingham, Liverpool, London and Portsmouth. Pregnant women who smoke will be given help to quit It will now be expanded to 50 hospitals with the highest number of alcohol-related admissions across the country. And every smoker admitted to hospital - around half a million people a year - will be offered specialised support to quit. This includes pregnant women and their partners. Recent figures show that 10% of women in England are still smoking when their baby is born, which can double the risk of stillbirth and increase the risk of miscarriage. Areas of particular need, such as Blackpool where one in five pregnant women smokes, will be given priority over the next five years, NHS England says. Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said: ""Drinking to excess can destroy families, with the NHS too often left to pick up the pieces. ""Alcohol and tobacco addiction remain two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death, and the right support can save lives."" He said the long-term plan delivered a ""sea change in care for a range of major conditions"" like cancer, mental ill health and heart disease. And he said it gave patients ""the support they need to take greater control of their own health and stay fitter longer"". The Royal College of Physicians said many patients only come to the attention of the NHS during their first stay in hospital. ""Every contact a health professional has with a patient is an opportunity to help the patient give up smoking - having a system in place to treat tobacco dependency with allocated funding will help make it happen. ""The focus on the management of alcohol-related disease is also very welcome. ""We mustn't forget prevention though and further measures to reduce harmful drinking are much needed."" Smokers' campaign group Forest criticised the NHS initiative as being ""tantamount to bullying"". Its director, Simon Clark, said: ""It's stressful enough being in hospital without the additional pressure of being hounded to stop smoking. ""Pressuring smokers to quit, especially if they're in hospital for a non smoking-related reason, is an invasion of privacy."" What will the NHS 10-year plan look like?

"Wimpy closure prompts emotional farewellCustomers expressed their sadness at the branch's closure, including a man who proposed to his wife there.Nottingham","Akram Malik has worked at the Broadmarsh branch since 1983 People are saying an emotional farewell to a fast food restaurant which has been a Nottingham landmark for decades. Wimpy opened in the Broadmarsh shopping centre in 1975 and has been run by the same manager, Akram Malik, since 1983. Loyal customers have expressed their sadness, with one revealing he had proposed to his wife there. Mr Malik, who said he would miss the crowds and atmosphere, said the move is due to wider redevelopment plans and other branches remain open. ""People have grown up coming here, they have moved away, worked abroad, come back and said 'oh God, Wimpy is still here',"" Mr Malik said. ""It might not be the end, maybe the end for me here but maybe it will be coming back."" A small number of customers came out to visit the branch on Saturday before it closed Apost about the closure,externalon the BBC Radio Nottingham Facebook page has attracted hundreds of comments, most reflecting the part it had played in their lives and wishing Mr Malik well. But few have the sentimental connection of Barry and Jayne Pickard, who had memorable afternoon 27 years ago. Mr Pickard said: ""We had gone for some shopping and me and Jayne had been together for a couple of months. ""I decided I would get a ring and propose, and where better to do it than the Wimpy in the Broadmarsh? ""I had my two daughters with me and I thought it was best to do it there and then and then I could decide whether I paid for her Wimpy or not."" Wimpy has been serving burgers in the UK since 1954 Wimpy opened in the UK in 1954 at Lyon's Corner House in London During the 1970s, it had more than 1,000 branches across 23 countries It became the first major fast food chain to offer a meat or fish-free burger in 1985 There are 67 branches still open in England Essex has the most locations with 18 A high street staple up and down the country - Wimpy Margate in 2011 Wimpy has been asked to move by the centre's owners, Intu, ahead of a redevelopment of the site. A spokesman for the burger chain, which still has dozens of branches across the UK, said negotiations were ongoing with Intu about a new location. Intu said Wimpy ""has been a huge part of Broadmarsh's history"" and it hopes it will return ""in the future"".

Phone-stare warning after 'hit-and-run',"Olivia Keane suffered cuts to her face and severe bruising to her pelvis and ribs in the suspected hit-and-run A woman has warned of the dangers of looking at phones while crossing roads after being hit by a vehicle in a suspected hit-and run. Olivia Keane, 20, was knocked unconscious while walking across Butts Road in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, on New Year's Eve. Police believe she was hit by a vehicle that failed to stop. Miss Keane cannot remember the details, but believes she was looking down at her phone at the time. The personal trainer said: ""If I was on my phone and crossing the road I know I'm partly to blame, and also you never know what idiots are going to be driving around. ""[Looking at your phone] is not worth it in the slightest. ""Just wait until you get home or wait until you've crossed the road, at least. ""I've definitely learned the hard way."" Olivia Keane has had to take time off work after being injured Olivia Keane was walking on Butts Road at the time Miss Keane was walking home from her girlfriend's house to pick up clothes for a trip to Brighton, where they planned to spend New Year.

""The next thing I remember I was lying on the floor and having a banging headache,"" she said. Miss Keane returned to her girlfriend Amy Gray's house and was then taken by ambulance to hospital, where she was told she was ""lucky"" not to have broken any bones. Olivia Keane had been preparing to travel to Brighton with her girlfriend Amy Gray for the New Year She had suffered severe pelvic and rib bruising and cuts to her face and has had to take time off work during her ""busiest time of year"".

This was the tongue-in-cheek exchange between Woking defender Ben Gerring and Watford captain Troy Deeney when the two were on BBC Radio 5 live's Friday Football Social last night. Gerring:""If I didn't offer some sort of challenge, he (Deeney) is not going to respect me. The biggest way to respect Troy is to put him in Row Z!"" Deeney:""First thing on Saturday I'm knocking on the manager's door to make sure I'm playing!""  Blackpool 0-3 Arsenal Blackpool boss Terry McPhillips:âWe had great confidence
from the League Cup game earlier in the season and we had belief. But if we were going to upset them we needed things to go our way and you need to be clinical and have some luck when youâre
defending and we didnât get that. âThey are quality and cut you open, but we caused them
problems in the second half.â  Bristol City 1-0 Huddersfield Huddersfield Town Huddersfield boss David Wagner:""The dressing room is quiet. We were not good enough. ""We had chances but didn't hit the target and work the keeper. We were not good enough to win this game. It was a tight and even game but I expected more. ""It looked like one goal would decide the game. You saw what happens when you hit the target. We were in better positions in the game but didn't hit the target. ""In our bid to stay up in the Premier League, this doesn't help. We missed getting the winning feeling back. Nothing is better than the winning feeling.

It didn't spoil today's game. ""The hardest thing in football is to score a goal and you have to be right. If it goes in then you have to check it."" Asked if Charlie Mulgrew is trying to score from corners, Mowbray looked deadly serious when he replied:""He's got an amazing left foot and we've worked hard on Charlie trying to score from corners and free-kicks.

There's a camaraderie amongst the players and we worked hard to get a result. ""I couldn't see Newcastle scoring so the penalty was a blow. It was soft, and I think it was a penalty, but we live to fight another day. It'll be interesting to see what side they play in the replay now. ""It was a great header from Bradley Dack and he worked his socks off. We told the players to test themselves against a Premier League side and Bradley should want to test himself against Premier League footballers. ""He took his goal well and worked really hard today. It's his first season in the Championship and he's bedding in well.""  #bbcfacup or text 81111 Liverpool or Man Utd would give a player like Joe Willock a chance. He won't get near first-team again until the FA Cup fourth round at Arsenal. Nathan, Kent FT: Newcastle 1-1 Blackburn Newcastle United Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez is a fan of VAR, saying 'we need it for every game'. He added:""We have to take some positives. The reaction of the players was good, they were pushing till the last minutes. ""Some players haven't had a chance to play 90 minutes so it was an opportunity for them to show what they have and I think they worked hard."" Asked if Blackburn targeted goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, he replied:""The referee knows that. In the second half the approach was different. ""I think sometimes we forget the rules when the ball goes into the six-yard box. We had to protect him in the second half.

Blackpool 0-3 Arsenal Arsenal Arsenal manager Unai Emery on MOTD:""We did everything today every player worked so hard. It was important for us to win today because we have 13 victories in this competition so today with this mentality we did well. ""We imposed our quality on the game and stuck to our game plan and it was good to see the young players do well today as well. ""I am very proud of [Joe] Willock and Eddie [Nketiah] because Eddie had three good chances to score and Willock scored two. They train very well in the second team and with us in training as well. "" On Laurent Koscielny's injury:""With Laurent we need to be calm with some moments in the training sessions because we are pushing him to play a lot of matches after his big injury so maybe he needs some time not playing but we had another player with big commitment to play in a different position today Stephan Lichtsteiner. ""Today Laurent said he could not play the match but now we have one week to rest before the next game and hopefully he will be OK."" #bbcfacup or text 81111 UTM:Grimsby didn't deserve to lose that game. Near enough 90 mins with 10 men and no centre-backs. No way was that a red card. VAR needs a serious evaluation as the decision today was totally wrong! Unlucky Grimsby. Bristol City 1-0 Huddersfield Bristol City manager Lee Johnson:""I'm very proud of the team. We put in a controlled performance and were composed. Huddersfield are a great side on the ball. We had the lions' share of possession - not a mean feat against a Premier League team. ""We had a bug - about seven or eight players were not well in the last 48 hours. Brownhill's goal got us in the hat. Adam Webster was great too today. ""Young Joe Morrell had his first start - he's an academy product. ""We are the underdog against the Premier League side. We have a young group on their way up. Last year we beat four en route to the League Cup semi. ""We look forward to the draw. We like playing at home in the FA Cup but ideally you want a big high-profile game at home."" #bbcfacup or text 81111 Shaun Holroyd:Gutted for the immense Gillingham players. What a display against Premier League opposition. So proud of the lads today. FT: Crystal Palace 1-0 Grimsby Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager:""They were unlucky to get a player sent off but it was a red card. The referee got it right with the help of VAR and made the right call. ""Grimsby got players behind the ball and sort of camped. They asked questions. We made a lot of attempts, made a real effort to get through but they were fantastic and there were incredible performances from some of their defenders throwing their bodies on the line. ""They must be very proud to come here and put out that defensive performance, even though it wasn't great to watch. It was a red card offence unfortunately. I don't think it was a deliberate attempt to foul but it is one that you can give a red card for and the referee had no choice. ""The only positive that you get from the game is that you actually win it in the end. You spend 90 minutes bashing your head at the wall. It doesn't make for the greatest spectacle or for the best viewing for a coach on the sidelines. ""But we did keep trying. We didn't use enough skill but I can't criticise them for their efforts or the way they kept going and we got our reward with that goal."" Â© 2025 BBC.

In anInstagram post,external, the British star said she has been ""so inspired"" by the achievements of Time's Up.

Its fund provides legal help to US women targeted in the workplace. Stars' #MeToo fund gives Â£1m to UK victims Hollywood women launch anti-abuse campaign Mr Weinstein faces charges in New York involving alleged sex assaults on two women, which he denies. He has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women and also faces additional investigations by the US federal government.

Mr Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex As of December,Time's Up,externalhad attracted $22m (Â£17m) in donations, and the services of hundreds of volunteer lawyers.

It is aimed primarily at those victims of sexual harassment unable to pay for legal support themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses. Time's Up also calls for ""gender inequality and the imbalance of power"" to be addressed, emphasising the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay.

Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ,"This week we are pulling up at the crossroads where art meets politics. It's not the latest Ai Weiwei installation, or a pro-Trump tweet from Kanye, but a TV movie called Brexit: The Uncivil War, a two-hour dramatised account of how Vote Leave won the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016. It's written by James Graham, the talented young playwright with a string of West End hits, among which is This House, his satirical take on the Labour government of 1974-79. This House - can a play reveal the whips' dark arts? Graham's work has a depth that goes beyond simply portraying British politics; he is questioning its foundations and structure. And so it is with Brexit: The Uncivil War, a TV movie that doesn't seek to retell a familiar story, but to ask an unfamiliar question: we know who won, but do we know how? Benedict Cumberbatch takes centre stage, swapping his handsome-yet-nerdy Sherlock Holmes persona for his baldy-and-even-more-nerdy Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave's real life campaign director and one-time special adviser to Michael Gove. Dominic Cummings (behind Michael Gove's left shoulder) was the former education secretary's special adviser Benedict Cumberbatch gives a compelling performance as Dominic Cummings, the leading strategist and campaign director of Vote Leave Cumberbatch presents us with an intense, socially awkward, strategic mastermind with a gentle Durham accent and a penchant for hanging out in stationery cupboards at work. He is aided and abetted by Vote Leave's CEO, Matthew Elliot, played by John Heffernan, as a deferential fixer in King Cummings's court. Rory Kinnear provides the oppo in the shape of Craig Oliver, then No 10's director of communications. There are cameos for Michael Gove (Oliver Maltman), Boris Johnson (Richard Goulding), Nigel Farage (Paul Ryan), and Arron Banks (Lee Boardman): all are no more than glib caricature impersonations, but amusing in a Spitting Image-type way. John Heffernan plays Matthew Elliot, mild-mannered Vote Leave chief executive Rory Kinnear plays Craig Oliver, who as David Cameron's spin doctor, oversaw Remain's communications strategy Lee Boardman portrays businessman Arron Banks, who funded the rival Brexit campaign, and worked with the then UKIP leader, Nigel Farage (Paul Ryan) David Cameron and George Osborne hardly feature at all beyond a second or two of archive footage and - in Cameron's case - as a disembodied voice on a conference call. The film is all about Cummings and how he beat the establishment he despises, while keeping Team Farage's alternative Leave campaign at arm's length. There's a face-off with the old guard Eurosceptic MPs, impromptu market research sessions in local pubs, a controversial red bus emblazed with the Â£350m-a-week NHS promise, and a park-bench meeting with a young physicist who persuades Cummings to allow his data science firm to use the referendum as an experiment in digital campaigning. And all the while there is the dramatic build-up to Cummings coining Vote Leave's campaign message -Take Back Control. Cummings was one of those credited with the Take Back Control slogan and the claim that Britain could save Â£350m a week by leaving the EU The attention the film gives the slogan succeeds in reflecting its psychological power, and the central role it played in winning the campaign, but it doesn't make for compelling telly. The drama is delivered by Cumberbatch's portrayal of Cummings as an idealistic oddball on the mission of a lifetime. So compelling is the actor's performance, I took to the internet to find out more about the man he plays. I found a YouTube video of Dominic Cummings delivering a talk to a group of communications professionals explaining how Vote Leave won the referendum. It appears to have taken place about a year after the vote, during the 2017 general election. Unlike Graham's TV dramatisation, which will probably be watched by millions, fewer than 1,000 people (at the time of writing) have seen this 30-minute talk by Cummings, although it answers the same question with less make-up and in a fraction of the time. I thoroughly recommend watching it before seeing Brexit: The Uncivil War (Channel 4, Monday at 21:00 GMT). It not only gives you a ""from the horse's mouth"" version of what happened, but also an insight into Cummings's immediate post-vote plan for Boris Johnson that is missing from the film. Of course, it is impossible to tell the entire story in one TV movie. Graham has chosen a specific tale to tell about a character not as well known to the public as others involved, but who had a significant bearing on events. Given the subject it is likely to be contentious, but it is evidently well researched. Cumberbatch met Cummings and Graham credits journalist Tim Shipman and Craig Oliver - both of whom have written books on the referendum - as political consultants. Richard Goulding plays Boris Johnson and Oliver Maltman portrays Michael Gove, who were the public faces of the official campaign for Britain to leave the EU The result is a very watchable TV movie that has a clear structure and a well-defined plot, which falls short because it ends up being a slightly-too-long biopic with an underdeveloped cast of supporting characters, rather than a revelatory edge-of-your seat political thriller that goes right down to the wire: a case maybe, of art failing to imitate life.

Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War âââââ,"This week we are pulling up at the crossroads where art meets politics. It's not the latest Ai Weiwei installation, or a pro-Trump tweet from Kanye, but a TV movie called Brexit: The Uncivil War, a two-hour dramatised account of how Vote Leave won the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016. It's written by James Graham, the talented young playwright with a string of West End hits, among which is This House, his satirical take on the Labour government of 1974-79. This House - can a play reveal the whips' dark arts? Graham's work has a depth that goes beyond simply portraying British politics; he is questioning its foundations and structure. And so it is with Brexit: The Uncivil War, a TV movie that doesn't seek to retell a familiar story, but to ask an unfamiliar question: we know who won, but do we know how? Benedict Cumberbatch takes centre stage, swapping his handsome-yet-nerdy Sherlock Holmes persona for his baldy-and-even-more-nerdy Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave's real life campaign director and one-time special adviser to Michael Gove. Dominic Cummings (behind Michael Gove's left shoulder) was the former education secretary's special adviser Benedict Cumberbatch gives a compelling performance as Dominic Cummings, the leading strategist and campaign director of Vote Leave Cumberbatch presents us with an intense, socially awkward, strategic mastermind with a gentle Durham accent and a penchant for hanging out in stationery cupboards at work. He is aided and abetted by Vote Leave's CEO, Matthew Elliot, played by John Heffernan, as a deferential fixer in King Cummings's court. Rory Kinnear provides the oppo in the shape of Craig Oliver, then No 10's director of communications. There are cameos for Michael Gove (Oliver Maltman), Boris Johnson (Richard Goulding), Nigel Farage (Paul Ryan), and Arron Banks (Lee Boardman): all are no more than glib caricature impersonations, but amusing in a Spitting Image-type way. John Heffernan plays Matthew Elliot, mild-mannered Vote Leave chief executive Rory Kinnear plays Craig Oliver, who as David Cameron's spin doctor, oversaw Remain's communications strategy Lee Boardman portrays businessman Arron Banks, who funded the rival Brexit campaign, and worked with the then UKIP leader, Nigel Farage (Paul Ryan) David Cameron and George Osborne hardly feature at all beyond a second or two of archive footage and - in Cameron's case - as a disembodied voice on a conference call. The film is all about Cummings and how he beat the establishment he despises, while keeping Team Farage's alternative Leave campaign at arm's length. There's a face-off with the old guard Eurosceptic MPs, impromptu market research sessions in local pubs, a controversial red bus emblazed with the Â£350m-a-week NHS promise, and a park-bench meeting with a young physicist who persuades Cummings to allow his data science firm to use the referendum as an experiment in digital campaigning. And all the while there is the dramatic build-up to Cummings coining Vote Leave's campaign message -Take Back Control. Cummings was one of those credited with the Take Back Control slogan and the claim that Britain could save Â£350m a week by leaving the EU The attention the film gives the slogan succeeds in reflecting its psychological power, and the central role it played in winning the campaign, but it doesn't make for compelling telly. The drama is delivered by Cumberbatch's portrayal of Cummings as an idealistic oddball on the mission of a lifetime. So compelling is the actor's performance, I took to the internet to find out more about the man he plays. I found a YouTube video of Dominic Cummings delivering a talk to a group of communications professionals explaining how Vote Leave won the referendum. It appears to have taken place about a year after the vote, during the 2017 general election. Unlike Graham's TV dramatisation, which will probably be watched by millions, fewer than 1,000 people (at the time of writing) have seen this 30-minute talk by Cummings, although it answers the same question with less make-up and in a fraction of the time. I thoroughly recommend watching it before seeing Brexit: The Uncivil War (Channel 4, Monday at 21:00 GMT). It not only gives you a ""from the horse's mouth"" version of what happened, but also an insight into Cummings's immediate post-vote plan for Boris Johnson that is missing from the film. Of course, it is impossible to tell the entire story in one TV movie. Graham has chosen a specific tale to tell about a character not as well known to the public as others involved, but who had a significant bearing on events. Given the subject it is likely to be contentious, but it is evidently well researched. Cumberbatch met Cummings and Graham credits journalist Tim Shipman and Craig Oliver - both of whom have written books on the referendum - as political consultants. Richard Goulding plays Boris Johnson and Oliver Maltman portrays Michael Gove, who were the public faces of the official campaign for Britain to leave the EU The result is a very watchable TV movie that has a clear structure and a well-defined plot, which falls short because it ends up being a slightly-too-long biopic with an underdeveloped cast of supporting characters, rather than a revelatory edge-of-your seat political thriller that goes right down to the wire: a case maybe, of art failing to imitate life.

Watson 'optimistic' at Time's Up progressActress reflects on first year of the initiative which was set up to combat sexual harassment.UK,"Actress Emma Watson says she is ""optimistic"" about a ""fairer future"" for women - a year after backing an initiative to combat sexual harassment. In anInstagram post,external, the British star said she has been ""so inspired"" by the achievements of Time's Up. More than 300 actresses, writers and directors launched the project last January in the wake of allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Its fund provides legal help to US women targeted in the workplace. Stars' #MeToo fund gives Â£1m to UK victims Hollywood women launch anti-abuse campaign Mr Weinstein faces charges in New York involving alleged sex assaults on two women, which he denies. He has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women and also faces additional investigations by the US federal government. Watson, who starred in the Harry Potter films and Disney's Beauty and the Beast, is pictured wearing a Time's Up T-shirt in her post. Allow Instagram content?

She wrote: ""From my sisters in the film industry to the activists and campaigners around the world who have supported us, I've been so inspired by the way people have reached out to each other, shared experiences and advice, and organised together as part of this movement for change. ""Gender equality can only become a reality if we harness the transformative power of solidarity across professions and across borders. ""There's still a long way to go, but the achievements so far make me optimistic for a fairer future. 2018 was just the beginning."" Mr Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex As of December,Time's Up,externalhad attracted $22m (Â£17m) in donations, and the services of hundreds of volunteer lawyers. The campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria, Emma Stone and America Ferrera, was announced via a full-page advert printed in the New York Times on 1 January 2018. It is aimed primarily at those victims of sexual harassment unable to pay for legal support themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses. Time's Up also calls for ""gender inequality and the imbalance of power"" to be addressed, emphasising the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay. Watson, 28, has been a prominent supporter of the organisation since its inception. In February, shealso donated Â£1m to a UK version of the campaign, and at the Oscars ceremony a month later,showed off a fake Time's Up tattoo- complete with typo - on her arm. 2017 saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment. The term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity.

This was the tongue-in-cheek exchange between Woking defender Ben Gerring and Watford captain Troy Deeney when the two were on BBC Radio 5 live's Friday Football Social last night. Gerring:""If I didn't offer some sort of challenge, he (Deeney) is not going to respect me. The biggest way to respect Troy is to put him in Row Z!"" Deeney:""First thing on Saturday I'm knocking on the manager's door to make sure I'm playing!""  Blackpool 0-3 Arsenal Blackpool boss Terry McPhillips:âWe had great confidence
from the League Cup game earlier in the season and we had belief. But if we were going to upset them we needed things to go our way and you need to be clinical and have some luck when youâre
defending and we didnât get that. âThey are quality and cut you open, but we caused them
problems in the second half.â  Bristol City 1-0 Huddersfield Huddersfield Town Huddersfield boss David Wagner:""The dressing room is quiet. We were not good enough. ""We had chances but didn't hit the target and work the keeper. We were not good enough to win this game. It was a tight and even game but I expected more. ""It looked like one goal would decide the game. You saw what happens when you hit the target. We were in better positions in the game but didn't hit the target. ""In our bid to stay up in the Premier League, this doesn't help. We missed getting the winning feeling back. Nothing is better than the winning feeling.

I don't think it was a deliberate attempt to foul but it is one that you can give a red card for and the referee had no choice. ""The only positive that you get from the game is that you actually win it in the end. You spend 90 minutes bashing your head at the wall. It doesn't make for the greatest spectacle or for the best viewing for a coach on the sidelines. ""But we did keep trying.

Ryanair named 'worst short-haul airline'The low-cost-carrier was ranked at the bottom of the pile by Which survey respondents.Business,"The Irish budget carrier received low marks for seat comfort, food and drink, boarding and its cabin environment Ryanair has won the dubious honour of the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running. The results from a Which survey of airline passengers ranked Ryanair at the bottom of 19 carriers flying from the UK. A Ryanair spokesperson said the airline's success was not reflected in the survey. The best performers were Guernsey-based Aurigny Air Service, Swiss Airlines, Jet2, Norwegian and Dutch carrier KLM. The UK's other large airlines, Easyjet and British Airways came in at 11th and 15th, respectively, in the survey. Easyjet beat British Airways's scores for food and drink, customer service and value for money, but both received low ratings for seat comfort. Ryanair faced strike action in 2018, cancelled flights but refused to offer passengers compensation and introduced new baggage rules three times. The airline, which predicts it will carry 141m passengers this year, also left passengers unimpressed with its boarding processes, seat comfort, food and drink offering, and cabin environment. Easyjet fared better than Ryanair or British Airways in the customer satisfaction survey Which said ""thousands of respondents"" said they would never fly the airline again. Of those surveyed who chose an airline that they would never fly in the future, 70% chose Ryanair. However, independent aviation consultant Chris Tarry said, despite the low satisfaction ratings, customers were still happy enough to fly with the Irish budget carrier. ""Ryanair still represents great value for a huge amount of people. What they receive is what they expect."" Mr Tarry said the airline had endured ""a tough year"" but still generates ""huge amounts of cash"". ""Painful lessons have been learnt,"" Mr Tarry said. A Ryanair spokesperson said: ""Ryanair passenger numbers have grown by 80% in the past six years and Ryanair.com has become the world's most visited airline website. ""These facts reflect what customers want much more than an unrepresentative survey of just 8,000 people.""

Time using landlines 'halves in five years',"Many young people interviewed didn't realise area codes have geographical significance As landline usage continues to fall, a new Ofcom study suggests remembering phone numbers could soon be consigned to history. Between 2012 and 2017, time spent on landline calls plummeted from 103 billion minutes to 54 billion minutes. Over the same period, mobile calls rose to 148.6 billion minutes. Throw in the growth of messaging services such as WhatsApp, and could the convention of dialling codes disappear altogether? Confessions of a smartphone addict Worry less about children's screen use, parents told 'Schools should have consistent policy on phones' As part of its research, Ofcom interviewed a cross-section of consumers, including 14 focus groups. It found a clear generational shift, between younger people who preferred to use text-based messaging services and older people who preferred to talk over the phone. ""Calling someone is a bit daunting,"" one 18-year-old told the organisation. ""It's much easier and quicker to WhatsApp my friends. If I have to call a company, I'll always try to use web chat if it's available."" A split was also found in the approach to area codes. In short: the younger people didn't feel strongly about them, and many didn't realise they had any geographical significance. These codes originally corresponded to the first two letters of a place. Aberdeen, for example, was AB, which equates to 22 on the keypad. Today's code for Aberdeen is 01224. The older people, on the other hand, found area codes helpful and reassuring when making and receiving calls. ""It's helpful to know where things are,"" said one 67-year-old from Wrexham. What does this say about the changing ways we communicate? ""We've seen a shift in people, away from thinking of communication as place-based, towards something more personal,"" Dr Bernie Hogan, from the Oxford Internet Institute, told the BBC. Instead of sharing phones in particular places, nailed to the wall or placed on a desk, we have got used to having our communication hub on our bodies, always at hand for messages, pictures and calls. Dr Hogan said this does not necessarily mean the landline will disappear altogether. In fact, in an age of smartphones, it may find a renewed sense of purpose. ""The landline won't have a resurgence but what it represents might: being available at a certain place and time."" As anyone who has faced late-night work emails or calls will be able to tell you, the bounds around communication have loosened as we've moved away from distinct private and professional numbers. Instead of memorising different numbers for the office or for home, plenty of people now use the same phone for calls throughout the day. But how does this square with the various roles we inhabit from morning to midnight? ""A person is many people,"" said professor John Zimmerman, from Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. ""Dad, son, employee, member, etc. Often it is more important for our devices to know who we are in the moment when making a choice to allow, dismiss, or reroute a potential connection."" Unhinged from clunky plastic handsets wired into specific rooms, what lines of communication should reach us when? Are we a manager in our child's bedroom, or a mother in a board meeting? For many, these roles are increasingly managed by a platter of social media accounts, from your family WhatsApp group to your work LinkedIn account. Unlike an open public network such as a phone number system, however, these are privately owned; controlled by big technology companies. ""What we're seeing is a shift towards the corporatisation of our communication channels,"" warned Dr Hogan. ""It's a concern. There should be policy or legal means to allow for interoperable communication between corporate networks."" Detached from names and private platforms, there's something simple about a series of numbers; a comprehensible digit-based address, pinpointing a line of communication. From webpage IP addresses to GPS coordinates, numbers seethe beneath the surface of our screens, but these are vast and complex, impossible to memorise or to feel a sense of ownership over. So what will happen? A hipster return of landlines? A resurgence of area codes? Probably not, but as a generation grows up with smartphones in their pockets, new ways will need to capture what that 67-year-old from Wrexham told Ofcom: ""It's helpful to know where things are.""

Smokers in hospital to be helped to quit,"Smokers and problem drinkers who are admitted to hospital in England will be given help to quit or cut down, to reduce demands on the health service. The measures are part of along-term planto be announced over the next few days by NHS England. It said addiction to alcohol and tobacco were two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death. And the right support could save lives and help people stay fitter for longer. Health charity Ash said it was delighted by the plans and Public Health England called the move ""smart"", saying it would save thousands of lives and help the NHS survive into the future. Alcohol-related harm costs the NHS in England around Â£3.5bn each year - admissions to hospitals have increased by 17% in the past decade to just over 2% of the total number. But the use of specialist Alcohol Care Teams has seen a significant reduction in A&E attendances, ambulance callouts and readmissions. The teams offer specialist help to patients on how to give up drinking and support to stay off it, which includes written advice, as well as counselling. That scheme is already running in Bolton, Salford, Nottingham, Liverpool, London and Portsmouth. Pregnant women who smoke will be given help to quit It will now be expanded to 50 hospitals with the highest number of alcohol-related admissions across the country. And every smoker admitted to hospital - around half a million people a year - will be offered specialised support to quit. This includes pregnant women and their partners. Recent figures show that 10% of women in England are still smoking when their baby is born, which can double the risk of stillbirth and increase the risk of miscarriage. Areas of particular need, such as Blackpool where one in five pregnant women smokes, will be given priority over the next five years, NHS England says. Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said: ""Drinking to excess can destroy families, with the NHS too often left to pick up the pieces. ""Alcohol and tobacco addiction remain two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death, and the right support can save lives."" He said the long-term plan delivered a ""sea change in care for a range of major conditions"" like cancer, mental ill health and heart disease. And he said it gave patients ""the support they need to take greater control of their own health and stay fitter longer"". The Royal College of Physicians said many patients only come to the attention of the NHS during their first stay in hospital. ""Every contact a health professional has with a patient is an opportunity to help the patient give up smoking - having a system in place to treat tobacco dependency with allocated funding will help make it happen. ""The focus on the management of alcohol-related disease is also very welcome. ""We mustn't forget prevention though and further measures to reduce harmful drinking are much needed."" Smokers' campaign group Forest criticised the NHS initiative as being ""tantamount to bullying"". Its director, Simon Clark, said: ""It's stressful enough being in hospital without the additional pressure of being hounded to stop smoking. ""Pressuring smokers to quit, especially if they're in hospital for a non smoking-related reason, is an invasion of privacy."" What will the NHS 10-year plan look like?

Ryanair named 'worst short-haul airline',"The Irish budget carrier received low marks for seat comfort, food and drink, boarding and its cabin environment Ryanair has won the dubious honour of the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running. The results from a Which survey of airline passengers ranked Ryanair at the bottom of 19 carriers flying from the UK. A Ryanair spokesperson said the airline's success was not reflected in the survey. The best performers were Guernsey-based Aurigny Air Service, Swiss Airlines, Jet2, Norwegian and Dutch carrier KLM. The UK's other large airlines, Easyjet and British Airways came in at 11th and 15th, respectively, in the survey. Easyjet beat British Airways's scores for food and drink, customer service and value for money, but both received low ratings for seat comfort. Ryanair faced strike action in 2018, cancelled flights but refused to offer passengers compensation and introduced new baggage rules three times. The airline, which predicts it will carry 141m passengers this year, also left passengers unimpressed with its boarding processes, seat comfort, food and drink offering, and cabin environment. Easyjet fared better than Ryanair or British Airways in the customer satisfaction survey Which said ""thousands of respondents"" said they would never fly the airline again. Of those surveyed who chose an airline that they would never fly in the future, 70% chose Ryanair. However, independent aviation consultant Chris Tarry said, despite the low satisfaction ratings, customers were still happy enough to fly with the Irish budget carrier. ""Ryanair still represents great value for a huge amount of people. What they receive is what they expect."" Mr Tarry said the airline had endured ""a tough year"" but still generates ""huge amounts of cash"". ""Painful lessons have been learnt,"" Mr Tarry said. A Ryanair spokesperson said: ""Ryanair passenger numbers have grown by 80% in the past six years and Ryanair.com has become the world's most visited airline website. ""These facts reflect what customers want much more than an unrepresentative survey of just 8,000 people.""

Trump threatens 'national emergency',"This video can not be played President Trump confirms he's prepared to shut down the government for months or years US President Donald Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a US-Mexico border wall without the approval of Congress. It came after he met senior Democrats, who refused his requests for funding. The stand-off has seen Mr Trump withhold support for a bill to fully fund the government until he gets money for the border wall. He said he was prepared for the partial government shutdown - now in its third week - to last years. Around 800,000 federal workers have been without pay since 22 December. The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress Trump aides and lawmakers will meet later on Saturday in a fresh bid to resolve the impasse. The Republican president initially gave a positive account of the 90-minute meeting at the White House, describing it as ""very productive"". But when asked whether he had considered using emergency presidential powers to bypass congressional approval of funding, Mr Trump said he had. ""I may do it. We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That's another way of doing it."" Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walk out of the West Wing ""I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing,"" the president added. ""I don't call it a shutdown, I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and safety of our country."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday's meeting had been ""contentious"", while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""We told the president we needed the government open. He resisted."" Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington Donald Trump says he can declare a ""national emergency"" and build his promised wall along the border without congressional approval. If that's the case, the question becomes why he doesn't go ahead and do that. Why put federal workers through the pain of forgoing pay and hamstring key government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, if he could bypass Democratic objections with the snap of his presidential fingers? The answer is because the solution isn't that simple. There are provisions of US law that allow the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from Defence Department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes. Such a move may prompt Congress, including Republicans, to push back. Then there's the inevitable legal challenge from Democrats to such an exercise of presidential authority. Any presidential order to build a wall would be met by an equally imposing wall of court filings blocking its construction. The president's latest suggestions are best viewed as simply another attempt to gain the upper hand in negotiations with Democrats. This may not be a threat, more a bluff. Democrats, who now hold the majority in the House, passed spending bills on Thursday to reopen the government, including $1.3bn (Â£1bn) of border security funds until 8 February. But the legislation cannot take effect unless it passes the Republican-controlled Senate, where leader Mitch McConnell said his party would not back any measure without the president's support. This video can not be played Five historic moments as new US Congress opens The Kentucky senator called the Democratic budget ""a time-wasting act of political posturing"". In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump also told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 raise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown. The fiscal fiasco began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Two vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 - Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine - have broken ranks to back approving the budget and ending the shutdown. The White House is again floating the idea of a deal for ""Dreamers"" - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding. Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being ""talked about"", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible ""without a wall"".

"'My sports coach kissed me when I was 17'What we learned about green living from a 7-day experimentVideoVideoDo Army 'snowflakes' posters work?Theatre boss rescues panto by starring in itBoy, 10, sent toys after losing kangaroo","""Megan"" first met the sports coach in her early teens, and they began a secret ""relationship"" when she was 17 ""When I was 16, we started messaging a bit more and it wasn't just the sport. I was quite naive and vulnerable."" Megan - not her real name - says she was 17 when she first kissed her sports coach, an older man who had acted as a guardian on trips away and was someone her parents trusted ""implicitly"". While it is illegal for teachers and care workers to have sexual relations with 16 and 17-year-olds in their care, this does not apply to sports coaches. Campaigners want this to be changed. They have accused the UK government of ""backtracking"" onproposals announced in 2017to add coaches to the list of professions covered by the law designed to prevent the abuse of positions of trust. The Ministry of Justice said it continued to keep the law under review. Megan was in her early teens when she first met the man she later accused of taking advantage of her. As she began competing at a higher level she trained seven days a week. She said she often found herself unexpectedly alone during sessions with her coach. ""I thought everyone was having individual sessions but in fact it was just me. He told the others that training was cancelled so we could have training by ourselves,"" Megan said. She said her coach had her phone number to arrange training sessions and meetings. When she was 16 - the standard age of consent - he began asking her personal questions about her sex life. Megan said they kissed after a night out and had several more intimate encounters in his car when he gave her a lift, making her feel like they were ""in a relationship"". ""It was a secret so I felt like we had to delete all of our messages,"" she said. ""It didn't feel nice to keep it a secret because I felt like I was lying. There were a lot of feelings of guilt involved."" Megan said the relationship continued until she ""realised what a big age difference there was"" and broke it off. ""He's just got away with it... it was very upsetting"" 'Bold change' urged on rugby injury risks Gender stereotypes: Teen called lesbian for playing football Girls and women 'missing out' on benefits of sport She said she finally told her parents who were ""devastated"" and reported it to the police. The coach - who disputed her account and denied any wrongdoing - was arrested and bailed, but the matter was dropped by police as no criminal offence was deemed to have been committed. ""He's just got away with itâ¦ it was very upsetting,"" Megan added. Des Mannion, the national head of service for NSPCC Wales, said the law as it stands ""isn't adequate"". ""We know there are individuals who are wronged but have no redress,"" he said. Mr Mannion said he was calling for the UK government to introduce legislation to protect all children and young people, not just when they are in a classroom. ""We're talking about a power relationship where an older adult has a position of trust and power over a young person,"" he said. ""We know that individuals who have a sexual interest in children will seek positions of power and influence so they can offend against them."" Megan considered quitting her sport The Ministry of Justice said it remained ""absolutely committed to protecting children and young people from sexual abuse"". ""We already have a wide range of criminal offences under which to prosecute and sentence those who carry out such acts,"" a spokesman said. For Megan, the relationship left her feeling her beloved sport had been ""ruined"". She considered quitting but is working hard to get back on track.

"What we learned about green living from a 7-day experimentVideoVideoDo Army 'snowflakes' posters work?Theatre boss rescues panto by starring in itBoy, 10, sent toys after losing kangaroo","Buy less meat and dairy. Walk, don't drive. Dry laundry on a rack. They're all things we're told could help save the planet. But how far are any of us prepared to go? And what's stopping us from doing more? We challenged three people to spend one week making as many changes as possible to live a greener life. Here's how they got on. About:I'm a 25-year-old senior associate at a consultancy firm, who lives wherever my latest project is. Home is Fife but for the time being I'm living and working in Glasgow, which means I can get everywhere on foot. I like to cook from scratch and socialise with friends and my team. My week:I made a really conscious effort not to buy any meat or fish. Buying vegetarian or vegan food was not particularly tough but eating out was trickier when it looked so tempting - and I did eat a prawn curry at a restaurant. Avoiding cow's milk was not hard - I already drink soy milk, prefer my coffee black and recently discovered chocolate oat milk. I tried vegan parmesan for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised that it tasted like the real thing and even melts. Plant-based diets 'help combat global warming' I tried not to throw anything away (I froze spinach before it went off) and bought loose vegetables instead of pre-packaged bags. My biggest shift was checking where food was from. One day my blueberries were from Perth, Scotland, the next, from Peru. Yet both packets suggested they were produced locally. Even my ""seasonal"" butternut squash was from Spain. Once I started spending a few seconds (and that really is all it takes) checking the source, I felt more inclined to pick local. I watched documentaries including Mission Blue and Cowspiracy [about marine conservation and intensive farming, respectively], and started following Zanna Van Dijk and The Happy Pear [environmental/fitness and vegetarian/lifestyle bloggers] online for inspiration and information. My friends and I discussed how social media could inspire but also make you feel so far off the end goal - you've just bought a coffee in a reusable cup, then you read about fast-fashion and think: ""God, I've just bought this T-shirt."" I spoke to my consultant colleagues, who are in and out of hotels, about leaving big plastic bottles of toiletries in their office locker or at hotels over weekends to avoid buying mini ones each week. One told me how they can't recycle takeaway food packaging in hotels, so bring it to work to put in office recycling bins. In Glasgow, I walk everywhere but, in the past, my job has involved driving, flying, getting a train and a bus just to get to the office. Where possible though, we do use video conferencing with colleagues and clients. What I learned: Spot the difference? One pack's grown in Italy, the other in the UK Look at the labels - is it grown locally? Buy minimal, responsibly-sourced meat from the meat counter (less plastic packaging) Take baby steps to inform yourself Try vegan cheese - with an open mind Top tip:Buy a reusable coffee cup, water bottle and Tupperware - and actually use them. About:I'm a healthy history student who hits the gym four times a week and eats eggs and chicken to keep up my protein levels. I mainly travel around Manchester by bus or foot, and share a house - but not usually meals - with my flatmates. I'm 20, and grew up in a nature-loving family in Belgium where food was never thrown away and leftovers were always for tomorrow. My week:Living in the UK - where everything is easily available and students live in houses where rent includes bills - means people leave taps on, lights on and put the heating up as high as they want. It's a problem. Every day I turned the heating off or down to 18C. I also bought insulating tape to block out draughts in my bedroom. I made a conscious effort to have shorter showers and use less dishwater. I swapped bananas for stewed UK-grown pears on my breakfast, and bought soya milk for the first time in my life - but I wasn't convinced. Cow's milk just tastes better and we always buy milk communally for the flat. One night I made a vegan stew for my flatmates - all the vegetables were UK-grown except the butter beans and lentils. I'd never cooked for them all before and was scared I'd bottle it. But they all really liked it. I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a more environmentally-friendly shampoo, but they're Â£6-7, and I'd usually spend Â£3. But I did invest Â£20 in a menstrual cup to cut down on waste and save money (a woman spends an average Â£4,800 on period products in her lifetime, according to the charity Bloody Good Period). My flatmates thought it a bit gross but I found it was just as good once I got used to it. Why menstrual cups are becoming more popular How shampoo is harming the environment What I learned: It only takes three or four days before it becomes automatic to think: buy loose, buy British and take your own bag Food is ridiculously over-packaged. I think it's a British thing to wrap fruit in plastic and cardboard - you wouldn't see it in Belgium Don't put the heating on, put a jumper on To my surprise, I've become pretty much vegetarian since the challenge - I don't even buy chicken any more Top tip:Prepare meals at the start of the week to reduce plastic and food waste - and save money. About:I'm a 31-year-old primary school teacher living in Bicester, Oxfordshire, with my partner and 18-month-old boy. Since my son's birth, I'm giving more thought to the sort of world he - and my class of nine and 10-year-olds - will grow up in. My week:At home, I made lots of small, simple changes which quickly became routine. My son wears disposable nappies which we usually put in a plastic nappy bag before binning. Instead, we only bagged up soiled nappies. Instead of a deep bath, we gave my little boy a shower over the bath with a plug in, using less water and he still got to splash around and play with his ducks. He loved that. I like my dairy and meat too much to have made any dietary changes - and my son is struggling to eat at the moment, so we carried on as normal with food. However, I did take leftovers from the previous night's dinner to work in Tupperware. I turned off the tap when I was brushing my teeth - or brushed them while in the shower. I monitored the heating, which was rarely above 15C (our semi-detached is well-insulated) and charged my mobile phone before bedtime so it wasn't charging through the night. Designers create the 'impossible' zero-carbon house In the classroom, I talked about the changes I was making in my life and asked each of the children to make one change at home. Theirs included turning the light off when they left a room; using a torch or fairy lights to read by at bedtime; using reusable water bottles, and turning the TV off at the switch. About 80% stuck to it for the whole week, and I felt proud and humbled they'd come on board. Change has a ripple effect - as a teacher you can influence 30 children, who then might influence 60 adults. At nine and 10, children are really positive, empathetic and absorb everything, like sponges. Next term, I plan to talk to them about energy and climate change in science lessons. What I learned:We are a throwaway society. We don't mend things any more nor realise quite how much we waste. We should think very carefully about what we use, why we use it and its impact on the environment and the world.

"Theatre boss rescues panto by starring in itBoy, 10, sent toys after losing kangaroo","Harvey (centre) seemed to take it in her stride When the leading actress in Theatr Clwyd's pantomime twisted her knee five minutes into Wednesday's performance, someone had to jump in quickly. Step forward the Welsh theatre's artistic director, Tamara Harvey. Emmy Stonelake was starring as Alice in Dick Whittington but was unable to continue after her injury. Harvey took the call as she was coaxing her toddler to eat broccoli - which most parents would agree is a more daunting task. ""It's something that every artistic director is prepared to do but I never expected I'd actually have to do it!"" she said. The theatre paid tribute to its new star, saying she ""saved the day by stepping onto the stage,externalto become Alice in our rock 'n' panto"", adding: ""We raise a glass and shout a massive thank you to you Tamara!"" Interestingly, her production of Home, I'm Darling at the National Theatre saw its artistic director, Rufus Norris, step into the breach when an actor became ill last year. Allow Twitter content?

Harries said: ""There's a bit of added pressure when the artistic director takes to the stage, particularly playing my son's love interest, but Tamara acquitted herself admirably and got a well-deserved standing ovation at the end of the show."" Harvey spoke last year about the need for a ""culture change"" in the theatre worldto improve conditions for working parents.

UK announces Iraq explosive clearance funds,"More than 40 explosives were found in this former playground in Mosul The UK is to give an extra Â£5m to help clear Islamic State (IS) explosives in Iraq, the government has announced. The Department for International Development (DfID) funding is in addition to the Â£24.9m the UK has contributed to demining projects in the country since 2015. The money will be given to the United Nations Mine Action Service. The UK is committed to spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid - spending Â£14.1bn in 2017. The biggest recipients were Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Syria and Somalia. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? My dad disarmed bombs with his bare hands About 1.8 million people are still displaced in Iraq and DfID says removing explosives from schools, hospitals and roads will help the country to return to normality. In 2018, 16,500 explosives, 800 suicide belts and 2,000 explosive traps were cleared from the country. Teams have cleared locations including a hospital used as IS's headquarters in Mosul, where 3,500 explosives were found and a school in Fallujah rigged with 13 IEDs. The funding will support six explosive clearance teams across the country's Sinjar Province, an area with a large Yazidi population that has been one of the worst affected by the occupation by Islamic State fighters. Iraq's government announced in December 2017 that its war against IS was over, almost four years after the group, which is also known as Daesh, first seized parts of the country. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: ""Daesh's sickening use of explosive traps continues to threaten children in their schools, mothers in hospitals and thousands of innocent people trying to return to a normal life. ""Thanks to this UK aid funded work, people can return to work, children can go back to school and lives are slowly being rebuilt.

Trump ready to shut government 'for years',"This video can not be played President Trump confirms he's prepared to shut down the government for months or years US President Donald Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a US-Mexico border wall without the approval of Congress. It came after he met senior Democrats, who refused his requests for funding. The stand-off has seen Mr Trump withhold support for a bill to fully fund the government until he gets money for the border wall. He said he was prepared for the partial government shutdown - now in its third week - to last years. Around 800,000 federal workers have been without pay since 22 December. The impact of the government shutdown How women are changing the face of Congress Trump aides and lawmakers will meet later on Saturday in a fresh bid to resolve the impasse. The Republican president initially gave a positive account of the 90-minute meeting at the White House, describing it as ""very productive"". But when asked whether he had considered using emergency presidential powers to bypass congressional approval of funding, Mr Trump said he had. ""I may do it. We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That's another way of doing it."" Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walk out of the West Wing ""I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing,"" the president added. ""I don't call it a shutdown, I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and safety of our country."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday's meeting had been ""contentious"", while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""We told the president we needed the government open. He resisted."" Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington Donald Trump says he can declare a ""national emergency"" and build his promised wall along the border without congressional approval. If that's the case, the question becomes why he doesn't go ahead and do that. Why put federal workers through the pain of forgoing pay and hamstring key government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, if he could bypass Democratic objections with the snap of his presidential fingers? The answer is because the solution isn't that simple. There are provisions of US law that allow the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from Defence Department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes. Such a move may prompt Congress, including Republicans, to push back. Then there's the inevitable legal challenge from Democrats to such an exercise of presidential authority. Any presidential order to build a wall would be met by an equally imposing wall of court filings blocking its construction. The president's latest suggestions are best viewed as simply another attempt to gain the upper hand in negotiations with Democrats. This may not be a threat, more a bluff. Democrats, who now hold the majority in the House, passed spending bills on Thursday to reopen the government, including $1.3bn (Â£1bn) of border security funds until 8 February. But the legislation cannot take effect unless it passes the Republican-controlled Senate, where leader Mitch McConnell said his party would not back any measure without the president's support. This video can not be played Five historic moments as new US Congress opens The Kentucky senator called the Democratic budget ""a time-wasting act of political posturing"". In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump also told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 raise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown. The fiscal fiasco began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate The Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Two vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 - Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine - have broken ranks to back approving the budget and ending the shutdown. The White House is again floating the idea of a deal for ""Dreamers"" - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. Democrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding. Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being ""talked about"", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible ""without a wall"".

Train knife murder suspect still at large,"The hunt for a murder suspect in Surrey is continuing after a train passenger was killed in front of his son. The 51-year-old victim died after suffering multiple knife wounds during a ""vicious fight"" on board a Guildford to London train on Friday afternoon. Police said the assailant, who fled the train, is black, in his 20s or 30s, about 6ft tall, slim, with a beard and dressed all in black with white shoes. The public has been warned not to approach him but to call 999 instead. The victim and the attacker had both boarded the train at London Road station in Guildford at about 13:00 GMT, but police believe the pair were not known to each other. Supt Paul Langley, from British Transport Police, said the victim's 14-year-old son would have seen his father being attacked. ""This would have been an horrific and hugely traumatic event to have witnessed and we are providing him with as much support as possible,"" he said. Forensics officers took items away from Horsley station He said the suspect left the train at Clandon station, Surrey, five minutes after boarding the services. Officers boarded the train at the next stop, Horsley, after the alarm was raised. Supt Langley said the suspect, who fled towards Dedswell Drive, was spotted a number of times in the area. He added: ""We have a number of officers in the area working hard to trace the man responsible for this violent and deadly attack. ""We are working close with Surrey Police and the National Police Air Service who are helping us to locate him."" An eyewitness to the killing told the BBC there had been a ""vicious fight"" on the train. A social media user who said she had been on the train praised the ""incredible"" response of the guards and driver. She wrote: ""I was on this train, how those guards and especially that train driver went into action was nothing short of incredible."" A private ambulance was seen arriving at Horsley station o n Friday evening Oliver Thompson, a 16-year-old student living in Clandon, said he was stopped by police in the area at roughly 14:30 and asked if he had seen a ""man running from the station"". A little later he saw police helicopters circling the area before being joined by ""a police van with high-powered lights"" as night fell. ""It is definitely unnerving to think there is a murderer maybe somewhere in the village."" Horsley station was closed for several hours while forensic investigations took place Matt Phelps, 35, who works at a business on Epsom Road in West Clandon, said there were three helicopters circling overhead when they locked up and went home. ""To think there was someone like that potentially hiding around the corner somewhere certainly made us want to pack up and go home quicker than usual,"" he said. After the attacker left the train at Clandon, emergency services were called to help the injured man when the train reached Horsley. Emergency teams were at the scene for several hours Transport Secretary Chris Grayling described the stabbing as ""tragic"" and said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the victim and their family."" The train remained at Horsley station for several hours, blocking the line into London Waterloo. Rail services were suspended between Guildford and Effingham Junction for nearly seven hours while police carried out investigations. South Western Railway said all lines had now reopened again with services returning to normal.

Brazilâs own Trump?," The candidate floated above the crowds, carried on their shoulders. The main commercial street in the south-eastern city of Juiz de Fora was packed for his rally. He wore a yellow T-shirt with green block letters - “My party is Brazil”. It was 6 September, three weeks into the most unpredictable presidential campaign in Brazil’s recent history. Jair Bolsonaro had given a thumbs-up to the crowd - smiling at chants of “the captain is back”. Suddenly he clutched his stomach with both hands. Grimacing in pain, he slowly slipped to the ground. Bolsonaro had just been stabbed with a 20cm kitchen knife. A man called Adelio Bispo de Oliveira was nearly lynched by the crowd. The suspect would reportedly later tell police he had acted on “God’s command”. Videos of the attack were watched over and over again by Brazilians. Bolsonaro’s abdomen was punctured and he lost two litres of blood. But as awful as the attack was, it proved to be a turning point for his campaign. Image posted by Bolsonaro's son Flávio on Twitter “You have just elected the president,” his eldest son, Flávio Bolsonaro, wrote on Twitter. A defiant picture showed his father lying in a hospital bed in a blue gown, with tubes sticking into his nose. The candidate did his trademark gesture, pointing his fingers, like pistols. Bolsonaro had been considered too extreme by many, with his broadsides against women, gay people, black people and even democracy, his violent rhetoric against his opponents and his nostalgia for Brazil’s military dictatorship. But he was now the victim of an assassination attempt. The breaking news story was not covered by the media regulations imposed during the campaign. Flávio Bolsonaro outside Santa Casa hospital Under normal circumstances, Bolsonaro and his small Social Liberal Party (PSL) would only have been entitled to very brief TV campaign ads - just eight seconds. But now he was all over the airwaves. “Look what a holy stab that was. It changed everything,” influential pastor Silas Malafaia recalls telling him in a hospital visit. “All people talk about is you.” His contenders were “dying of envy”. According to Malafaia, Bolsonaro chuckled but held back his laughter. It made his stitches hurt. Being injured did something else. It meant Bolsonaro could not take part in televised debates against his rivals. At first this was following clear doctors’ orders - he had suffered very serious injuries. But things didn’t change even after doctors recognised his improvement and said it was his call - the surgeon advised that although he could not stand for long periods he could do a shorter debate while sitting in a comfortable chair. Bolsonaro's campaign pointed out that he still had health problems and discomfort from having a colostomy bag. Bolsonaro avoided additional exposure when he was already leading in the polls. Brazilians elected a president in a run-off vote without ever having seen a face-off between the two final candidates. So how did he get there? Results of Brazil's 2018 presidential election In 1970, troops arrived in the scenic Ribeira Valley in the state of São Paulo, hunting for enemies of the military regime in the woods and farmland around the town of Eldorado. It was the most violent phase of a dictatorship that had started six years earlier with a military coup against President João Goulart. The soldiers in the Ribeira Valley were looking for Carlos Lamarca. The former captain had deserted the army a year earlier to join a leftist guerrilla group and became one of the leaders of the armed struggle against the regime. He had come to Eldorado to set up a training ground in the valley. President Joao Goulart (L) and President Kennedy (R) leaving the White House, 1962 It was Bolsonaro’s home town - he was 15 years old. “[Lamarca] was in the region and injured six soldiers,” Bolsonaro recalled in a 2017 interview. ""He took one of them... as a hostage, and then killed him with strikes of a rifle butt - cowardly.” As the war between the military regime and left-wing guerrilla fighters came near his door, the young Bolsonaro chose his side. “I knew everything in those woods and I passed on information to the soldiers about the places,” he said. He and other young men in the region offered guidance to the army to help find Lamarca’s hideaway. The guerrilla managed to escape, but was killed a year later. As for the boy, he decided to join the army. At 18, Bolsonaro enrolled in the preparatory school for cadets. It was the start of a military career that would mould Bolsonaro’s beliefs. Our Lady of Guidance Church, Eldorado He had been born into a family of six children, descended mostly from Italian immigrants - the surname came from his Venetian great-grandfather, initially spelled Bolzonaro. His father was a dentist, the only one in town, and his mother a housewife. They were not wealthy and rented a simple house by the Ribeira do Iguape river. The young Bolsonaro used to go fishing on the river and extracted heart of palm in the woods to make some money. Palmito, as the inner core of palms is called in Portuguese, was one of his nicknames - he was long, lean and very light-skinned. He helped his father produce dentures for his clinic. And he liked shooting birds with pellet guns and going on hunts for gold in areas that had been mined in the past. Celso Luiz Leite and his wife Maria do Carmo Ferreira Leite Those close to him remember him as a serious young man, a dedicated student. “He wasn’t the party type. He liked doing sports and going fishing,” says Celso Luiz Leite, 63, whose sister is married to one of Bolsonaro’s brothers. “A friend of his told me Jair always said he wanted to be the president of Brazil.” Today the region mostly survives off its abundant banana plantations and some tourism. Bolsonaro’s siblings still live there and are a lot better off - his family now own a number of furniture and construction suppliers. People in Eldorado hope that now he’s president, Bolsonaro won’t forget them. “We have good expectations,” says Antonio Carlos de Melo Cunha, 64, who used to go to school with Bolsonaro. “If he stops all this stealing in politics it’s already an important mark. And I believe he may bring some benefits to our region.” Agulhas Negras Military Academy In 1977, Bolsonaro graduated from Brazil’s Agulhas Negras academy for army officers, three hours away from Rio, in the city of Resende. The writing on the school’s facade summarises their philosophy: “Cadet! You will command. Learn to obey.” There he quickly stood out as an athlete. His speed on the running track and strength in the military pentathlon team earned him the nickname of Cavalão (“Big Horse”). His training continued at the army’s physical education school and then with the Paratrooper Brigade in Rio de Janeiro, where Bolsonaro settled. He rose to the rank of captain. But then he did something officers were not allowed to do - he spoke out. In 1986, he used an article in a news magazine to argue that colleagues were giving up their careers because of inadequate wages. A year later, he came under investigation over graver allegations. The same magazine accused Bolsonaro and a colleague of a plot to plant small explosive devices in military bases - supposedly designed to make a commotion and pressure government officials into raising salaries. Bolsonaro denied the plot. A military council initially ruled that he should be stripped of his post but when his case was sent to the Supreme Military Court he was acquitted. Despite that, his military career was effectively over. And his relationship with the media hadn’t started off well. “He lost his position in the armed forces because of fallacies published by the press,” says journalist Waldir Luiz Ferraz, who has worked with him ever since. “He stood no chance of pursuing a successful military career. So he was advised to go into politics.” Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, 1991 Brazil’s 21-year dictatorship came to an end in 1985 and a new constitution was proclaimed in 1988. It became known as the “citizens’ constitution”. That was also the year Bolsonaro was elected to Rio’s city council. Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, 1991 The former captain’s outspoken demands for higher pay had given him fame among his peers, and earned him support from the military community. “The campaign took lots of hard work,” recalls Ferraz, who did his public relations from then on. “We’d always be up at dawn slipping leaflets under the doors of military houses.” In 1991, Bolsonaro moved on to the lower house of Congress, again boosted by voters from the military. Congressman Chico Alencar entered Rio’s city council in the same year as him and came to have a parallel trajectory in Congress, but on the left. “From the beginning, Bolsonaro emerged as a dictatorship nostalgic and a defender of the military. He was obsessed with attacking what he referred to as subversives from the left,” recalls Alencar, a history teacher as well as a politician. In 1993, Bolsonaro rose to the Congress podium to proclaim: “I am in favour of a dictatorship. We will never resolve serious national problems with this irresponsible democracy.” He was depicted on the front page of O Globo, the Rio newspaper, as a dinosaur in army boots - Stupidosaurus, according to the cartoon. Front page of the O Globo newspaper, 1993 “His views were always very narrow, sectarian,” says Alencar. “He was seen as an eccentric figure - rude, authoritarian, always saying the same things.” Bolsonaro has been married three times, and has five children. His first wife, Rogeria Bolsonaro, was elected a councillor in Rio shortly after he went to Congress. Bolsonaro with three of his sons (L-R): Flávio, Eduardo and Carlos His three older sons, Flavio, Carlos and Eduardo, have followed his steps to form a Bolsonaro political clan. They were all elected lawmakers at early ages. Carlos, now 36, became a city councillor aged 17. “He used to joke and tell me that one day the Bolsonaros would be bigger than [my] PSOL,” says Alencar, referring to his own small Socialism and Liberty Party. Maria do Rosário (L) and Bolsonaro (R) clash once again during a debate at the Brazilian parliament, 2016 It was 2003, Maria do Rosário’s first year as a deputy in Congress, and she had a press interview about her work heading a commission that fought the sexual abuse of children. Bolsonaro was being interviewed before her, inside the Congress building. He was arguing for the reduction of the age of criminal responsibility, based on a recent case of a teenager who had murdered a young couple. But his words had a belligerent tone that shocked Maria do Rosario, she recalls. According to her version, she told him he should calm down, arguing that violence begets more violence. He was enraged. Bolsonaro and Maria do Rosário during an interview on RedeTV!, 2003 “Are you calling me a rapist?” he said, turning to the camera. “She’s calling me a rapist!” And he looked at her: “I would never rape you because you don’t deserve it.” She told him she would slap him if he made any such move. “Do it and I will slap you back,” he shouted, repeating the sentence six times as he pushed her and called hervagabunda- a whore. The episode was one of a long list of past outbursts seized on by critics of Bolsonaro during the presidential election campaign. Bolsonaro during a debate on violence against women in the Brazilianparliament, 2016 Bolsonaro has said he was “proud to be homophobic” and that he’d rather see a son die in an accident than appear with a “moustached” partner. He said he wouldn’t hire a woman for the same salary as a man since they get pregnant. He described “quilombolas”, as descendants of African former slaves are known, as people who “did nothing” and were too fat “even to breed”, criticising how much they cost the government in welfare programmes. Bolsonaro said that Brazil would be a better country if the dictatorship had killed more people, including former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He had also vowed he would shut down Congress “on the same day” if he were ever elected president, referring to parliament as “useless” in a 1999 interview. “Let’s do the coup, already. Let’s go straight to the dictatorship,” he said at the time. Who would elect a president like that, his opponents asked. Pro-Bolsonaro Women's March, 2018 But he struck a chord with supporters - his unfiltered remarks conveyed a frank, no-nonsense image. Like US President Donald Trump, they saw him as someone who spoke his mind - and at times said things many people thought, but were too afraid to say. “Bolsonaro managed to capture a social feeling that was out there,” notes sociologist Esther Solano, a professor at the Federal University of São Paulo and organiser of the book of essays Hate as Politics: The Reinvention of the Right in Brazil, published in Brazil in 2018. “When he makes homophobic or racist jokes, he knows this will raise controversy, but he also knows that many in his ‘base’ will nod approvingly,” says Solano, underlining how conservative many people in Brazil are when it comes to gender, race and class divisions. Electing a president like Bolsonaro might not have been possible a few years ago in Brazil, she says - but after Trump, a new way of doing politics was established. Anti-Bolsonaro's Women's March, 2018 Emphasis on the politically incorrect and on controversy became a form of campaigning. “Trump opened the door to others who wanted to follow,” says Solano. During the campaign, feminist groups organised under the motto #EleNão, “Not Him”, urging voters to choose other candidates. Huge protests were held a week ahead of the first round of votes in over a hundred Brazilian cities. #EleNao, or Not Him, the hashtag of the anti-Bolsonaro Women's March, 2018 Bolsonaro’s allies say the media is hostile towards him and distorts his words, taking them out of context. Joice Hasselmann, a former TV and radio presenter who ran for Congress in 2018 under Bolsonaro’s umbrella, used to think he went too far - until they met four years ago and there was “immediate empathy”. “He’s very different from what you think from what you see on the news,” she says. “He is a big man with a boy’s heart. He’s very sweet and humorous. “Jair is not a good communicator. Sometimes he gets trampled by his words.” Bolsonaro with Joice Hasselmann Lawmaker Alberto Fraga, who was in the same class as Bolsonaro at the army’s physical education school and has shared much of his time in Congress, says “people exaggerate”. “His positions are very clear. But they are also very firm. If he doesn’t agree with something, that’s that. He doesn’t even let the conversation go on,” Fraga says. Congressman Alberto Fraga He describes him as a playful and popular character, who would stop to take pictures with fans in Congress and always had lunch in the cafeteria along with the general staff. Fraga says he witnessed the row between Bolsonaro and Maria do Rosario back in 2003. “She’s the one who called him a rapist. She’s the one who said she would hit him. He said he would hit her back,” he says in his defence. Bolsonaro during a debate in the Brazilian parliament, 2016 “He is like a snake,” says his long-time PR agent Waldir Luiz Ferraz. “When he is attacked, he attacks back. As long as he’s not attacked, he’s really easygoing.” But Do Rosário denies ever having called him a rapist, and says she still suffers attacks from his supporters on the internet. “He adopted the same attitude as men who attack women and then say they are to blame, saying they did it because she deserved it. I’m not willing to accept that,” she says. “He wins discussions by shouting, and that’s how he got elected.” In a green T-shirt, with a backdrop of bushes and clothes lines covered with washing, Bolsonaro started an impassioned campaign speech as birds chirped in the sunny backyard of his home. It was a week before the final vote of the 2018 presidential elections. He shouted into a smartphone while someone filmed him with another. His audience was 500km away from Rio - thousands of followers gathering in São Paulo’s iconic Paulista Avenue. Paulista Avenue “This time, the clean-up will be even greater. This group, if they want to stay, will have to abide by our laws,” he roared. “These red outlaws will be banned from our homeland. Either they go overseas, or they go to jail.” The speech was rapidly shared, and went down with dread or delight, depending on which side of a divided Brazil was watching. The “reds” were the Workers’ Party - the PT - and demonising the left-wing group was a key part of his campaign strategy. Heavy unemployment, economic crises, escalating violence and a series of corruption scandals that discredited the whole political system all provided fertile ground for Bolsonaro. “We have to change all this,” became his informal trademark phrase. “This” included the PT. After winning four presidential elections, the party was tainted by corruption scandals revealed byOperation Car Wash, the investigation which has uncovered a series of kickback schemes involving a number of political parties. To many Brazilians, enthusiasm for the period of growth under former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has long been forgotten, and the PT has become synonymous with corruption and economic crisis as inequality and poverty levels rose. Lula himself was charged with corruption and jailed for 12 years in April 2018. He denies the charges. The economy derailed under Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budget laws. She denies any wrongdoing. The PT offered former São Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad as candidate for 2018’s election - but a big chunk of voters just didn’t want the PT back. Presidential candidate Fernando Haddad (C) Rousseff had been ousted in a controversial process that the left called a “parliamentary coup”, and which deepened social divides between left and right. The mass protests calling for her to be removed were a platform for right-wing groups in Brazil. They grew and became organised, adopting the patriotic green and yellow of the Brazilian flag. Anti-corruption protesters sing the national anthem along Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro Still, Bolsonaro was running for a tiny party and was seen as an unimportant politician who in 27 years in Congress had only approved two minor bills and had rotated between different parties. His ideas were considered too extreme for a viable candidacy at first, but that changed in a time of disillusionment. Other centre-right candidates failed to gain support, and Bolsonaro started to appear as the only right-wing candidate who could beat the Workers’ Party. “Brazilian democracy opened a number of doors and Bolsonaro was able to walk through,” says Timothy Power, director of the Brazilian Studies Programme at the University of Oxford. “You have to give him credit for having very good political instincts. He knew this was the year. His support base was very narrow, but he smelled the blood in the water after the impeachment. “The political system was vulnerable to a clever populist who could create an anti-system and an anti-PT message.” Bolsonaro ran a highly unconventional campaign. He had a small party machine and a paltry campaign budget. He resorted to the power of social media and his knack of speaking directly to his voters in blunt, simple language. Press reports outside Brazil nicknamed him the “Trump of the Tropics”. With a multitude of Tweets and Facebook live videos, he built a solid base of followers - called “Bolsominions” by opponents. He talked about everything - from politics and the electoral race to his recovery in hospital and attacks against the “fake news” media and his opponents. Microphones placed on top of a bodyboard at a press conference held at Bolsonaro's home There were snapshots of his everyday life - like a picture of him seated at a messy breakfast table covered in breadcrumbs, using a can of condensed milk (a national favourite) to spread on bread. “In a period where politicians were being rejected left and right, he got some brownie points for conveying authenticity and for having a very simple set of messages: ‘I’m against corruption. I’m against politicians. I’m against crime, drugs and gangs.’ These things resonate with the public,” says Power. But critics complained about a wave of “fake news” during the campaign, with rumours swirling online - particularly on WhatsApp - about his opponents. Bolsonaro knew things were going well. At every town he travelled to, he was greeted by crowds of frenzied supporters at the airport. I was at one of these receptions and saw him carried on his voters’ shoulders to the chants of “myth”, wrapped in a presidential sash, seven months ahead of the elections. His candidacy was backed by supportive groups in Congress, notably the BBB - the Bible, Bull and Bullet triumvirate - representing the evangelical churches, agribusiness and pro-gun lobbyists. Bolsonaro pledged to ease gun control, so that “honest citizens” could own weapons, and to interrupt demarcation of indigenous land reserves, which scored points with the rural sector. And he embraced a conservative moral agenda together with evangelical groups in Congress, standing for the values of the “traditional family” and “the innocence of children”. This alliance had been strengthened when Bolsonaro and pastors in Congress joined to condemn a package of educational material that the Dilma Rousseff government tried to introduce in 2011, to tackle homophobia in schools. They called it the “gay kit” and said it would teach children how to be homosexuals. The material ended up being dropped. Bolsonaro was raised a Catholic, but was symbolically baptised in Israel’s Jordan River by an evangelical pastor in 2017. His campaign motto was: “Brazil above all, God above everyone.” “We share the same views and the same agendas,” says pastor Silas Malafaia, who performed Bolsonaro’s wedding ceremony to the now first lady Michelle Bolsonaro in 2013. First lady Michelle and the president “We’re all against abortion, gender ideology, gay marriage. The left-wing governments were attacking our moral values,” he says. As the race progressed, Bolsonaro started to appear as the only right-wing candidate who could beat the Workers’ Party. Winning over business leaders was largely down to his economic guru, Paulo Guedes, a free-market advocate who earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago. Guedes, now minister of economy, made Bolsonaro appeal to Brazilians who wanted to see liberal economic policies implemented. Bolsonaro himself admits he doesn’t understand economics. “He knows his limitations. He’s a very humble and simple man,” says pastor Malafaia. After Bolsonaro won, he recalls his words to him. “I’m like the Beetle that made it into a Formula 1 race and won. The improbable of the improbable,” he told the pastor. They both laughed. Bolsonaro and his wife Michelle arrive at the Planalto presidential palace On 28 October, as soon as Bolsonaro learned he had won, he did a Facebook live. At his home in Rio, he sat with his wife on one side, a sign language interpreter on the other, and carefully chosen books on the desk: The Bible, Brazil’s constitution, World War II memoirs by Winston Churchill and a collection of articles by Olavo de Carvalho, a self-taught philosopher who has become a guru to Brazil’s right-wing. He thanked God, the medical team that had “operated a miracle” in saving his life, and his loyal followers on the internet. He hadn’t gone for the presidency out of personal ambition, “but out of the certainty that we could change Brazil’s destiny,” he said. Maintaining a stern expression, he declared: “God clearly has a purpose for me and for all of us in Brazil.” He then prayed in a circle with his allies. Only after that did he make an official, nationwide TV-address. Bolsonaro’s first moments as president-elect reflected his strong allegiance to his followers both on social media and in evangelical groups. But in an attempt to dispel fears raised by his controversial history, he vowed to respect the constitution and democratic rule, and to govern for the country as a whole. “We will offer you a decent government, which will truly work for all Brazilians.” Celebrations outside Bolsonaro's house in Rio. Placard reads: ""Bolsonaro you're the man"" Outside his house in Rio, on the beachfront, the party exploded. Supporters lit fireworks, sang the national anthem and wrapped themselves in the Brazilian flag. Vendors sold inflatable dolls depicting former President Lula in a black and white prison uniform, and key rings showing Bolsonaro wearing sunglasses, a presidential sash and pointing his fingers. “We are just so thrilled that he won. We defeated communism!” a woman told me in the middle of the crowd outside, waving a flag and wearing a T-shirt with the slogan BolsoMito - “BolsoMyth”. Over the past months, Brazilians have watched as Bolsonaro made his first moves as a president who promised to change the way politics is conducted in Brazil. One by one, he announced his ministers on Twitter. He had promised to reduce his cabinet from 29 to 15 ministries - he ended up stopping at 22 in total. The cabinet he built around him reflects his views about the military, his moral values and his contempt for the left-wing governments of the PT. It includes a Ministry for Women, Family and Human Rights, led by a female, anti-abortion evangelical pastor; an environment minister who says global warming is a “secondary issue”; and a foreign minister who has promised to “help Brazil and the world liberate themselves from globalist ideology”. Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights Damares Alves After South America’s wave of left-wing governments in the mid-2000s, Bolsonaro’s foreign policy now signals an alignment with an emerging global right. Trump called to congratulate Bolsonaro straight after his election and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu andHungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbántravelled to the presidential inauguration on 1 January. As well as Bolsonaro himself, seven of his ministers and his vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, have military backgrounds. First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro (L), Jair Bolsonaro (C) and Vice-President Hamilton Mourão (R) during their inauguration ceremony Appointed head of the presidential office for national security, retired Army General Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira says in no way does this make it a “military government”. “I hope people understand that he is a president for all Brazilians,” says the general, who commanded a UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti and is an old friend of Bolsonaro’s. Newly appointed Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni (L) and head of the Office for National Security, retired army general Augusto Heleno (R) Bolsonaro takes on the post with huge challenges ahead for Brazil. The country has seen a sluggish recovery from recession and growth is expected to stay at 1% this year. Its debt is among the highest in any emerging economy. Unemployment has reached 12 million and crime rates have been rising year after year - with 63,000 homicides across the country in 2017. Bolsonaro has pledged to implement pension reform to reduce government spending and achieve fiscal balance. But this is a highly unpopular measure that requires two-thirds support in Congress - and he has kept to a campaign promise of not distributing seats to potential allies in parliament, which may create challenges for governance in the future. “He will now have to make alliances, form coalitions, work with different parties on the floor of Congress,” says Timothy Power. If part of Brazil has high hopes for the former captain, another part is deeply worried about how his ideas will play out into policies. On his first day in office, Bolsonaro adjusted Brazil’s minimum wage, with an increase that was slightly lower than expected - reflecting new inflation estimates. He made it harder to create reserves for indigenous communities and descendants of slaves. He removed any mention of LGBT concerns from national human rights directives. Bolsonaro receives the presidential sash Brazil’s stock market closed at an all-time high on the next day, after ministers reinforced their pledge to privatise state-owned companies and with hopes of a turnaround in Latin America’s biggest economy. Areas of special concern include the environment and the protection of the rainforest and of Brazil’s indigenous people, human rights, social benefits, education, and the freedom of press, schools and academia. With his attacks against the “fake news media” and pledges to tackle “political indoctrination” by school teachers, there are fears of restrictions in freedom of thought. There is also anxiety about whether his government could impact the rights of women, black people, LGBT people, and indigenous people. During the campaign he said minorities would have to “bow to the majority… or disappear”. Crowds gather for Bolsonaro's swearing-in ceremony “A campaign is a campaign,” says General Augusto Heleno. “Now it’s important to think positive, especially with the situation Brazil is in. The country was put on the verge of the abyss economically, politically and socially. We need to rebuild Brazil. “I hope he may surprise the part of the population that did not vote for him.” Correction: This story has been amended to reflect that the minimum wage was not reduced;it wasincreased by a slightly lower than anticipated amount.
