Churchill statue 'may have to be put in museum'The war-time leader's granddaughter says the statue may be safer in a museum if protests continue.UK,"A statue of Churchill in Parliament Square was boarded up ahead of a Black Lives Matter protest on Friday A statue of Winston Churchill may have to be put in a museum to protect it if demonstrations continue, his granddaughter has said. Emma Soames told the BBC the war-time prime minister was a ""complex man"" but he was considered a hero by millions. She said she was ""shocked"" to see the monument in London's Parliament Square boarded up, although she said she understood why this was necessary. It came after protesters daubed ""was a racist"" on the statue last weekend. Ms Soames said it was ""extraordinarily sad that my grandfather, who was such a unifying figure in this country, appears to have become a sort of icon through being controversial."" ""We've come to this place where history is viewed only entirely through the prism of the present,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Calls to remove 'racist' Gandhi statue How many statues of black people does the UK have? Ms Soames acknowledged her grandfather had often held views which ""particularly now are regarded as unacceptable but weren't necessarily then"". However she added: ""He was a powerful, complex man, with infinitely more good than bad in the ledger of his life."" She said if people were ""so infuriated"" by seeing the statue it may be ""safer"" in a museum. ""But I think Parliament Square would be a poorer place without him,"" she added. Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames said he was ""deeply upset"" after the statue was vandalised and then boarded up. ""I find it extraordinary that millions and millions of people all over the world who look up to Britain will be astonished that a statue of Churchill and the Cenotaph, our national war memorial, could have been defaced in this disgusting way,""he told the Daily Telegraph,external. Last weekend the statue of Winston Churchill was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" However, author Shrabani Basu, who has written books about the British Empire, said there were ""two sides of Churchill"" and ""we need to know his darkest hour as well as his finest hour"". She argued that in India, Churchill is not seen as a hero, citing his role in the 1943 Bengal famine, during which at least three million people are believed to have died. While Ms Basu said she did not want to see the statue removed from Parliament Square, she said people should be taught ""the whole story"" about the war-time figure. Black Lives Matter activist Imarn Ayton said statues of slave traders and people who had spoken negatively towards black people were ""extremely offensive"" and should be moved to museums. ""I think it's a win-win to everyone so we no longer offend the black nation and we also get to keep our history,"" she told the BBC. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonbranded the boarding up of the statue to protect it from potential vandalism as ""absurd and shameful"". Mr Johnson said the former prime minister had expressed opinions which were ""unacceptable to us today"" but remained a hero for saving the country from ""fascist and racist tyranny"". ""We cannot try to edit or censor our past,"" he wrote of moves to remove tributes to historical figures. ""We cannot pretend to have a different history."" This video can not be played Britainâs wartime leader divided opinion in his own lifetime, and remains a divisive figure today Winston Churchill, who lived between 30 November 1874 and 24 January 1965, is often named among Britain's greatest-ever people but for some he remains an intensely controversial figure. Despite his leading the country through the darkest hours of World War Two and being prime minister twice, critics point to his comments on race and some of his actions during both world wars. Churchill told thePalestine Royal Commission,externalthat he did not admit wrong had been done to Native Americans or aboriginal Australians as ""a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place"". His supporters argue that he was by no means the only person to hold these sorts of views during the period. He also advocated the use of chemical weapons, ""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes,""he wrote in a memo,external. Another criticism is for his part inthe Bengal famine in Indiain 1943, during which at least three million people are believed to have died after Allied forces halted the movement of food in the region - including through British-run India - following the Japanese occupation of Burma.

A demonstration planned for Saturday was brought forward by a day because of fears there could be violent clashes with far-right groups. The Met Policehave placed restrictions on several groups intending to protest on Saturday, including requiring demonstrations to end at 17:00 BST. Thousands of people gathered in Central London on Saturday, including around the Cenotaph war memorial in Whitehall and the nearby Churchill statue. The protesters, largely groups of white men who were right-wing activists, sang the national anthem and chanted ""England"", amid a tense atmosphere and heavy police presence. Among the demonstrators was Paul Golding, leader of far-right group Britain First, who said they had turned out to ""guard our monuments"". Other monuments have been removed ahead of separate protests planned over the weekend, while the Cenotaph has also been covered. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said other ""key statues"", including one of Nelson Mandela, would be protected, saying there was a risk statues could become a ""flashpoint for violence"". It comes after the statue ofslave trader Edward Colston was thrown into the harbour in Bristolduring a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday. Demonstrations have been taking place across the world followingthe death in police custody of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis last month.

The football club healing the wounds of Grenfell,"Joseph says football has helped him escape the trauma in ways he couldn't before Joseph John was about to get into bed in the early hours of 14 June 2017. He heard noise coming from outside the second-floor apartment he shared with his partner and 14-month-old son in the Grenfell Tower. He looked through his curtains and saw a fire engine. He then caught a bright red reflection in the window of a parked car. ""I saw the building was on fire,"" Joseph, 29, recalls. He woke his partner and rushed out of the flat to seek help. Joseph's partner is disabled and he needed help in evacuating his family from the 24-storey tower. A firefighter told him to go back inside the flat and someone would assist them in getting out. But after an hour, as flames engulfed the tower's upper floors, he and his partner realised they couldn't risk waiting any longer. Joseph passed their baby over a large gate to a stranger downstairs before carrying his partner through the window and over the gate himself. They managed to get out just in time. Seventy-two people did not. Joseph is still struggling to process the trauma he experienced. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. A few months after the fire, Joseph heard about a new local football team that had started up. A keen player, he eventually decided to check out a training session. Finally, he could take his mind off what had happened that night. ""I tried cooking, I tried working, I tried everything,"" he says. ""Nothing seemed to work for me, other than football."" Joseph wasn't the only one. This is the story of a very special Sunday league team, Grenfell Athletic. The Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington, west London, was one of the worst disasters in British modern history. It began on the fourth floor of the tower just before 01:00 BST on 14 June. By 04:30 more than 100 flats were on fire. The blaze did not burn itself out for 24 hours. Rupert Taylor was born and raised on the streets surrounding Grenfell and used to play on football pitches beneath the tower. He started volunteering as a youth worker in 2005 and at the time of the fire was manager of the local youth centre. Nine children from the youth centre died in the tower. Justice4Grenfell says more than 23,000 homes in the UK are still covered in ""Grenfell-style cladding"" Rupert was on holiday in Gibraltar when he received a phone call in the early hours of 14 June. ""I turned on the news. My heart sunk, it was horrific,"" he recalls. ""We didn't know who was alive."" He got the first plane back to London and got straight to work in helping people affected by the fire. ""When I got back I drove inâ¦ the smell of burning was real,"" he says. ""I was trying to get support for the residents who were wandering the streets trying to find out about their loved ones."" A few days later, Rupert noticed a young man wandering outside the youth centre looking lost. He asked the man if he was OK and if he wanted to come in and get some supplies. He politely declined but they exchanged phone numbers. The man later came into the centre and they started to talk. He told Rupert he was a resident of the tower. ""He seemed like a very lonely chap,"" Rupert says. ""He told me that he'd lost both his parents a few years ago. A couple of weeks in, we were building a relationship and I noticed he was really struggling. I asked what helped him get through the time when he lost his parents and the first thing that came out of his mouth was 'football'. ""I said: 'Right, we're going to create a team.'"" Inside the Grenfell Athletic changing room - the team started up for the 2017-18 season Grenfell Athletic was born barely a month after the fire. Rupert started to put word around the local community and training sessions were set up. Because it was so soon after the fire, he wanted it to be as open as possible. Many were still recovering mentally and physically, and he wanted residents to feel able to pop in for training sessions without fully committing to the team. Grenfell Athletic joined the Middlesex County Football League for the 2017-18 season. The early days were turbulent. ""It was the strain of the shadow of what we were all walking out for,"" Rupert says. ""The 72 lives that were lost. Every time we went out to the pitch, we did a minute's silence. It starts to wear you down and it's quite heavy on the soul. ""Children lost their lives. You're seeing their faces when you get out on the pitch and you say you're doing this for them. You're trying to build something greater than your bog-standard Sunday league team."" Grenfell Athletic soon started to gel and finished fifth out of 12 teams in their first season - a solid start for a new team founded under such tough circumstances. At the end of the season, the team went on a tour of Italy where they played semi-professional Lanciano from the Italian fifth tier. The trip was an important part of the healing process for a lot of the players, many of whom hadn't properly left the area since the fire. It was, Rupert says, ""a time for them to be away from the shadow of this area and the tower"". Bonded after their Italian tour, the team fully found their stride in the second season. They lost just one game and won both the league - gaining promotion - and League Cup. Rupert (right) celebrating with the team's League Cup trophy last year After the fire, Joseph and his family had to spend the first few days living in a local church, before eventually being given a room in a hotel - where they stayed for a year. They have been in temporary housing since. As time went on, Joseph struggled to come to terms with the night of the fire. He knew people who lost their lives. He recalls a family he would chat to and help out in the tower's lift. They didn't make it out. ""For me, it was super difficult, even now. Every day I feel like I am living back in 2017,"" he says. Joseph, who moved to the UK four years ago, is from a family of footballers and grew up playing in his native Trinidad and Tobago - even representing his country at under-17 level. The team soon helped him escape the trauma in ways he hadn't been able to before. He also started opening up to some of his team-mates about the fire. ""It helped me grow bonds with them, it helped me be open. I can discuss anything with some of my team-mates,"" he says. ""We can chat one to one - man to man - it makes me feel comfortable. ""I don't like being around people, I don't like meeting people, I don't like being in people's space - I like to be around myself. But in football you can't have that. 'Football is my family, football is my community,"" Joseph says ""You have to be respectful, you have to be considerate to your team-mates, you have to be uplifting. It's different rules - being part of the team."" By mid-March of this year, Grenfell Athletic were joint second in the table, and then coronavirus hit. ""Right now my mental health is going down badly with no football and just staying at home,"" he said in April. ""I can't go to my physio, I can't go to my therapist. It's hard."" Many of the team did not live in Grenfell, but the tower had been a constant in their lives. Boxer Dan-Dan Keenan, 23, grew up in the area and started training at the Dale Youth Boxing Club inside Grenfell Tower aged 10. Dan-Dan was outside the tower on the night of the fire, speaking to his best friend's father, Tony, on the phone. Tony was trapped on the 23rd floor and never made it out. ""I rang him when I first got there to tell him there was a fire and he said 'thanks for making me aware but I already know,'"" Dan-Dan recalls. ""We were watching it, so it's pretty bad."" Dan-Dan soon heard about Grenfell Athletic from local friends he grew up with playing football. ""I wanted to get involved in remembrance of Grenfell and especially in remembrance of Tony. But also, besides that, I just wanted to play football,"" he says. ""It means that everyone is still talking about Grenfell, which is always a good thing. Obviously we want to remember them and not just let it get swept under the carpet."" Grenfell Athletic are now hoping to establish a permanent home in the local area While the club is still in its infancy, everyone you speak to from Grenfell Athletic is dreaming big. Rupert is eyeing up a plot of land in Greenford, west London, that could one day be the team's official home (they currently play around six miles away in Chiswick). Dan-Dan says that a home ground of their own would help build the team's profile. ""I see a lot of Sunday league clubs - YouTube teams, for example - and they've got hundreds and hundreds of people watching and supporting them,"" he says. ""If we can get a home pitch which is local to Grenfell I'm sure people - whether they like football or not - will come and support us just because we are representing Grenfell."" Joseph agrees that a real home and top-quality coaching is needed for the team to take the next step up and bag more silverware. But the importance of Grenfell Athletic goes far beyond titles and trophies for Joseph. ""I have no family here, I'm here on my own with my kids and my partner. Football is my family, football is my community,"" he says. ""They're like my brothers. Well, they are my brothers.""

Fear of Beijing second wave after market outbreakParts of China's capital are locked down after its first new coronavirus cases in nearly two months.,"Xinfadi is the biggest wholesale market in Beijing An area of the Chinese capital Beijing has been put under strict lockdown measures after the city's first coronavirus cases in more than 50 days. The outbreak has been linked to the city's largest wholesale market. A total of 45 people out of 517 tested at the Xinfadi market tested positive for Covid-19, a district official said. None was displaying symptoms. Lockdowns have been imposed in 11 nearby neighbourhoods, while 10,000 market staff will be tested. The authorities also want to test everyone who has had recent contact with the market as well as those living in the district surrounding it. These are the first new confirmed cases in Beijing for more than 50 days. Xinfadi market in the city's south-western Fengtai district was shut down in the early hours of Saturday, after two men who had recently visited the market were reported to have Covid-19. Tests at the market then showed 45 people had the virus. Thousands who work at the market are now being tested ""In accordance with the principle of putting the safety of the masses and health first, we have adopted lockdown measures for the Xinfadi market and surrounding neighbourhoods,"" Chu Junwei, a district official, told a briefing. The district is in a ""wartime emergency mode"", he added. Hundreds of military police have entered the now locked-down facility. Nearby transport links and schools have been closed. What did China do about early outbreak? Did China test a whole city in 10 days? Right across Beijing sport has been cancelled and major public facilities are pulling down the shutters again. There will now be fears of a second wave of the virus in the capital. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic China's coronavirus outbreak was brought under control through some of the world's strictest lockdown measures after the disease was detected in the city of Wuhan. More than 4,600 people in China have lost their lives to the coronavirus out of around 426,000 worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University. Chinese officials aren't sure how the huge Xinfandi wholesale market - which supplies 80% of Beijing's vegetables and meat - has become the source of a new coronavirus outbreak. In recent months the Chinese government's strategy has been to completely isolate any town or city where a coronavirus cluster has emerged. This appears to have worked but locking down all of Beijing, at time when it seemed like the virus emergency had been brought under control, is not something they'll want to do in a hurry.

""Things are beginning to fall into place that would allow us to put another layer of pencil over that date, but it's still early days."" Researchers must ensure people of black, asian and minority ethnic groups are proportionately represented in Covid-19 studies, scientists from the UK and United States say. It comes as the British Medical Associationhas askedthe UK government why pages with recommendations to safeguard BAME communities were ""omitted"" from a key report. A paper published in The Lancet by researchers from several universities - including Aberdeen - says previous studies show people in these groups are under-represented in many medical studies. That is despite them often being more likely to be affected by the conditions being researched. Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland A date must be set for shops to reopen, the Scottish Retail Consortium warns. The trade association is calling for the Scottish government to announce a provisional reopening date.

It brings the total number to have died in all settings - including hospitals, care homes and the community - to 41,662, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Urgent financial support from the UK government is needed within days to prevent long-term damage to university research, according to Scotland's Higher Education Minister, Richard Lochhead. He points out that the Scottish Funding Councilâs recent analysis suggests the countryâs universities will lose around Â£72m in academic year 2019-20 alone as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with an operating deficit of between Â£384m and Â£651m in academic year 2020-21 expected. Those reductions do not take account of the potential loss of EU funding following Brexit. Mr Lochhead has been part of a UK taskforce with UK Science Minister Amanda
  Solloway and has written to her asking for a comprehensive package of funding
  for research to counter those twin threats. âScotland has
  already put together an emergency Covid-19 support package worth an
  additional Â£75m for our university research sector, but this direct
  Scottish government commitment - which has already been allocated - must be
  urgently complemented by a substantial UK element,"" he writes. Increased participation in cycling during the Covid-19 pandemic can act as ""a big light at the end of the tunnel"", says Scottish Cycling chief executive Craig Burn. Competitive events have been suspended until 1 August because of the coronavirus pandemic. But Burn says there has been ""an absolute boom in bike sales"" during lockdown. ""We have seen since Covid a huge number of people cycling for exercise,"" he told McLeod Media.

Retailers call for reopening date for shops,"A date must be set for shops to reopen, the trade association has said. The Scottish Retail Consortium has called for the Scottish government to announce a provisional reopening date. The Scottish government said its total package for businesses during the ""unprecedented economic crisis"" was now in excess of Â£2.3bn. Only essential shops such as those selling essentials including food and medicine can open in Scotland at present. So-called ""non-essential shops"" in Northern Ireland, such as clothes shops and bookshops, are now open again and a full range of shops in England can open again from Monday. The SRC is concerned about the ongoing economic impact of the lockdown and worried that after shops in England start reopening, the problems for retailers here might grow. On 23 March all shops other than essential retailers including food stores and chemists were ordered to close as the UK entered lockdown. Coronavirus: What shops will open next? Coronavirus in Scotland - Fears for the economy amid pandemic Ewan Macdonald-Russell of the SRC said: ""We really need an indicative timetable so we can put the right measures in place so we're ready to trade and customers can have a bit of confidence when they can come back to shops and get the products we're all hoping they'll want to buy."" Mr Macdonald-Russell stressed he did not want shops to reopen until it was safe. From Monday the vast majority of shops in England will be able to reopen although some such as hairdressers will remain closed for now. In Northern Ireland, they reopened on Friday. No date has been set yet for the reopening of shops in Wales but it is hoped they may be able to start welcoming customers again within a fortnight. TheScottish government has published a route map,externalto lead the country out of lockdown including different measures which can be taken at different stages. These include stages where smaller shops and then large shops might reopen. No dates are attached to the phases themselves and the government has indicated the move between phases could be gradual - with certain sectors or aspects of life at different phases of the return. The next government review of the lockdown measures is due on Thursday. The Scottish government said: ""We have a review point on Thursday at which time we will consider further, safe progression through the route map. ""Our total package for businesses during this unprecedented economic crisis now exceeds Â£2.3bn. This support, which is under constant review, includes almost Â£900m of non-domestic rates relief and a Â£1.3bn business grants scheme. ""Importantly, we have extended the eligibility criteria for our small business and retail, hospitality and leisure grants and we have extended the upper threshold for retail, hospitality or leisure properties with individual rateable values of up to Â£18,000 each. ""We have also published workplace guidance to support the retail sector's return to trading."" The Scottish government's National Clinical Director Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland he was hopeful there could be good news for retailers soon. Prof Leitch said: ""We've tried to avoid as far as possible indicative dates because we don't want people to presume too much about the future."" Provisional dates have been set for the reopening of businesses such as hotels and the return of children to school. These are 15 July and 11 August respectively. Prof Leitch added: ""Shops will be part of our conversation this week as we move towards hopefully phase two of the route map on Thursday and Friday and conversations around next weekend."" Retailers argue they would like a provisional date for a number of practical reasons. These include preparing shops for social distancing measures,  bringing back staff and planning sales promotions. There is a concern in areas close to the Scottish border that customers might head to shops in, for example, Carlisle or Newcastle if there is no indication soon of a reopening date. However, shoppers doing this would contravene the Scottish government's advice on non-essential travel. Is cross-border traffic a coronavirus risk? Five ways shopping will be different from now on Retailers also fear that keeping shops closed for longer will simply drive more customers to the internet and lead to more empty units on the high street. If shops were given little notice of a reopening date it could also be problematic. For instance, some may not be able to reopen for a number of days while they put social distancing or protective measures in place. While shops want customers to return, some would be anxious about the prospect of large queues on the day they reopened. Social distancing is likely to mean only a certain number would be allowed in at any one time. Some shops would hope some customers might shop at what are normally the quieter times of the week to help prevent queuing and spread out business.

Beijing market outbreak sparks local lockdown,"Leaked report says racism, stigma and social inequality may exacerbate Covid-19 risk to UK minorities This may mean BAME individuals are less likely to seek care, the draft Public Health England report says A virus outbreak in a wholesale market in Beijing leads to fears of a second wave in the Chinese capital Brazil's death toll becomes second highest in the world, surpassing the UK's with more than 41,000 victims Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro continues to play down the virus, focusing on the economic damage to Brazil From today, people living alone in England and Northern Ireland can form a support bubble with another household Edited by Suzanne Leigh That's it from us for today. Thank you very much for following our coverage. Here is a reminder of some of the day's key coronavirus developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by: Vicky Baker, Kevin Ponniah, Joshua Cheetham, Ashitha Nagesh, Suzanne Leigh, Doug Faulkner, Matt Cannon, Sarah Collerton and Shamaan Freeman-Powell Participants in the virtual Boat Race raced on machines at home As we mentioned earlier, the Oxford versus Cambridge Boat Race was being held virtually this year.And the results are in. Cambridge followed up on last year's (real life) win by once again finishing ahead of their university rivals. Both teams of eight used rowing machines at home to cover the 6.8km distance. The event - usually held on the River Thames in London - was one of many sporting events cancelled due to the ongoing lockdown in the UK. A Peruvian doctor in charge of his region's coronavirus response has been fired after recommending people ingest chlorine dioxide, an industrial disinfectant similar to bleach. AmÃ­lcar Huancahuari, who was head of the Covid-19 response in the southern region of Ayacucho, said the chemical should be distributed to everyone with coronavirus symptoms, despite it not being suitable for human consumption. During a press conference he claimed chlorine dioxide had ""already been tested with people with Covid-19 and they have improved remarkably"". Ayacucho governor Carlos RÃºa then held a follow-up press conference to say Huancahuari's comments were made in a personal capacity, because he hadn't discussed chlorine dioxide in any official meetings. A few hours later RÃºa announced that the doctor had been dismissed from his post. Iran will reintroduce lockdown measures if health regulations are not observed in the country, says President Hassan Rouhani. The country has seen a spike in coronavirus infections since it began to ease restrictions in mid-April. More than 2,400 new cases were reported on Saturday, bringing the national toll to 184,955. Total deaths have also risen to 8,730. Infections dipped during Iran's lockdown, but have risen since restrictions were eased President Rouhani said that last month there was an 80% compliance rate with health protocols, but this has since fallen to 20%. He also expressed concern about mass gatherings at the recently reopened Imam Reza shrine - the country's largest Shia Muslim complex. Since early April, the government has been trying as much as it can to reopen businesses, schools and religious sites, and revive an economy that was already crippled by US sanctions. However, such moves have caused concern among health officials, and rising infections have spurred fears of a second wave in Iran, which is the worst-hit country in the Middle East. Chile's President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era has removed his health minister, Jaime MaÃ±alich. MaÃ±alich, who had only been in the role for a year, has been replaced with Oscar Enrique Paris, the president's office announced in a briefing. Allow Twitter content?

The reshuffle comes amid controversy over the country's virus death toll, which has gone through revisions. Last weekend, officials added another 653 deaths from databases, which hadn't originally been included. The government has faced criticism for how it's recorded the death toll, which experts say may be far higher than is being officially reported. It has also been criticised for being slow to enforce preventative measures, such as lockdowns. Chile has one of the highest numbers of cases in Latin America, behind Brazil and Peru. A shoe shop run by eight generations of the same family for more than 200 years will finally reopen, as coronavirus restrictions begin to lift. W. J. French & Son has been trading in Southampton since 1803, but estimates it has lost more than Â£100,000 during the lockdown. The shop will reopen on Monday with social distancing measures in place, so shoes can be safely fitted by staff. This video can not be played Coronavirus: 200-year-old family shoe business set to reopen We reported earlier that Monday is the day that the European Union wants all its members to reopen their internal borders by. France, Belgium and Greece are among those who will then open their frontiers to most other EU member states. But Poland did so today - reopening all its EU borders after three months of closure. Small towns that straddle the border celebrated as the gates opened at midnight. The mayors of Frankfurt (Oder) on the German side and Slubice on the Polish side toasted the moment with champagne, and were even pictured sharing a hug. Work commuters were initially barred from crossing when the border closed in March but later allowed to resume travel. ""We have missed it, we are going there to eat out quite often and do shopping. So it's great now, we have missed it a lot,"" said Petra, from Frankfurt (Oder), a town not to be confused with the major city on the other side of Germany. As we've just heard, another 1,425 Covid-19 cases and 181 deaths have been reported across the UK in a day. It brings the total number to have died in all settings - including hospitals, care homes and the community - to 41,662, the Department of Health and Social Care said. These charts offer more context by plotting the downward trend in the numbers. Of course, each death is much more than a statistic. The BBC has been hearing from family and friends of some of those who have died. Read their tributes here. It was the worst day of Anthony Almojera's career. In just one shift in early April, the veteran New York City paramedic had to tell a dozen families that a loved one had died from suspected coronavirus. But in the days that followed, this became his grim routine. When we first spoke to Anthony nine weeks ago,New York was at the forefront of the global Covid-19 pandemic, with the state reporting more diagnosed cases than any single country. Since then, five of his colleagues have died. Four contracted coronavirus and one took his own life after telling co-workers he was struggling to cope. Anthony is still coming to terms with what's happened. Read more here.

Russia's official death toll for April has more than doubled to 2,712, after the country changed how it classifies fatalities. Officials are now warning that May's updated toll is likely to be even worse, as the country's daily number of new infections peaked in the middle of last month. The official overall death toll still stands at just over 6,800. But earlier this week, health officials in Moscow said the death toll in May in the capital city alone was 5,260, when calculated using the new method. Before, the official toll only included people for whom the virus was listed as the main cause of their death. However, it now includes all those who have died after testing positive for the virus, even if Covid-19 is not listed as the primary cause of their death. We have more information from a leaked report into the impact of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority communities.It finds racism and social inequality may have contributed to increased coronavirus risksfor people in these communities. The Public Health England draft report found ""historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work"" meant individuals in BAME groups were less likely to seek care when needed or to speak up when they had concerns about personal protective equipment or risk. Other possible factors include risks linked to discrimination and occupation, and inequalities in conditions such as diabetes. Images of just some of the NHS workers who lost their life during the coronavirus pandemic âThe unequal impact of COVID-19 on BAME communities may be explained by a number of factors ranging from social and economic inequalities, racism, discrimination and stigma, occupational risk, inequalities in the prevalence of conditions that increase the severity of disease including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and asthma,"" it said. It also said there was a ""lack of trust"" of NHS services for many BAME communities. The report said stakeholders expressed ""deep dismay, anger, loss and fear in their communities"" as data emerged suggesting Covid-19 was ""exacerbating existing inequalities"". It also said there was ""deep concern and anxiety"" that ""if lessons are not learnt from this initial phase of the epidemic, future waves of the disease could again have severe and disproportionate impacts"".

The country has swiftly risen up the grim leaderboard of coronavirus statistics and its death toll - 41,828 - is now the world's second highest. The Americas account for around half of the number of cases globally. Brazil, Latin America's biggest country, is now the epicentre of the epicentre. But its leader still seems to care very little - or at least that is the impression he is happy to portray.

Urgent financial support from the UK government is needed within days to prevent long-term damage to university research, according to Scotland's Higher Education Minister, Richard Lochhead. He points out that the Scottish Funding Councilâs recent analysis suggests the countryâs universities will lose around Â£72m in academic year 2019-20 alone as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with an operating deficit of between Â£384m and Â£651m in academic year 2020-21 expected. Those reductions do not take account of the potential loss of EU funding following Brexit. Mr Lochhead has been part of a UK taskforce with UK Science Minister Amanda
  Solloway and has written to her asking for a comprehensive package of funding
  for research to counter those twin threats. âScotland has
  already put together an emergency Covid-19 support package worth an

Why Pete Davidson is The King of Staten Island âââââ,"On the face of it The King of Staten Island tells a tale so familiar it's a clichÃ©. A young man is struggling to come to terms with adult life. He smokes a lot of weed, hangs out with a crew of equally lost souls, and starts making some ill-advised life decisions. He's not an inherently bad lad: he loves his mum, he's nice to kids (mostly), and routinely disarms with his self-deprecating charms. You know this story, you know this person. If you're like me, it was you. Or, is you. Or, your brother. Or, one of your friends, or one of your children, or one of your friend's children, or one of your children's friends. He is the Everyman in the male coming-of-age saga: a troubled, confused, angry, depressed, fragile dude looking for some direction and purpose - not that he'd ever admit it. There's a journey to be taken and that's the basis of the movie/book/play/song etc. And so it is with The King of Staten Island, a 135-minute easy-paced film directed by Judd Apatow, now available on-demand. It is not genre-busting, or genre-defining, or genre-bending - it is a middle-of-the-road genre staple. Except for one thingâ¦ Pete Davidson. Pete Davidson goes on a deeply personal journey in the film Pete Davidson is the movie's star. He isn't middle-of-the-road. He's speeding along the charisma super-highway, turning heads with what looks like an old banger act but is in fact a finely-tuned, custom-made performance that not only brings the film alive, but gives it a heart and a soul. Whatever way you look at it, The King of Staten Island is his film. Or put another way, Pete Davidson is The King of Staten Island. The comedian and Saturday Night Live regular plays the lead role, he gives the stand-out performance, he co-wrote the script, and he has an executive producer credit. He was even born in Staten Island and still lives there, for goodness sake. (L-R) Colin Jost, Michael Che and Pete Davidson on Saturday Night Live And that's not all. Davidson plays Scott Carlin, a drifting 24-year old wannabe tattoo artist who has yet to come to terms with the death of his firefighter father, killed in the line of duty when our pot-head protagonist was a boy. Scott's mental health is poor. He smokes too many joints, he lives with his mum, and he has chronic gut issues. It is a biography that reads very close to Davidson's own life story (his firefighter father, also called Scott, died trying to save others as a 9/11 first responder). Scott Davidson (Pete's father), was a firefighter who died while responding to the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001, and is described by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation as ""a brave and fearless man who was very proud of his children"" Not exactly a stretch for Davidson the actor, then. I imagine there weren't a lot of ""Hey, Judd, what's my motivation?"" type conversations between lead actor and director. But, maybe, playing a fictional role largely based on your own back story is far harder than taking on the role of a totally different character altogether. Pete Davidson is not Scott Carlin in the way that Larry David is a heightened version of himself in Curb Your Enthusiasm. And yet, anybody who knows Davidson's stand-up work will see similar traits: the low-status schtick, the poking fun but not being mean - or being mean and then apologising afterwards. The dry delivery, the ill-fitting clothes, the off-beat persona. These characteristics are all evident in Scott Carlin, too, but somehow Davidson manages to shape him in such a way that the fictional character becomes so vivid it obscures the identity of the man playing him. That's not an easy trick to pull off. Davidson does it with plenty of help from his friends. Fellow stand-up comic Bill Burr plays Ray Bishop, a straight-talking, shirt-tucked-in kinda guy, who provides a nicely weighted counter-point to Scott and his haphazard lifestyle. Ray has eyes for Margie (the excellent Marisa Tomei), the long-suffering mother of Scott and his preppy younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow). That's one love story. Scott Carlin (Davidson) and his mum Margie (Marisa Tomei) have an emotional rollercoaster of a relationship Scott doesn't have the easiest of times adjusting to his mother's boyfriend Ray Bishop (Bill Burr) The other is between Scott and his girlfriend Kelsey, a young woman hell-bent on putting Staten Island on the hipster map. She is played by the British actress Bel Powley, who was one of the few good things about Apple TV's The Morning Show (buckle up, there's a second season on the way). She doesn't have many scenes, but those she is in are some of the best in the movie - there'll be an Oscar on her shelf one of these days. There is also a very welcome cameo-plus from Steve Buscemi as Papa the fire chief, and a short but memorable appearance by Machine Gun Kelly in the guise of a tattoo shop owner. Steve Buscemi plays Papa, the firefighter, who knew Scott's father, and in real life was a firefighter before becoming an actor, and then returned to volunteer after 9/11 Bel Powley gives an impressive performance as Scott's childhood friend and secret lover, Kelsey Judd Apatow does a good job keeping all the moving parts in order, although the pace could be a bit slow for some. It wasn't a problem for me, it's not as if there's a whole load to do right now. What's more, you sense a looseness that allowed the actors room to explore and improvise, which gives the film an edge it might otherwise lack. It also affords the viewer a chance to reflect while watching. And when you do, it becomes apparent The King of Staten Island is more than a run-of-the-mill genre movie. It is a brutally honest, first-person account of what can happen to a family when tragedy strikes. It's not hyperbolic or overly-dramatic. It's just sad and downbeat at times. It is not a new story, but it is well told. And Pete Davidson is always worth watching.

Churchill statue 'may have to be put in museum',"A statue of Churchill in Parliament Square was boarded up ahead of a Black Lives Matter protest on Friday A statue of Winston Churchill may have to be put in a museum to protect it if demonstrations continue, his granddaughter has said. Emma Soames told the BBC the war-time prime minister was a ""complex man"" but he was considered a hero by millions. She said she was ""shocked"" to see the monument in London's Parliament Square boarded up, although she said she understood why this was necessary. It came after protesters daubed ""was a racist"" on the statue last weekend. Ms Soames said it was ""extraordinarily sad that my grandfather, who was such a unifying figure in this country, appears to have become a sort of icon through being controversial."" ""We've come to this place where history is viewed only entirely through the prism of the present,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Calls to remove 'racist' Gandhi statue How many statues of black people does the UK have? Ms Soames acknowledged her grandfather had often held views which ""particularly now are regarded as unacceptable but weren't necessarily then"". However she added: ""He was a powerful, complex man, with infinitely more good than bad in the ledger of his life."" She said if people were ""so infuriated"" by seeing the statue it may be ""safer"" in a museum. ""But I think Parliament Square would be a poorer place without him,"" she added. Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames said he was ""deeply upset"" after the statue was vandalised and then boarded up. ""I find it extraordinary that millions and millions of people all over the world who look up to Britain will be astonished that a statue of Churchill and the Cenotaph, our national war memorial, could have been defaced in this disgusting way,""he told the Daily Telegraph,external. Last weekend the statue of Winston Churchill was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" However, author Shrabani Basu, who has written books about the British Empire, said there were ""two sides of Churchill"" and ""we need to know his darkest hour as well as his finest hour"". She argued that in India, Churchill is not seen as a hero, citing his role in the 1943 Bengal famine, during which at least three million people are believed to have died. While Ms Basu said she did not want to see the statue removed from Parliament Square, she said people should be taught ""the whole story"" about the war-time figure. Black Lives Matter activist Imarn Ayton said statues of slave traders and people who had spoken negatively towards black people were ""extremely offensive"" and should be moved to museums. ""I think it's a win-win to everyone so we no longer offend the black nation and we also get to keep our history,"" she told the BBC. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonbranded the boarding up of the statue to protect it from potential vandalism as ""absurd and shameful"". Mr Johnson said the former prime minister had expressed opinions which were ""unacceptable to us today"" but remained a hero for saving the country from ""fascist and racist tyranny"". ""We cannot try to edit or censor our past,"" he wrote of moves to remove tributes to historical figures. ""We cannot pretend to have a different history."" This video can not be played Britainâs wartime leader divided opinion in his own lifetime, and remains a divisive figure today Winston Churchill, who lived between 30 November 1874 and 24 January 1965, is often named among Britain's greatest-ever people but for some he remains an intensely controversial figure. Despite his leading the country through the darkest hours of World War Two and being prime minister twice, critics point to his comments on race and some of his actions during both world wars. Churchill told thePalestine Royal Commission,externalthat he did not admit wrong had been done to Native Americans or aboriginal Australians as ""a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place"". His supporters argue that he was by no means the only person to hold these sorts of views during the period. He also advocated the use of chemical weapons, ""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes,""he wrote in a memo,external. Another criticism is for his part inthe Bengal famine in Indiain 1943, during which at least three million people are believed to have died after Allied forces halted the movement of food in the region - including through British-run India - following the Japanese occupation of Burma.

A demonstration planned for Saturday was brought forward by a day because of fears there could be violent clashes with far-right groups. The Met Policehave placed restrictions on several groups intending to protest on Saturday, including requiring demonstrations to end at 17:00 BST. Thousands of people gathered in Central London on Saturday, including around the Cenotaph war memorial in Whitehall and the nearby Churchill statue. The protesters, largely groups of white men who were right-wing activists, sang the national anthem and chanted ""England"", amid a tense atmosphere and heavy police presence. Among the demonstrators was Paul Golding, leader of far-right group Britain First, who said they had turned out to ""guard our monuments"". Other monuments have been removed ahead of separate protests planned over the weekend, while the Cenotaph has also been covered. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said other ""key statues"", including one of Nelson Mandela, would be protected, saying there was a risk statues could become a ""flashpoint for violence"". It comes after the statue ofslave trader Edward Colston was thrown into the harbour in Bristolduring a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday. Demonstrations have been taking place across the world followingthe death in police custody of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis last month.

It brings the total number to have died in all settings - including hospitals, care homes and the community - to 41,662, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Urgent financial support from the UK government is needed within days to prevent long-term damage to university research, according to Scotland's Higher Education Minister, Richard Lochhead. He points out that the Scottish Funding Councilâs recent analysis suggests the countryâs universities will lose around Â£72m in academic year 2019-20 alone as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with an operating deficit of between Â£384m and Â£651m in academic year 2020-21 expected. Those reductions do not take account of the potential loss of EU funding following Brexit. Mr Lochhead has been part of a UK taskforce with UK Science Minister Amanda
  Solloway and has written to her asking for a comprehensive package of funding
  for research to counter those twin threats. âScotland has
  already put together an emergency Covid-19 support package worth an
  additional Â£75m for our university research sector, but this direct
  Scottish government commitment - which has already been allocated - must be
  urgently complemented by a substantial UK element,"" he writes.

BA warns of job cuts,"British Airways is among many airlines that have seen passenger numbers shrink and bookings collapse British Airways is to ground flights 'like never before' and lay off staff in response to the coronavirus. In a memo to staff titled ""The Survival of British Airways"", boss Alex Cruz warned that job cuts could be ""short term, perhaps long term"". The airline industry was facing a ""crisis of global proportions"" that was worse than that caused by the SARS virus or 9/11. Meanwhile, Ryanair told staff they may be forced to take leave from Monday. An internal memo to Ryanair staff, seen by the BBC, said crew may be allocated to take unpaid leave due to cancelled flights and schedule changes. BA boss Mr Cruz said: ""We can no longer sustain our current level of employment and jobs would be lost - perhaps for a short term, perhaps longer term."" The airline is in talks with unions but gave no further details about the scale of the likely job losses in the video message transcript seen by the BBC. The airline boss said that British Airways, which is owned by FTSE 100 company IAG, was suspending routes and parking planes in a way they had ""never had to do before"". British Airways would ""continue to do our best for customers and offer them as much flexibility as we can"", Mr Cruz said in the video. Although Mr Cruz said the British flag carrier airline had a strong balance sheet and was financially resilient, he told staff ""not to underestimate the seriousness of this for our company"". BA and other carriers' revenues have been hit by the coronavirus response as governments close borders, companies ban lucrative business travel, conferences and events are cancelled and demand for leisure travel slumps. British Airways boss Alex Cruz said the effect of the coronavirus on the aviation industry will be worse than 9/11 IAG shares bounced on Friday after the global share market rout on Thursday. They closed up 4.8% to 350p per share, but were trading higher before news of the mass groundings broke. The International Air Transport Association warned on Friday that global airline revenue losses would be ""probably above"" the figure of $113bn (Â£90bn) that it estimated a week ago, before the Trump administration's announcement of US travel curbs on passengers from much of continental Europe. Earlier this month, IAG said flight suspensions to China and cancellations on Italian routes wouldaffect how many passengers it carried this year,external. Major US airlines are in talks with the government there over economic relief, as traveller demand plummets. ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we've seen,"" Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said on Friday in a note to staff, which also said the firm would cut flights by 40% over the next few months, ground 300 aircraft and reduce spending by $2bn. On Thursday, Norwegian Air said it was set to cancel 4,000 flights and temporarily lay off about half of its staff because of the coronavirus outbreak. The increase in flight cancellations comes after the European Union said it would suspend until the end of June a ""use it or lose it"" law that requires airlines to use their allocated runway slots or risk losing the lucrative asset. The law had led to so-called ""ghost flights"" where airlines were flying near-empty planes in order to keep their slots at airports. The pilot's union Balpa on Friday called for greater government support for the aviation industry and complained that this week's Budget had not included a cut to Air Passenger Duty (APD) as the industry had lobbied for. BALPA general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Removing APD is just one step that could help airlines make it through their financial woes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The reality is, with such a loss in forward bookings for the summer - the time when airlines make all their profit - the airlines have had to look at ways to save money to keep the companies afloat"".

Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy reels,"Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said he will be ""ready to take action"" to help the UK economy weather the coronavirus crisis. He was speaking after figures showed that the country's economy shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown. ""We are still very much in the midst of this,"" Mr Bailey said. But he said the figure was ""pretty much in line"" with what the bank expected. ""Obviously it's a dramatic and big number, but actually it's not a surprising number,"" he said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid April's ""historic"" fall affected virtually all areas of activity, as large parts of the economy remained shut to battle the pandemic. The contraction is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. But analysts said April was likely to be the worst month, as the government began easing the lockdown in May. Mr Bailey said there were ""signs of the economy now beginning to come back into life"", but the big question was how much long-term damage the pandemic would cause. ""That's the thing we've got to be very focused on, because that's where jobs get lost,"" he said. ""Now we hope that will be as small as possible, but we have to be ready and ready to take action, not just the Bank of England, but more broadly on what we can do to offset those longer-term and damaging effects."" What a shrinking economy means in one town The ONS also published figures for the three months from February to April, which showed a decline of 10.4% compared with the previous three-month period. News of the slump comes as almost nine million UK workers are having their wages paid by the government, whilethe number of people claiming unemployment benefitrocketed by 856,500 to 2.1 million in April. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a ""tough"" few months ahead, but added: ""We will get through it."" ""We've always been in no doubt this was going to be a very serious public health crisis but also have big, big economic knock-on effects. ""The UK is heavily dependent on services, we're a dynamic creative economy, we depend so much on human contact. We have been very badly hit by this."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak expects life to get ""a little bit more back to normal"" when shops reopen Chancellor Rishi Sunak said life would get ""a little bit more back to normal"" once High Street shops could reopen. That is set to happen on Monday in England, while shops in Northern Ireland have already been allowed to resume trading. Scotland and Wales have their own timetables for easing restrictions. In response, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that the UK's economy was shrinking faster than those of other countries. She said the UK would need ""strong action to help us climb out of this as quickly as possible"". In normal times, a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of the goods and services it produces - increases, making its citizens on average slightly richer. However, the ONS said April's fall in GDP was the biggest the UK had ever seen. ""[The fall was] more than three times larger than last month and almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-Covid-19 fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, the agency's deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""In April, the economy was around 25% smaller than in February."" What is GDP and how is it measured? What is a recession? He said virtually all areas of the economy had been hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all seeing marked falls in activity. Carmakers and housebuilders were also badly affected, although Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's highly likely April will be the low point. ""Our own surveys and wider indicators have suggested a pick-up in economy activity, but I think it's really too early to know how quickly economic activity will recover in the coming months."" In large part, thanks to the extraordinary levels of state intervention propping it up. More than one in four UK workers - some 8.9 million - are now on the government's furlough scheme that allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to Â£2,500. The scheme has cost Â£19.6bn so far, while a similar programme for self-employed workers has seen 2.6 million claims made worth Â£7.5bn. Without these schemes, household consumption, which makes up nearly two-thirds of the UK's GDP, would have fallen even further. Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to reopen. ""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed."" Furloughing has been vital, she says, but she'd like the government to do more - perhaps in the form of VAT exemptions or more support for leaseholders. Despite the uncertainties, however, she thinks the sector will weather the storm. ""In terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this."" Three firms still positive despite the crisis The ONS numbers add to the pressure to ease the lockdown more quickly, but fears around the control of the disease have led to a step-by-step cautious approach. There is some pressure on the Treasury to consider similar economic rescue packages to those made across Europe. Germany, for example, has cut VAT and offered billions in a package to help families with children and purchasers of green cars. France is offering huge rescue funds to the car and aerospace industry. The unprecedented jobs schemes here will help to protect livelihoods. But with this scale of hit, it will not be enough. During the global financial crisis, from the peak in February 2008 to the lowest point of March 2009, a total of 13 months, GDP shrank by 6.9%. April's unprecedented contraction is three times that - and it happened in one month. The UK's economy was already shrinking even before April. It contracted by 2% in the first three monthsof 2020, as just a few days of impact from the virus pushed it into decline. Economists expect an even bigger slump in the April-to-June period, plunging the country into a deep recession. ""Given the lockdown started to be eased in May, April will mark the trough in GDP. So we are past the worst,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics. ""But the recovery will be a drawn-out affair, as restrictions are only lifted gradually and businesses and consumers continue to exercise caution."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said coronavirus had caused ""unparalleled"" economic turmoil which was ""likely to scar the UK economy for some time yet"". ""Having provided businesses life support, the government must now figure out how to stimulate activity,"" he added. ""Waiting until later in the year to act will risk more businesses and jobs will be lost."" We don't really know yet. The UK is one of the few countries to publish monthly economic data - most others just produce quarterly and annual figures. We do know, however, that coronavirus has already pushed several major economies into recession: Japan saw a 3.4% fall in GDPfor the first three months of 2020 Germany's economy shrank by 2.2%in the first three months of this year And France saw a 5.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2020. On Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned thatthe UK could be the hardest hit by Covid-19among major economies. The British economy is likely to shrink by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said. A recession is usually defined as two three-month periods - or quarters - of economic contraction in a row. Technically, we are not at that point yet. But the UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. Read more SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

British Airways: A breakdown in trust?,"British Airways was once seen as a national champion, a potent symbol of the country's commercial prowess and - as the airline itself puts it - of ""timeless British values and modern Britain's strengths"". Now, however, it is a company in crisis - struggling to cope with the huge financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, its relationship with the government apparently fractured, and in conflict with its own employees. There's no question that BA, like other airlines, has been dramatically affected by the lockdowns and closure of borders associated with the pandemic. For weeks, it has been operating just a handful of flights a day, while the bulk of its fleet has been parked up. But it is BA's response to the crisis which has created an atmosphere within the company that staff have described as toxic, and prompted a political backlash. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh: IAG wants to start a major restructuring programme at BA In late April, its parent company International Airlines Group announced plans to implement a major restructuring programme at BA, which could lead to up to 12,000 redundancies. It said it would begin formal consultations with its unions, Unite, GMB and Balpa. Launching that process, BA said it wanted to reach agreement over the proposals - which would also include significant changes to the terms and conditions of remaining staff. But it warned that if an agreement could not be reached, it would force the issue - by giving them notice, and offering them new contracts. In a letter to the prime minister on 27 May, the chief executive of parent company IAG, Willie Walsh, wrote: ""We are open to any ideas on how to limit and mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on our business and our employees. ""Regrettably, Unite and GMB have decided not to represent their members, preferring to engage in what Unite calls 'crisis leverage' in an effort to intimidate BA and delay any consultation taking place at this critical time. This has not and most definitely, will not work. Time is not on our side so we will not pause or defer our consultations."" But the apparent ultimatum from BA has triggered a deep rift with the unions. Unite and GMB are currently refusing to take part in formal consultations. Balpa has been engaging with the company, but now says the negotiations are ""hanging by a thread"". For cabin crew, there is not only the threat of redundancy, but also the possibility of big pay cuts for long-serving staff - in some cases of more than 50%. Many of those affected believe the company is using the current crisis to force through changes it has wanted to make for years. One BA union, Unite, says BA is using the Covid-19 crisis to make ""permanent, drastic cuts to jobs"" Longer-serving crew at BA have contracts which are, by modern standards, relatively generous. They date back to an era when the airline industry was less ferociously competitive, before the emergence of budget carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet forced older airlines to cut costs and change their business models. In 2010, BA engaged in a bitter dispute with Unite over plans to overhaul cabin crew contracts. The row lasted two years and involved 22 days of strikes. Ultimately a settlement was reached, under which existing staff retained most of their privileges - but new joiners were put on inferior contracts, with lower pay. Now, Unite says BA is using the Covid-19 crisis as cover to make ""permanent, drastic cuts to jobs, wages and conditions"", at a time when industrial action is not an option. The union is waging a high-profile campaign against what it calls the company's ""betrayal"" of its staff. British Airways says it is ""facing the deepest structural change in its history"" The campaign has garnered some high-profile political support. One of BA's fiercest critics is the Conservative MP and chair of the transport select committee, Huw Merriman. He says the way in which staff at the company have been treated is ""appalling"". ""It's the equivalent of holding a gun to someone's head,"" he says. ""It's really sad to see an iconic brand being dragged into the gutter by its management"". When the redundancy plans were first announced, Balpa came to the negotiating table. Initially, the company did not threaten to ""fire and rehire"" pilots if they failed to accept new terms. But at the end of last week, that changed - and pilots were given the same ultimatum other employees were already facing. According to Brian Strutton, general secretary of Balpa, that move ""felt like a kick in the teeth to those people who had been carrying out negotiations in good faith"". The union is still talking to BA - but he says the negotiations are ""hanging by a thread"" and could break down at any time. Few within the air travel industry expect a quick recovery Meanwhile many pilots have responded furiously. One BA captain told the BBC, ""I wouldn't say there was a lot of trust beforehand. There's even less now"". Another described the mood within the company as ""terrible"". ""I'm absolutely amazed at the huge outpouring of anger among our members"", says Mr Strutton. ""There's outrage and despair at the way management are running the company they once loved working for"". A number of pilots have also voiced concerns that the row could have an impact on safety - with worries about their jobs and mortgages providing an unwelcome distraction for pilots on the flight deck, and potentially affecting their mental health. All of this has left BA looking like a company under siege. A great deal of anger also seems to be aimed at Willie Walsh, widely seen as the architect of the planned cuts. Quarantine rules will ""torpedo"" the chances of flights resuming in July, says Mr Walsh The airline itself insists that the industry is ""facing the deepest structural change in its history"". It says it is acting now to protect as many jobs as possible - and that it wants to work with the trade unions to mitigate the impact of any changes. Although BA does have substantial cash reserves, it is currently burning through Â£20m every day - and with the majority of its fleet grounded, there is very little money coming in. It is also feuding with the government over the introduction of a 14-day quarantine period for travellers coming into the UK - which Mr Walsh says has ""torpedoed"" the possibility of resuming flights in July. Few within the industry expect a quick recovery. According to the International Air Transport Association, air traffic is unlikely to return to the levels seen last year until 2023. Around the world, carriers are cutting back - and BA's direct rivals such as Easyjet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic are all planning thousands of redundancies. But what marks BA out is the response to its actions - and the palpable resentment now directed at a brand that once invoked national pride.

US must confront its Original Sin,"Following the death of George Floyd while under arrest, protests have consumed America and onlookers have wondered how one of the most powerful countries in the world could descend into such chaos. Despite being defined by race, American society does not spend much time analysing the history of our racial divisions, and America prefers to believe in the inevitable progression towards racial equality. The election of Barack Obama in 2008 fed into this narrative of progress, but Donald Trump's presidential victory in 2016 was seen as a step backwards, coming after a campaign with a slogan that championed America's divisive past as a form of progress. Floyd's death now appears to be the tipping point for an exhausted, racially divided nation still in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic cost that followed. **WARNING: This article contains a racial slur** Floyd's cries of ""I can't breathe"" echoed the cries of Eric Garner, who was choked by police on a New York City sidewalk in 2014. Floyd's words reminded Americans of the oppressive past we work to forget regardless of whether it is six years ago, 60 years ago, the 1860s, or 1619 when some of the first slaves arrived in America. To a large extent, America's neglect of the past and belief in progress have left many Americans unaware of the severity and scope of our racial tensions, and as a result many Americans lack the words to articulate our current turmoil. Recently, I have used the word ethnocide meaning ""the destruction of culture while keeping the people"" to describe America's past and present racial tensions, and this language also helps articulate the uniqueness of America's race problem. 'I lost my best friend in a police shooting' Timeline of US police killings Three facts that help explain anger in the US In 1941, Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew and distinguished lawyer, immigrated to the United States as he fled the Nazis. While in America he implored the American government to stop the Nazis from killing his people, and as his words fell on deaf ears, he realized he needed to create a new word to describe the unique horror befalling his people. In 1944, Lemkin coined the words genocide and ethnocide. Lemkin intended for the words to be interchangeable but over time they diverged. Genocide became the destruction of a people and their culture, and this word radically changed the world for the better. Ethnocide became the destruction of culture while keeping the people, and has been ignored for decades. Recently, ethnocide has been used to describe the plight of indigenous people against colonisation, but regarding America, ethnocide also pertains to the transatlantic slave trade and the founding of the nation. From the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade, European colonisers destroyed the culture of African people, but kept their bodies in order to create the chattel slavery system that became the economic and social foundation of the United States. Colonisers prevented Africans from speaking their languages and practising their religions. Tribal and familial bonds were broken, and African people could no longer identify as Igbo, Yoruba, and Malian. Instead de-cultured names such as nigger, negro, coloured, and black were stamped upon African people. Additionally, Europeans identified themselves as white, and in the United States the one-drop rule was created to sustain that division. One drop of black or African blood meant that a person could not be white. In America, whiteness became a zero-sum identity that was maintained by systemic racial division. Interracial marriage was still illegal in much of America until the Loving vs Virginia decision in 1967. Behind the legacy of America's blackface Viewpoint: A 'true horror' story for black Americans Viewpoint: Why racial incidents are part of America Beyonceâs Homecoming salutes black culture From colonisation to the formation of the United States, America has created countless laws and policies to sustain the racial division between blacks and whites forged by ethnocide. These American norms, extending to housing, education, employment, healthcare, law enforcement and environmental protections including clean drinking water, have disproportionately harmed African Americans and other communities of colour in order to sustain racial division and white dominance. George Floyd's murder represents a continuation of the systemic criminalisation and oppression of black life in America that has always been the American norm dating back to Jim Crow, segregation (which means apartheid), and slavery. When the Confederacy, the collection of American slave-holding states in the South, seceded from the United States, they launched the Civil War to defend the immoral institution of slavery. After losing the Civil War, these states were readmitted back into the United States. To this day, many Americans, and especially America hate groups, still celebrate Confederate soldiers and politicians as heroes, and there are monuments and memorials dedicated to them across America. Despite the American South losing the Civil War in 1865, American President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers, and soon thereafter Confederate politicians won elected office in the newly-reunited America. The influence of former slave owners and Confederates contributed to erasing the rights that African Americans won in the 1860s including citizenship and the right to vote. The political campaign to remove African American rights was called the Redeemers movement, and it was led by former slave-owners and Confederates, who wanted to redeem the South by returning it to the norms of chattel slavery. The Redeemers and ""Make America Great Again"" derive from America's oppressive, ethnocidal school of thought. The Redeemers were also assisted by American terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) that were made up of former Confederate soldiers. The KKK, and many other white supremacist groups, terrorised and lynched black Americans, and they also prevented them from voting to help ensure that Redeemer candidates won elected office. The terrorists became the government. Protesters attacked by police dogs during demonstrations against segregation in Alabama in 1963 By the start of the 20th Century, the Redeemers had succeeded in undoing the racial equality progress of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, and now Jim Crow segregation became the norm of the American South. The Supreme Court's decision in Plessy vs Ferguson made ""separate but equal"" the new law of the land, and America again became a legal apartheid state. According to the Equal Justice Initiative's 2017 report Lynching in America,external, over 4,400 lynchings of African Americans occurred from 1877-1950. That is more than a lynching a week for 74 years. During Jim Crow, America could not legally deny black people their humanity, but they could deny them the services that are afforded to human beings. Black people were denied education, housing, employment, and were expected to ""know their place"" as a perpetually subjugated people. Large prisons were erected on former plantations; black people were arrested for minor crimes and given long prison sentences doing manual labour on the same land their ancestors were forced to work as enslaved people. As a result of Jim Crow, millions of African Americans fled the neo-slavery and terror of the South during the Great Migration, and racial tensions spread as other American cities did not welcome these domestic refugees. This is the same journey as the Underground Railroad, where prior to the Civil War enslaved African Americans escaped the South and sought refuge in Canada and the Northern parts of America. The civil rights movement of the 1960s effectively ended Jim Crow, and African Americans began reclaiming the rights, specifically voting rights and freedom of movement, they had previously won in the 1860s, but it is a long road to dismantle systemic and legalised racism and segregation. Obama's election in 2008 was a monumental event in American society, but it did not magically erase the systemic racism woven into America's social fabric and the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, 17, helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement to national attention. Trayvon was shot and killed by George Zimmerman as he walked home in his own neighbourhood because Zimmerman thought he looked suspicious. Martin was unarmed. Zimmerman pled self-defence and a jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Trayvon was one of countless African Americans killed by America's ethnocidal society that sanctions terror from both the government and civilians. The unjust killing of black people by the police and racist vigilantes remained the norm during Obama's presidency, but now the black community could record and document these crimes on video, and had a president who would defend them. Obama famously said: ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."" The emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and other protests under Obama occurred because black Americans were confident that the White House would listen to their cries of ""I can't breathe"" and make American society finally equitable and just. Under Trump those cries have fallen on deaf ears and tensions have escalated. America has much work to do to fix our racial tensions because our divisions and inequality are forged in our ethnocidal roots. We need to reform the policing of a nation nearly the size of a continent with over 300 million people, but we also need to make our education, healthcare, and housing systems, and every facet of our democracy more equitable. Additionally, truth and reconciliation commissions, a national apology, reparations, holding evildoers accountable, and other processes nations have used to heal after a genocide, the linguistic sibling of ethnocide, will help America change course and forge equality and justice. Should black Americans get slavery reparations? Should the term 'racist' be redefined? The awkward questions about slavery from US tourists Also, America has rarely criminalised white supremacist hate and terror and instead has spent centuries normalising white terrorist groups, celebrating them as heroes, and letting them decide if their actions are evil or not. This is why the Confederacy is still celebrated today. Europe did not allow fascists and Nazis to determine if their actions were good or not, but America has always given this luxury to racist slave-owners and their generational apologists and offspring. This must change. Rwanda, Germany, and South Africa have reckoned with their troubled past to make a better future, but America has long preferred to ignore the past, and proclaim the inevitability of progress. America today must define and confront the Original Sin of slavery, ethnocide, and the cultural destruction it has inflicted upon all Americans, past and present. Otherwise we will fail to make a better future, and will continue our regression. Barrett is a writer, journalist and filmmaker focusing on race, culture and politics Her ancestors enslaved mine.

What is GDP?,"The UK's economy had zero growth in the third quarter of 2024, according to the latest official figures. The strength of the economy affects things like pay increases for workers and the amount of tax the government can raise to pay for services. GDP stands for gross domestic product, and is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishesnew GDP figures every month,external. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. That's because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. When GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which can be bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known asa recession, which can lead to pay freezes and job losses. The UK briefly fell into recession at the end of 2023, when the economy shrank in the last two quarters of the year. It rebounded in the first half of 2024, when GDP increased 0.7% between January and March, and0.5% between April and June,external. However, the economy had zero growth betweenJuly and September. The latest monthly figures show that GDPshrank by 0.1% in October. Analysts said the unexpected fall was linked to measures announcedin that month's Budget, including a rise in employernational insurance contributions (NICs)and ahigher minimum wage. In early December, the influential think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its growth forecast for the UK for 2024. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.9% across the year as a whole, down from its previous prediction of 1.1%. That would make it the fourth best performer in the G7 group of rich nations,according to the OECD,external, behind the US, Canada and France, but ahead of Italy, Germany and Japan. However, economic forecasts are not always accurate. If GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government, which it can choose to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Governments tend to get less money in tax, which means they may decide to freeze or cut public spending, or put taxes up. In 2020, the Covid pandemic caused the most severe UK recession for more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. How much money does the UK government raise and spend each year? Where does the government borrow billions from? GDP can be measured in three ways: Output: The total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction, the service sector and government Expenditure:The value of goods and services bought by households and by government, investment in machinery and buildings - this also includes the value of exports, minus imports Income: The value of the income generated, mostly in terms of profits and wages In the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question. At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in. The ONS publishes more information about thison its website,external. GDPdoesn't tell the whole story: the hidden economy:unpaid work such as caring for children or elderly relatives isn't captured inequality:it also doesn't show how income is split across a population - rising GDP could result from the richest getting richer, rather than everyone becoming better off, and some people could be worse off To try and address this, the ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. In fact, when you strip out inflation and population growth, the latest quarterly figures show thatGDP per capita actually fell by 0.1% between July and September 2024,external. Official GDP figures don't take into account unpaid work like looking after children Some critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable,or the environmental damage it might do. Alternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. Since 2010,the ONS has also measured well-being,externalalongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. But despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.

Firms still positive despite pandemic,"Vivien Wong, who runs Little Moons, said lockdown didn't come as a great surprise The scale of the UK's economic troubles have been laid bare bythe latest GDP figures. Will the recovery be V-shaped, L-shaped, U-shaped, or is it far too early to tell? Despite the uncertainties, however, some British companies are nothing if not positive. Here, the owners of three firms that went into lockdown in March tell the BBC why they can see light at the end of the tunnel. The lockdown hit just as Little Moons was enjoying its best month of trading. The business, which makes the Japanese ice cream confection mochi for restaurants and supermarkets, shut down overnight. Co-founder Vivien Wong said lockdown didn't come as a great surprise. ""We'd followed what was happening in China and Hong Kong,"" she said. More than 50% of revenues came from restaurants, money that dried up immediately. ""We were weren't sure what was going to happen with supermarkets, but we knew immediately we had to go into cash preservation mode."" Luckily, Little Moons struck a deal with its landlord, which eased cash flow. ""We cancelled marketing and all unnecessary spending. Basically, we just hunkered down,"" Ms Wong said. The London-based company trades throughout Europe, which has helped Little Moons to get back to business. Ms Wong said: ""Europe opened up a little earlier, so from about mid-May we started getting orders from supermarkets. ""We started un-furloughing a few members of our team, and have just started cranking up production again."" But a return to the record trading Little Moons saw in March could be a long way off. Ms Wong said: ""We have halved the number of people on the production floor and changed shift patterns. ""It means we are not as efficient as before. That's really affected us financially."" Little Moons is employing more cleaners, and the cost of face masks and other food hygiene equipment has soared. The firm's future is tied up with the restaurant sector, which she worries may never fully recover. That said, supermarket orders are rising, which Ms Wong puts down to people wanting comfort food. ""It was pretty catastrophic"" is how Adam Redhouse describes the first few days of lockdown. Sales and lettings at his London estate agents firm disappeared virtually overnight. ""We furloughed sales staff immediately, and closed all the offices,"" he said. ""We lost over 50% of the sales pipeline over the first few days as people cancelled."" And yet, over the following weeks the business continued to get what Mr Redhouse said were ""a fair few inquiries. That was a massive surprise. But if you can't do viewings, you can't sell properties."" Still, even though Squire Estates did very few transactions, the continuing customer interest at least gave him hope that business would pick up once the lockdown eased. It was only in mid-May that estate agents began re-opening for business, but Mr Redhouse has been amazed at the pace of recovery. ""It sounds crazy, given how much business we lost,"" he said. ""It was on a Tuesday night that the government said we could re-open, and on the Wednesday morning we un-furloughed all the sales staff. There was a lot of pent up demand for transactions and viewings,"" he said. It helped, Mr Redhouse believes, that he and his partner made a special effort to keep in touch with clients and potential clients during the lockdown. Business continues to pick up, but will it get back to normal? ""I like to think so. The amount of demand that we are seeing shows that people want to move. I feel positive,"" he said. Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to re-open. ""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed."" Furloughing has been vital. ""It's given us a great deal of oxygen to keep the business going,"" she said. Staff wages are the biggest fixed costs after property rents and rates. As soon as Total Fitness is given the go-ahead to re-open Ms Lawler plans to bring all the staff back from furlough. ""We will need all our people, maybe even more."" She'd like to see the government do more to help, perhaps with some VAT exemptions and support for landlords to let them ease the burden on leaseholders. Despite the uncertainties, however, she says the fitness industry ""has an exceptionally bright future if we can weather this storm"". Ms Lawler said the sector has proved particularly resilient to recessions in the past, and will do so again. She expects to see a uptick in customers who recognise the importance of fitness and exercise in the fight to stay healthy against viruses. ""It terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this,"" she said. The trouble is, she has no idea when that might be. ""Our single biggest challenge is that there is just no guidance on re-opening.""

Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy reelsGovernor Andrew Bailey pledges action after the UK's economy sees its biggest monthly decline on record.BusinessComments,"Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said he will be ""ready to take action"" to help the UK economy weather the coronavirus crisis. He was speaking after figures showed that the country's economy shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown. ""We are still very much in the midst of this,"" Mr Bailey said. But he said the figure was ""pretty much in line"" with what the bank expected. ""Obviously it's a dramatic and big number, but actually it's not a surprising number,"" he said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid April's ""historic"" fall affected virtually all areas of activity, as large parts of the economy remained shut to battle the pandemic. The contraction is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. But analysts said April was likely to be the worst month, as the government began easing the lockdown in May. Mr Bailey said there were ""signs of the economy now beginning to come back into life"", but the big question was how much long-term damage the pandemic would cause. ""That's the thing we've got to be very focused on, because that's where jobs get lost,"" he said. ""Now we hope that will be as small as possible, but we have to be ready and ready to take action, not just the Bank of England, but more broadly on what we can do to offset those longer-term and damaging effects."" What a shrinking economy means in one town The ONS also published figures for the three months from February to April, which showed a decline of 10.4% compared with the previous three-month period. News of the slump comes as almost nine million UK workers are having their wages paid by the government, whilethe number of people claiming unemployment benefitrocketed by 856,500 to 2.1 million in April. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a ""tough"" few months ahead, but added: ""We will get through it."" ""We've always been in no doubt this was going to be a very serious public health crisis but also have big, big economic knock-on effects. ""The UK is heavily dependent on services, we're a dynamic creative economy, we depend so much on human contact. We have been very badly hit by this."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak expects life to get ""a little bit more back to normal"" when shops reopen Chancellor Rishi Sunak said life would get ""a little bit more back to normal"" once High Street shops could reopen. That is set to happen on Monday in England, while shops in Northern Ireland have already been allowed to resume trading. Scotland and Wales have their own timetables for easing restrictions. In response, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that the UK's economy was shrinking faster than those of other countries. She said the UK would need ""strong action to help us climb out of this as quickly as possible"". In normal times, a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of the goods and services it produces - increases, making its citizens on average slightly richer. However, the ONS said April's fall in GDP was the biggest the UK had ever seen. ""[The fall was] more than three times larger than last month and almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-Covid-19 fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, the agency's deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""In April, the economy was around 25% smaller than in February."" What is GDP and how is it measured? What is a recession? He said virtually all areas of the economy had been hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all seeing marked falls in activity. Carmakers and housebuilders were also badly affected, although Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's highly likely April will be the low point. ""Our own surveys and wider indicators have suggested a pick-up in economy activity, but I think it's really too early to know how quickly economic activity will recover in the coming months."" In large part, thanks to the extraordinary levels of state intervention propping it up. More than one in four UK workers - some 8.9 million - are now on the government's furlough scheme that allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to Â£2,500. The scheme has cost Â£19.6bn so far, while a similar programme for self-employed workers has seen 2.6 million claims made worth Â£7.5bn. Without these schemes, household consumption, which makes up nearly two-thirds of the UK's GDP, would have fallen even further. Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to reopen. ""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed."" Furloughing has been vital, she says, but she'd like the government to do more - perhaps in the form of VAT exemptions or more support for leaseholders. Despite the uncertainties, however, she thinks the sector will weather the storm. ""In terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this."" Three firms still positive despite the crisis The ONS numbers add to the pressure to ease the lockdown more quickly, but fears around the control of the disease have led to a step-by-step cautious approach. There is some pressure on the Treasury to consider similar economic rescue packages to those made across Europe. Germany, for example, has cut VAT and offered billions in a package to help families with children and purchasers of green cars. France is offering huge rescue funds to the car and aerospace industry. The unprecedented jobs schemes here will help to protect livelihoods. But with this scale of hit, it will not be enough. During the global financial crisis, from the peak in February 2008 to the lowest point of March 2009, a total of 13 months, GDP shrank by 6.9%. April's unprecedented contraction is three times that - and it happened in one month. The UK's economy was already shrinking even before April. It contracted by 2% in the first three monthsof 2020, as just a few days of impact from the virus pushed it into decline. Economists expect an even bigger slump in the April-to-June period, plunging the country into a deep recession. ""Given the lockdown started to be eased in May, April will mark the trough in GDP. So we are past the worst,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics. ""But the recovery will be a drawn-out affair, as restrictions are only lifted gradually and businesses and consumers continue to exercise caution."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said coronavirus had caused ""unparalleled"" economic turmoil which was ""likely to scar the UK economy for some time yet"". ""Having provided businesses life support, the government must now figure out how to stimulate activity,"" he added. ""Waiting until later in the year to act will risk more businesses and jobs will be lost."" We don't really know yet. The UK is one of the few countries to publish monthly economic data - most others just produce quarterly and annual figures. We do know, however, that coronavirus has already pushed several major economies into recession: Japan saw a 3.4% fall in GDPfor the first three months of 2020 Germany's economy shrank by 2.2%in the first three months of this year And France saw a 5.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2020. On Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned thatthe UK could be the hardest hit by Covid-19among major economies. The British economy is likely to shrink by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said. A recession is usually defined as two three-month periods - or quarters - of economic contraction in a row. Technically, we are not at that point yet. But the UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. Read more SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?
