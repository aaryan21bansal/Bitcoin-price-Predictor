Killing of migrant on Italian street sparks outcry,"The local police released the picture of the scene following the attack The death of a migrant who was attacked in broad daylight in central Italy has sparked outrage. The assault on the Nigerian street trader by another man in Civitanova Marche town centre was captured on video on Friday. The recording, reportedly made by onlookers without any attempt to intervene, shows the victim being held to the ground by a white man. A 32-year-old Italian has been arrested on suspicion of murder and robbery. The video of the attack - which has been widely circulated on Italian news websites and social media - has shocked the community, with many highlighting the ""indifference"" of witnesses. The circumstances of the incident are unclear. The victim has been named as Alika Ogorchukwu, a married father of two.  His wife, named as Charity Oriachi, could not contain her tears as she told media how she was shown the body of her husband lying on the ground. On Saturday hundreds of people from the local Nigerian community took to the streets of Civitanova Marche, in Marche region, to demand justice. The attack has also been condemned by Italian politicians. Enrico Letta, the leader of the left-wing Democratic Party, said what happened was ""dismaying"". ""Unheard of ferocity. Widespread indifference. There can be no justification,"" he wrote in a tweet. Right-wing leader Matteo Salvini also expressed outrage over the death, saying ""security has no colour""  and ""needs to return to being a right.""

Beach body ad edited out my prosthetic leg - model,"Sian Green-Lord says the image on the left was used without permission, and removed her prosthetic leg A British model says she was left furious after the Spanish government used her image without permission and edited out her prosthetic leg. The photo was used as part of abody positivity campaign launched by Spain's equality ministry. But Sian Green-Lord, 32, said she only found out about the campaign when friends messaged her about it. She is the second woman featured in the campaign to say her photos were used without permission. On Friday, Nyome Nicholas-Williams, from London, told the BBC thatan image from her Instagram page was used in the posterreleased by the Spanish Institute for Women. It features an illustration of five women - including one who has had a mastectomy - on a beach underneath the slogan ""summer is ours too"". Ms Green-Lord is seen at the bottom left of the image. Speaking in an Instagram story, she said she was left ""shaking with rage"" after she saw her photos had been edited to remove her prosthetic leg. She said her swimsuit had also been altered. ""I don't know how to even explain the amount of anger that I'm feeling right now,"" she said in the video. ""There's one thing using my image without my permission. But there's another thing editing my body."" ""I literally don't even know what to say but it's beyond wrong,"" Ms Green-Lord added. The influencer and mother-of-one's leg was amputated after she was hit by a taxi while on holiday in New York in 2013. She was walking with a friend in Manhattan when the vehicle mounted the kerb. On Thursday, the campaign's creator, Arte Mapache, issued an apology for using the images without permission. ""Given the - justified - controversy over the image rights in the illustration, I have decided that the best way to make amends for the damages that may have resulted from my actions is to share out the money I received for the work and give equal parts to the people in the poster,"" the artist said. ""I hope to be able to solve all this as soon as possible, I accept my mistakes and that is why I am now trying to repair the damage caused,"" she added. The Spanish government has yet to comment on the controversy. But in a statement earlier this week, Spain'sInstitute of Women,externalsaid the campaign was a response to the ""fatphobia, hatred and the questioning of non-normative bodies - particularly those of women, something that's most prevalent in the summertime.""

Ex-health secs call for urgent blood scandal payouts,"Three former health secretaries have called on the government to urgently pay compensation to victims of the contaminated blood scandal. The chairman of the public inquiry into the scandal, Sir Brian Langstaff,has recommendedthat each victim should receive a provisional sum of Â£100,000. One woman who developed hepatitis C from infected blood told the BBC the news was ""incredibly significant"". The government has said it will urgently consider any recommendations. Former health secretaries Andy Burnham, Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock told the BBC it was important to act quickly because the life expectancy of many victims had been shortened by infections they had contracted. A lawyer representing about 15,000 claimants also argued that victims should receive compensation ""immediately"". Des Collins said payment must be made within ""days or weeks"", and he would step up pressure from Monday. The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Explained: Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Pay-outs ignore some families - victim's son Thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s afterbeing given a new treatment called factor VIII or IX. More than 2,400 have died as a result, and it has been estimated that one person affected by the scandal dies every four days. At the time, the medication was imported from the US where it was made from the pooled blood plasma of thousands of paid donors, including some in high-risk groups, such as prisoners. If a single donor was infected with a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis or HIV, then the whole batch of medication could be contaminated. An unknown number of UK patients were also exposed to hepatitis B or C though a blood transfusion after childbirth or surgery. This video can not be played Video statements were played at the start of the public inquiry in September 2018 Labour's Andy Burnham called on ministers to act quickly, telling BBC Breakfast many victims had ""not got long left"". He added that governments had not ""been truthful about this matter because of the fear about the financial exposure"". Mr Burnham claimed that successive health ministers - including himself - had been misled by officials, adding there ""may be a case for corporate manslaughter"". Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, another former health secretary who now chairs the health select committee, said the issue must not be ""kicked into the long grass"". Like Mr Burnham, he acknowledged failings of previous governments in their support for victims of the scandal. Giving evidence to the inquiry in 2021, then health secretary Matt Hancock said ""of course"" compensation would be paid to victims and their families if the public inquiry formally called for it. On Saturday, Mr Hancock told the BBC he was confident the government would deliver pay-outs to victims and that it was its ""moral duty"" to do so. Mr Hancock went on to say that compensation had not been paid yet because ""in government, when a recommendation comes in like this, you do need to then check with each department"". Ros Cooper welcomed the judge's recommendation of compensation Ros Cooper, who was infected with hepatitis C after being given blood-clotting products as a baby, welcomed the recommendation of interim compensation. Ms Cooper called the judge's words ""incredibly significant"", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her disease had been ""the controlling factor"" in her life. Currently, victims and families get an annual financial support payment but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Sir Brian Langstaff said on Friday that more than 4,000 individuals who currently qualify for the government's existing offering of financial support - including some bereaved partners of those killed - should now receive the pay-outs. Jason Evans, whose father died in 1993 after contracting HIV and hepatitis C from infected blood, said he was concerned he would need to continue to campaign to get pay-outs ""over the line"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he described the ""terrible"" stigma his family had faced during his father's illness. He said his mother lost her job at a bakery because the manager thought customers would worry about being served by someone whose husband might develop Aids. Mr Evans, who was four when his father died, was also bullied at school as a result of his father's infection. Jason Evans said his family had faced stigma after his father contracted HIV and hepatitis C Mr Evans criticised shortcomings in the existing government support scheme for victims, saying this hadcreated a ""situation where some victims' lives matter and others' don't"". He said some bereaved family members would be ineligible to receive support under Sir Brian's recommendation - for example, if a victim's relationship had broken down, meaning that their ex-spouse had no longer been living with the victim at the time they died. Over the years, the government has put in place a number of schemes offering victims financial support without any admission of liability but, unlike in the Republic of Ireland and some other countries, compensation has never been paid to individuals or families affected. Compensation would be intended to fund immediate bills and care needs, with final recommendations on compensation for a wider group of people expected when the inquiry concludes next year. An independent study commissioned by the government,published last month,external, said victims should eventually be compensated for physical and social injury, the stigma of the disease, the impact on family and work life, and the cost of care. Partners, children, siblings and parents of those who have been infected should be eligible for payments too, the study recommended. If the inquiry and then the government accept those proposals then it is possible a final bill could be more than a billion pounds. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise how important this will be for people infected and affected across the UK, and can confirm that the government will consider Sir Brian's report and the recommendations of Sir Robert Francis QC with the utmost urgency, and will respond as soon as possible.""

Liverpool 3-1 Man City Matt UpsonFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Liverpool deserved to win this.

FT: Liverpool 3-1 Man City Inevitably, a lot of people will see this as a Darwin Nunez victory over Erling Haaland. The Liverpool forward was on the scoresheet, the Norwegian was not and also missed a few great chances. I think it is pretty clear, though, that they're both going to score boatloads this season.

Nunez scores as Liverpool win Community Shield,"This video can not be played Community Shield highlights: Darwin Nunez stars as Liverpool beat Man City Summer signing Darwin Nunez sealed victory as Liverpool landed the first blow of the season on champions Manchester City by winning a thrilling Community Shield encounter. The FA Cup winners were pipped to the Premier League title by a single point last term after a season-long fight with City, but came out on top in a tremendous game in Leicester. Playing at the King Power Stadium rather than Wembley - which will host Sunday's Women's Euros final - the two sides did not hold back in a match that tends to be badged as a 'glorified friendly'. Reds full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold scored the opening goal with a curling effort from the edge of the box which took a slight deflection off Nathan Ake and nestled in the far corner. He celebrated by raising his finger to his lips in front of the City supporters, who had helped generate a thunderous atmosphere by trading jibes with their Liverpool counterparts. City's star summer signing Erling Haaland showed glimpses of what he will bring by drawing a good save from Adrian, while Nunez had a one-on-one effort kept out by Ederson. But it was another newcomer - Julian Alvarez - who scored next, staying alert after Phil Foden's shot was saved to poke home the equaliser from close range, with the goal awarded after a lengthy VAR check. Mohamed Salah edged Liverpool back in front by scoring from the penalty spot with eight minutes remaining after referee Craig Pawson adjudged - from looking at the pitchside monitor - that Ruben Dias had handled inside the area. And Nunez had the final say, stooping to head in from close range before wheeling off to celebrate in front of his new supporters. Nunez strikes first in battle with Haaland Reaction to the Community Shield Liverpool came agonisingly close to a quadruple last season as they won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, but they missed out on the league by the narrowest of margins and were defeated in the Champions League final by Real Madrid. Just 63 days on from that loss in Paris, the Reds were back in action against the side they have formed an intense but respectful rivalry with over the past four years. Liverpool came out flying in trademark fashion from kick-off, hassling and harrying the City backline, and Salah - fresh from signing a bumper new contract in the summer - struck the side-netting in just the third minute. Andrew Robertson headed into the side-netting too, before fellow full-back Alexander-Arnold broke the deadlock with a curling effort, albeit via a nick off Ake's head. It sparked jubilant scenes in the red end of the ground, where the Liverpool fans lit flares and filled the stadium with smoke. The scenes were similar to those at Wembley after their FA Cup triumph over Chelsea in May, but this time the Football Association said it is investigating the use of flares following the introduction of stricter measures to tackle ""anti-social and criminal behaviour in football grounds"". On the pitch, Nunez has been brought in from Benfica to replace Sadio Mane, who joined Bayern Munich, and the Uruguay international was brought on just before the hour mark. He almost made the perfect start to his Liverpool career when latching on to Jordan Henderson's perfectly weighted through ball only to strike his shot straight at the advancing Ederson. But he was involved for Salah's goal as his header struck Dias' arm inside the box, and the Egyptian stepped up to net the penalty. There was still time for Nunez to head home late on, as the Â£64m man sealed victory to complete the domestic trophy set for manager Klopp. City have won four of the past five Premier League titles and are looking to become just the second side after Manchester United to lift the trophy in three successive seasons. The City fans were not shy of reminding their Liverpool counterparts, their chants of ""You nearly won the league"" prompting a riposte of ""Where's your European Cup?"" Pep Guardiola's men went into the closing weeks of the season aiming for a Treble of their own, but their hopes were dashed by semi-final defeats in the FA Cup by Liverpool, and in the Champions League by Real Madrid. The Â£51m acquisition of Norway international Haaland from Borussia Dortmund gives them a different dimension up front, following the departures of Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling. Haaland outmuscled Robertson in the first half, taking the ball down on his chest only for his side-footed shot to be batted away by Adrian, then he could not get enough connection on a stretching effort. Argentina international Alvarez, who signed in January but stayed with River Plate until the end of their season, did level after coming on, to highlight the options Guardiola has at his disposal. But the joy was short-lived as Salah and Nunez both scored, before Haaland missed a sitter from a couple of yards out in the final minute.

The MS Victoria is serving as temporary accommodation for families arriving in Scotland from Ukraine. More than 10,500 people have travelled from Ukraine to Scotland since the invasion in February. Refugees told BBC Scotland they were impressed by the facilities on the ship chartered by the Scottish government. They beganmoving on to the vessel on Tuesday. It could accommodate up to 1,700 people in total. Onboard facilities include restaurants, children's play areas with toys and books, shops, a laundry, support services and Wi-Fi access.

""There is Ukrainian TV channels which we were very surprised about as you never find that when you go on holiday. ""All the signs are in Ukrainian on the ship and most of the staff are Ukrainian. ""And last night we had Borscht beetroot soup, our national dish, we couldn't believe it. ""We were so happy to have this as it is our hearts."" Ukrainian food is available on the ship She said there were cinemas and theatres on board but there were issues with the lights because they were not working after the Covid lockdowns.

LiveLiveDisruption as train strike hits weekend travel8 minutes ago,"Rail passengers face more disruption as train drivers at seven companies walk out in a dispute over pay The strike by members of the Aslef union is scheduled for 24 hours, with disturbance expected to continue into Sunday Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, says unless Britain's railway industry is modernised, it could enter a ""managed decline"" as it did 30 or 40 years ago Meanwhile, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says that today's industrial action brings a ""whiff of the Seventies"" and accuses union leaders of ""holding a gun"" to the government's head Affected operators are Arriva Rail London, Greater Anglia, Great Western, Hull Trains, LNER, Southeastern and West Midlands Trains This is the second strike action of the week and impacts the first games of the season for most English Football League clubs and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham Aslef's Mick Whelan has described the day's strike by train drivers as ""solidly supported"" Edited by Jeremy Gahagan We're pausing our live coverage of today's strike action by train drivers - here's what's been happening:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan, Marita Moloney and Laura Gozzi. Lee Blackman's train is full and people are having to stand between carriages Lee Blackman is travelling back to Manchester from London, where he attended the Lady Gaga concert last night. He told the BBC of chaotic scenes on the train back: ""Our original train got
cancelled - not sure why. As soon as the new platform was
announced everyone ran to the train, but when we got on it
was bedlam, nobody was guiding anyone anywhere and the majority of seats were
reserved."" ""Nobody cared - it was a
free-for-all. No health or safety
procedures were followed either. A poor woman had a table
reserved as she had two children with her and the people sat in her seats point
blank refused to move."" ""We are currently travelling stood
between two carriages."" The picket line outside Leeds station today Aslef's Mick Whelan has been sharing an update on today's walk out, describing the strike by train drivers as ""solidly supported"". The union chief said this shows ""the solidarity of our members and their determination not to be pushed around by Grant Shapps, the Department for Transport, and the train companies"". Whelan continued by saying workers are just looking for a pay rise in line with the increase in the cost of living and he hit out at the Transport Secretary again after earlier accusing him of ""lying"" about the ongoing negotiations. ""Shapps holds the key to this but, true to form, he is blustering and ducking and diving, and looking to blame everyone else, indeed, anyone else, for the problems he has created,"" Whelan said. ""He could solve this in an instant by allowing the train companies to come to the table with a sensible offer and negotiate with us."" As we reported earlier, the Department of Transport has responded to the union's calls by saying it is ""extremely misleading"" to suggest Shapps should get involved in the negotiations. Sport fans travelling to their first matches of the Football League season have described convoluted journeys as a result of the rail strikes. Jack Lucas travelled to watch his team Derby County, requiring two buses and a train to reach Pride Park stadium from his home in Kidderminster. The journey took around three times the length it would have done with the usual two trains. ""I was constantly texting my mum and girlfriend to make sure
they knew where I was in case I got lost,"" he says with a laugh. Rail workers on strike ""picked the right day to do it,"" he says with an ironic tone. ""It does mess other people around,"" he says. Judith MoritzBBC North of England Correspondent, reporting from Leeds There are plenty of departures from Leeds station This feels like a tale of two kinds of station. Those like Folkestone in Kent which are closed, with no Southeastern trains running at all. And those like Leeds, where I am, which seem very busy. Thatâs because some companies like Northern Rail are unaffected, so there are lots of trains operating. But others, like LNER are running severely reduced services. Normally there would be two trains every hour between Leeds and London on the East Coast mainline. Today there was one early this morning, and there wonât be another leaving for the capital until tomorrow morning. We've been hearing how passengers have been contending with today's disruption, and for one man coming home from Europe, it has been a long week of travelling. Tim Limbach, who has been on holidays with a group of 12 people, including his family, in Austria after flying via Munich last weekend. As with the UK, the roads in Germany have been really busy with lots of delays since schools broke up for the summer. Tim's trip was also affected by British Airways cancellations, and he had to rebook his initial flights through Salzburg to Munich, which meant it was a long drive to the resort he was staying in in Austria. The group are travelling home today, and Tim spoke to the BBC ahead of departing from Munich. ""It's really challenging, I've arrived at the airport and I have to go through security but I've been told it's been quite quick, and then through the non-EU passport queue, which is long,"" he said. He added that the children in the group are handling all the travel well and seem ""unflappable"" in the midst of the long drives and wait times. ""It's just us oldies who struggle a bit,"" he joked. Stephen Glover is travelling with family and friends from Stafford to London to watch England's women play in Sunday's Euro 2022 football final. He tells the BBC that all eight of them have had to cram into their van due to strike action affecting West Midlands Railway. ""The kids were looking forward to the rail journey,"" says Stephen. ""It's all part of the experience."" He's sceptical of the justification for the industrial action, saying it's not only rail workers who have faced hard times recently. Stephen says many owners of small businesses like himself are trying to recover from Covid, but have been ""hit by all these days of strikes. ""I just think itâs not
fair for all these businesses that have been hammered, to be hammered again,"" he adds. Arthur Scargill, the former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, is showing his solidarity with striking train drivers today on the picket line. His first major strike took place in 1972 when he led an initial group of 400 Yorkshire miners on apicket of the Saltley Gate coal depotin Birmingham. The 84-year-old, who led the NUM for two decades, was seen joining Aslef members outside Doncaster station in Yorkshire to show his support for their walk out today. Scargill also appeared on the picket line, this time in Sheffield, alongside striking rail workers last month during three days of industrial action as part of the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.

Grant Shapps Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, has hit out at the transport secretary while speaking to the media from the picket line about today's industrial action. Whelan accused Grant Shapps of lying about the ongoing negotiations between unions and rail companies and hit back at the transport secretary for saying Aslef was ""dragging its feet in negotiations"". The union boss told Times Radio: ""I would like Mr Shapps to get us out of this catch-22 situation that he misrepresents at every opportunity."" Now the Department of Transport has responded to Whelan's comments, saying it was ""extremely misleading"" to suggest Shapps should get involved in the negotiations. A spokesperson said: ""The union knows full well that negotiations over pay and working practices don't happen with the government, they happen with the employers of the people they represent. We once again urge union representatives to get back round the negotiating table."" Today's strike is not the last one set to disrupt summer plans for travellers across the country - three more are planned forSaturday 13, Thursday 18 and Saturday 20 August. Aslef train drivers at nine rail companies will carry out industrial action on August 13, while Network Rail, as well as 14 other operators, will walk out on 18 and 20 August. In addition, London Undeground staff will strike on19 August. Rail passengers are being hit with fresh disruption today due to a strike by around 5,000 train drivers. Members of the Aslef union have taken to the picket line across Britain in a dispute over pay, affecting services run by seven operators. Passengers check the boards at London's King's Cross Station Aslef boss Mick Whelan (centre) joins the picket line outside London's Paddington station Southeastern trains in sidings near Ashford railway station in Kent Sam Tarry, the former shadow transport minister joins the picket line outside Paddington Hitachi Rail workers are to strike for three days from tomorrow in a row over pay and conditions. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) whose jobs include maintenance, are in dispute over pay and issues including breaks, leave entitlement and shift length. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said members ""know the value of their work and will not be short changed by Hitachi Rail"". ""I congratulate our members on this strong industrial response and RMT will support further stoppages until they receive a just settlement,"" he said. It is estimated that Hitachi Rail employs around 3,000 staff in the UK, including 700 at its Newton Aycliffe factory in Durham. Trevor Bartlett, the leader of Dover City Council, told the BBC that although traffic in Dover has cleared up following last week's congestion, the problem isn't going to go away and is indeed ""going to get worse with the introduction of the biometric passport checks"". These might ""require every passenger to get out of their car, coach and lorry."" The new measures, which should come into force next year, will likely have ""a devastating impact on all the residents and businesses across Kent,"" says Bartlett. Bartlett said he felt ""dismay, desperation and anger"" during last week's gridlock. ""Dover deserves better."" Ongoing disruption to rail services has meant many people around the country have seen their travel plans upended. While lots have been forced to cancel plans, some have been determined to make their journey come what may. Mike Simpson had been looking forward to seeing blues and rock band George Thorogood and the Destroyers at Nottingham's Royal Concert Hall on Wednesday night. On discovering that his train from his hometown Leicester to Nottingham was cancelled, the 54-year-old refused to be defeated - and decided to cycle the 33-mile journey instead. ""I got the exercise and fun of a big electric bike ride and managed to see the gig so it was a win-win,"" says Mike. By train, the journey would have taken him around half an hour. Instead the journey, door to door, took five hours each way. Read morehere. Traffic is expected to be busy at the Port of Dover over the weekend Away from the railways, traffic on Britain's main roads is expected to be heavy again today after holidaymakers were hit with congestion yesterday. The AA put its first ""amber traffic warning"" in place yesterday, and this also is in effect from 11:00 to 15:00 BST today. Major roads in south-east England were particularly affected yesterday due to a combination of the first switchover days for holiday lets during the school summer holidays in England and Wales. The Commonwealth Games, the start of the Football League season in England, and the rail strike are also contributing to issues on the roads. The AA says there is a high chance of traffic jams and delays across the country this weekend, with these expected to be worse in: David Sidebottom, the director of travel watchdog Transport Focus, has told the BBC that passengers want the unions and trade operators to ""sort out"" the ongoing disruption, noting that there's another strike planned for next weekend and more to come in August. Sidebottom warns that, if industrial action persists, people might eventually stop thinking of trains as a reliable way to get around, particularly for leisure journeys. ""That will be the legacy of these strikes: people will find alternatives"" and turn to cars, planes or other means to get to their destinations. ""In the long term, that is going to damage the railways,"" he says. Mark and Fiona are a couple from Winchester who are due to travel to a wedding today. ""This will seriously affect our plans for travelling to a wedding in Kent. Now we have no choice but to drive, and there will be so much traffic,"" Fiona told the BBC. ""It's causing me a lot of anxiety and unnecessary stress,"" she added. Her husband Mark said that three people due to sit on their table at the wedding cannot come as there are no trains for them - and they do not drive. ""These are the groom's work colleagues. It's really sad and makes me angry,"" said Mark. ""It's unfair that the wedding plans are being spoiled at the last minute."" Simon JonesReporting from Folkestone station in Kent No trains from Southeastern, which is a rail company that operates services in within Kent, are running at all today. Normally on a Saturday morning, this station would be really busy with people coming here as a tourist destination, but today it is eerily quiet. There have been people arriving at the station not actually aware that there's a strike on, they hadn't seen advance notification of it even though there have been posters around the station, there has been a lot of talk about it in the media. We spoke to one man who had just completed a 12-hour night shift as a care worker. ""It's a bit annoying, the next bus for me is in an hour, and then it's going to be another hour and a half,"" he said. ""I haven't slept a wink, I worked eight to eight, so I don't even know where I'm going to go right now."" We also heard from a woman who arrived here wanting to buy a ticket in advance for next week only to find the ticket office itself was shut too. ""It's just so random, we can't really make any plans or of we do, they don't really work out, like today,"" she said. Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, has given a wide-ranging interview with The Daily Telegraph today where he is warning what could happen if the industry is not modernised. Unions have been in dispute with rail companies and the government over pay, jobs and conditions amid plans, as the Department of Transport has termed it, to bring the industry into the 21st century. Hendytells the paper,externalthat ""you have to move with the times"", saying that he can't bear ""to be associated with an industry that becomes so out of date it becomes irrelevant"". He says that unless Britain's railway industry is modernised, it could enter a ""managed decline"" as it did 30 or 40 years ago, or else it could become obsolete in the same way as coal mines did. Hendy adds that he is confident a resolution with unions will eventually be reached, saying: ""A 100-year history shows that, however bad the dispute is, people do back to work."" Writing in today's Times newspaper, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, says that today's industrial action brings a ""whiff of the Seventies"" and accuses union leaders of ""holding a gun"" to the government's head in the form of repeated national strikes. ""The 'Two Micks', Lynch of the RMT and Whelan of Aslef, are taking the taxpayer for a ride, but not in the way they are meant to, writes Shapps, accusing the unions of not being interested in discussing reforming working practices. Yet, ""despite the stonewalling, changes will be introduced regardless,"" Shapps says. The reforms he lists include freeing up ticket-office staff to help passengers on platforms instead of having them ""twiddling their thumbs"" in ticket offices, as well as replacing maintenance staff working on tracks - ""a potentially fatal practice"" - with hi-tech cameras and drones. ""If we don't reform our railway it will slowly die,"" Shapps says, adding: ""This is not brinkmanship. We have to grip this situation and force it through necessary change. Mick Lynch can take pot shots at me as much as he likes. It doesn't change the facts."" ""I'm not going to cave in,"" Shapps writes. Â© 2025 BBC.

Winning ticket for $1.3bn US jackpot,"One lucky ticket purchased in the US state of Illinois has won $1.34bn (Â£1.11bn) in the second-largest Mega Millions prize, organisers say. The cash value option of the jackpot is $780.5m. The winner can choose to take the cash outright or be paid the full jackpot in instalments over 29 years. The odds of winning the jackpot in Friday's draw were rather slim - one in 300 million. The largest Mega Millions prize to date was $1.537bn in 2018. It was won by a single ticket sold in South Carolina. The 2016 Powerball prize, however, remains the largest jackpot in US history - $1.586bn - shared by three winners. The winning numbers for Friday night's Mega Millions draw were 13, 36, 45, 57 and 67 - with a Mega Ball of 14. The final prize was bigger than original estimate,due to high sales.,external Indian man who won lottery hours before selling house The Mega Millions website shows there was one winner, and company officials later confirmed that the ticket was sold in Illinois. No winner has yet come forward. The last time someone won the Mega Millions jackpot was 15 April in Tennessee. Since then, Americans have rushed to buy tickets as the prize swelled.

UK troops in Finland drills amid Russia threats,"About 150 British troops have joined Finnish and US forces for a ""high-readiness exercise"" in Finland. The four-day exercise involved 750 troops from the three nations, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. It comes just weeks after Nato signed an accession protocol with Finland to join the military alliance, beginning the process for membership. Finland and Sweden, which have held neutral status for years, applied to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine. The Kremlin has strongly opposed Finland and Sweden joining Nato and has issued threats over their plans to do so. Finland shares a 830-mile (1,340km) border with Russia. British troops based in Estonia were flown to Finland in Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters as part of the exercise, according to the MoD. The British personnel had been in Estonia as part of the British Arm's Project Unified Stance, which sees troopstake on a series of exercises,externalacross Europe in coordination with Nato and allies. Wing Commander Stephen Boyle, the UK defence attachÃ© in Helsinki, said: ""Our soldiers, sailors and aviators have received a warm welcome in Finland over the last few months. ""Exercise Vigilant Fox is the latest activity in an ongoing series of events across the domains. ""As Finland moves towards full Nato Membership, we will continue to seek opportunities like this to show solidarity with Finland, learn from each other and improve our ability to operate together."" In-depth: Sweden and Finland - from neutral to Nato Explained: What is Nato and how is it changing? Defence Minister James Heappey said the training, called Exercise Vigilant Fox, ""demonstrated the strength and interoperability of our armed forces with our US and Finnish allies"". He added that it reaffirms the UK's commitment to the defence and security of the Baltic Sea region. This latest exercise comes just days after the MoD revealed that six Royal Air Force fighter jetsflew to Finland and Sweden for joint training exercises.

We need to talk about live organ donation - BBC DJ,"A BBC Radio DJ who got a transplant says black and Asian people need to talk more about living organ donation. 1Xtra's DJ Ace was diagnosed withrenal failurein 2018 and received a kidney in October 2021. Doctors warned him it might take up to six years to find a match ""for somebody my age and ethnicity,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He and donor Naomi said they were initially unaware they could be living donors. Certain vital organs, such as the heart, can only be donated after death, but it is possible todonate a kidney or part of the liver while you are alive,external. Naomi was registered to donate after her death but, once she found out she could do it whilst living, she ""got lost in the rabbit hole of the internet"". ""Even me, I always assumed I'd get a kidney from a deceased person,"" Ace added. Ace says something has to be done to raise awareness as his wait time of up to six years was much longer than it would have been if he were white. He feels it's vital ""to have these conversations, why black people are not joining"". Naomi (right) says she took the decision to donate because of the ""benefits of it"" and is ""grateful that both are really healthy and well"" It comes down to getting somebody to match your organs as close as possible. People of the same background are more likely to share blood and tissue types - which means your body is more likely to accept an organ without issues. According toNHS Blood and Transplant,external, people from Black and Asian communities are more likely to develop high blood pressure, diabetes and certain forms of hepatitis than white people. This makes them more likely to need a transplant. Just over 30% of people waiting for a transplant across the UK are from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds. Over a third of people (35%) waiting for a kidney are from these backgrounds. Most black and minority ethnic people receive organs from white people, but they're less likely to be a closer match. There are some cultural reasons why organ donation rate is lower in these communities. This video can not be played DJ Ace spoke about waiting for a kidney transplant for two years ""There are myths and fears and taboos within the black community,"" co-founder of the African Caribbean Leukemia Trust (ACLT), Orin Lewis, has previously told Newsbeat. These include interpretations of the Bible or the Quran, a lack of trust in the system or simply not understanding why their organs are more valuable to their own race, he says. However, Orin added that talking to people and explaining the role they can have does make a difference. ""Most people will actually say: 'Yeah, I would seriously consider because I realise the power of my ethnicity to saving someone's life'."" Ace started to campaign and put his story out there, because ""there were a lot of people that were just like me, waiting for organs that didn't have a platform"".

Lee Blackman's train is full and people are having to stand between carriages Lee Blackman is travelling back to Manchester from London, where he attended the Lady Gaga concert last night. He told the BBC of chaotic scenes on the train back: ""Our original train got
cancelled - not sure why. As soon as the new platform was
announced everyone ran to the train, but when we got on it
was bedlam, nobody was guiding anyone anywhere and the majority of seats were
reserved."" ""Nobody cared - it was a
free-for-all. No health or safety
procedures were followed either. A poor woman had a table
reserved as she had two children with her and the people sat in her seats point
blank refused to move."" ""We are currently travelling stood
between two carriages."" The picket line outside Leeds station today Aslef's Mick Whelan has been sharing an update on today's walk out, describing the strike by train drivers as ""solidly supported"". The union chief said this shows ""the solidarity of our members and their determination not to be pushed around by Grant Shapps, the Department for Transport, and the train companies"". Whelan continued by saying workers are just looking for a pay rise in line with the increase in the cost of living and he hit out at the Transport Secretary again after earlier accusing him of ""lying"" about the ongoing negotiations. ""Shapps holds the key to this but, true to form, he is blustering and ducking and diving, and looking to blame everyone else, indeed, anyone else, for the problems he has created,"" Whelan said. ""He could solve this in an instant by allowing the train companies to come to the table with a sensible offer and negotiate with us."" As we reported earlier, the Department of Transport has responded to the union's calls by saying it is ""extremely misleading"" to suggest Shapps should get involved in the negotiations. Sport fans travelling to their first matches of the Football League season have described convoluted journeys as a result of the rail strikes. Jack Lucas travelled to watch his team Derby County, requiring two buses and a train to reach Pride Park stadium from his home in Kidderminster. The journey took around three times the length it would have done with the usual two trains. ""I was constantly texting my mum and girlfriend to make sure
they knew where I was in case I got lost,"" he says with a laugh. Rail workers on strike ""picked the right day to do it,"" he says with an ironic tone. ""It does mess other people around,"" he says. Judith MoritzBBC North of England Correspondent, reporting from Leeds There are plenty of departures from Leeds station This feels like a tale of two kinds of station. Those like Folkestone in Kent which are closed, with no Southeastern trains running at all. And those like Leeds, where I am, which seem very busy. Thatâs because some companies like Northern Rail are unaffected, so there are lots of trains operating. But others, like LNER are running severely reduced services. Normally there would be two trains every hour between Leeds and London on the East Coast mainline. Today there was one early this morning, and there wonât be another leaving for the capital until tomorrow morning. We've been hearing how passengers have been contending with today's disruption, and for one man coming home from Europe, it has been a long week of travelling. Tim Limbach, who has been on holidays with a group of 12 people, including his family, in Austria after flying via Munich last weekend. As with the UK, the roads in Germany have been really busy with lots of delays since schools broke up for the summer. Tim's trip was also affected by British Airways cancellations, and he had to rebook his initial flights through Salzburg to Munich, which meant it was a long drive to the resort he was staying in in Austria. The group are travelling home today, and Tim spoke to the BBC ahead of departing from Munich. ""It's really challenging, I've arrived at the airport and I have to go through security but I've been told it's been quite quick, and then through the non-EU passport queue, which is long,"" he said. He added that the children in the group are handling all the travel well and seem ""unflappable"" in the midst of the long drives and wait times. ""It's just us oldies who struggle a bit,"" he joked. Stephen Glover is travelling with family and friends from Stafford to London to watch England's women play in Sunday's Euro 2022 football final. He tells the BBC that all eight of them have had to cram into their van due to strike action affecting West Midlands Railway. ""The kids were looking forward to the rail journey,"" says Stephen. ""It's all part of the experience."" He's sceptical of the justification for the industrial action, saying it's not only rail workers who have faced hard times recently. Stephen says many owners of small businesses like himself are trying to recover from Covid, but have been ""hit by all these days of strikes. ""I just think itâs not
fair for all these businesses that have been hammered, to be hammered again,"" he adds. Arthur Scargill, the former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, is showing his solidarity with striking train drivers today on the picket line. His first major strike took place in 1972 when he led an initial group of 400 Yorkshire miners on apicket of the Saltley Gate coal depotin Birmingham. The 84-year-old, who led the NUM for two decades, was seen joining Aslef members outside Doncaster station in Yorkshire to show his support for their walk out today. Scargill also appeared on the picket line, this time in Sheffield, alongside striking rail workers last month during three days of industrial action as part of the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.

Grant Shapps Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, has hit out at the transport secretary while speaking to the media from the picket line about today's industrial action. Whelan accused Grant Shapps of lying about the ongoing negotiations between unions and rail companies and hit back at the transport secretary for saying Aslef was ""dragging its feet in negotiations"". The union boss told Times Radio: ""I would like Mr Shapps to get us out of this catch-22 situation that he misrepresents at every opportunity."" Now the Department of Transport has responded to Whelan's comments, saying it was ""extremely misleading"" to suggest Shapps should get involved in the negotiations. A spokesperson said: ""The union knows full well that negotiations over pay and working practices don't happen with the government, they happen with the employers of the people they represent. We once again urge union representatives to get back round the negotiating table."" Today's strike is not the last one set to disrupt summer plans for travellers across the country - three more are planned forSaturday 13, Thursday 18 and Saturday 20 August. Aslef train drivers at nine rail companies will carry out industrial action on August 13, while Network Rail, as well as 14 other operators, will walk out on 18 and 20 August. In addition, London Undeground staff will strike on19 August. Rail passengers are being hit with fresh disruption today due to a strike by around 5,000 train drivers. Members of the Aslef union have taken to the picket line across Britain in a dispute over pay, affecting services run by seven operators. Passengers check the boards at London's King's Cross Station Aslef boss Mick Whelan (centre) joins the picket line outside London's Paddington station Southeastern trains in sidings near Ashford railway station in Kent Sam Tarry, the former shadow transport minister joins the picket line outside Paddington Hitachi Rail workers are to strike for three days from tomorrow in a row over pay and conditions. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) whose jobs include maintenance, are in dispute over pay and issues including breaks, leave entitlement and shift length. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said members ""know the value of their work and will not be short changed by Hitachi Rail"". ""I congratulate our members on this strong industrial response and RMT will support further stoppages until they receive a just settlement,"" he said. It is estimated that Hitachi Rail employs around 3,000 staff in the UK, including 700 at its Newton Aycliffe factory in Durham. Trevor Bartlett, the leader of Dover City Council, told the BBC that although traffic in Dover has cleared up following last week's congestion, the problem isn't going to go away and is indeed ""going to get worse with the introduction of the biometric passport checks"". These might ""require every passenger to get out of their car, coach and lorry."" The new measures, which should come into force next year, will likely have ""a devastating impact on all the residents and businesses across Kent,"" says Bartlett. Bartlett said he felt ""dismay, desperation and anger"" during last week's gridlock. ""Dover deserves better."" Ongoing disruption to rail services has meant many people around the country have seen their travel plans upended. While lots have been forced to cancel plans, some have been determined to make their journey come what may. Mike Simpson had been looking forward to seeing blues and rock band George Thorogood and the Destroyers at Nottingham's Royal Concert Hall on Wednesday night. On discovering that his train from his hometown Leicester to Nottingham was cancelled, the 54-year-old refused to be defeated - and decided to cycle the 33-mile journey instead. ""I got the exercise and fun of a big electric bike ride and managed to see the gig so it was a win-win,"" says Mike. By train, the journey would have taken him around half an hour. Instead the journey, door to door, took five hours each way. Read morehere. Traffic is expected to be busy at the Port of Dover over the weekend Away from the railways, traffic on Britain's main roads is expected to be heavy again today after holidaymakers were hit with congestion yesterday. The AA put its first ""amber traffic warning"" in place yesterday, and this also is in effect from 11:00 to 15:00 BST today. Major roads in south-east England were particularly affected yesterday due to a combination of the first switchover days for holiday lets during the school summer holidays in England and Wales. The Commonwealth Games, the start of the Football League season in England, and the rail strike are also contributing to issues on the roads. The AA says there is a high chance of traffic jams and delays across the country this weekend, with these expected to be worse in: David Sidebottom, the director of travel watchdog Transport Focus, has told the BBC that passengers want the unions and trade operators to ""sort out"" the ongoing disruption, noting that there's another strike planned for next weekend and more to come in August. Sidebottom warns that, if industrial action persists, people might eventually stop thinking of trains as a reliable way to get around, particularly for leisure journeys. ""That will be the legacy of these strikes: people will find alternatives"" and turn to cars, planes or other means to get to their destinations. ""In the long term, that is going to damage the railways,"" he says. Mark and Fiona are a couple from Winchester who are due to travel to a wedding today. ""This will seriously affect our plans for travelling to a wedding in Kent. Now we have no choice but to drive, and there will be so much traffic,"" Fiona told the BBC. ""It's causing me a lot of anxiety and unnecessary stress,"" she added. Her husband Mark said that three people due to sit on their table at the wedding cannot come as there are no trains for them - and they do not drive. ""These are the groom's work colleagues. It's really sad and makes me angry,"" said Mark. ""It's unfair that the wedding plans are being spoiled at the last minute."" Simon JonesReporting from Folkestone station in Kent No trains from Southeastern, which is a rail company that operates services in within Kent, are running at all today. Normally on a Saturday morning, this station would be really busy with people coming here as a tourist destination, but today it is eerily quiet. There have been people arriving at the station not actually aware that there's a strike on, they hadn't seen advance notification of it even though there have been posters around the station, there has been a lot of talk about it in the media. We spoke to one man who had just completed a 12-hour night shift as a care worker. ""It's a bit annoying, the next bus for me is in an hour, and then it's going to be another hour and a half,"" he said. ""I haven't slept a wink, I worked eight to eight, so I don't even know where I'm going to go right now."" We also heard from a woman who arrived here wanting to buy a ticket in advance for next week only to find the ticket office itself was shut too. ""It's just so random, we can't really make any plans or of we do, they don't really work out, like today,"" she said. Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, has given a wide-ranging interview with The Daily Telegraph today where he is warning what could happen if the industry is not modernised. Unions have been in dispute with rail companies and the government over pay, jobs and conditions amid plans, as the Department of Transport has termed it, to bring the industry into the 21st century. Hendytells the paper,externalthat ""you have to move with the times"", saying that he can't bear ""to be associated with an industry that becomes so out of date it becomes irrelevant"". He says that unless Britain's railway industry is modernised, it could enter a ""managed decline"" as it did 30 or 40 years ago, or else it could become obsolete in the same way as coal mines did. Hendy adds that he is confident a resolution with unions will eventually be reached, saying: ""A 100-year history shows that, however bad the dispute is, people do back to work."" Writing in today's Times newspaper, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, says that today's industrial action brings a ""whiff of the Seventies"" and accuses union leaders of ""holding a gun"" to the government's head in the form of repeated national strikes. ""The 'Two Micks', Lynch of the RMT and Whelan of Aslef, are taking the taxpayer for a ride, but not in the way they are meant to, writes Shapps, accusing the unions of not being interested in discussing reforming working practices. Yet, ""despite the stonewalling, changes will be introduced regardless,"" Shapps says. The reforms he lists include freeing up ticket-office staff to help passengers on platforms instead of having them ""twiddling their thumbs"" in ticket offices, as well as replacing maintenance staff working on tracks - ""a potentially fatal practice"" - with hi-tech cameras and drones. ""If we don't reform our railway it will slowly die,"" Shapps says, adding: ""This is not brinkmanship. We have to grip this situation and force it through necessary change. Mick Lynch can take pot shots at me as much as he likes. It doesn't change the facts."" ""I'm not going to cave in,"" Shapps writes. Â© 2025 BBC.

Which lines are affected?,"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

He told the BBC of chaotic scenes on the train back: ""Our original train got

The picket line outside Leeds station today Aslef's Mick Whelan has been sharing an update on today's walk out, describing the strike by train drivers as ""solidly supported"". The union chief said this shows ""the solidarity of our members and their determination not to be pushed around by Grant Shapps, the Department for Transport, and the train companies"". Whelan continued by saying workers are just looking for a pay rise in line with the increase in the cost of living and he hit out at the Transport Secretary again after earlier accusing him of ""lying"" about the ongoing negotiations. ""Shapps holds the key to this but, true to form, he is blustering and ducking and diving, and looking to blame everyone else, indeed, anyone else, for the problems he has created,"" Whelan said. ""He could solve this in an instant by allowing the train companies to come to the table with a sensible offer and negotiate with us."" As we reported earlier, the Department of Transport has responded to the union's calls by saying it is ""extremely misleading"" to suggest Shapps should get involved in the negotiations. Sport fans travelling to their first matches of the Football League season have described convoluted journeys as a result of the rail strikes. Jack Lucas travelled to watch his team Derby County, requiring two buses and a train to reach Pride Park stadium from his home in Kidderminster.

Judith MoritzBBC North of England Correspondent, reporting from Leeds There are plenty of departures from Leeds station This feels like a tale of two kinds of station. Those like Folkestone in Kent which are closed, with no Southeastern trains running at all. And those like Leeds, where I am, which seem very busy. Thatâs because some companies like Northern Rail are unaffected, so there are lots of trains operating. But others, like LNER are running severely reduced services. Normally there would be two trains every hour between Leeds and London on the East Coast mainline. Today there was one early this morning, and there wonât be another leaving for the capital until tomorrow morning. We've been hearing how passengers have been contending with today's disruption, and for one man coming home from Europe, it has been a long week of travelling. Tim Limbach, who has been on holidays with a group of 12 people, including his family, in Austria after flying via Munich last weekend. As with the UK, the roads in Germany have been really busy with lots of delays since schools broke up for the summer. Tim's trip was also affected by British Airways cancellations, and he had to rebook his initial flights through Salzburg to Munich, which meant it was a long drive to the resort he was staying in in Austria. The group are travelling home today, and Tim spoke to the BBC ahead of departing from Munich. ""It's really challenging, I've arrived at the airport and I have to go through security but I've been told it's been quite quick, and then through the non-EU passport queue, which is long,"" he said. He added that the children in the group are handling all the travel well and seem ""unflappable"" in the midst of the long drives and wait times. ""It's just us oldies who struggle a bit,"" he joked. Stephen Glover is travelling with family and friends from Stafford to London to watch England's women play in Sunday's Euro 2022 football final. He tells the BBC that all eight of them have had to cram into their van due to strike action affecting West Midlands Railway. ""The kids were looking forward to the rail journey,"" says Stephen. ""It's all part of the experience."" He's sceptical of the justification for the industrial action, saying it's not only rail workers who have faced hard times recently. Stephen says many owners of small businesses like himself are trying to recover from Covid, but have been ""hit by all these days of strikes. ""I just think itâs not
fair for all these businesses that have been hammered, to be hammered again,"" he adds. Arthur Scargill, the former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, is showing his solidarity with striking train drivers today on the picket line. His first major strike took place in 1972 when he led an initial group of 400 Yorkshire miners on apicket of the Saltley Gate coal depotin Birmingham. The 84-year-old, who led the NUM for two decades, was seen joining Aslef members outside Doncaster station in Yorkshire to show his support for their walk out today. Scargill also appeared on the picket line, this time in Sheffield, alongside striking rail workers last month during three days of industrial action as part of the ongoing dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.

Grant Shapps Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, has hit out at the transport secretary while speaking to the media from the picket line about today's industrial action. Whelan accused Grant Shapps of lying about the ongoing negotiations between unions and rail companies and hit back at the transport secretary for saying Aslef was ""dragging its feet in negotiations"". The union boss told Times Radio: ""I would like Mr Shapps to get us out of this catch-22 situation that he misrepresents at every opportunity."" Now the Department of Transport has responded to Whelan's comments, saying it was ""extremely misleading"" to suggest Shapps should get involved in the negotiations. A spokesperson said: ""The union knows full well that negotiations over pay and working practices don't happen with the government, they happen with the employers of the people they represent. We once again urge union representatives to get back round the negotiating table."" Today's strike is not the last one set to disrupt summer plans for travellers across the country - three more are planned forSaturday 13, Thursday 18 and Saturday 20 August. Aslef train drivers at nine rail companies will carry out industrial action on August 13, while Network Rail, as well as 14 other operators, will walk out on 18 and 20 August. In addition, London Undeground staff will strike on19 August. Rail passengers are being hit with fresh disruption today due to a strike by around 5,000 train drivers. Members of the Aslef union have taken to the picket line across Britain in a dispute over pay, affecting services run by seven operators. Passengers check the boards at London's King's Cross Station Aslef boss Mick Whelan (centre) joins the picket line outside London's Paddington station Southeastern trains in sidings near Ashford railway station in Kent Sam Tarry, the former shadow transport minister joins the picket line outside Paddington Hitachi Rail workers are to strike for three days from tomorrow in a row over pay and conditions. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) whose jobs include maintenance, are in dispute over pay and issues including breaks, leave entitlement and shift length. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said members ""know the value of their work and will not be short changed by Hitachi Rail"". ""I congratulate our members on this strong industrial response and RMT will support further stoppages until they receive a just settlement,"" he said. It is estimated that Hitachi Rail employs around 3,000 staff in the UK, including 700 at its Newton Aycliffe factory in Durham. Trevor Bartlett, the leader of Dover City Council, told the BBC that although traffic in Dover has cleared up following last week's congestion, the problem isn't going to go away and is indeed ""going to get worse with the introduction of the biometric passport checks"". These might ""require every passenger to get out of their car, coach and lorry."" The new measures, which should come into force next year, will likely have ""a devastating impact on all the residents and businesses across Kent,"" says Bartlett. Bartlett said he felt ""dismay, desperation and anger"" during last week's gridlock. ""Dover deserves better."" Ongoing disruption to rail services has meant many people around the country have seen their travel plans upended. While lots have been forced to cancel plans, some have been determined to make their journey come what may. Mike Simpson had been looking forward to seeing blues and rock band George Thorogood and the Destroyers at Nottingham's Royal Concert Hall on Wednesday night. On discovering that his train from his hometown Leicester to Nottingham was cancelled, the 54-year-old refused to be defeated - and decided to cycle the 33-mile journey instead. ""I got the exercise and fun of a big electric bike ride and managed to see the gig so it was a win-win,"" says Mike. By train, the journey would have taken him around half an hour. Instead the journey, door to door, took five hours each way. Read morehere. Traffic is expected to be busy at the Port of Dover over the weekend Away from the railways, traffic on Britain's main roads is expected to be heavy again today after holidaymakers were hit with congestion yesterday. The AA put its first ""amber traffic warning"" in place yesterday, and this also is in effect from 11:00 to 15:00 BST today. Major roads in south-east England were particularly affected yesterday due to a combination of the first switchover days for holiday lets during the school summer holidays in England and Wales. The Commonwealth Games, the start of the Football League season in England, and the rail strike are also contributing to issues on the roads. The AA says there is a high chance of traffic jams and delays across the country this weekend, with these expected to be worse in: David Sidebottom, the director of travel watchdog Transport Focus, has told the BBC that passengers want the unions and trade operators to ""sort out"" the ongoing disruption, noting that there's another strike planned for next weekend and more to come in August. Sidebottom warns that, if industrial action persists, people might eventually stop thinking of trains as a reliable way to get around, particularly for leisure journeys. ""That will be the legacy of these strikes: people will find alternatives"" and turn to cars, planes or other means to get to their destinations. ""In the long term, that is going to damage the railways,"" he says. Mark and Fiona are a couple from Winchester who are due to travel to a wedding today. ""This will seriously affect our plans for travelling to a wedding in Kent. Now we have no choice but to drive, and there will be so much traffic,"" Fiona told the BBC. ""It's causing me a lot of anxiety and unnecessary stress,"" she added. Her husband Mark said that three people due to sit on their table at the wedding cannot come as there are no trains for them - and they do not drive. ""These are the groom's work colleagues. It's really sad and makes me angry,"" said Mark. ""It's unfair that the wedding plans are being spoiled at the last minute."" Simon JonesReporting from Folkestone station in Kent No trains from Southeastern, which is a rail company that operates services in within Kent, are running at all today. Normally on a Saturday morning, this station would be really busy with people coming here as a tourist destination, but today it is eerily quiet. There have been people arriving at the station not actually aware that there's a strike on, they hadn't seen advance notification of it even though there have been posters around the station, there has been a lot of talk about it in the media. We spoke to one man who had just completed a 12-hour night shift as a care worker. ""It's a bit annoying, the next bus for me is in an hour, and then it's going to be another hour and a half,"" he said. ""I haven't slept a wink, I worked eight to eight, so I don't even know where I'm going to go right now."" We also heard from a woman who arrived here wanting to buy a ticket in advance for next week only to find the ticket office itself was shut too. ""It's just so random, we can't really make any plans or of we do, they don't really work out, like today,"" she said. Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, has given a wide-ranging interview with The Daily Telegraph today where he is warning what could happen if the industry is not modernised. Unions have been in dispute with rail companies and the government over pay, jobs and conditions amid plans, as the Department of Transport has termed it, to bring the industry into the 21st century. Hendytells the paper,externalthat ""you have to move with the times"", saying that he can't bear ""to be associated with an industry that becomes so out of date it becomes irrelevant"". He says that unless Britain's railway industry is modernised, it could enter a ""managed decline"" as it did 30 or 40 years ago, or else it could become obsolete in the same way as coal mines did. Hendy adds that he is confident a resolution with unions will eventually be reached, saying: ""A 100-year history shows that, however bad the dispute is, people do back to work."" Writing in today's Times newspaper, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, says that today's industrial action brings a ""whiff of the Seventies"" and accuses union leaders of ""holding a gun"" to the government's head in the form of repeated national strikes. ""The 'Two Micks', Lynch of the RMT and Whelan of Aslef, are taking the taxpayer for a ride, but not in the way they are meant to, writes Shapps, accusing the unions of not being interested in discussing reforming working practices. Yet, ""despite the stonewalling, changes will be introduced regardless,"" Shapps says. The reforms he lists include freeing up ticket-office staff to help passengers on platforms instead of having them ""twiddling their thumbs"" in ticket offices, as well as replacing maintenance staff working on tracks - ""a potentially fatal practice"" - with hi-tech cameras and drones. ""If we don't reform our railway it will slowly die,"" Shapps says, adding: ""This is not brinkmanship. We have to grip this situation and force it through necessary change. Mick Lynch can take pot shots at me as much as he likes. It doesn't change the facts."" ""I'm not going to cave in,"" Shapps writes. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Blood scandal victims need quick payouts - lawyerA lawyer representing some claimants says they should receive compensation ""immediately"".","Three former health secretaries have called on the government to urgently pay compensation to victims of the contaminated blood scandal. The chairman of the public inquiry into the scandal, Sir Brian Langstaff,has recommendedthat each victim should receive a provisional sum of Â£100,000. One woman who developed hepatitis C from infected blood told the BBC the news was ""incredibly significant"". The government has said it will urgently consider any recommendations. Former health secretaries Andy Burnham, Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock told the BBC it was important to act quickly because the life expectancy of many victims had been shortened by infections they had contracted.

The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Explained: Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Pay-outs ignore some families - victim's son Thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s afterbeing given a new treatment called factor VIII or IX. More than 2,400 have died as a result, and it has been estimated that one person affected by the scandal dies every four days. At the time, the medication was imported from the US where it was made from the pooled blood plasma of thousands of paid donors, including some in high-risk groups, such as prisoners. If a single donor was infected with a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis or HIV, then the whole batch of medication could be contaminated.

He added that governments had not ""been truthful about this matter because of the fear about the financial exposure"". Mr Burnham claimed that successive health ministers - including himself - had been misled by officials, adding there ""may be a case for corporate manslaughter"". Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, another former health secretary who now chairs the health select committee, said the issue must not be ""kicked into the long grass"". Like Mr Burnham, he acknowledged failings of previous governments in their support for victims of the scandal. Giving evidence to the inquiry in 2021, then health secretary Matt Hancock said ""of course"" compensation would be paid to victims and their families if the public inquiry formally called for it. On Saturday, Mr Hancock told the BBC he was confident the government would deliver pay-outs to victims and that it was its ""moral duty"" to do so. Mr Hancock went on to say that compensation had not been paid yet because ""in government, when a recommendation comes in like this, you do need to then check with each department"". Ros Cooper welcomed the judge's recommendation of compensation Ros Cooper, who was infected with hepatitis C after being given blood-clotting products as a baby, welcomed the recommendation of interim compensation. Ms Cooper called the judge's words ""incredibly significant"", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her disease had been ""the controlling factor"" in her life. Currently, victims and families get an annual financial support payment but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Sir Brian Langstaff said on Friday that more than 4,000 individuals who currently qualify for the government's existing offering of financial support - including some bereaved partners of those killed - should now receive the pay-outs. Jason Evans, whose father died in 1993 after contracting HIV and hepatitis C from infected blood, said he was concerned he would need to continue to campaign to get pay-outs ""over the line"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he described the ""terrible"" stigma his family had faced during his father's illness. He said his mother lost her job at a bakery because the manager thought customers would worry about being served by someone whose husband might develop Aids. Mr Evans, who was four when his father died, was also bullied at school as a result of his father's infection. Jason Evans said his family had faced stigma after his father contracted HIV and hepatitis C Mr Evans criticised shortcomings in the existing government support scheme for victims, saying this hadcreated a ""situation where some victims' lives matter and others' don't"". He said some bereaved family members would be ineligible to receive support under Sir Brian's recommendation - for example, if a victim's relationship had broken down, meaning that their ex-spouse had no longer been living with the victim at the time they died. Over the years, the government has put in place a number of schemes offering victims financial support without any admission of liability but, unlike in the Republic of Ireland and some other countries, compensation has never been paid to individuals or families affected. Compensation would be intended to fund immediate bills and care needs, with final recommendations on compensation for a wider group of people expected when the inquiry concludes next year. An independent study commissioned by the government,published last month,external, said victims should eventually be compensated for physical and social injury, the stigma of the disease, the impact on family and work life, and the cost of care. Partners, children, siblings and parents of those who have been infected should be eligible for payments too, the study recommended. If the inquiry and then the government accept those proposals then it is possible a final bill could be more than a billion pounds. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise how important this will be for people infected and affected across the UK, and can confirm that the government will consider Sir Brian's report and the recommendations of Sir Robert Francis QC with the utmost urgency, and will respond as soon as possible.""

Blood scandal victims need quick payouts - lawyer,"Three former health secretaries have called on the government to urgently pay compensation to victims of the contaminated blood scandal. The chairman of the public inquiry into the scandal, Sir Brian Langstaff,has recommendedthat each victim should receive a provisional sum of Â£100,000. One woman who developed hepatitis C from infected blood told the BBC the news was ""incredibly significant"". The government has said it will urgently consider any recommendations. Former health secretaries Andy Burnham, Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock told the BBC it was important to act quickly because the life expectancy of many victims had been shortened by infections they had contracted. A lawyer representing about 15,000 claimants also argued that victims should receive compensation ""immediately"".

UK troops in Finland exercise amid Russia threats,"About 150 British troops have joined Finnish and US forces for a ""high-readiness exercise"" in Finland. The four-day exercise involved 750 troops from the three nations, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. It comes just weeks after Nato signed an accession protocol with Finland to join the military alliance, beginning the process for membership. Finland and Sweden, which have held neutral status for years, applied to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine. The Kremlin has strongly opposed Finland and Sweden joining Nato and has issued threats over their plans to do so. Finland shares a 830-mile (1,340km) border with Russia. British troops based in Estonia were flown to Finland in Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters as part of the exercise, according to the MoD. The British personnel had been in Estonia as part of the British Arm's Project Unified Stance, which sees troopstake on a series of exercises,externalacross Europe in coordination with Nato and allies. Wing Commander Stephen Boyle, the UK defence attachÃ© in Helsinki, said: ""Our soldiers, sailors and aviators have received a warm welcome in Finland over the last few months. ""Exercise Vigilant Fox is the latest activity in an ongoing series of events across the domains. ""As Finland moves towards full Nato Membership, we will continue to seek opportunities like this to show solidarity with Finland, learn from each other and improve our ability to operate together."" In-depth: Sweden and Finland - from neutral to Nato Explained: What is Nato and how is it changing? Defence Minister James Heappey said the training, called Exercise Vigilant Fox, ""demonstrated the strength and interoperability of our armed forces with our US and Finnish allies"". He added that it reaffirms the UK's commitment to the defence and security of the Baltic Sea region. This latest exercise comes just days after the MoD revealed that six Royal Air Force fighter jetsflew to Finland and Sweden for joint training exercises.

When are the train strikes?,"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?
