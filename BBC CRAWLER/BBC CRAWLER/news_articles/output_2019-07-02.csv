"Nike loses aid as 'racist trainer' row intensifiesArizona pulls factory grant after the firm's ""unpatriotic"" withdrawal of allegedly racist trainer.","Arizona has pulled a $1m grant to help Nike build a new factory in a dispute over the firm's withdrawal of a trainer allegedly featuring racist symbolism. The state's governor had condemned Nike's decision, which was prompted by complaints about its use of an old US flag embraced by white nationalists. Nike-sponsored sportsman Colin Kaepernick had criticised the trainers, now selling on websites for $1,500. But governor Doug Ducey said Nike had bowed to political correctness. The special edition Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July trainer features the Betsy Ross flag. With a circle of 13 stars representing the first US colonies, the flag was created during the American Revolution. Although opinion is divided over its origins, the flag was later adopted for use by the American Nazi Party. Nike said it withdrew the trainers ""based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday"". On Tuesday the trainers were selling for well over $1,500 on StockX, the online marketplace for trainers. Colin Kaepernick was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for six years Earlier, Mr Kaepernick, a former NFL star,reportedly told Nike that he found the flag offensive,externalbecause of its connection to the era of slavery. Other critics also raised concerns with Nike. Last year, he became the face of Nike's advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" slogan. The former American football quarterback had previously sparked a furore by kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest against police violence against African-Americans. Mr Kaepernick was joined by other players, but their actions caused fury among some Republicans. US President Donald Trump said the players had shown ""disrespect"" to the US flag, adding that they should be sacked. The Betsy Ross flag was used by the American Nazi Party as a symbol, here seen at a German American Bund rally in Madison Square Garden in 1939 Doug Ducey, the Republican governor of Arizona,said in a series of tweets:,external""Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike. ""Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation's independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism,"" he said. Later, the governor's office confirmed that the $1m from the Arizona Commerce Authority' Competes Fund had been withdrawn. The fund is designed to attract, expand or retain businesses to the state. The factory was expected to generate about 500 jobs. Nike said in a statement it remained committed to making ""a significant investment in an additional manufacturing centre which will create 500 new jobs"". It did not mention the Arizona plant by name. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Georgia Lord, the mayor of the city of Goodyear in Arizona where Nike is building the new factory, said the city ""had found itself in the middle of a difficult situation"". She said the Goodyear City Council had recently ""unanimously approved a job creation agreement with Nike"". ""This deal is expected to bring more than 500 jobs and a significant investment to the city. We will honor the commitment we made in our agreement,"" she added. Texas Senator Ted Cruz also dismissed Nike's move as unpatriotic, writing on Twitter that the shoe giant ""only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag"". Other Twitter users called for a boycott of Nike products over the move. However, Nike also received widespread support, with Twitter users pointing out that the flag had been used by white nationalists. Matt Powell, senior industry adviser at the research and consultancy group NPD, said Nike would probably find support among its core consumers.

TikTok's young fans 'exploited' for digital gifts,"This video can not be played WATCH: Fans are accusing TikTok creators of exploiting them for cash Video-sharing app TikTok says it is ""sorry"" that some children and other young people have felt pressured into sending money to their favourite influencers on the app. TikTok lets fans send their favourite videomakers ""digital gifts"", which can cost up to Â£48.99. A BBC investigation found influencers promising to share their phone numbers with fans in exchange for the gifts. TikTok said it would strengthen its policies and guidelines but did not explain exactly how. Claire (not her real name) told BBC News she regretted spending Â£100 to obtain her favourite TikTok star's phone number - and he had never answered his phone. Claire, 12, who lives in the north-west of England, sent TikTok star Sebastian Moy a Â£48.99 ""drama queen"" gift to show her appreciation for his videos. Sebastian Moy has 3.8 million fans on TikTok And when he had asked for another one in exchange for his personal phone number, she said she was swept up in the moment. The US-based video-maker has 3.8 million fans on TikTok and has not broken any of the app's rules. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. TikTok is the fastest-growing social media app, with about 500 million regular users, although the company doesn't disclose its userbase. It's estimated to have been downloaded more than a billion times on app stores. The app lets people post 15-second videos. It is known for clips of teenagers lip-syncing and dancing to the latest trending music. The ""drama queen"" gift The company says it is most popular with 16- to 24-year-olds but there is evidence that many users are under 13, which is against the app's rules. The firm has alreadybeen fined $5.7m (Â£4.5m) by a US regulator after being accused of collecting under-13s' personal detailswithout their parents' consent. And on Tuesday, the UK's Information Commissioner revealed she had also launched an inquiry into whether the app was doing enough to safeguard its youngest users. ""We do have an active investigation into TikTok right now, so you can watch that space,"" said Elizabeth Denham. Videomakers with more than 1,000 followers are allowed to broadcast live on the platform. It is during these live streams that fans can send digital gifts to show their appreciation. Gifts appear as on-screen animations and cost between 5p and Â£48.99. The app's biggest stars can earn thousands of pounds in one live stream. TikTok declined to say how much of that money it kept - but several influencers told the BBC they took home 50% of all gift revenue earned. Over 10 weeks, the BBC monitored dozens of live streams in which the app's stars asked fans for gifts. In exchange, they promised shoutouts on their live streams, said they would follow back fans on social media or offered to make ""duets"", which allow users to collaborate with TikTok stars in a split-screen video. This video can not be played WATCH: What is TikTok? One creator promised to talk to a fan on Instagram ""for a week"" and was given three gifts worth a total of Â£147. Some creators routinely offered personal messaging details and phone numbers in exchange for gifts. The BBC also found a group who scoured the app for people giving gifts and then contacted them directly asking for money in exchange for ""likes"" and ""follows"". Stephanie Barbour, from Toronto, found her 11-year-old daughter had run up a bill for $400 (Â£240). ""I was shocked when I found out what the money was spent on,"" she said. ""I said to my daughter, 'So you don't actually get anything for it?' and she said, 'No.' ""Adults should know better. And even other teenagers should know better - that you do not ask children for money."" Another TikTok fan, Kelly, told the BBC she had spent Â£500-Â£600 of her own money on digital gifts. She no longer sends them because she feels she was exploited. ""I understand people need to make money these days off social media but I just think it's force-fed down young people's throats that they need to pay money to get attention or feel appreciated,"" Kelly said. Rhys, 20 said he had spent more than Â£1,000 without realising it. ""Gifting on TikTok is a little bit like gambling,"" he said ""It gets addictive. I really didn't see anything wrong with it at the time but now I don't think it's worth it. ""I have nothing to show for it. It was my personal choice but I do think there should be some sort of age restriction or timeout function."" The BBC contacted several of the TikTok stars seen using such techniques but most of them did not reply. The Neffati brothers The Neffati brothers have amassed 2.5 million followers in just six months on the platform. The 25-year-old Polish twins who live in Blackburn, Lancashire, are famous for their dancing and comedy sketches. They offer to follow back fans in exchange for a ""drama queen"" gift, worth Â£49 and promise to write fans' names on their heads if they send multiple gifts. They told the BBC that they had only started offering perks in exchange for gifts because they had been receiving them regularly. They said they were simply following the lead of other creators on the platform and that most of the fans that sent gifts were about 30 years old. But they said they did feel guilty when they received gifts from young fans. ""We don't like it when our gifters are young, so basically we ask them if their parents know about it,"" they said. ""But we can't stop them. We can't stop it. We are going live not only for the money but we are going on the live to get more audience."" Rhia, from south Wales, and has 2.5 million fans thanks to her creative video-editing skills. Rhia posts creative videos She said her average fan was about 10 to 14 years old and they were always happy with the perks she offered in exchange for gifts. But she also feels uncomfortable when she receives several gifts from very young followers. And she would like to see stricter age limits on gifting. ""It would give us peace of mind as creators,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make you feel more ethical because taking money from children is not a good way to earn a living really."" Livestream gifting originated in China - where TikTok's owner Bytedance is based. The practice is far more popular there. Professional ""cam girls"" earn huge amounts from their audiences. In the West, tipping has become more common especially on gaming platforms such as Twitch. However, the rapid rise of TikTok is testing the business model like never before. TikTok declined to answer specific questions but told the BBC it was investigating digital gifting. In a statement, it said: ""We do not tolerate behaviours that are deceptive in nature and we are sorry to hear some of the users' experiences. ""We recognise there is always room for improvements in terms of making guidelines and information more accessible, clear and easy-to-understand for all users. ""We value your feedback and will further strengthen our policies and product features."" The company gave no details on what policies or community guidelines it would change. Alessandro Bogliari, from the Influencer Marketing Factory, said there was wider pressure on TikTok to make changes. ""These sorts of stories are not good for a social network that is becoming popular with brands and marketers,"" he said. ""The app has major potential but there is clearly work to do to improve things. ""I think more parental-control features would be a good idea and some sort of cap on the amount users can gift per day or per livestream. ""They could also make the guidelines more clear and ban the use of certain terms that 'hard sell' to users."" Video app TikTok fails to remove online predators What is TikTok?

"Ball, Winkleman and Feltz among top BBC earners","Zoe Ball, Claudia Winkleman and Vanessa Feltz have all moved up the list Claudia Winkleman, Zoe Ball and Vanessa Feltz have all moved up the BBC's star salaries list after the corporation's efforts to tackle an equal pay problem. The top 12 earners were all male last year, but Winkleman is now eighth, Ball is ninth and Feltz is joint 10th. Match of the Day'sGary Linekeris still at the top of the list, on an unchanged Â£1.75m per year. The total talent bill has risen by Â£11m to Â£159m, with the number of stars earning over Â£150,000 up from 64 to 75. Of those 75 presenters and correspondents, 60% were men, down from 65% when the list was first published in 2017. The stars' salaries are published as part ofthe BBC's Annual Report,externaland covers the period from April 2018 to March 2019. BBC star salaries 2018-19: Who earned what? What else did we learn from the annual report? However, as usual the list is not a fair or complete reflection of what all celebrities at the BBC earn. Actors and some entertainment presenters who work for the corporation's commercial arm BBC Studios are not included. As a result, the stars of some of the BBC's biggest programmes - like Top Gear and Doctor Who - are absent from the list. In the past 12 months,Chris Evanshas left for Virgin Radio, replaced by Zoe Ball. As a result, his figure reflects nine months of work on the Radio 2 breakfast show before leaving in December, and not his full annual salary. Similarly,Zoe Ball's figure only covers what she earned for hosting the breakfast show in the first three months of this year, plus her earnings for the Saturday-only Radio 2 show she hosted in the nine months prior to that. BBC director general Tony Hall said the budget for paying talent was now a smaller proportion of total programming costs than last year. Speaking about Lineker's pay, Lord Hall said the success of BBC Sport, which reaches 40% of the UK population, has ""much to do with Gary"", adding that he ""does an excellent job"". BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said he had ""seen no evidence we are paying anyone above the market rate"", adding: ""What I've seen suggests the opposite."" The figures show that some male stars includingJeremy Vine,John HumphrysandSteve Wrighthave taken significant pay cuts. Vine earned around Â£290,000 in 2018/19 - down approximately Â£150,000 on the previous year. Humphrys is now on the same level, a cut of about Â£110,000. Gary Lineker's pay has remained unchanged on Â£1.75m Wright has lost roughly Â£85,000;Stephen Nolanis down by around Â£75,000; andNicky Campbellis reduced by approximately Â£70,000. Nolan hosted a huge number of programmes for the BBC -around 350 editions in totalincluding shows for Radio Ulster and 5 Live.Vanessa Feltzpresentedmore than 400 editions of her shows across Radio 2 and BBC London. Of the biggest risers, Zoe Ball andSara Coxare both new entries on the list after landing the Radio 2 breakfast and drivetime shows respectively. Other new entries include former footballerJermaine Jenason Â£210,000, BBC Breakfast'sLouise Minchinon Â£205,000 and news presenterClive Myrieon Â£200,000. Of those who were also on the list last year, the biggest rises have gone toJo Whiley(up approx Â£100,000),Jason Mohammad(up approx Â£95,000),Justin Webb(up approx Â£85,000) andSarah Montague(up approx Â£80,000). Lauren LaverneandFiona Bruceboth saw their salaries rise by roughly Â£75,000, whileSophie Raworthwas up by around Â£60,000. Three major figures have left for the commercial sector in the course of the year - Chris Evans, Simon Mayo and Eddie Mair. The corporation's overall gender pay gap has fallen from 7.6% last year to 6.7% this time, BBC media editor Amol Rajan said. Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey, who leads a campaign group called BBC Women, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'd like to congratulate the three women who have made it into the top 10. ""That's 30% of the top 10. Of course it would be nice if it was 50, or maybe even more than that. Who knows, we might reach that state of nirvana at some point in my life."" Trevor Nelson and Greg James have started new shows on Radio 2 and Radio 1 She said she had sympathy with the viewers and listeners who felt the salaries were still too high. ""Perhaps it would have been better to cut more male salaries rather than to up some female salaries,"" she said. In a statement, BBC Women said: ""There has been some progress in the last two years, but many women at all levels of the BBC are locked into slow, inefficient and demoralising internal processes. ""New equal pay cases are still emerging and staff are yet to have confidence that pay inequality is in the past."" Lord Hall said the public supported the BBC to give high salaries to ""big stars"" because they were ""talented and entertaining"". In an article for The Huffington Post,,externalhe wrote: ""The BBC was rightly criticised for a lack of female representation when we first published details of our highest earning stars two years ago. ""But the reality is that on pay we have come a long way to becoming a fairer organisation since then."" Damian Collins, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ""It is welcome to see more women named on the high earners' list. However, this masks the wider issue of equal pay across all levels of the BBC workforce. ""The rising talent bill is concerning in light of plans to remove free TV licences from all but the poorest of those over 75. We'll be raising this with BBC executives when they appear before the committee later this month."" The cost of providing free licence fees to over-75s is Â£745 million. This used to be paid for by the government, but in 2015 it was announced the BBC would absorb the cost by 2020 as part of a licence fee settlement. Last month,the BBC announcedthat only low-income households where one person receives the pension credit benefit will continue to receive free TV licences. All other pensioners, around 3.7 million, will have to pay for a TV licence from June 2020. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

MPs 'staggered' by NHS fines 'complacency'Serious concerns are raised by MPs about penalty fines for vulnerable people going to the dentist.,"MPs on the public spending watchdog committee attacked the ""breathtaking complacency"" of a system of healthcare fines in England in which 1.7 million penalties were overturned as incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee was inquiring into a National Audit Office report showing confusion and errors in fines over eligibility for free dental treatment and prescription charges. Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, accepted that the system was ""problematic"" and promised significant changes. Before fines are issued, he said there would be a new stage in which people could put forward evidence showing they were entitled to free treatment. ""It gives people a clear opportunity to say that we've got it wrong before we get into the penalty charge notice process,"" Sir Chris told MPs. The British Dental Association described this as a ""huge victory for patients"". 'I was panicking when daughter fined after dental check-up' Dentists say fear of fines deterring poorer patients Go to the dentist and get fined Â£100 The BBC audience told us about getting fined at the dentist The cross-party committee repeatedly challenged the credibility of a system which has been accused of unfairly charging hundreds of thousands of people for fraudulent use of health services. The National Audit Office had shown that since 2014almost a third of the fines issued, worth Â£188m, were subsequently withdrawn. A series of BBC stories had highlighted concerns from families who believed they had been unfairly hit by penalty charges after getting dental treatment. Dentist Charlotte Waite has raised concerns about vulnerable people being wrongly fined Charlotte Waite of the British Dental Association said many of those getting caught up in the penalty fine process were ""vulnerable"" people, who might be brought to the dentist by carers or relatives. This might include people with dementia, learning difficulties or the very elderly, who either might have ticked the wrong exemption box or who were not able to supply the required information. ""We're very concerned about this hitting innocent patients,"" she told MPs. Even if the fines - often of about Â£100 - were levied in error, Ms Waite said many people might pay up. ""Appealing is stressful and difficult. How many people don't appeal? How many just pay the fine?"" she asked. Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris said the fining regime was effectively ""putting the frighteners on people"". Meg Hillier warned ""something has gone pretty badly wrong"" This was rejected by Brendan Brown of the NHS Business Services Authority, who described the process as taking people on a ""customer journey"". Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the committee, said it was very rare to have such unanimous levels of concern from MPs about what had been revealed. The Labour MP said that when so many people were contacting MPs over the fines, it showed ""something has gone pretty badly wrong"". Shabana Mahmood warned of ""breathtaking complacency"" Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown challenged representatives of the NHS and the Department of Health as to whether the ""vastly over-complicated"" penalty system was even ""fit for purpose"". The Conservative MP said there was a poor financial return from the fines, which involved ""chasing some of the poorest people in the land"". He questioned an ""easy read"" guide to eligibility for free treatment that stretched for 21 pages. Sir Chris told MPs: ""We're not trying to claim that the system is simple."" But Ms Morris said: ""My concern is that you're not doing anything about it."" Witnesses told MPs about the problems of patients either being unable to understand the rules of eligibility for free treatment or who had falsely been identified as fraudsters. Dan Scorer, of the mental health charity Mencap, told MPs it was a ""real problem"" causing a ""lot of confusion among people with learning disabilities and their families"".

Nike loses aid as 'racist trainer' row intensifies,"Arizona has pulled a $1m grant to help Nike build a new factory in a dispute over the firm's withdrawal of a trainer allegedly featuring racist symbolism. The state's governor had condemned Nike's decision, which was prompted by complaints about its use of an old US flag embraced by white nationalists. Nike-sponsored sportsman Colin Kaepernick had criticised the trainers, now selling on websites for $1,500. But governor Doug Ducey said Nike had bowed to political correctness. The special edition Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July trainer features the Betsy Ross flag. With a circle of 13 stars representing the first US colonies, the flag was created during the American Revolution. Although opinion is divided over its origins, the flag was later adopted for use by the American Nazi Party. Nike said it withdrew the trainers ""based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday"". On Tuesday the trainers were selling for well over $1,500 on StockX, the online marketplace for trainers. Colin Kaepernick was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for six years Earlier, Mr Kaepernick, a former NFL star,reportedly told Nike that he found the flag offensive,externalbecause of its connection to the era of slavery. Other critics also raised concerns with Nike. Last year, he became the face of Nike's advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" slogan. The former American football quarterback had previously sparked a furore by kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest against police violence against African-Americans. Mr Kaepernick was joined by other players, but their actions caused fury among some Republicans. US President Donald Trump said the players had shown ""disrespect"" to the US flag, adding that they should be sacked. The Betsy Ross flag was used by the American Nazi Party as a symbol, here seen at a German American Bund rally in Madison Square Garden in 1939 Doug Ducey, the Republican governor of Arizona,said in a series of tweets:,external""Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike. ""Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation's independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism,"" he said. Later, the governor's office confirmed that the $1m from the Arizona Commerce Authority' Competes Fund had been withdrawn. The fund is designed to attract, expand or retain businesses to the state. The factory was expected to generate about 500 jobs. Nike said in a statement it remained committed to making ""a significant investment in an additional manufacturing centre which will create 500 new jobs"". It did not mention the Arizona plant by name. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Georgia Lord, the mayor of the city of Goodyear in Arizona where Nike is building the new factory, said the city ""had found itself in the middle of a difficult situation"". She said the Goodyear City Council had recently ""unanimously approved a job creation agreement with Nike"". ""This deal is expected to bring more than 500 jobs and a significant investment to the city. We will honor the commitment we made in our agreement,"" she added. Texas Senator Ted Cruz also dismissed Nike's move as unpatriotic, writing on Twitter that the shoe giant ""only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag"". Other Twitter users called for a boycott of Nike products over the move. However, Nike also received widespread support, with Twitter users pointing out that the flag had been used by white nationalists. Matt Powell, senior industry adviser at the research and consultancy group NPD, said Nike would probably find support among its core consumers. ""I think it's important to understand who Nike's core demographic is here. They're really focused on teens and looking at the commentary on Twitter and so forth, I don't see a lot of teens coming out with a negative attitude here,"" he said. Mr Kaepernick has not played in the National Football League (NFL) since the 2016 season, and sued the organisation, arguing team owners deliberately froze him out because of his activism, later settling with the NFL. Betsy Ross was credited with sewing the first ""Stars and Stripes"" flag in 1776, although this version of events has been rejected by modern US scholars. Nike is not the only company to recently face a backlash over products labelled racially insensitive. In December, Prada pulled products accused of depicting blackface. And on Monday, reality TV star and businesswoman Kim Kardashian said she would rename her Kimono line after people in Japan said her use of the term was disrespectful.

MPs 'staggered' by NHS fines 'complacency',"MPs on the public spending watchdog committee attacked the ""breathtaking complacency"" of a system of healthcare fines in England in which 1.7 million penalties were overturned as incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee was inquiring into a National Audit Office report showing confusion and errors in fines over eligibility for free dental treatment and prescription charges. Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, accepted that the system was ""problematic"" and promised significant changes. Before fines are issued, he said there would be a new stage in which people could put forward evidence showing they were entitled to free treatment. ""It gives people a clear opportunity to say that we've got it wrong before we get into the penalty charge notice process,"" Sir Chris told MPs. The British Dental Association described this as a ""huge victory for patients"". 'I was panicking when daughter fined after dental check-up' Dentists say fear of fines deterring poorer patients Go to the dentist and get fined Â£100 The BBC audience told us about getting fined at the dentist The cross-party committee repeatedly challenged the credibility of a system which has been accused of unfairly charging hundreds of thousands of people for fraudulent use of health services. The National Audit Office had shown that since 2014almost a third of the fines issued, worth Â£188m, were subsequently withdrawn. A series of BBC stories had highlighted concerns from families who believed they had been unfairly hit by penalty charges after getting dental treatment. Dentist Charlotte Waite has raised concerns about vulnerable people being wrongly fined Charlotte Waite of the British Dental Association said many of those getting caught up in the penalty fine process were ""vulnerable"" people, who might be brought to the dentist by carers or relatives. This might include people with dementia, learning difficulties or the very elderly, who either might have ticked the wrong exemption box or who were not able to supply the required information. ""We're very concerned about this hitting innocent patients,"" she told MPs. Even if the fines - often of about Â£100 - were levied in error, Ms Waite said many people might pay up. ""Appealing is stressful and difficult. How many people don't appeal? How many just pay the fine?"" she asked. Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris said the fining regime was effectively ""putting the frighteners on people"". Meg Hillier warned ""something has gone pretty badly wrong"" This was rejected by Brendan Brown of the NHS Business Services Authority, who described the process as taking people on a ""customer journey"". Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the committee, said it was very rare to have such unanimous levels of concern from MPs about what had been revealed. The Labour MP said that when so many people were contacting MPs over the fines, it showed ""something has gone pretty badly wrong"". Shabana Mahmood warned of ""breathtaking complacency"" Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown challenged representatives of the NHS and the Department of Health as to whether the ""vastly over-complicated"" penalty system was even ""fit for purpose"". The Conservative MP said there was a poor financial return from the fines, which involved ""chasing some of the poorest people in the land"". He questioned an ""easy read"" guide to eligibility for free treatment that stretched for 21 pages. Sir Chris told MPs: ""We're not trying to claim that the system is simple."" But Ms Morris said: ""My concern is that you're not doing anything about it."" Witnesses told MPs about the problems of patients either being unable to understand the rules of eligibility for free treatment or who had falsely been identified as fraudsters. Dan Scorer, of the mental health charity Mencap, told MPs it was a ""real problem"" causing a ""lot of confusion among people with learning disabilities and their families"". Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asked whether the system was ""fit for purpose"" Laura Cockram of Parkinson's UK said that vulnerable patients were left ""shocked and anxious"" when they received penalty fines.

Who is Merkel ally Von der Leyen?,"Ursula von der Leyen is a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel ""For me, it's like coming home,"" said Ursula von der Leyen of her new job as president of the European Commission. Brussels born and bred, she is a former German defence minister, a long-term ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the first woman to head the EU's powerful executive. Mrs von der Leyen replaced Jean-Claude Juncker in the EU's top job on 1 December 2019 and part of her role is overseeing Brexit. She has warned that ending 2020 without a trade deal with the UK would be ""a cliff-edge situation"", which ""would clearly harm our interests"", but would ""impact more the UK than us"". ""We are not ready to put into question the integrity of our Single Market - the main safeguard for European prosperity and wealth,"" she said. This video can not be played EC President Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit will be ""new beginnings for old friends"" She was not the first choice for the EU's most powerful job. She was not especially popular in her previous role among Germany's armed forces, and only emerged from the shadows as a candidate for Commission chief when initial compromise deals collapsed. Eventually she was nominated by EU member states and then backed by the European Parliament, after a political stalemate over other contenders. Her responsibilities include proposing new EU laws, enforcing the bloc's rules and handling trade deals. Mrs von der Leyen has a reputation as a workaholic.Her decision to sleep in a bedsit adjoining her office at the Commission HQ,externalrather than making a home in Brussels has also raised eyebrows. She set out her values both before and after assuming office: Gender balance: Mrs von der Leyen, the first woman to serve as president, selected a team of 27 EU commissioners including 12 women at the top table. Climate change:Within days of taking office she promised a ""European Green Deal"",external, to set Europe on a path to ""climate neutrality"" - that is, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions - by 2050, and creating a transition fund for countries still dependent on fossil fuels. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Europe to be the first ""climate-neutral"" continent Brexit: She warned the UK that the timetable to conclude an agreement - by the end of 2020 - was ""extremely challenging"", adding that whatever happened, the EU would remain united and continue to benefit from its single market and customs union. Migration: She said she was committed to reforming the EU's asylum system, which member states have been struggling with for years, with a reinforced border guard. She spoke in favour of enlarging the eurozone and the EU's open-border Schengen area, and said the bloc should be ready to take in Western Balkan countries. Defence: While backing Nato as the ""cornerstone of our collective defence"", she said the EU should invest in joint defence capacities that would complement those of the Western alliance. The EU should ""become more assertive"" towards the United States, she said. Ursula von der Leyen was born in Brussels in 1958, and attended the European School - a multilingual elite school for the children of diplomats and EU bureaucrats. A few years later, in the 1970s, Boris Johnson attended the European School, as his father was an official in the then European Economic Community (EEC). Mrs von der Leyen's father Ernst Albrecht was a senior Commission official in Brussels in the 1950s, before entering German domestic politics - he was in the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), today led by Chancellor Merkel. He became premier of the state of Lower Saxony in 1976. He came from a privileged family of merchants. Her mother had a university doctorate and academic success was much encouraged,journalist Ben Judah has written,externalin a study of Ursula von der Leyen. With her parents and five siblings she moved to Germany aged 13. Family life was comfortable, on a farm near Hanover - Ursula came to love horse-riding - and the children performed in home plays and concerts, sometimes in front of politicians. Ursula (L) with her parents Ernst Albrecht and Heidi-Adele in April 1978 Later she studied economics at London's LSE and medicine in Hanover before going into politics. In London she went by the name Rose Ladson - at the time German politicians were being targeted by Red Army Faction leftist militants. Her family nickname had been RÃ¶schen - ""little rose"". She enjoyed partying and rock concerts. She told Germany's Die Zeit daily that ""London was for me then the epitome of modernity: freedom, the joy of life, trying everything"". Later in Germany she met Heiko von der Leyen, a doctor, at medical school and they got married in 1986. Fluent in English and French, she has been a member of the CDU since 2005. She said her father always told his children that when countries traded, they built friendships and did not shoot each other. Now 62, Mrs von der Leyen is the mother of seven children, highly unusual in a country where the average birth rate is 1.59 children per woman. Ursula von der Leyen with her children in October 2003 She is seen as a staunch integrationist, backing closer military co-operation in the EU and highlighting the ""potential Europe has to unify and to promote peace,external"". Her appointment as German defence minister in 2013 was unexpected and followed three months of coalition talks between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). As defence minister in the EU's most industrialised and populous country, she argued for Germany to boost its military involvement in Nato. Why is Germany beefing up military? German defence minister attacks own army However, her tenure in the defence post was not without incident. In recent years, a litany of stories have exposed inadequacies in Germany's armed forces, from inoperable submarines and aircraft to shortages of personnel. A report published in 2018 highlighted the shortfalls,saying they were ""dramatically"" hindering Germany's readiness for combat. It said that no submarines or large transport planes were available for deployment at the end of 2017. While her appointment was initially seen as a fresh start for a German ministry beset by problems, Mrs von der Leyen was questioned as part of an investigation into spending irregularities. Her defence department was accused of awarding questionable private contracts to consultants that were said to be worth millions of euros. She later admitted that a number of errors were made in allocating contracts and that new measures were being implemented to prevent it happening again. That period of her career has not gone away. In December 2019, German MPs accused the defence ministry of deliberately deleting key data from her office mobile phone in an attempt to obstruct their investigation.

Lagarde: The 'rock star' of finance,"Christine Lagarde is known as the ""rock star"" of international finance ""No, no, no no, no no,"" was what Christine Lagarde was reported to have said when asked last year if she was interested in running the European Central Bank (ECB). Yet just a few months later, she has been nominated as the institution's new president. Ms Lagarde - known as the ""rock star"" of international finance - said the new role was ""an honour"". Poised, chic and known for her straight talking,  she has become one of Europe's most influential ambassadors in the world of international finance. Until this weekend, the main contenders for the ECB job were male central bankers. But assuming the nomination is approved she will become the central bank's first ever female leader, responsible for the euro and the monetary policy of the eurozone. Ms Lagarde is legendary for her stamina ""First ever female"" is a tag that has followed Ms Lagarde throughout her career. The former lawyer was the first woman to chair global law firm Baker McKenzie, the first woman to  serve as a finance minister from any Group of Seven nation and then the first to lead the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Unsurprisingly she has long championed promoting women into powerful positions, saying it's the key to improving the world economy. ""As I have said many times, if it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers, the world might well look a lot different today,"" she said earlier this year. The silver-haired 63-year-old is legendary for her stamina. A former synchronised swimmer for the French national team, she is reported to exercise daily, even during meetings if necessary. In her current role, she has been praised for steering the Washington-based IMF through the aftermath of the financial crisis. Analysis by By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent Christine Lagarde's status as rock star of international finance is beyond doubt. She has a high profile as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, building on her experience as a cabinet minister in France. What she doesn't have is the technical expertise as a central banker. The previous presidents of the ECB did. All three had been governors of their own national central banks. Mario Draghi in particular presided over the bank at a time when it faced the eurozone financial crisis and a weak economic recovery. The response was both innovative and technical. Christine Lagarde would not be the first ever central banker to be in that position. But there could well be challenges. The eurozone is struggling with inflation that is persistently below its target. Getting it back up might require more innovation. Ms Lagarde would need to draw on the expertise of the ECB's technocrats. Her career has however had one significant negative, when she was investigated for abuse of authority during her time as French finance minister in 2007. In 2016, she was convicted in a French court for failing to challenge a â¬404m award to flamboyant French businessman Bernard Tapie in 2008 over the sale of sportswear brand Adidas. She did not serve a sentence. Bernard Tapie was ordered to pay back the â¬404m with interest Ms Lagarde has always defended her decision, saying it was ""the best solution at the time"". Her drive means Ms Lagarde's career has continued unaffected. It's a determination that she learnt at a young age after her father's death when she was 17. Her mother, widowed at just 38, bought Ms Lagarde and her three younger brothers up alone. ""My mother was a very strong character. I learnt a lot from her,""she told the Financial Times in an interview.,external Ms Lagarde knew how to ""impose calm"" a former colleague says Consistently ranked among the top 10 most powerful women globally, Ms Lagarde has helped to rebuild the IMF's credibility following Greece's 2010 bailout, which bent the fund's rules. She also presided over the IMF's biggest bailout, a $57bn deal for Argentina last year that many credited with arresting emerging market turbulence. Ms Lagarde has admitted before that she lacks economic experience, telling the Guardian in 2012: ""I've studied a bit of economics, but I'm not a super-duper economist."" Many don't believe this will hold her back. One former IMF official said her leadership of the fund meant she was ""exceptionally qualified"" to run the ECB. ""She knew how to impose calm without posing as morally superior,"" instead displaying ""a touch of humanity,"" said a former colleague. Mark Sobel, a former US Treasury official and chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, said Ms Lagarde has experience in monetary policy even though she is not an economist. ""She's been involved in all the monetary debate and it's not like they don't discuss monetary policy at the fund,"" he said. 1956: Born in Paris 1973: Wins scholarship to exclusive US school for a year, where she perfects her English 1981: After law school in Paris, joins international law firm Baker & McKenzie as an associate, becoming chair 18 years later 2005: Becomes France's trade minister in 2005 2007: Becomes France's finance minister, the first woman to hold this post not just in France but in any of the G8 major industrial countries 2011: Becomes head of the IMF 2019: Nominated to become president of the European Central Bank First woman nominated to lead EU Commission 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

First woman nominated to lead EU Commission,"Ursula von der Leyen was backed by Angela Merkel but there was resistance to her nomination within the German coalition EU leaders have put forward their nominations for the bloc's top jobs, with a woman for the first time proposed as European Commission chief. The surprise choice of German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen to replace Jean-Claude Juncker came after the main front-runners were rejected. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been nominated as the first woman to head the European Central Bank (ECB). The announcement follows days of difficult negotiations. Who is surprise EU choice Von der Leyen? In all, EU leaders were tasked with nominating five people for the top jobs. Belgian liberal Prime Minister Charles Michel is nominated to replace European Council President Donald Tusk while Spain's Josep Borrell is proposed as foreign policy chief. The fifth key role - president of the European Parliament - is to be chosen on Wednesday. Possible candidates include German centre-right MEP Manfred Weber and Bulgarian socialist Sergei Stanishev. Most of the roles must be ratified by the European Parliament. ""We have agreed the whole package before the first session of the European Parliament,""said Mr Tusk,external. He said Germany had abstained on Mrs von der Leyen's nomination over coalition issues but pointed out that Chancellor Angela Merkel herself had backed her. French President Emmanuel Macron said the nominations were ""the fruit of a deep Franco-German entente"". ""Von der Leyen is a very good candidate and a very good choice to head the European Commission,"" he told reporters, adding that Ms Lagarde's ""capacities and competences... totally qualified her"" for the ECB. This video can not be played Donald Tusk announces choices for top European Commission jobs Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the nomination of two women for key jobs sent a powerful message that the EU was leading the way towards gender equality. However, there were concerns that the European Parliament's own contest for the main job - the ""Spitzenkandidaten"" (lead candidate) process - had been cast aside. Neither the winner of that process, Manfred Weber of Germany, nor other frontrunners were selected by EU leaders. ""You have to compromise in politics,"" Mr Varadkar insisted, adding that the centre-right Mr Weber would most likely be given the shared presidency of the European Parliament along with a Socialist figure. There was also surprise that four of the main jobs had gone to Western Europeans, with no nominations from Eastern Europe. However, the eastern states are thought to have been strongly behind Mrs von der Leyen's nomination, having rejected a compromise involving Dutch Labour leader Frans Timmermans the night before. Ursula von der Leyen - if confirmed as new European Commission president - will not bring winds of change to Brussels. She's loyal to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a true Christian Democrat and a conservative Europhile. As for Brexit, remember, the European Commission negotiated on behalf of EU member states. Those negotiations ended when the UK government signed off on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement back in November. The only ones now with the legal power to change or add to the text are EU national leaders, not the commission. And what these days of indecision among national leaders over these top EU jobs have shown us is that while France and Germany are still powerful, they are not all-powerful in EU circles any more. Chancellor Merkel and President Macron were unable to impose on others the EU job allocation plan agreed between them at the G20.

The real Lionesses - your stories,"This video can not be played Highlights: Norway 0-3 England After England reached the Women's World Cup semi-finals, we asked you for your stories of meeting Lionesses players - and you did not let us down. Here is a selection of your tales. This video can not be played Houghton smashes in indirect free-kick to give England the lead I watchedSteph Houghtonplay up front for Sunderland when she was 14 as my flatmate also played for Sunderland at the same time. If my memory is correct, her dad used to give her money for every goal she scored. I bumped into her again a couple of years ago, she was as down to earth as she always was. I have followed football my whole life but the dedication, determination and humility of the women's game will always set the ladies apart. You can natter to a women's England international player about the passion and pride of representing their nation. Bring football home ladies. Cathy Foster, Newcastle-upon-Tyne I was working at a conference at St George's Park while the Lionesses were in residence. I happened to stumble across a couple of the players. One was Alex Scott, my daughter's favourite player. I asked her if I could have a selfie and the other player said: ""Do you want me to take the picture for you?"" The picture was duly taken, and I thanked the players. Later on in the day I discovered that the other player who had kindly taken the picture wasSteph Houghton!How embarrassing to have not been bothered to ask the England captain for a picture with her too! Sorry Steph! Come on the Lionesses! Steve Chamberlain, Loughborough This video can not be played White taps in after a wonderful move to give England a 2-0 lead Ellen Whitewas a pupil at The Grange, Aylesbury. I was her history teacher in Years 7 and 8. I recall her as a positive, keen and able student. She had immaculate handwriting, taking care over her work and I kept one of her exercise books for many years as an exemplar piece! She had a sporty group of friends and was, at that stage, playing for Arsenal juniors. I recall her as able, conscientious, polite, friendly and sporty, of course! She is now the same age as I was when I taught her! I can easily tell it's her; only she's bigger now! Ellen - we are proud of you! Kathy Castle, Bournemouth My daughter Amelia met withEllen Whitewhile she was a Birmingham City player. She took part in a coaching session and Ellen was watching on. She later spoke to her, told her she had talent and gave some really positive advice which only inspired her further. Four years on and my daughter now plays for Wolverhampton Wanderers and always speaks about that moment with Ellen when she gave her the belief that girls could play football too. Matt Lightfoot, Birmingham My sister Nicola was good friends withEllen Whitewhen they were at school. Ellen used to come to our house for dinner after school, and my sister would get annoyed because Ellen and I would end up playing football in the back garden while my sister sat there and watched! Ellen was probably seven or eight years old at the time. I'm four years older than her, but even at that age you could see how good she was - miles better than me! Paul Rogan, Aylesbury I remember going to watch my local team Aylesbury United at Buckingham Road. Pre-match entertainment was a kids' five-a-side and I saw there was a long-haired blonde girl playing. It was the first time I had seen a girl play football and thought stupidly ""this will be funny"". The girl in question wiped the floor with them all, scoring goals for fun and was by far the best player on the park. Turns out that girl wasEllen White. Ellen, Aylesbury is proud of you! Chris Williams, Aylesbury Karen Carney is one of England's most experienced players In 2009 my family went to the Women's European Championship in Finland for a 10-day holiday to support England. They faced Finland in the quarter-finals and we couldn't get tickets. I walked in to the England team hotel and left a note for the FA explaining our holiday and if they had any spare tickets. Later that evening I got a call saying we could possibly have two tickets but in fact they gave us four. England won and I think we were the only England fans who weren't family at the stadium. The FA invited us to dinner with the players and I remember the amazement on my girls' faces, as they sat withKaren Carney.The next day the FA offered us a lift on the coach back to Helsinki. They even offered us more tickets for the semi-final but we had to catch our flight in time for the girls to be back at school. We remain great fans of England and also saw them at Euro 2017 and went to Nice for the Japan game and try to get to as many home games as possible. A great group of women and amazing role models for today's generation. Robert Cogings, Derby Several years ago my girls' primary school football team were playing in a local schools tournament at St George's Park near to Burton. This team included several girls who had never played a competitive game in their lives. We were told that a couple of women from the Lionesses would be coming down for a five-minute photo shoot. This they duly did. One of the two wasKaren Carney. The tournament organisers emphasised how very important and very busy the two Lionesses were. Not only did the ladies make a little speech and let everybody have their pictures taken with them but they stayed with my girls for TWO hours! Two years later, same scenario, Karen Carney again and once more she stayed with them for another two hours, encouraging and supporting my seven to 11-year-olds as they began their footballing careers. She was humble, enthusiastic and charming. What a role model, what an inspiration and, in a world of over-hyped, over-paid athletes, what a genuine hero. I have been a fan of women's football and the England Lionesses since then. She has never disappointed me and could never disappoint me. Karen, because of what you did for my girls, you are my hero.

She was asked to write a reference for Keira to help get her into her preferred high school. In the letter, my mum said: ""Keira will play for England, I don't know at what sport, but she will play for England."" Turns out she was right! Mike Giverin, Rochdale This video can not be played England get off to the perfect start thanks to Jill Scott's third-minute goal At the 2017 Euros I was staying in the same hotel as the Lionesses. They thumped Scotland 6-0. When the England team returned to the hotel they found some very dejected Scottish supporters. The England players were all very gracious victors butJill Scottstood out among them - she spoke with the young Scotland supporters, posed for pics and even brought out the match ball for them to be photographed with. What a lovely young woman. I will always support the Lionesses now (unless they are playing Scotland, of course).

Within 24 hours, we received a personalised video message recorded byLeah Williamsonwishing my daughter a speedy recovery, reassuring her she'd soon be fine to play again; sharing a story of when she herself once broke her arm in a game. My daughter and  I were absolutely blown away by the kindness and thoughtfulness of the gesture, and for Leah telling her she would bounce back very soon.

Nike pulls trainer in racist symbolism row,"Arizona has pulled a $1m grant to help Nike build a new factory in a dispute over the firm's withdrawal of a trainer allegedly featuring racist symbolism. The state's governor had condemned Nike's decision, which was prompted by complaints about its use of an old US flag embraced by white nationalists. Nike-sponsored sportsman Colin Kaepernick had criticised the trainers, now selling on websites for $1,500. But governor Doug Ducey said Nike had bowed to political correctness. The special edition Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July trainer features the Betsy Ross flag. With a circle of 13 stars representing the first US colonies, the flag was created during the American Revolution. Although opinion is divided over its origins, the flag was later adopted for use by the American Nazi Party. Nike said it withdrew the trainers ""based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday"". On Tuesday the trainers were selling for well over $1,500 on StockX, the online marketplace for trainers. Colin Kaepernick was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for six years Earlier, Mr Kaepernick, a former NFL star,reportedly told Nike that he found the flag offensive,externalbecause of its connection to the era of slavery. Other critics also raised concerns with Nike. Last year, he became the face of Nike's advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" slogan. The former American football quarterback had previously sparked a furore by kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest against police violence against African-Americans. Mr Kaepernick was joined by other players, but their actions caused fury among some Republicans. US President Donald Trump said the players had shown ""disrespect"" to the US flag, adding that they should be sacked. The Betsy Ross flag was used by the American Nazi Party as a symbol, here seen at a German American Bund rally in Madison Square Garden in 1939 Doug Ducey, the Republican governor of Arizona,said in a series of tweets:,external""Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike. ""Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation's independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism,"" he said. Later, the governor's office confirmed that the $1m from the Arizona Commerce Authority' Competes Fund had been withdrawn. The fund is designed to attract, expand or retain businesses to the state. The factory was expected to generate about 500 jobs. Nike said in a statement it remained committed to making ""a significant investment in an additional manufacturing centre which will create 500 new jobs"". It did not mention the Arizona plant by name. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Georgia Lord, the mayor of the city of Goodyear in Arizona where Nike is building the new factory, said the city ""had found itself in the middle of a difficult situation"". She said the Goodyear City Council had recently ""unanimously approved a job creation agreement with Nike"". ""This deal is expected to bring more than 500 jobs and a significant investment to the city. We will honor the commitment we made in our agreement,"" she added. Texas Senator Ted Cruz also dismissed Nike's move as unpatriotic, writing on Twitter that the shoe giant ""only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag"". Other Twitter users called for a boycott of Nike products over the move. However, Nike also received widespread support, with Twitter users pointing out that the flag had been used by white nationalists. Matt Powell, senior industry adviser at the research and consultancy group NPD, said Nike would probably find support among its core consumers. ""I think it's important to understand who Nike's core demographic is here. They're really focused on teens and looking at the commentary on Twitter and so forth, I don't see a lot of teens coming out with a negative attitude here,"" he said. Mr Kaepernick has not played in the National Football League (NFL) since the 2016 season, and sued the organisation, arguing team owners deliberately froze him out because of his activism, later settling with the NFL. Betsy Ross was credited with sewing the first ""Stars and Stripes"" flag in 1776, although this version of events has been rejected by modern US scholars. Nike is not the only company to recently face a backlash over products labelled racially insensitive. In December, Prada pulled products accused of depicting blackface. And on Monday, reality TV star and businesswoman Kim Kardashian said she would rename her Kimono line after people in Japan said her use of the term was disrespectful.

First woman nominated to lead EU CommissionGerman Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen is picked for the top EU post after a marathon summit.,"Ursula von der Leyen was backed by Angela Merkel but there was resistance to her nomination within the German coalition EU leaders have put forward their nominations for the bloc's top jobs, with a woman for the first time proposed as European Commission chief. The surprise choice of German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen to replace Jean-Claude Juncker came after the main front-runners were rejected. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been nominated as the first woman to head the European Central Bank (ECB). The announcement follows days of difficult negotiations. Who is surprise EU choice Von der Leyen? In all, EU leaders were tasked with nominating five people for the top jobs. Belgian liberal Prime Minister Charles Michel is nominated to replace European Council President Donald Tusk while Spain's Josep Borrell is proposed as foreign policy chief. The fifth key role - president of the European Parliament - is to be chosen on Wednesday. Possible candidates include German centre-right MEP Manfred Weber and Bulgarian socialist Sergei Stanishev. Most of the roles must be ratified by the European Parliament. ""We have agreed the whole package before the first session of the European Parliament,""said Mr Tusk,external. He said Germany had abstained on Mrs von der Leyen's nomination over coalition issues but pointed out that Chancellor Angela Merkel herself had backed her. French President Emmanuel Macron said the nominations were ""the fruit of a deep Franco-German entente"". ""Von der Leyen is a very good candidate and a very good choice to head the European Commission,"" he told reporters, adding that Ms Lagarde's ""capacities and competences... totally qualified her"" for the ECB. This video can not be played Donald Tusk announces choices for top European Commission jobs Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the nomination of two women for key jobs sent a powerful message that the EU was leading the way towards gender equality. However, there were concerns that the European Parliament's own contest for the main job - the ""Spitzenkandidaten"" (lead candidate) process - had been cast aside. Neither the winner of that process, Manfred Weber of Germany, nor other frontrunners were selected by EU leaders. ""You have to compromise in politics,"" Mr Varadkar insisted, adding that the centre-right Mr Weber would most likely be given the shared presidency of the European Parliament along with a Socialist figure. There was also surprise that four of the main jobs had gone to Western Europeans, with no nominations from Eastern Europe. However, the eastern states are thought to have been strongly behind Mrs von der Leyen's nomination, having rejected a compromise involving Dutch Labour leader Frans Timmermans the night before. Ursula von der Leyen - if confirmed as new European Commission president - will not bring winds of change to Brussels. She's loyal to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a true Christian Democrat and a conservative Europhile. As for Brexit, remember, the European Commission negotiated on behalf of EU member states. Those negotiations ended when the UK government signed off on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement back in November. The only ones now with the legal power to change or add to the text are EU national leaders, not the commission. And what these days of indecision among national leaders over these top EU jobs have shown us is that while France and Germany are still powerful, they are not all-powerful in EU circles any more. Chancellor Merkel and President Macron were unable to impose on others the EU job allocation plan agreed between them at the G20. Something for the new UK prime minister to consider, perhaps, ahead of planning trips to Berlin and Paris to request a renegotiation of the Brexit deal.

BBC Annual Report: At a glance,"The BBC has published its annual report for 2018/2019 and while the pay for on-air talent is grabbing many of the headlines, it accounts for a fraction of the BBC's total spend. Here are some other key figures from the 286-page document. Overall, the number of people watching BBC television is falling across high and low income homes. BBC One has seen its audience shrink by 2% since last year and BBC Two by 3%. The biggest drop comes in audiences aged between 16-34 who watch BBC TV weekly, down from 60% to 56%. The same age group is also watching for a shorter period of time, down from an average of nearly three hours a week to two hours and 32 minutes. From a gender perspective, there has been a joint fall, by 2% of men and women who watch the BBC weekly. The same is said of BBC Radio where men and women over the age of 16 are listening to less radio and for shorter times, up to 30 minutes less than last year in most age groups. Radio 1's reach has dipped by less than one percent while Radio 2 remains unchanged. The BBC's online offering continue to perform well with 2% increases in usage by male and female audiences over the age of 18. There has been a 6% increase in online users from the C2DE demographic which includes working class and lower income households. It has been a bumper year for iPlayer with 3.6bn programme requests, the most popular being Bodyguard. Killing Eve's first series had 42.5 million overall requests. The BBC has seen the money from its annual licence fee drop by Â£140 million, from Â£3.83bn to Â£3.69bn - due partly to the government's phased reduction of funding for free TV licences for the over 75s, something which was imposed as part of the 2015 licence fee settlement In June, the BBCsaid it will no longer fund free licencesfor up to 3.7 million pensioners, with only low-income households where one person receives the pension credit benefit eligible. The announcement was attacked by the likes of Age UK, which set up a petition calling for the government to foot the bill. The BBC's chairman David Clementi said on Tuesday: ""The BBC has never paid for the concession, the government ended that funding, it was not the BBC,"" adding, ""any future concession would be paid for by those who already pay the licence fee"" which would mean cutting services. He said cutting talent salaries to pay for the concession would make no difference, saving around Â£20 million of the Â£745 million required to fund free licences. There is no question that audiences aged 55 and over are BBC television's most loyal consumers - with a staggering 92% reach in that age group, who watch nearly 13 hours of BBC TV a week, compared with the two and a half hours watched by 16-34 year olds. Of the licence fee's Â£12.54 cost per household per month, Â£6.92 goes on television, Â£2.17 on radio and Â£1.24 on the World Service. The BBC also saw a fall in income caused by the decline in the sale of consumer products, i.e. DVDs, to the tune of Â£33 million. Ball, Winkleman and Feltz among top BBC earners BBC star salaries 2018 - 19: Who earned what? When it comes to those earning above Â£150,000 a year, the BBC is operatingat a ratio of 60/40 in favour of men. Across the board, women make up 47.9% of the BBC's workforce and 43.8% of leadership roles. According to Lord Hall, the figures represent ""rapid and real change"". He said the gender pay gap is 3% or less at all pay grades, adding ""it's not the end of the process but the BBC is well ahead of other organisations"". Speaking to media editor Amol Rajan, Lord Hall said the BBC has resolved more than 90% of 32 pay disputes. ""It is inevitable that in any large organisation that you get people querying their pay but what we discovered as we look across 20,000 people we employ, we found 25 cases which were about equal pay and seven more we spotted and said we need to pay them more."" People from BAME backgrounds make up 15.3% of staff, people with disabilities 10.2% and people who identify as LGBT 10.8%. In February, the BBClaunched the digital channel BBC Scotlandwhich the corporation said was ""the BBC's biggest investment in Scotland for a generation"". Specialist programmes include Emeli Sande's Street Symphony, which follows the singer across Scotland as she picks a handful of buskers to put on a concert. As the service is less than six months old, there are no official figures as yet, though BBC DG Tony Hall said ""during its core hours of broadcast, from 7pm until midnight, it's the most watched digital channel in Scotland"". However, in June,it was reported that,externalon one particularly quiet day in May, the new channel had an average audience of only 7,200 people. A BBC spokesperson said at the time: ""It's not unusual for digital channels outside the main five to occasionally record zero audiences."" ""It really is finding new voices and a new dynamic in Scotland which I think is really impressive so I'm really proud of the channel,"" said Lord Hall on Tuesday. In Tuesday's annual report, the BBC shows a two percent drop in households watching television and a four percent drop in radio, where audiences are listening for over an hour less per week than they were in 2017/18. There was a similar drop of 4%, from 49% - 45% in households watching dedicated Scottish new services. In news bulletins and and documentary programming, the BBC has drawn attention to climate change and, via Blue Planet II, the scourge of plastic in the oceans. Since 2015/16, the BBC has reduced its carbon footprint by 78% but has yet to make an impact on its energy usage, which has a target of 10% by 2022. BBC canteens have ditched plastic cups, containers and cutlery, which has seen waste reduced by 25% with 50% of waste recycled. That is a drop from last year which the BBC has said it will ""take steps to address"". The BBC has also committed to no single-used plastic by 2022.

Nike pulls trainer 'after Kaepernick complaint',"Arizona has pulled a $1m grant to help Nike build a new factory in a dispute over the firm's withdrawal of a trainer allegedly featuring racist symbolism. The state's governor had condemned Nike's decision, which was prompted by complaints about its use of an old US flag embraced by white nationalists. Nike-sponsored sportsman Colin Kaepernick had criticised the trainers, now selling on websites for $1,500. But governor Doug Ducey said Nike had bowed to political correctness. The special edition Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July trainer features the Betsy Ross flag. With a circle of 13 stars representing the first US colonies, the flag was created during the American Revolution. Although opinion is divided over its origins, the flag was later adopted for use by the American Nazi Party. Nike said it withdrew the trainers ""based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday"". On Tuesday the trainers were selling for well over $1,500 on StockX, the online marketplace for trainers. Colin Kaepernick was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for six years Earlier, Mr Kaepernick, a former NFL star,reportedly told Nike that he found the flag offensive,externalbecause of its connection to the era of slavery. Other critics also raised concerns with Nike. Last year, he became the face of Nike's advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" slogan. The former American football quarterback had previously sparked a furore by kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest against police violence against African-Americans. Mr Kaepernick was joined by other players, but their actions caused fury among some Republicans. US President Donald Trump said the players had shown ""disrespect"" to the US flag, adding that they should be sacked. The Betsy Ross flag was used by the American Nazi Party as a symbol, here seen at a German American Bund rally in Madison Square Garden in 1939 Doug Ducey, the Republican governor of Arizona,said in a series of tweets:,external""Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike. ""Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation's independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism,"" he said. Later, the governor's office confirmed that the $1m from the Arizona Commerce Authority' Competes Fund had been withdrawn. The fund is designed to attract, expand or retain businesses to the state. The factory was expected to generate about 500 jobs. Nike said in a statement it remained committed to making ""a significant investment in an additional manufacturing centre which will create 500 new jobs"".

"Hammond vows to oppose 'Â£90bn no-deal hit'The chancellor says it would be up to MPs to ensure a no-deal Brexit ""doesn't happen"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Philip Hammond and John McDonnell agreed on the threat posed by no deal Chancellor Philip Hammond has signalled he would be prepared to vote against a no-deal Brexit in Parliament, claiming it could cost the UK up to Â£90bn. Leaving the EU without a legal agreement would be the ""wrong"" policy and cause a huge ""hit"" to the public finances, he told MPs. He said it was ""highly unlikely"" he would still be in his job after Theresa May stands down next month. But he said it would be up to MPs to ensure no-deal ""doesn't happen"". Shadow chancellor John McDonnell asked Mr Hammond at Treasury questions if he would join Labour in voting against no deal and opposing any attempt by a new prime minister to stop Parliament sitting in order to let a no-deal Brexit go ahead. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom Warehousing Associationhas told BBC Newsnight that UK warehouses are ""full"", raising doubts about the ability of UK firms to stockpile goods ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Is there a Brexit 'war chest'? What would no deal look like? Compare the leadership candidates Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two men vying to succeed Mrs May, have both said they would be willing to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. Mr Johnson has refused to rule out shutting down - proroguing - Parliament to push it through. In reply to Mr McDonnell, the chancellor said: ""I do agree with him, it would be wrong for a British government to pursue no deal as a policy and I believe it will be for the House of Commons, of which I will continue proudly to be a member, to ensure that doesn't happen."" In the event of no deal, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process and leave both the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to help trade between members by eliminating checks and tariffs (taxes on imports). Tariffs - taxes on imports - are likely to be applied to most UK goods exported to the continent, making them less competitive and increasing costs to businesses. UK exporters could also face non-tariff barriers, such as additional customs declarations, rules of origin checks and sanitary inspections Border checks could cause bottlenecks at British ports, such as Dover This could potentially lead to disruption to food and medical supplies, although the NHS and retailers have been stockpiling Prices of some food items could rise unlessthe UK chose to apply zero tariffs on EU food imports The services sector would lose its guaranteed access to the EU single market, affecting everything from banking and insurance to lawyers, musicians and chefs Mobile phone roaming charges could return -although some operators have already ruled this out The chancellor has been a long-term critic of a no-deal exit, making him something of a bogeyman among Brexiteers within his own party. In recent days,Mr Hammond has questioned both leadership candidates' promises of greater spending and tax cutsif they make it to Downing Street. He has insisted there is ""no pot of money"" sitting in the Treasury for extra spending or tax cuts and, in the event of a no-deal exit, all the Â£26bn ""headroom"" in the public finances would be absorbed by dealing with the economic upheaval. ""I have no doubt whatsoever that in a no deal exit we will need all of that money, and more, to respond to the immediate impacts of the disruption of a no deal exit,"" he told MPs. ""And that will mean there is no money available for either tax cuts or spending increases."" ""But let me go further - the government's analysis suggests that in a disruptive no-deal exit there will be a hit to the Exchequer of about Â£90bn. That will also have to be factored in to future spending and tax decisions."" Can Parliament stop no deal? The Treasury has previously said a no-deal exit could lead to a Â£80bn spike in borrowing. Speaking after Treasury questions, Mr McDonnell told reporters he felt the chancellor had been ""ferocious"" in his criticism of no deal and would be ""influential"" on the matter from the backbenches - if indeed that was where he found himself under a new Tory leader.

"Whirlpool says up to 800,000 faulty dryers existA fault in Whirlpool machines was blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period.Business","Whirlpool has admitted that there could be as many as 800,000 faulty tumble-dryers in homes around the UK. In June, the government said it would issue a recall notice of up to 500,000 dryers which pose a fire safety risk. But when pressed by MPs on the Business Committee, company executives admitted the number of unmodified machines could be higher. A fault in Whirlpool machines was blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, the government said. Whirlpool said it had logged 54 fires caused by a build-up of fluff in its tumble dryers in recent years, three of which were in machines that had been modified. Charlie Pugsley, deputy assistant commissioner at the London Fire Brigade, said his service had seen a wide range of faults causing fires in machines that had already been modified. The danger in our homes? Whirlpool told to recall dryers in 'unprecedented' government move 'Creativity needed' in Whirlpool fire-risk tumble dryer warnings Jemma Spurr was one customer whose modified dryer caught fire. She told the Business Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that despite repeated attempts to get in touch with Whirlpool directly, she had never received the report on the cause of her fire, or an apology from the company. Whirlpool executive Jeff Noel apologised to Ms Spurr during the hearing and said the company had modified every machine bought to its attention. Ms Spurr also claimed that Whirlpool asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) about the incident. She did sign it but has spoken out anyway. Whirlpool said non-disclosure agreements were standard industry practice during insurance settlements. By Colletta Smith, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Faulty dryers, months to wait for a fix, continued problems even after modifications, and a full product recall. It's a string of bad publicity for a company trying to brand itself as a provider of ""quality home appliances"". It isn't the first time that the company's corporate vice-president has had to defend his products to a parliamentary committee. Jeff Noel previously responded to safety concerns about the company's fridge-freezers which were blamed as the cause of the Grenfell fire. Customers are understandably frustrated, and the white goods market is particularly dependent on trust. Research by Deloitte suggests that people are more likely to read online reviews, and ask family and friends for recommendations of household appliances than any other purchase. The string of damaging news has put Whirlpool in a real spin, as it comes at the same time as increased competition from the likes of Samsung, Bosch, Siemens and Zanussi. The company also confirmed that, during the recall period, customers can either have their current dryers modified or get a brand new machine free of charge, including installation. In a statement, the Whirlpool Corporation told the BBC: ""The Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) recently concluded a comprehensive year-long review of the dryer programme which confirmed that the modification is effective in resolving the issue. ""Safety is always our number one priority and we remain committed to resolving all unmodified dryers affected by this issue. ""As we updated the committee, we are expanding our recall campaign to include further options to encourage remaining consumers to come forward and remedy their unmodified appliances. ""The crucial message to anyone who still owns an affected dryer and has not already had it modified by Whirlpool is to contact us immediately on 0800 151 0905, or visit https://safety.hotpoint.eu/, https://safety.indesit.eu/ or https://safety-swan.eu. ""As advised by OPSS, consumers whose tumble dryers have been modified can continue to use them safely and there is no need to contact Whirlpool at this time."" Sue Davies, strategic policy adviser at consumer group Which?, said: ""With Whirlpool admitting it has only managed to provide a modification or replacement for a tiny proportion of affected machines in the last two years, it's clear that the company is failing to do enough to keep customers safe. ""Now it has acknowledged that modified machines are still catching fire. ""If the safety of Whirlpool's fire-risk tumble dryers cannot be assured, secretary of state Greg Clark must step in and ensure that all potentially dangerous machines are immediately removed from people's homes.""

"Whirlpool says up to 800,000 faulty dryers exist","Whirlpool has admitted that there could be as many as 800,000 faulty tumble-dryers in homes around the UK. In June, the government said it would issue a recall notice of up to 500,000 dryers which pose a fire safety risk. But when pressed by MPs on the Business Committee, company executives admitted the number of unmodified machines could be higher. A fault in Whirlpool machines was blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, the government said. Whirlpool said it had logged 54 fires caused by a build-up of fluff in its tumble dryers in recent years, three of which were in machines that had been modified. Charlie Pugsley, deputy assistant commissioner at the London Fire Brigade, said his service had seen a wide range of faults causing fires in machines that had already been modified. The danger in our homes? Whirlpool told to recall dryers in 'unprecedented' government move 'Creativity needed' in Whirlpool fire-risk tumble dryer warnings Jemma Spurr was one customer whose modified dryer caught fire. She told the Business Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that despite repeated attempts to get in touch with Whirlpool directly, she had never received the report on the cause of her fire, or an apology from the company. Whirlpool executive Jeff Noel apologised to Ms Spurr during the hearing and said the company had modified every machine bought to its attention. Ms Spurr also claimed that Whirlpool asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) about the incident. She did sign it but has spoken out anyway. Whirlpool said non-disclosure agreements were standard industry practice during insurance settlements. By Colletta Smith, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Faulty dryers, months to wait for a fix, continued problems even after modifications, and a full product recall.

Scotch whisky targeted by new US tariffs,"Scotch whisky is among the products targeted by the US for a possible range of new tariffs on imported goods. The US has threatened to impose tariffs on European Union imports worth up to $4bn (Â£3.2bn), although it is not known when tariffs would be imposed. Whiskey from Ireland, cheeses including Parmesan and Gouda, pasta and olives are other items affected. The US Trade Representative said it was ""in response to harm caused by EU aircraft subsidies"". In April, theUS announced proposed tariffs on $11bn of EU goods. The moves are part of a 15-year dispute at the World Trade Organization between the US and EU over subsidies given to plane-makers Airbus, from Europe, and the US's Boeing. How can Boeing regain trust? Airbus secures multi-billion dollar jet order from China Can China's plane-maker take on Boeing and Airbus? The United States is the world's largest export market for Scotch whisky by value - Â£1.04bn in 2018. By volume, it is the second largest, with 137 million 70cl bottles exported last year. A spokesperson for the Scotch Whisky Association told the BBC: ""Exports of Scotch whisky to the US have been zero tariff for 20 years, so it is disappointing that Scotch whisky has been drawn into this dispute. ""The Scotch whisky industry has consistently opposed the imposition of tariffs, which harms economies on both sides of the Atlantic which depend on trade for their continued prosperity. ""There is a close relationship between the US whiskies and Scotch whisky, not least due to the use of bourbon casks for maturation which generates around Â£70m for the US economy each year. ""We continue to urge the UK government, the EU and the US government to resolve this situation."" Scotch whisky makes up 12% of the total whiskey market in the United States, with US whiskey accounting for 48%. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States warned that the move may harm both jobs and consumers in the country. ""We strongly oppose the inclusion of distilled products in the proposed retaliation list,"" said spokeswoman Lisa Hawkins. ""US companies - from farmers to suppliers to retailers - are already being negatively impacted by the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by key trading partners on certain US distilled spirits. ""These additional tariffs will only inflict further harm,"" she said. Can China's plane-maker take on Boeing and Airbus?

Secret 'border patrol Facebook group' investigated,"This video can not be played 'No woman should be locked up in a pen' US officials are investigating a secret Facebook group where border patrol members allegedly posted racist and sexist jokes about migrants and others. The private group had about 9,500 members, including former and current border patrol agents,ProPublica reported,external. Some posts mocked migrant deaths, while others targeted Latino members of Congress, ProPublica said. The Border Patrol chief has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"". ""Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable,"" Carla Provost said. 'I left without telling my mum' The agony over an American dream The group was called ""I'm 10-15"", ProPublica said - 10-15 being Border Patrol code for ""aliens in custody"". According to ProPublica, members of the group mocked Latino members of Congress who visited migrant detention centres in Texas on Monday. Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Veronica Escobar were among those said to have been called ""hoes"" and ""scum buckets"" in the private postings. In one post, a member reportedly suggested throwing burritos at them, while another shared a doctored image depicting Ms Ocasio-Cortez performing a sex act on President Donald Trump. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were heckled as they visited detention facilities The BBC was not able to independently verify the existence of the private group, which is not publicly accessible on Facebook. Matthew Klein, an assistant commissioner at the CBP, said the Department of Homeland Security had launched a code-of-conduct investigation into the group. He said a number of CBP agents may be members of the group. Ms Ocasio-Cortez said the posts did not surprise her, and that they were ""indicative"" of what she had seen while visiting the migrant detention centre on Monday. ""I see why CBP officers were being so physically and sexually threatening towards me,"" she tweeted after the trip. On Twitter, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said that border patrol officers had told women in cells to ""drink out of the toilets"". She added that during the visit, she ""forced"" herself into a cramped cell where the women inside ""described their treatment at the hands of officers as 'psychological warfare'"".

Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he was introducing a plan to ""virtually eliminate migrant detention"". He called the facilities ""for-profit prison that should not exist"", and said that as president, he would improve the facilities and close any that do not meet his standard. Since taking office in 2017, President Trump had adopted tougher policies in an attempt to reduce the number of undocumented migrants. But officials say his administration's crackdown, and the recent increase in Central American migrant arrivals, has led to a strain on enforcement resources.

Last month a US Justice Department lawyer disputed in court whether detained migrant children are entitled to toothbrushes and soap. In February, Mr Trump declared an emergency on the country's southern border, saying it was necessary to tackle what he said was a crisis there.

Travel money firms focus in gangs crackdown,"Bureaux de change and currency transfer businesses are to be raided by police in a week-long crackdown on suspected drugs money laundering. They hope targeting the cash will reduce street violence linked to disputes between gangs by disrupting their activities. Police say 12 businesses in London will be raided on Tuesday - the first day of the operation Inspectors will visit another 39 to check they are complying with the law. Number of middle-aged 'money mules' rising Teens 'paid money to stab other youths' Drugs violence 'at unprecedented level' There are around 9,000 money exchanges in London, handling tens of billions of pounds each year between them - about a fifth of the UK market. Detectives say the vast majority of these companies operate legitimately, but a ""significant number"" - which they call ""launderettes"" - are involved in illegal activity. This can include receiving bags or holdalls full of cash from drug deals and processing it to make it look as though it has come from a legitimate source. About Â£100bn is laundered through the UK every year, but it is not known much of this goes through money service businesses. The crackdown is a joint operation between the Metropolitan Police, HM Revenue & Customs and financial services watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Most of the debate about ways to curb knife crime has revolved around short-term measures, includingstop-and-search, and long-term solutions, such as the 'public health' modelpioneered in Glasgow. But with much of the violence believed to be linked to drug disputes over territory and unpaid debts, police are stepping up their efforts on that front too. Drug gangs exist to make money, the argument goes, so impeding the flow of their ill-gotten gains will disrupt their activities and reduce the violence. The ""launderettes"" - the illegal money transfer businesses that conceal and process the drugs money - are a key target in the anti-violence campaign. Det Ch Supt Mick Gallagher, who is co-ordinating the operation, said: ""Money drives drug dealing, drives violence."" He added: ""The cash is the lifeblood of this. If you choke off the ability to trade effectively, then you disrupt the network."" Following a similar operation in 2011, police described the use of legitimate bureaux de change by money launderers as a ""weak point"". A number of people were convicted of offences linked to drug dealing or money launderingin a case that exposed one London firm's links to organised crime networksfrom all over the UK.

"Brexit backstop 'has to change or go', says Hunt","Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has told a Conservative Party leadership hustings that as Brexit approaches, the Northern Irish backstop ""has to change or has to go"". He and Boris Johnson made their pitch to be the next PM to Conservative Party members in Northern Ireland. The two candidates for the Tory leadership have been taking part in a series of party events across the UK. The current EU withdrawal agreement was ""a dead letter"", said Mr Johnson. He said the backstop presented the UK with the ""unacceptable choice"" between ""abandoning the ability to govern ourselves"" or to ""give up control of the government of Northern Ireland"". Johnson v Hunt - who impressed NI Conservatives? How PM hopefuls view Brexit and the Irish border Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Who chooses the next PM? The backstop - the most controversial part of the deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU -is a position of last resortto prevent any new checks or controls on the Irish border after Brexit. The UK and EU would prefer to maintain the border status quo through a comprehensive trade deal. Mr Johnson met with DUP leader Arlene Foster at Stormont after the hustings. Allow Twitter content?

He reaffirmed his promise of there being no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mrs Foster said they had a ""useful discussion about restoring devolution and delivering on the EU referendum result"". By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter It was described as the Northern Ireland version of ""Tories got talent"" by host, broadcaster Iain Dale. But Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson stuck to their scripts on Brexit and the backstop - which seemed to go down well with the Northern Ireland Conservatives in the room. However, they diverged on restoring the Northern Ireland Assembly. Mr Hunt said he would be ""personally"" involved, while Mr Johnson told the parties just to ""get on with it"". The 500 NI Conservative members will all get their say on who becomes the next PM -  but it's the DUP vote that the two men are really courting. They both agreed that winning over their unionist allies is vital for a Tory majority in Parliament. That's something the new prime minister will have to address quickly, by renewing the Â£1bn confidence and supply pact when he enters No 10 later this month. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Mrs May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Mr Hunt was first to take to the stage at the event. ""We are never going to have a deal to leave the EU with the backstop,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt is in favour of a ""technology-led solution"" to the border issue Mr Hunt has said he would decide by the end of September whether there was a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new Brexit deal with the EU.

""The fundamental issue with the backstop is not the principle that we shouldn't have border infrastructure on the island of Ireland - that's accepted by all sides,"" he said. ""The principle is the backstop which traps us into following EU customs tariffs until the EU gives us permission to leave the customs union... we have to find a different solution."" This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) He said he believed the answer was a technology-led solution, as modelled in Germany. He told Sky News earlier that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was willing to look at any new proposals put forward by the next prime minister. For his part, Mr Johnson said the backstop presented the UK with an unacceptable choice and that ""the UK as a whole should come out of the EU"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there are ""useful bits"" in Theresa May's Brexit deal, but a lot must change Mr Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. Mr Hunt said his campaign was based on trying to fire up the economy, increasing defence spending, abolishing illiteracy and supporting young people. Were he from Northern Ireland, he would want the law changed on both abortion and same-sex marriage, he said, but added that both matters were issues for a devolved government. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Northern Ireland is also the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is illegal. Mr Johnson also said the NI abortion issue should be debated at Stormont.

During a vote in November 2015, Northern Ireland assembly members supported same-sex marriage by a slim majority of 53 votes to 52. But the devolved government has been in limbo since 2017 when a power-sharing agreement between rivals Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP broke down. Both would-be prime ministers pledged to put renewed efforts to get Stormont up and running. ""It is totally unacceptable that politicians that are paid to run the NHS and schools, and promote inward investment are not turning up to work and doing their job,"" said Mr Hunt. Mr Johnson said if he was leader, he ""would do whatever I can personally to energise"" power-sharing talks which are currently stalled. ""Everyone needs to recognise that it is the citizens and voters of Northern Ireland that are losing out."" Following the hustings event, Mr Johnson tweeted that it was a ""pleasure to meet"" DUP leader Arlene Foster ""to discuss restoring and protecting the governance of Northern Ireland"". In 2017,the Conservative Party entered into a confidence-and-supply pact with the DUP. The Conservatives needed the votes of the DUP's 10 MPs in order to have a working Commons majority after the 2017 Westminster election, but had to agree to an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland.

Mr Hunt tweeted on Tuesday that he had been invited to a live BBC TV debate against Mr Johnson on 16 July. He argued that about 90% of Conservative members would have already voted in the leadership race by then. Meanwhile, former party leader William Hague, who served as leader of the opposition between 1997 and 2001, wrote in the Daily Telegraph that both candidates had ""great merits"" but added that he believed Mr Hunt would make the better prime minister.

"Whirlpool say up to 800,000 faulty dryers exist","Whirlpool has admitted that there could be as many as 800,000 faulty tumble-dryers in homes around the UK. In June, the government said it would issue a recall notice of up to 500,000 dryers which pose a fire safety risk. But when pressed by MPs on the Business Committee, company executives admitted the number of unmodified machines could be higher. A fault in Whirlpool machines was blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, the government said. Whirlpool said it had logged 54 fires caused by a build-up of fluff in its tumble dryers in recent years, three of which were in machines that had been modified. Charlie Pugsley, deputy assistant commissioner at the London Fire Brigade, said his service had seen a wide range of faults causing fires in machines that had already been modified. The danger in our homes? Whirlpool told to recall dryers in 'unprecedented' government move 'Creativity needed' in Whirlpool fire-risk tumble dryer warnings Jemma Spurr was one customer whose modified dryer caught fire. She told the Business Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that despite repeated attempts to get in touch with Whirlpool directly, she had never received the report on the cause of her fire, or an apology from the company. Whirlpool executive Jeff Noel apologised to Ms Spurr during the hearing and said the company had modified every machine bought to its attention. Ms Spurr also claimed that Whirlpool asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) about the incident. She did sign it but has spoken out anyway. Whirlpool said non-disclosure agreements were standard industry practice during insurance settlements. By Colletta Smith, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Faulty dryers, months to wait for a fix, continued problems even after modifications, and a full product recall. It's a string of bad publicity for a company trying to brand itself as a provider of ""quality home appliances"". It isn't the first time that the company's corporate vice-president has had to defend his products to a parliamentary committee. Jeff Noel previously responded to safety concerns about the company's fridge-freezers which were blamed as the cause of the Grenfell fire. Customers are understandably frustrated, and the white goods market is particularly dependent on trust. Research by Deloitte suggests that people are more likely to read online reviews, and ask family and friends for recommendations of household appliances than any other purchase. The string of damaging news has put Whirlpool in a real spin, as it comes at the same time as increased competition from the likes of Samsung, Bosch, Siemens and Zanussi. The company also confirmed that, during the recall period, customers can either have their current dryers modified or get a brand new machine free of charge, including installation. In a statement, the Whirlpool Corporation told the BBC: ""The Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) recently concluded a comprehensive year-long review of the dryer programme which confirmed that the modification is effective in resolving the issue. ""Safety is always our number one priority and we remain committed to resolving all unmodified dryers affected by this issue. ""As we updated the committee, we are expanding our recall campaign to include further options to encourage remaining consumers to come forward and remedy their unmodified appliances. ""The crucial message to anyone who still owns an affected dryer and has not already had it modified by Whirlpool is to contact us immediately on 0800 151 0905, or visit https://safety.hotpoint.eu/, https://safety.indesit.eu/ or https://safety-swan.eu. ""As advised by OPSS, consumers whose tumble dryers have been modified can continue to use them safely and there is no need to contact Whirlpool at this time."" Sue Davies, strategic policy adviser at consumer group Which?, said: ""With Whirlpool admitting it has only managed to provide a modification or replacement for a tiny proportion of affected machines in the last two years, it's clear that the company is failing to do enough to keep customers safe. ""Now it has acknowledged that modified machines are still catching fire. ""If the safety of Whirlpool's fire-risk tumble dryers cannot be assured, secretary of state Greg Clark must step in and ensure that all potentially dangerous machines are immediately removed from people's homes.""

Protests mark opening of European Parliament,"This video can not be played Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs as Ode to Joy was performed The European Parliament has re-opened in Strasbourg with an anti-EU protest by the UK's Brexit Party and a demonstration by Catalan nationalists whose MEPs are barred. The first session after Europe-wide elections in May began as EU leaders went into a third day of talks on who should fill the bloc's top jobs. A plan emerged on Tuesday to nominate German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen as Commission president. An earlier compromise deal collapsed. Ms Von der Leyen is being considered for the top job, while Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel is being considered for the key role of president of the European Council, according to German website Die Welt and other reports. Christine Lagarde is being cited as a possible new head of the European Central Bank. The French head of the International Monetary Fund served as economy minister during Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency. Hundreds of Catalan demonstrators protested that three separatist figures were unable to take their seats, as inside the chamber fellow MEPs placed photos of the missing members on their desks. Protesters waved Catalan flags outside parliament Ex-Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and colleague Toni Comin were barred from taking their seats because they had fled to Brussels after a banned referendum on independence went ahead and had not attended a swearing-in ceremony in Madrid as required. Another separatist leader, Oriol Junqueras, is in detention and on trial in Spain. Irish Sinn FÃ©in MEP Matt Carthy warned that the parliament's credibility would be undermined if it did not stand up for the voters of Catalonia. MEPs return: Four things to watch out for As outgoing speaker Antonio Tajani convened the new session, MEPs rose for the EU's anthem, Beethoven's Ode to Joy, accompanied by a saxophone quartet. But not everyone stood, and anti-EU MEPs from the UK's Brexit Party turned their backs on the rendition. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Among the new intake was Italy's former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, 82 EU leaders reconvened in Brussels for their third consecutive day after a reported compromise deal that would have seen Dutch Labour leader Frans Timmermans head the Commission with centre-right Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva taking the other key job of European Council president. Who is in the running for the EU's top job? EU split over top jobs forces suspension of talks That deal fell apart when the four Visegrad states of Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia blocked the plan, with the backing of Italy. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Mr Timmermans was ""unacceptable"" and a ""total catastrophe"". A new compromise emerged after hours of phone diplomacy involving EU leaders and outgoing Council President Donald Tusk, who was seen heading for the talks with his mobile phone to his ear. After Italy's Giuseppe Conte said he would be very happy with a woman as Commission president, that idea gained ground when Ursula von der Leyen emerged as a possible candidate. She has not been considered a front-runner so far. Political horse-trading has always been part of choosing the names for the top EU jobs, but EU elections at the end of May have shifted influence away from the two biggest groups in the European Parliament, the centre-right EPP and the Socialists and Democrats (S&D). If the main post does go to the German defence minister, it is a defeat for the EPP's candidate Manfred Weber, but still a result for the party and for Angela Merkel's ruling CDU. It is not just the Commission presidency that is part of the discussion. The leaders also need to agree on four other top posts: European Council president (to replace Donald Tusk) High Representative for foreign policy (to replace Federica Mogherini) European Parliament president European Central Bank president The European Parliament will elect its president on Wednesday, placing further pressure on the EU leaders. MEPs will also have to approve the leaders' eventual nomination for Commission chief.

Tory leadership hopefuls make pitch to NI members,"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has told a Conservative Party leadership hustings that as Brexit approaches, the Northern Irish backstop ""has to change or has to go"". He and Boris Johnson made their pitch to be the next PM to Conservative Party members in Northern Ireland. The two candidates for the Tory leadership have been taking part in a series of party events across the UK. The current EU withdrawal agreement was ""a dead letter"", said Mr Johnson. He said the backstop presented the UK with the ""unacceptable choice"" between ""abandoning the ability to govern ourselves"" or to ""give up control of the government of Northern Ireland"". Johnson v Hunt - who impressed NI Conservatives? How PM hopefuls view Brexit and the Irish border Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Who chooses the next PM? The backstop - the most controversial part of the deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU -is a position of last resortto prevent any new checks or controls on the Irish border after Brexit. The UK and EU would prefer to maintain the border status quo through a comprehensive trade deal. Mr Johnson met with DUP leader Arlene Foster at Stormont after the hustings. Allow Twitter content?

He reaffirmed his promise of there being no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mrs Foster said they had a ""useful discussion about restoring devolution and delivering on the EU referendum result"". By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter It was described as the Northern Ireland version of ""Tories got talent"" by host, broadcaster Iain Dale. But Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson stuck to their scripts on Brexit and the backstop - which seemed to go down well with the Northern Ireland Conservatives in the room. However, they diverged on restoring the Northern Ireland Assembly. Mr Hunt said he would be ""personally"" involved, while Mr Johnson told the parties just to ""get on with it"". The 500 NI Conservative members will all get their say on who becomes the next PM -  but it's the DUP vote that the two men are really courting. They both agreed that winning over their unionist allies is vital for a Tory majority in Parliament. That's something the new prime minister will have to address quickly, by renewing the Â£1bn confidence and supply pact when he enters No 10 later this month. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Mrs May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Mr Hunt was first to take to the stage at the event. ""We are never going to have a deal to leave the EU with the backstop,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt is in favour of a ""technology-led solution"" to the border issue Mr Hunt has said he would decide by the end of September whether there was a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new Brexit deal with the EU. He said he would deliver a provisional ""no-deal Brexit budget"" in early September and then give the EU three weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The fundamental issue with the backstop is not the principle that we shouldn't have border infrastructure on the island of Ireland - that's accepted by all sides,"" he said. ""The principle is the backstop which traps us into following EU customs tariffs until the EU gives us permission to leave the customs union... we have to find a different solution."" This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) He said he believed the answer was a technology-led solution, as modelled in Germany. He told Sky News earlier that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was willing to look at any new proposals put forward by the next prime minister. For his part, Mr Johnson said the backstop presented the UK with an unacceptable choice and that ""the UK as a whole should come out of the EU"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there are ""useful bits"" in Theresa May's Brexit deal, but a lot must change Mr Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. Mr Hunt said his campaign was based on trying to fire up the economy, increasing defence spending, abolishing illiteracy and supporting young people. Were he from Northern Ireland, he would want the law changed on both abortion and same-sex marriage, he said, but added that both matters were issues for a devolved government. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Northern Ireland is also the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is illegal. Mr Johnson also said the NI abortion issue should be debated at Stormont.

During a vote in November 2015, Northern Ireland assembly members supported same-sex marriage by a slim majority of 53 votes to 52. But the devolved government has been in limbo since 2017 when a power-sharing agreement between rivals Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP broke down. Both would-be prime ministers pledged to put renewed efforts to get Stormont up and running. ""It is totally unacceptable that politicians that are paid to run the NHS and schools, and promote inward investment are not turning up to work and doing their job,"" said Mr Hunt. Mr Johnson said if he was leader, he ""would do whatever I can personally to energise"" power-sharing talks which are currently stalled. ""Everyone needs to recognise that it is the citizens and voters of Northern Ireland that are losing out."" Following the hustings event, Mr Johnson tweeted that it was a ""pleasure to meet"" DUP leader Arlene Foster ""to discuss restoring and protecting the governance of Northern Ireland"". In 2017,the Conservative Party entered into a confidence-and-supply pact with the DUP. The Conservatives needed the votes of the DUP's 10 MPs in order to have a working Commons majority after the 2017 Westminster election, but had to agree to an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland. At the hustings event, Mr Johnson was asked about his attendance at a DUP conference last year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The candidates are set to face each other in an ITV debate on 9 July and at an event hosted by the Sun newspaper and talkRADIO on 15 July. Mr Hunt tweeted on Tuesday that he had been invited to a live BBC TV debate against Mr Johnson on 16 July. He argued that about 90% of Conservative members would have already voted in the leadership race by then. Meanwhile, former party leader William Hague, who served as leader of the opposition between 1997 and 2001, wrote in the Daily Telegraph that both candidates had ""great merits"" but added that he believed Mr Hunt would make the better prime minister.

'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minuteSatellite images show a sharp increase in clearances of trees in the first half of this year.Science & Environment,"An area of Amazon rainforest roughly the size of a football pitch is now being cleared every single minute, according to satellite data. The rate of losses has accelerated as Brazil's new right-wing president favours development over conservation. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. A senior Brazilian official, speaking anonymously, told us his government was encouraging deforestation. Usually by bulldozers, either pushing against the trunks to force the shallow roots out of the ground, or by a pair of the machines advancing with a chain between them. In one vast stretch of recently cleared land, we found giant trees lying on their sides, much of the foliage still green and patches of bare earth drying under a fierce sun. Later, the timber will be cleared and sold or burned, and the land prepared for farming. In other areas, illegal loggers carve new tracks through the undergrowth to reach particularly valuable hardwood trees which they sell on the black market, often to order. Satellite images show a sharp increase in clearances of trees over the first half of this year, since Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil, the country that owns most of the Amazon region. The most recent analysis suggests a staggering scale of losses over the past two months in particular, with about a hectare being cleared every minute on average. The single biggest reason to fell trees, according to official figures, is to create new pastures for cattle, and during our visit we saw countless herds grazing on land that used to be rainforest. Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce the clearances with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But this approach is being overturned by Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers who have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes. The forest holds a vast amount of carbon in its billions of trees, accumulated over hundreds or even thousands of years. Every year, the leaves also absorb a huge quantity of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be left in the atmosphere adding to the rise in global temperatures. Jair Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda By one recent estimate, the trees of the Amazon rainforest pulled in carbon dioxide equivalent to the fossil fuel emissions of most of the nine countries that own or border the forest between 1980-2010. The forest is also the richest home to biodiversity on the planet, a habitat for perhaps one-tenth of all species of plants and animals. And it is where one million indigenous people live, hunting and gathering amid the trees. According to a senior Brazilian environment official, the impact is so ""huge"" that he took the risk of giving us an unauthorised interview to bring it to the attention of the world. We had to meet in secret and disguise his face and voice because Mr Bolsonaro has banned his environment staff from talking to the media. Over the course of three hours, a startling inside picture emerged of small, under-resourced teams of government experts passionate about saving the forest but seriously undermined by their own political masters. Farming organisations argue that the network of protected areas of forest is too restrictive Mr Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda backed by agricultural businesses and small farmers, many of whom believe that too much of the Amazon region is protected and that environment staff have too much influence. He has said he wants to weaken the laws protecting the forest and has attacked the civil servants whose job it is to guard the trees. The result, according to the environment official, is that ""it feels like we are the enemies of the Amazon, when in fact we should be seen in a completely different way, as the people trying to protect our ecological heritage for future generations"". ""They don't want us to speak because we'll say the truth, that conservation areas are being invaded and destroyed, there are many people marking out areas that should be protected."" The official believes the figures for deforestation could be even worse than officially recognised. ""There's a government attempt to show the data is wrong, to show the numbers don't portray the reality,"" he told me. Ministers are considering hiring an independent contractor to handle information from satellite images of the region, questioning the work of the current government agency. One million indigenous people live in the forest Also, the rainy season is only now coming to an end, and because deforestation typically takes place in the drier months of the year, the official fears that the pace of losses could pick up speed. ""In truth, it can be even worse,"" he said, because many of the areas recently damaged haven't yet been picked up by satellite images. ""People need to know what's happening because we need allies to fight against invasions, to protect areas, and against deforestation."" We made repeated requests for interviews with the ministers for environment and agriculture but were refused. Earlier this year, Mr Bolsonaro, who's known as the ""Trump of the Tropics"", invited the US president to be a partner in exploiting the resources of the Amazon. Last month, in an interview with BBC Brasil, the environment minister Ricardo Salles, said landowners should be rewarded for preserving forest and that developed nations should foot the bill. And there's an assertive response when voices in the outside world call for the forest to be saved. The president's top security adviser, General Augusto Heleno Pereira, told Bloomberg last month that it was ""nonsense"" that the Amazon was part of the world's heritage. ""The Amazon is Brazilian, the heritage of Brazil and should be dealt with by Brazil for the benefit of Brazil,"" he said. For decades, farming organisations have argued that the network of protected areas of forest, including reserves for indigenous people, is too restrictive for a developing country that needs to create jobs. A leading figure in the farmers' union  in the city of Santarem, a hub for soya and cattle, told me that other countries had cleared their trees for agriculture but now wanted Brazil not to do the same. Vanderley Wegner said that the US and Europe, which buy produce from the Amazon region, have far less stringent controls on their forests, and that Europe ""has very little forest left"" anyway. ""We have to develop the Amazon. More than four million people live here and they need development too, it's a constitutional right of every Brazilian citizen,"" he said.

Scotch whisky targeted by new US tariffsEU products including Parmesan cheese and pasta may also have tariffs added when exported to the US.,"Scotch whisky is among the products targeted by the US for a possible range of new tariffs on imported goods. The US has threatened to impose tariffs on European Union imports worth up to $4bn (Â£3.2bn), although it is not known when tariffs would be imposed. Whiskey from Ireland, cheeses including Parmesan and Gouda, pasta and olives are other items affected. The US Trade Representative said it was ""in response to harm caused by EU aircraft subsidies"". In April, theUS announced proposed tariffs on $11bn of EU goods. The moves are part of a 15-year dispute at the World Trade Organization between the US and EU over subsidies given to plane-makers Airbus, from Europe, and the US's Boeing. How can Boeing regain trust? Airbus secures multi-billion dollar jet order from China Can China's plane-maker take on Boeing and Airbus? The United States is the world's largest export market for Scotch whisky by value - Â£1.04bn in 2018. By volume, it is the second largest, with 137 million 70cl bottles exported last year. A spokesperson for the Scotch Whisky Association told the BBC: ""Exports of Scotch whisky to the US have been zero tariff for 20 years, so it is disappointing that Scotch whisky has been drawn into this dispute. ""The Scotch whisky industry has consistently opposed the imposition of tariffs, which harms economies on both sides of the Atlantic which depend on trade for their continued prosperity. ""There is a close relationship between the US whiskies and Scotch whisky, not least due to the use of bourbon casks for maturation which generates around Â£70m for the US economy each year. ""We continue to urge the UK government, the EU and the US government to resolve this situation."" Scotch whisky makes up 12% of the total whiskey market in the United States, with US whiskey accounting for 48%. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States warned that the move may harm both jobs and consumers in the country. ""We strongly oppose the inclusion of distilled products in the proposed retaliation list,"" said spokeswoman Lisa Hawkins. ""US companies - from farmers to suppliers to retailers - are already being negatively impacted by the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by key trading partners on certain US distilled spirits. ""These additional tariffs will only inflict further harm,"" she said. Can China's plane-maker take on Boeing and Airbus?

Travel money firms focus in gangs crackdownPolice hope targeting the cash will reduce street violence by disrupting gang activities.,"Bureaux de change and currency transfer businesses are to be raided by police in a week-long crackdown on suspected drugs money laundering. They hope targeting the cash will reduce street violence linked to disputes between gangs by disrupting their activities. Police say 12 businesses in London will be raided on Tuesday - the first day of the operation Inspectors will visit another 39 to check they are complying with the law. Number of middle-aged 'money mules' rising Teens 'paid money to stab other youths' Drugs violence 'at unprecedented level' There are around 9,000 money exchanges in London, handling tens of billions of pounds each year between them - about a fifth of the UK market. Detectives say the vast majority of these companies operate legitimately, but a ""significant number"" - which they call ""launderettes"" - are involved in illegal activity. This can include receiving bags or holdalls full of cash from drug deals and processing it to make it look as though it has come from a legitimate source. About Â£100bn is laundered through the UK every year, but it is not known much of this goes through money service businesses. The crackdown is a joint operation between the Metropolitan Police, HM Revenue & Customs and financial services watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Most of the debate about ways to curb knife crime has revolved around short-term measures, includingstop-and-search, and long-term solutions, such as the 'public health' modelpioneered in Glasgow. But with much of the violence believed to be linked to drug disputes over territory and unpaid debts, police are stepping up their efforts on that front too. Drug gangs exist to make money, the argument goes, so impeding the flow of their ill-gotten gains will disrupt their activities and reduce the violence. The ""launderettes"" - the illegal money transfer businesses that conceal and process the drugs money - are a key target in the anti-violence campaign.

Protests mark opening of new European Parliament,"This video can not be played Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs as Ode to Joy was performed The European Parliament has re-opened in Strasbourg with an anti-EU protest by the UK's Brexit Party and a demonstration by Catalan nationalists whose MEPs are barred. The first session after Europe-wide elections in May began as EU leaders went into a third day of talks on who should fill the bloc's top jobs. A plan emerged on Tuesday to nominate German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen as Commission president. An earlier compromise deal collapsed. Ms Von der Leyen is being considered for the top job, while Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel is being considered for the key role of president of the European Council, according to German website Die Welt and other reports. Christine Lagarde is being cited as a possible new head of the European Central Bank. The French head of the International Monetary Fund served as economy minister during Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency. Hundreds of Catalan demonstrators protested that three separatist figures were unable to take their seats, as inside the chamber fellow MEPs placed photos of the missing members on their desks. Protesters waved Catalan flags outside parliament Ex-Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and colleague Toni Comin were barred from taking their seats because they had fled to Brussels after a banned referendum on independence went ahead and had not attended a swearing-in ceremony in Madrid as required. Another separatist leader, Oriol Junqueras, is in detention and on trial in Spain. Irish Sinn FÃ©in MEP Matt Carthy warned that the parliament's credibility would be undermined if it did not stand up for the voters of Catalonia. MEPs return: Four things to watch out for As outgoing speaker Antonio Tajani convened the new session, MEPs rose for the EU's anthem, Beethoven's Ode to Joy, accompanied by a saxophone quartet. But not everyone stood, and anti-EU MEPs from the UK's Brexit Party turned their backs on the rendition. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Among the new intake was Italy's former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, 82 EU leaders reconvened in Brussels for their third consecutive day after a reported compromise deal that would have seen Dutch Labour leader Frans Timmermans head the Commission with centre-right Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva taking the other key job of European Council president. Who is in the running for the EU's top job? EU split over top jobs forces suspension of talks That deal fell apart when the four Visegrad states of Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia blocked the plan, with the backing of Italy. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Mr Timmermans was ""unacceptable"" and a ""total catastrophe"". A new compromise emerged after hours of phone diplomacy involving EU leaders and outgoing Council President Donald Tusk, who was seen heading for the talks with his mobile phone to his ear. After Italy's Giuseppe Conte said he would be very happy with a woman as Commission president, that idea gained ground when Ursula von der Leyen emerged as a possible candidate. She has not been considered a front-runner so far. Political horse-trading has always been part of choosing the names for the top EU jobs, but EU elections at the end of May have shifted influence away from the two biggest groups in the European Parliament, the centre-right EPP and the Socialists and Democrats (S&D). If the main post does go to the German defence minister, it is a defeat for the EPP's candidate Manfred Weber, but still a result for the party and for Angela Merkel's ruling CDU. It is not just the Commission presidency that is part of the discussion. The leaders also need to agree on four other top posts: European Council president (to replace Donald Tusk) High Representative for foreign policy (to replace Federica Mogherini) European Parliament president European Central Bank president The European Parliament will elect its president on Wednesday, placing further pressure on the EU leaders. MEPs will also have to approve the leaders' eventual nomination for Commission chief.

MEPs return: Four things to watch out for,"MEPs are in Strasbourg and have begun the first full sitting of the European Parliament since May's EU elections. It comes as European leadersremain deadlockedover who should get the EU's top jobs, with talks between them resuming over in Brussels. The European Parliament has the power to block or amend EU laws, and will have the final say on whether to ratify a Brexit deal with the UK. Here are four things look out for as the new-look parliament gets back to work. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage will be back in Strasbourg They are the parliamentarians who were never meant to be elected - but with Brexit delayed, the UK has sent 73 MEPs to take up their seats in Strasbourg. With 29 MEPs, The Brexit Party will not only be the largest British party, but the joint-biggest party delegation in the European Parliament overall. The party has yet to announce if it is joining a new trans-national group, which requires MEPs from at least seven different EU countries. Groupless parties have more limited access to speaking time, and their leaders don't get to speak at the front, as the BBC's Adam Fleming points out: Allow Twitter content?

The Liberal Democrats have increased their representation from a single MEP to a group of 16 - and will no doubt want to use the platform for their pro-Remain message. But with uncertainty surrounding the length of their tenure, it is unclear what role the British MEPs will be given in the running of the new parliament, including piloting legislation through the chamber and chairing its numerous committees. Jean-Claude Juncker is due to step down at the start of November This month could prove an early test of mettle for MEPs in the process of deciding who becomes the next boss of another EU institution, the European Commission. They have previously insisted that the Commission's next boss must be one of the spitzenkandidaten - or lead candidates - put forward earlier this year by the assembly's various political groups. This process resulted in Jean-Claude Juncker - who was the candidate of the centre-right EPP group - becoming the current Commission President in 2014. However the convention is not precisely defined in the EU's treaties, and some leaders are keen to do away with the idea altogether. The previous parliamentthreatened to reject,externalanyone put forward who was not a lead candidate when they face their confirmation vote in the assembly. This week's sitting will provide a first opportunity for MEPs to react if a non-spitzenkandidat emerges as the leaders' preferred candidate. They will have to decide how far they are willing to go to preserve the principle, ahead of the confirmation vote due later this month. The president chairs debates in the chamber and represents the parliament internationally MEPs are also due to make a decision on who should serve as the European Parliament's next president. The job runs until early 2022, the mid-point in the new parliamentary session. Candidates must be nominated by the assembly's political groups or a group of at least 38 MEPs, with the winner decided in a series of secret ballots. Current incumbent Antonio Tajani has insisted the process is ""entirely independent"" of the haggling over other major positions among EU leaders. But it remains to be seen whether agreement between leaders on the Commission presidency could result in a side-deal for the Parliament role, which would see the major political groups unite behind a common candidate. Indeed according to onecompromise dealdiscussed by EU leaders, the role has already been offered to German MEP Manfred Weber as a consolation prize if his bid to become the Commission president fails. With new personnel comes a change in the political groups which house the myriad national parties represented in the parliament and provide a basic structure governing the allocation of funds, positions and speaking time in the chamber. The National Rally party of Marine Le Pen and Italy's right-wing League party have clubbed together with Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) to form a new group called Identity and Democracy. With 73 MEPs, they will be the fifth-largest group in the new parliament - and be a bigger presence than theformer ENF groupthey have essentially replaced. The liberal group, formerly known as ALDE, now includes MEPs from President Macron's Renaissance delegation and has rebranded as 'Renew Europe'. The centre-right EPP and centre-left S&D remain the biggest groups but have lost the combined majority that underpinned their traditional dominance. With the liberal, anti-EU and green groups all boosting their numbers, the power structure in the new assembly will be more fragmented. Some of the largest groups are in talks to see if they can reach agreement on shared objectives in areas such as trade, climate change, and migration. But even if a deal is reached, compromise could be more difficult, particularly in policy areas where the divide between parties on the left and right is often more important then where they stand on the EU project overall.

The issue with BBC Studios becoming commercial,"Tony Hall says the BBC's current fixed income is ""not sustainable"" The publication of this report shows the perennial difficulty of reporting any financial year, and the disadvantages of removing BBC Studios from the equation of salaries disclosed. While there has been some progress in improving the overall balance of this list - on which my own name appears - the top of the list is still dominated by men. Had BBC Studios' salaries been included, there would have been a better balance of men and women overall on the list, and more of the names at the very summit of the list would have been female. But the BBC argues that it needs BBC Studios to flourish commercially, and publishing names there would put it at a disadvantage. The other problem for the corporation is that, because the figures here reflect the past financial year, major changes - whether some men being paid less, or some women being paid more - aren't in the figures available today. They will only filter through next year. This is the sense in which such financial reporting always seems a year behind. While the issue of equal pay and the gender pay gap will dominate headlines, the annual report mentions an existential question for the BBC, which the director-general also addressed when I spoke to him. Lord Hall of Birkenhead says the current model of the BBC, in which it has a fixed income in a super-inflationary market - where the likes of Amazon, Netflix, and Disney are all spending billions building direct-to-consumer, global offerings - ""is not sustainable"". I asked him what he intends to do about this. Apparently the BBC board are turning their attention to this in the autumn, making it a priority after August. But it already feels late. Devising a plausible solution to the BBC's fixed revenue model, perhaps in conjunction with other public service broadcasters - or failing to do so - will be an even bigger part of Lord Hall's legacy than equal pay.

US probe after black man held while on IV machine,"The patient was being treated for pneumonia (file photo) US police are investigating the arrest of a black patient in Illinois who was detained near a hospital while attached to an intravenous (IV) machine.

""They [the police] took my rescue inhaler and began to transport me to the city lockup, while in transit I began to have a seizure, and subsequently an asthma attack, I pleaded with officers for almost four minutes to retrieve my inhaler from the transporting officer, and finally, when I became unresponsive, it miraculously appeared.""

Gambling firms pledge Â£60m to help addicts,"The UK's biggest gambling firms have agreed to contribute more money to fund treatment for problem gamblers. The owners of William Hill, Ladbrokes Coral, Paddy Power Betfair, Skybet and Bet 365 will increase their voluntary levy on gambling profits from 0.1% to 1% up to 2023 - a contribution of Â£60m. It will be ""a step change"" in how they tackle addiction, the firms claimed. It comes amid criticism of the industry on how little it spends to help addicts compared with its marketing budget. Earlier this month, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens warned betting firms could be taxed to pay for addiction treatment. Mr Stevens condemned the ""fraction"" spent by industry on helping those struggling with addiction, compared with the amount spent on advertising and marketing. The companies said cumulatively they would spend Â£100m on treatment over the next four years. Bookmakers pledge Â£100m to avoid crackdown Bookmakers warned over fixed-odds stake cut Bookmakers pull new games after criticism Last month,when the BBC broke the news of the plans,a source said the industry had to act: ""The industry is on a precipice - if we don't get ahead of this, we will end up where the alcohol industry was 10 years ago, and tobacco 30 years ago. ""The fear is that we face a ban on touchline advertising or football shirt sponsorship."" Peter Jackson, chief executive of Flutter Entertainment - the holding company name for Paddy Power Betfair - said the agreement marked ""an unprecedented level of commitment and collaboration by the leading companies in the British betting and gaming sector to address gambling-related harm"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""We think that is an important step to make. ""We do think we need to increase the amount of money that is available to protect the young and vulnerable."" Marc Etches, chief executive of charity GambleAware, told the BBC: ""We welcome this initiative by the leading operators as it's essential there is sufficient funding to provide for treatment and support for both problem gamblers and for those who are 'at risk' - particularly the young and vulnerable. ""Customers should be able to gamble in a safe environment, where help and advice is readily available at the point of need. ""It is vital that we work closely with the commission, government and other organisations to ensure that operators continue to focus on making gambling products safer, and that treatment and support is properly funded alongside other initiatives including the Safer Gambling campaign, Bet Regret."" The five firms have also agreed to increase safer gambling messages in their adverts and review the ""tone and content"" of their marketing and sponsorship material. The Gambling Commission estimates there are 430,000 people with a serious gambling addiction in the UK. If you include those they deem at risk of addiction, the number rises to more than two million. Of these, around 55,000 are children and young people aged 11 to 16. Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said the gambling industry had a  responsibility to tackle problem gambling and contribute to the cost of treatment to rebuild the lives of those affected. ""We will monitor closely the progress of these new measures and encourage the wider industry to step up. The government will not hesitate to take further action to protect people from gambling related harm.""

Tory leadership candidates to address NI membersBoris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will make their pitch to be the next PM to Conservative members in NI.Northern Ireland,"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has told a Conservative Party leadership hustings that as Brexit approaches, the Northern Irish backstop ""has to change or has to go"". He and Boris Johnson made their pitch to be the next PM to Conservative Party members in Northern Ireland. The two candidates for the Tory leadership have been taking part in a series of party events across the UK. The current EU withdrawal agreement was ""a dead letter"", said Mr Johnson. He said the backstop presented the UK with the ""unacceptable choice"" between ""abandoning the ability to govern ourselves"" or to ""give up control of the government of Northern Ireland"". Johnson v Hunt - who impressed NI Conservatives? How PM hopefuls view Brexit and the Irish border Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Who chooses the next PM? The backstop - the most controversial part of the deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU -is a position of last resortto prevent any new checks or controls on the Irish border after Brexit. The UK and EU would prefer to maintain the border status quo through a comprehensive trade deal. Mr Johnson met with DUP leader Arlene Foster at Stormont after the hustings. Allow Twitter content?

He reaffirmed his promise of there being no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mrs Foster said they had a ""useful discussion about restoring devolution and delivering on the EU referendum result"". By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter It was described as the Northern Ireland version of ""Tories got talent"" by host, broadcaster Iain Dale. But Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson stuck to their scripts on Brexit and the backstop - which seemed to go down well with the Northern Ireland Conservatives in the room. However, they diverged on restoring the Northern Ireland Assembly. Mr Hunt said he would be ""personally"" involved, while Mr Johnson told the parties just to ""get on with it"". The 500 NI Conservative members will all get their say on who becomes the next PM -  but it's the DUP vote that the two men are really courting. They both agreed that winning over their unionist allies is vital for a Tory majority in Parliament. That's something the new prime minister will have to address quickly, by renewing the Â£1bn confidence and supply pact when he enters No 10 later this month. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Mrs May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Mr Hunt was first to take to the stage at the event. ""We are never going to have a deal to leave the EU with the backstop,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt is in favour of a ""technology-led solution"" to the border issue Mr Hunt has said he would decide by the end of September whether there was a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new Brexit deal with the EU.

""The fundamental issue with the backstop is not the principle that we shouldn't have border infrastructure on the island of Ireland - that's accepted by all sides,"" he said. ""The principle is the backstop which traps us into following EU customs tariffs until the EU gives us permission to leave the customs union... we have to find a different solution."" This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) He said he believed the answer was a technology-led solution, as modelled in Germany. He told Sky News earlier that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was willing to look at any new proposals put forward by the next prime minister. For his part, Mr Johnson said the backstop presented the UK with an unacceptable choice and that ""the UK as a whole should come out of the EU"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there are ""useful bits"" in Theresa May's Brexit deal, but a lot must change Mr Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. Mr Hunt said his campaign was based on trying to fire up the economy, increasing defence spending, abolishing illiteracy and supporting young people. Were he from Northern Ireland, he would want the law changed on both abortion and same-sex marriage, he said, but added that both matters were issues for a devolved government. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Northern Ireland is also the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is illegal. Mr Johnson also said the NI abortion issue should be debated at Stormont.

During a vote in November 2015, Northern Ireland assembly members supported same-sex marriage by a slim majority of 53 votes to 52. But the devolved government has been in limbo since 2017 when a power-sharing agreement between rivals Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP broke down. Both would-be prime ministers pledged to put renewed efforts to get Stormont up and running. ""It is totally unacceptable that politicians that are paid to run the NHS and schools, and promote inward investment are not turning up to work and doing their job,"" said Mr Hunt. Mr Johnson said if he was leader, he ""would do whatever I can personally to energise"" power-sharing talks which are currently stalled. ""Everyone needs to recognise that it is the citizens and voters of Northern Ireland that are losing out."" Following the hustings event, Mr Johnson tweeted that it was a ""pleasure to meet"" DUP leader Arlene Foster ""to discuss restoring and protecting the governance of Northern Ireland"". In 2017,the Conservative Party entered into a confidence-and-supply pact with the DUP. The Conservatives needed the votes of the DUP's 10 MPs in order to have a working Commons majority after the 2017 Westminster election, but had to agree to an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland. At the hustings event, Mr Johnson was asked about his attendance at a DUP conference last year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Secret 'border patrol Facebook group' investigatedBorder officials allegedly posted racist and sexist jokes about migrants and lawmakers in the group.US & Canada,"This video can not be played 'No woman should be locked up in a pen' US officials are investigating a secret Facebook group where border patrol members allegedly posted racist and sexist jokes about migrants and others. The private group had about 9,500 members, including former and current border patrol agents,ProPublica reported,external. Some posts mocked migrant deaths, while others targeted Latino members of Congress, ProPublica said. The Border Patrol chief has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"". ""Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable,"" Carla Provost said. 'I left without telling my mum' The agony over an American dream The group was called ""I'm 10-15"", ProPublica said - 10-15 being Border Patrol code for ""aliens in custody"". According to ProPublica, members of the group mocked Latino members of Congress who visited migrant detention centres in Texas on Monday. Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Veronica Escobar were among those said to have been called ""hoes"" and ""scum buckets"" in the private postings. In one post, a member reportedly suggested throwing burritos at them, while another shared a doctored image depicting Ms Ocasio-Cortez performing a sex act on President Donald Trump. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were heckled as they visited detention facilities The BBC was not able to independently verify the existence of the private group, which is not publicly accessible on Facebook. Matthew Klein, an assistant commissioner at the CBP, said the Department of Homeland Security had launched a code-of-conduct investigation into the group. He said a number of CBP agents may be members of the group. Ms Ocasio-Cortez said the posts did not surprise her, and that they were ""indicative"" of what she had seen while visiting the migrant detention centre on Monday. ""I see why CBP officers were being so physically and sexually threatening towards me,"" she tweeted after the trip. On Twitter, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said that border patrol officers had told women in cells to ""drink out of the toilets"". She added that during the visit, she ""forced"" herself into a cramped cell where the women inside ""described their treatment at the hands of officers as 'psychological warfare'"".

Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he was introducing a plan to ""virtually eliminate migrant detention"". He called the facilities ""for-profit prison that should not exist"", and said that as president, he would improve the facilities and close any that do not meet his standard. Since taking office in 2017, President Trump had adopted tougher policies in an attempt to reduce the number of undocumented migrants. But officials say his administration's crackdown, and the recent increase in Central American migrant arrivals, has led to a strain on enforcement resources.

Last month a US Justice Department lawyer disputed in court whether detained migrant children are entitled to toothbrushes and soap. In February, Mr Trump declared an emergency on the country's southern border, saying it was necessary to tackle what he said was a crisis there.

Pregnancy screening call for life-threatening bug,"Northern Ireland's politicians have jointly called for Group B Strep screening for all pregnant women. Group B Strep is the most common cause of serious infection in newborn babies in the UK. A cross-party letter has been sent to Department of Health officials. It says it is unacceptable that a baby born in Northern Ireland has a higher chance of developing the infection than one born elsewhere. The letter was prompted by the death of Hollie Maguire shortly after her birth in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital in 2016 from congenital pneumonia. At her inquest last month, her parents, Brendan Maguire and Susan Ho-Maguire from Dunmurry, warned other mothers-to-be to take a simple test for the Group B Streptococcus bacteriathat caused their daughter's death. Group B Strep is also one of the leading causes of neonatal pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. On average, two babies each day in the UK develop a Group B Strep infection and each week one baby dies. Each year in the UK, between 400 to 500 babies are born with Group-B streptococcus (GBS) -  a bacteria which can cause serious illness or death in newborns. Most will fully recover with treatment, but GBS can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and a dangerous blood infection called sepsis. About 150,000 pregnant women - one in five - carry GBS and if it is undiagnosed, there is a chance they could pass it to their baby. GBS can be especially dangerous to babies who are born prematurely. The government has launched a new screening trial across 80 hospitals in Great Britain Most strains of the new born infection can be prevented by testing during pregnancy and providing intravenous antibiotics to women in labour. However, the UK does not routinely test for GBS, unlike the United States, Canada, Germany, France and Spain. Experts worry that routine testing would see antibiotics given to many more women. In 2017, independent experts said there was not enough proof that a national screening programme would benefit mothers and babies. Campaigners disagree. In May, the government said screening would be offered as part of a trial at 80 hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland. The trial will compare two tests with the current approach of testing only ""high risk"" pregnant women. Mr Maguire said he was pleased to see the issue had united the parties. ""I'm so pleased to see the political parties united in support of group B Step screening,"" he said. ""Nothing can bring Hollie back, but if Northern Ireland introduced routine screening, other babies like Hollie would be protected and other families wouldn't have to go through the heartbreak we have."" Brendan Maguire and Susan Ho-Maguire have called for all pregnant women to be tested for Group B Strep The letter signed by representatives of the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP and Alliance parties is also backed by the chief executive of charity Group B Strep Support. The letter outlines that while Northern Ireland has made significant steps forward in its prevention of Group B Strep infection, improvements are possible. ""In America, Canada, France, Germany or Italy, Mrs Maguire would have been tested to see if she was carrying Group B Step bacteria and offered antibiotics in labour, which would very likely have prevented Hollie's infection,"" it states. Jane Plumb who founded the B Strep support group toldBBC NI's Good Morning Ulsterthat the UK national screening committee had recommended against routine testing. ""We believe their decision is flawed,"" she said. ""Most developed countries are screening and have seen their rates fall quite dramatically. ""In ours, the rates are just going up. If we just keep doing what we're doing, we're going to get the same thing happening. ""It is not good enough. One baby a week in the UK is dying from GBS. We must change this."" Ms Plumb said that the test for GBS was costed by the NHS at Â£11 to Â£12. ""It's inexpensive, simple and safe. When you consider the costs of having a baby who develops GBS, the financial costs associated for that are absolutely huge before you even get onto the emotional costs. ""We can be protecting these babies and for the sake of Â£11 for this test for each pregnant woman, we absolutely should be making this available."" She welcomed news that Northern Ireland politicians had united to call for screening and noted that NI had made ""significant steps forward"" in recent years in preventing GBS. ""We can be doing so much more because babies and families are being let down by the current approach.""

Heavy rain triggers transport chaos in Mumbai,"This video can not be played Mumbai: Deadly floods bring India's financial capital to standstill Heavy rain has caused at least 18 deaths and triggered massive rail, road and air transport disruptions in India's financial capital Mumbai. The victims died when a wall collapsed on them in the early hours of Tuesday after persistent rainfall for two days. Authorities have declared a public holiday on Tuesday and have requested people to stay indoors. Met department officials have confirmed that this is the heaviest rainfall in the city for a decade.

Candidates must 'be honest' over spending - chancellor,"This video can not be played Hammond: Candidates' promises 'exceed fiscal headroom' The chancellor has called on Tory leadership candidates to ""stop and think"" about their spending promises. Both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have announced a raft of policies during the contest, including cutting taxes and increasing spending on public services. But Philip Hammond said they needed to ""be honest"" as the policies ""greatly exceed"" the Treasury's coffers. He also said available money would be needed to support the UK economy in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the candidates were being honest with the electorate, he said: ""I think they need to be very careful about setting out these ambitions and being clear about the consequences of them."" The warning comes afterMr Hunt said he would decide by the end of Septemberwhether there was a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new deal with the EU were he to become PM. The foreign secretary said he would deliver a provisional ""no-deal Brexit budget"" in early September, but abandon talks at the end of the month if there was no ""immediate prospect"" of progress - instead moving to a no-deal footing. His rival Boris Johnson has vowed to leave ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Is there a Brexit 'war chest'? Hunt sets 30 September 'no-deal deadline' Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Mr Hammond said the Treasury had ""built up fiscal headroom to protect against the cost of a no-deal Brexit"" and that money could be released ""if we have a smooth Brexit with a transition period in an orderly way"". But he said the current proposals on the table from Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson would already require increased borrowing beyond the government cap, or spending cuts or tax rises elsewhere - even without a no-deal Brexit-shaped ""hole"" in the public finances. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have been busy spraying around hypothetical cash - whether on defence, on care for the elderly, on schools, for more police, the list goes on. It is not politically surprising that they both want to signal they would turn on the spending taps a bit after a long, long period of cuts. But one of their erstwhile colleagues seems to have had enough. After making some carefully crafted warnings in the last couple of weeks, Chancellor Philip Hammond has tried to call a halt, telling the BBC that both of the candidates have to resist the temptation of a bidding war, worrying that the party's reputation is at risk too. Mr Hammond told me the candidates needed to ""stop and think"". And that by his calculation, both of the candidates' plans ""greatly exceeds"" the amount of wriggle room they will inherit from No 11 if they are lucky enough to be the one that moves in next door. Read more from Laura Mr Hammond also said the headroom wasn't ""a pot of money sitting in the Treasury"", but a way of borrowing more without breaching government limits. ""Whether it is a leadership competition or a general election, there is always a temptation to get into a bidding war about spending more and cutting taxes,"" he said. ""But you can't do both, and if we're not careful, all we end up doing is borrowing more, spending more on interest, instead of on our schools, hospitals and our police, and delivering a bigger burden of debt to our children and grandchildren."" He said the candidates' policies were ""sensible and interesting ideas"", but said the government had ""built up a reputation for fiscal responsibility... and it is very important we don't throw that away"". ""We have to live within our means and people have to be honest about the consequences of either spending more money or of cutting taxes that will have implications for borrowing or spending elsewhere,"" he added. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has also warned the candidates about their spending promises, saying they had to ""raise the money honestly from somewhere"". The de-facto deputy prime minister said: ""While in a short term crisis you can ease up on the borrowing, money borrowed has to be repaid by the next generation with interest - so you shouldn't take on extra borrowing lightly, nor should we be wanting to impose more taxes on people already working very hard. ""Sound money and restraint in public spending remains a good Tory principle."" He said the ""stewardship"" of Mr Hammond meant ""money is available"" to ""cushion the impact"" of a no-deal Brexit. But, he added: ""I don't think any of us should pretend that no-deal would be easy even with the most meticulous and thorough planning."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: Who is the Conservative leadership contender? Mr Hunt has said he wants to negotiate a new deal with the EU and would be building a team to create an ""alternative exit deal"" to be published by the end of August. He would then engage with other EU leaders, but keep up preparations at home for a no-deal Brexit. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the timeline Mr Hunt was setting out was very tight - especially given the notice the government's fiscal watchdog, the OBR, usually needs to prepare for a Budget. Earlier, one of Mr Johnson's leading backers, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, told the Times the days of public sector ""pay freezes"" under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. But during a campaign visit in Kent on Monday, Mr Johnson declined to make a detailed pledge on public sector pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Chris Mason's guide to the political life of Boris Johnson A no-deal exit on 31 October remains the default position in UK law after MPs rejected the deal Mrs May had agreed with Brussels three times. If that does happen, the UK will automatically begin trading with the EU under the basic World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Under these rules, the tariffs - the taxes on imported and exported goods - will be different to what the UK currently trades under.

Travel money firms focus in gangs crackdownPolice to raid bureaux de change operators handling cash from drug dealers linked to violence surge.UK,"Bureaux de change and currency transfer businesses are to be raided by police in a week-long crackdown on suspected drugs money laundering. They hope targeting the cash will reduce street violence linked to disputes between gangs by disrupting their activities. Police say 12 businesses in London will be raided on Tuesday - the first day of the operation Inspectors will visit another 39 to check they are complying with the law. Number of middle-aged 'money mules' rising Teens 'paid money to stab other youths' Drugs violence 'at unprecedented level' There are around 9,000 money exchanges in London, handling tens of billions of pounds each year between them - about a fifth of the UK market. Detectives say the vast majority of these companies operate legitimately, but a ""significant number"" - which they call ""launderettes"" - are involved in illegal activity. This can include receiving bags or holdalls full of cash from drug deals and processing it to make it look as though it has come from a legitimate source. About Â£100bn is laundered through the UK every year, but it is not known much of this goes through money service businesses. The crackdown is a joint operation between the Metropolitan Police, HM Revenue & Customs and financial services watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Most of the debate about ways to curb knife crime has revolved around short-term measures, includingstop-and-search, and long-term solutions, such as the 'public health' modelpioneered in Glasgow. But with much of the violence believed to be linked to drug disputes over territory and unpaid debts, police are stepping up their efforts on that front too. Drug gangs exist to make money, the argument goes, so impeding the flow of their ill-gotten gains will disrupt their activities and reduce the violence. The ""launderettes"" - the illegal money transfer businesses that conceal and process the drugs money - are a key target in the anti-violence campaign. Det Ch Supt Mick Gallagher, who is co-ordinating the operation, said: ""Money drives drug dealing, drives violence."" He added: ""The cash is the lifeblood of this. If you choke off the ability to trade effectively, then you disrupt the network."" Following a similar operation in 2011, police described the use of legitimate bureaux de change by money launderers as a ""weak point"". A number of people were convicted of offences linked to drug dealing or money launderingin a case that exposed one London firm's links to organised crime networksfrom all over the UK.

"Investors frustrated as Woodford fund stays lockedThe fund's continued suspension is in the ""best interests of investors"", the firm says.","Well-known stockpicker Neil Woodford's flagship fund will remain locked for investors, it has been confirmed. The extension,announced as the initial 28-day suspension expired,external, means investors will have to wait at least another month to withdraw their money. Investors in the Equity Income Fund have now not been able to access their moneysince 3 June. Withdrawals were frozen after rising numbers of investors asked for their money back. ""It remains in the best interests of all investors in the fund to continue the suspension,"" Link, the regulated manager of the fund, said in a letter to investors posted on its website. The next update on the fund will be before 29 July, the next formal deadline for a review. Mr Woodford fuelled speculation that the fund could be locked for a long period, by reiterating that there is no ""prescribed limit"" to the suspension in avideo statement to investors.,external ""Of course, we understand that people want access to their money, they are very frustrated by not being able to deal in the fund. But we are using the timeâ.â.â.âto ensure we get the right outcomes for our investors,"" he added. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell said it was now ""imperative"" that Mr Woodford communicated clearly with investors on progress. ""While this is difficult given liquidity is a moving target, investors deserve to be kept fully informed as the portfolio is repositioned."" Mr Hughes said the fund's performance had continued to deteriorate since the suspension, dropping 4% compared to a 3% rise in the FTSE All Share over the same period. Mr Woodford is one of the UK's biggest names in stockpicking - which is when a fund manager analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. He was widely celebrated for previous success, and backed until the suspension by huge investment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown - but both now face questions over how business was conducted amid criticism from investors. Neil Woodford faces regulator pressure over fees Hargreaves Lansdown boss apologises for Woodford suspension What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Investor Claire Jebson and her husband have some of their money locked up in the Woodford fund. It was supposed to be used to help pay for son Sam's university education which is due to start in September. However, she does not expect her money to be unlocked for another six to 12 months - missing the planned start of his studies. ""We didn't know this block could happen - our mistake. It is good that we all are aware now, but sad that this had to happen for us to find out,"" she said, echoing the views of many investors. ""We do have a back-up plan and I am sure others are in a worse position."" Paul Madon, from Leicester, said he expected the value of the investment to drop sharply when the suspension is eventually lifted. ""I thought [the Woodford fund] would be boringly safe. It was not,"" the 67-year-old said. ""I will get out as soon as I can, and take the loss."" Stuart Evans based his investment on Hargreaves Lansdown recommendations Stuart Evans, who is saving for his grandchildren and spoke of his frustration with Hargreaves Lansdownlast month, also said he expected to take a ""big hit"" when the fund eventually reopens. When the fund launched five years ago, Mr Woodford's previous record meant thousands of investors trusted him with their money. At its peak, the Woodford Equity Income Fund managed Â£10.2bn worth of assets, such as local authority pension funds. In its first year, there were returns of 18% on investors' money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, far from uniquely, this was followed by struggles in the last couple of years. Neil Woodford is under the regulator's microscope As a result, the fund has brought very little return for investors who have been in it throughout. Figures from FE Analytics show the fund has made a total return of 0.36% since its launch. It also meant that investors pulled out at an increasingly rapid rate. The fund now manages Â£3.7bn, according to the financial services and research firm Morningstar. Owing to this ""increased level of redemptions"", Mr Woodford and his backers said investors would not be allowed to ""redeem, purchase or transfer shares"" in the fund. In effect, it was suspended while they reordered the fund. There has been criticism that, in the meantime, Mr Woodford has continued to charge management fees to customers. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee of MPs, said fees should be halted while trading in the fund was suspended.

US probe after black man held while on IV machineThe patient said he was accused of trying to steal the machine while he went for a walk.US & Canada,"The patient was being treated for pneumonia (file photo) US police are investigating the arrest of a black patient in Illinois who was detained near a hospital while attached to an intravenous (IV) machine.
