UK charities launch Indonesia appeal,"An appeal to help the survivors of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has been launched by the UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC). More than 1,300 people are known to have died following Friday's disaster. The 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the central island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami. DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said ""devastated communities"" urgently required clean drinking water, food, medical care and shelter. He said: ""DEC member charities and their local partners are working closely with the Indonesian authorities to get aid to those who urgently need it."" The committee brings together 14 UK charities when crisis hits poorer countries The charities include Age International, British Red Cross, CAFOD, Christian Aid, Islamic Relief Worldwide, Oxfam GB, and Save the Children UK The 2004 tsunami earthquake appeal raised Â£392m, while the 2010 Haiti earthquake appeal raised Â£107m Aid supplies are beginning to arrive in the coastal city of Palu, where survivors have no access to running water or electricity. The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says there are nearly 200,000 people in urgent need of assistance, about a quarter of them children. Indonesia tsunami deaths pass 1,300 The UK government said on Tuesday it would send a transport aircraft filled with urgent aid to Indonesia. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said thousands of shelter kits, solar lanterns and water purifiers were being sent to the disaster zone. DEC will show its appeal on major UK television and radio stations on Thursday.

Children told escape was an 'adventure',"A couple who fled Grenfell Tower told their children they were going on a ""night-time adventure"" as they escaped. In a written statement to the inquiry into the blaze, Jamie Murray and Mahad Egal said they were woken up by frantic knocking from their neighbour, who lived in the flat where the fire began. They told Zak, three, and Vega, one, they were playing the ""look at the sky at night"" game to stop them panicking. The couple spoke on the first day of evidence from survivors at the inquiry. A total of 72 people died as a result of the fire on 14 June 2017. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us Grenfell bereaved to decide site's future Ms Murray described in the statement how they covered their children's heads with wet towels before making their escape. ""As we were lined up in our flat next to the door, Mahad was standing in front of me holding Zak [and] I was behind him holding Vega,"" she said. ""I remember him saying to the children, 'we're going to go outside, we're going to go play hide and seek, which is why we're covering your heads... and then we're going to have a night-time adventure and look at the sky and try to find Venus'."" CCTV showed the family got out just before 01:00 BST, and then watched as the place they called their ""forever home"" - which they had moved into only months before - went up in flames. In the statement, Ms Murray said: ""They say home is where the heart is and this is what I feel has been taken away from us. ""Everything apart from our lives was taken away from us - they took away my children's comfort, they took away a part of me because I feel like I've changed. ""Now I just worry about what tomorrow is going to bring and whether tomorrow will come."" Mr Egal added: ""Before the fire, I had built a life for us at Grenfell Tower. We had dreams and aspirations that were shattered. ""Our lives have been destroyed."" Earlier, one of the last people to be rescued from the tower described how he waited for four hours to be rescued and ate porridge to keep his energy up. Antonio Roncolato, who lived on the 10th floor for 27 years, was only alerted to the fire when his son Christopher called him at around 01:40. After seeing a picture of the blaze from the outside, sent to him by his son, he tried to escape, but the corridors were filled with black smoke. Mr Roncolato said: ""I was stunned at this photo... then I really started to focus on how to get out of the tower alive. ""I knew that one mistake would be fatal. "" Antonio Roncolato lived in Grenfell Tower for 27 years Mr Roncolato's son told a fire marshal his father's location, and he was told to ""stay put"" as the fire was not near his flat. Feeling reassured, he said he called his boss to tell him he would not be in for work later that day. ""I kept thinking if I remained calm and acted rationally that I would come out of this alive."" It wasn't until 06:00 that two firefighters knocked on his door and helped him get out of the block. In his statement, Mr Roncolato said the fire had ""devastated the entire community"". ""We have lost everything, including our homes and all our memories and possessions,"" he said. ""There is nothing left. ""I was one of the lucky ones, especially after being trapped for so long."" Maria De Fatima Alves also gave evidence to the inquiry and provided a written statement, describing the guilt she felt after escaping from the blaze. Mrs Alves, who had lived in a flat on the 13th floor for 18 years, got out of the building at 01:00 and watched from a friend's home as the tower burned. CCTV showed Mrs Alves getting out of a lift and leaving the building She told the inquiry: ""I still think about what I could've done more. ""I often wonder if I had stayed at the tower and buzzed people to wake them up and get them out whether more lives could have been saved. ""This guilt haunts me."" Survivors of the fire, along with those who lost loved ones and others who lived nearby, will be giving evidence to the inquiry for around a month. What happened at Grenfell Tower?

Ronaldo 'firmly' denies rape allegation,"Ms Mayorga alleges she was raped after meeting the footballer at a Las Vegas nightclub Kathryn Mayorga, the former teacher who has accused footballer Cristiano Ronaldo of raping her in 2009, was inspired to speak out by the #MeToo movement, her lawyer has said. ""The MeToo movement and the women who have stood up and disclosed sexual assaults has given Kathryn a lot of courage,"" Leslie Stovall said. Ronaldo has ""firmly"" denied assaulting Ms Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel. He spoke out ahead of her lawyers giving a press conference on Wednesday. The Juventus forward, 33, said he was calm over ""any and all investigations"" as he had a ""clear"" conscience over the allegation. Ms Mayorga did not attend the press conference. Her lawyer Mr Stovall said she had left Las Vegas to escape the media scrutiny. ""She has decided not to make herself available to the media and stay out of the public because of her emotional state,"" he told reporters. ""It is not pleasant for her."" In a lawsuit, Ms Mayorga says she met Ronaldo at the Rain Nightclub in the Palms Hotel and Casino, and that he raped her in his penthouse suite. Mr Stovall said his client had suffered from major depression and considered suicide since the alleged assault almost a decade ago. He said a psychiatrist had diagnosed Ms Mayorga with post-traumatic stress disorder. Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegation ""fake news"" The lawyer said that Ronaldo has 20 days to respond to Ms Mayorga's lawsuit. Her legal team are considering releasing documents linked to the case, including the initial police report and medical records. The Portuguese international had previously said the allegation, first reported in German magazine Der Spiegel, was ""fake news"".

Der Spiegel said Ms Mayorga, 34, had filed a report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. But the next year, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Her lawyers are now seeking to declare the non-disclosure agreement void. Las Vegas police confirmed on Tuesdaythey had initially investigated a complaint in June 2009,but added they had no suspect in the case. ""At the time the report was taken, the victim did not provide detectives with the location of the incident or suspect description,"" a statement said. ""As of September 2018, the case has been reopened and our detectives are following up on information being provided,"" it added. Ronaldo's lawyers have previously said they willsue Der Spiegel magazineover its reporting.

Putin labels ex-spy Skripal a 'scumbag',"President Putin has maintained the suspects in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal are civilians Russian President Vladimir Putin has labelled poisoned ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"". In a speech, he complained that the media were treating Mr Skripal as ""some kind of human rights defender"", insisting he had betrayed his country. Mr Skripal and his daughter survived an attack in Salisbury, which the UK says was carried out by two agents of Russian military intelligence. But a British woman died in another poisoning that police say was linked. UK authorities believe Mr Skripal's door in the southern English city was targeted with the nerve agent Novichok. It was sprayed from a modified perfume bottle that was later picked up and given to Dawn Sturgess, who died in July, they say. Russian woman 'identifies' Salisbury suspect Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Last month, President Putin insisted that the suspects named by UK police were civilians not criminals, and urged them to come forward. They later gave a televised interview. He said on Wednesday that he thought the whole ""information campaign"" surrounding the former Russian spy had been ""blown up"" and that it would pass, ""the sooner, the better"". Mr Skripal is a former Russian intelligence officer, who was arrested in 2004 and put on trial for ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by a Moscow military court. Authorities accused him of being a double-agent who shared Russian state secrets with Britain's MI6. Mr Skripal has lived in the UK since being released in a prisoner swap He confessed and co-operated at trial and was then jailed for 13 years, but was pardoned in 2010 then released to the UK as part of a prisoner exchange. The former spy at centre of poison mystery Who is Sergei Skripal? ""I see that some of our colleagues are pushing the theory that Mr Skripal was almost some kind of human rights activist,"" Mr Putin said on Wednesday. The Russian leader, a former intelligence officer himself, then described Mr Skripal as a ""traitor to the motherland"". ""He's simply a scumbag, that's all."" By Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent The verbal attack on Sergei Skripal underlines Vladimir Putin's personal hatred of betrayal. He's said before it's the one thing he can't forgive. Many Russians share that contempt, and there was applause from some in the conference hall for the comments. But Mr Putin's outburst also seems meant to distract from increasing talk about the two key suspects in the poisoning. Last month, at another conference, he was asked about the men. He vouched for them personally, saying there was ""nothing special"" and ""nothing criminal"" about them. Crucially, he also insisted they were civilians. Since then, credible evidence has emerged that the men are in fact military intelligence officers and investigative journalists are still digging. On that, Vladimir Putin has so far remained silent. The UK says two Russian nationals who travelled under the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov tried to kill the ex-spy and his daughter Yulia. The two suspects gave a televised interview in Russia in which they claimed to be ""just tourists"" visiting the city of Salisbury because of their interest in its 123m (400ft) spire. Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far However, their story was widely mocked in Russia as well as the UK,  and one of the men was subsequently identified by an investigative website as Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, an officer in Russia's GRU military intelligence. The Bellingcat website released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) The website, Bellingcat, said Col Chepiga had been made ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" by President Putin himself in 2014. Speaking to the BBC,a woman in the town where Chepiga grew up then then identified the Salisbury suspectas the intelligence officer. On Wednesday Mr Putin dismissed the allegation that Russia was responsible for Ms Sturgess's death. ""Sometimes I'm amazed by what's going on around this case: so some guys came to Great Britain and started poisoning homeless people? What nonsense!"" he said. BBC Monitoring About a fortnight after the poisoning, President Putin said any suggestions of Russian involvement were ""total nonsense"", and called it ""unthinkable that anyone in Russia would do such a thing ahead of the presidential election and the Fifa World Cup"". In May, Mr Putin denied that Mr Skripal was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, saying he would have died ""on the scene"" if that was the case. ""A military toxic agent is so powerful that it kills a person instantaneously,"" the president added. He went on to deny that Russia had any chemical agents: ""We have destroyed all our chemical weapons."" After Sergei Skripal was discharged from hospital later in May, Mr Putin sounded delighted. ""God bless his health, we're very glad about this,"" the president told a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""Thank God he's recoveredâ¦ and I hope he'll be healthy.""

Republicans deplore Trump mocking accuser,"This video can not be played Mr Trump cast doubt on Prof Ford's credibility US President Donald Trump is facing criticism from fellow Republicans after he mocked a woman who says she was assaulted by his Supreme Court nominee. Senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, both key votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, called Mr Trump's remarks ""appalling"" and ""just plain wrong"". At a rally, Mr Trump poked fun at Christine Blasey Ford for not recalling key details of the alleged assault. Last week the Republican president called her a ""very credible witness"". What will the FBI investigation actually do? Are young men in America scared? If approved, Judge Kavanaugh, 53, would be expected to tilt the ideological balance of the Supreme Court in favour of conservatives. Its nine justices are appointed for life and have the final say on some of the most contentious issues in US public life, from abortion, to gun control, to voting laws. Mr Flake - who helped spur the FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh - told NBC's Today show: ""There's no time and no place for remarks like that. ""To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. It's just not right. I wish he hadn't had done it."" Judge Brett Kavanaugh (L) and Professor Christine Blasey Ford The Arizona senator is a closely watched swing vote as Republicans can potentially only afford one defection if they are to confirm their nominee. Ms Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, told reporters on Wednesday: ""The president's comments were just plain wrong."" She has not yet said whether she will vote for Judge Kavanaugh either. Later on Wednesday, moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski joined in the criticism, saying Mr Trump's speech was ""wholly inappropriate"" and ""unacceptable"". ""I am taking everything into account,"" Senator Murkowski said when asked by reporters if it may affect her vote. Prof Ford's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, described Mr Trump's words as ""a vicious, vile and soulless attack"" on her. ""Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well?"" he added. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday denounced Mr Trump's ""outright mockery of a sexual assault survivor"". At a briefing at the White House, Mr Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said she did not think the president's performance had made the approval more difficult. At Tuesday night's rally in Mississippi, Mr Trump mocked gaps in Prof Ford's memory about the alleged assault 36 years ago. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh He said: ""Where's the house? I don't know! Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know! But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Shortly after Prof Ford's testimony to the Senate last week, Mr Trump said she was a ""very fine woman"". When she spoke before the Senate committee last Thursday, Prof Ford recalled that the house where the alleged assault took place was in the Chevy Chase-Bethesda area in the Washington DC suburbs. The president seemed to suggest she did not know on what floor of the property the alleged attack had occurred, but Prof Ford told senators she remembered being pushed into a bedroom on the upstairs level. This video can not be played ""Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling"" She testified that Judge Kavanaugh held his hand over her mouth to prevent her shouts from being heard, and attempted to rape her at the party in the summer of 1982. Prof Ford did acknowledge in her testimony that she could not provide all the details asked of her - including how she arrived at the party or how she left it and where exactly it took place. Experts have said it is not unusual for victims of trauma to remember certain details vividly but have little recollection of other things. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Prof Ford's legal team has released a statement to rebut claims by a purported ex-boyfriend of hers. Fox News has obtained a letter,externalfrom the unnamed man contradicting her testimony that she had never given anyone advice on taking lie-detector tests. The unidentified man says he witnessed the California psychology professor coach a friend on how to take a polygraph while applying for a government job. Prof Ford's legal team released a statement from Prof Ford's friend, Monica McLean, the woman named in the purported ex-boyfriend's letter. Ms McLean denied that Prof Ford had ever had any ""type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at anytime"". Allow Twitter content?

Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans on Tuesday took the extraordinary step of releasing another letter attacking another Kavanaugh accuser, Julie Swetnick. The correspondence was sent by a man identifying himself as a former boyfriend of Ms Swetnick. Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, told the Washington Post the letter was ""bogus and outrageous"". Ms Swetnick accuses Judge Kavanaugh of involvement in alleged drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. The FBI's confidential investigation is due to be completed by Friday, but some reports have suggested it could be completed as early as Wednesday. According to US media reports, at least five people have been questioned so far. Four of those interviewed attended a 1 July 1982 event which was listed on a calendar that Mr Kavanaugh has produced to show what he did at the time. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate must vote on confirming Mr Kavanaugh this week. Are young men in America scared?

'Slavery victim lived in shed for 40 years',"The man was said to be living in a shed containing just a chair and soiled bedding A potential victim of modern slavery has been rescued after living in a shed for 40 years, according to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. Officers found the 58-year-old British man with just a chair and soiled bedding during a raid at a residential site north of Carlisle on Wednesday. He was taken away to be assessed by specialist medical staff. A 79-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of modern slavery offences. Martin Plimmer from the GLAA said: ""The information that was given to us was that he had been kept in the shed for a period of 40 years. ""When we found him he was like a rabbit in headlights and very confused. ""He was just in the clothes he stood up in and where he was sleeping in the shed there was just a soiled duvet on the floor. ""There was no heating and it was very cold. It was conditions that no human being should live in."" Mr Plimmer said the man appeared to have been made to carry out unpaid work from the age of 16 or 17. He said it was unclear whether the man had ever tried to leave. ""He has been traumatised for such a length of time that it will be a slow process to win back his trust,"" Mr Plimmer added. He said the 79-year-old arrested man would be questioned in due course. Mr Plimmer added: ""In my long career I've never come across anyone who has been held as a slave potentially for 40 years and this, I think, could be the longest period of captivity that we have dealt with. ""It's an extremely sad and serious case."" The raid resulted from a call to a confidential helpline, Mr Plimmer said. The operation was supported by the National Crime Agency and Cumbria Police.

ITV's This Morning brought its floating weather map back to Liverpool's Albert Dock for its 30th anniversary, but the segment didn't go entirely to plan. Alison Hammond was the stand-in weather host on Wednesday's programme, but she accidentally pushed a man dressed as a sailor off the map and into the dock. Hosts Phillip and Holly could barely contain themselves after the mishap. ""It's gonna be a little bit wet in Northern Ireland as you can see,"" Alison joked. This Morning: 'Completely different from any other TV show' This Morning's most iconic moments Hammond had the job of navigating the weather map with the aid of two male models in sailors' hats, who were topless apart from a pair of braces. They had the task of holding on to the presenter as she jumped across the Irish Sea - but she pushed one of them square in the chest, causing him to lose his balance and fall into the water. Back in the studio, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby looked stunned at what had just unfolded, with Phillip suggesting: ""Put your cape around him!"" Hammond apologised profusely as he hauled himself back onto the map, and as she duly wrapped him up in her multi-coloured cape. The map was made famous by Fred Talbot, who did the weather between 1988 and 2001 but went on to bejailed for indecently assaulting schoolboys. He wasn't mentioned on the anniversary. Some viewers were unhappy that it had been brought back at all, given its association with Talbot. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Matley died in April aged 36after taking crystal meth and falling from a 13th floor balcony in east London. The Irish singer had arrived at the flat of a friend under the influence of the Class A drug and was later locked out on the balcony. Trying to climb down, he fell and died from ""multiple traumatic injuries"".

They went on to release five albums, four of which charted in the UK top 10.

Ahmed: PM makes Budget trickier,"So, there's the headline. ""Austerity is over,"" says the prime minister. After eight years of cuts which has seen Â£45bn (or 10% in some years) stripped from central government spending, Theresa May has said she ""gets it"". ""The British people need to know that the end is in sight,"" she said. The crucial review of public spending next year will not be about cuts in the future, it will be about opening the spending taps, the PM suggested. You can imagine the rather blanched faces at the Treasury, preparing for a somewhat earlier challenge for the public finances - the Budget in just over three weeks' time. A Budget which will be delivered against a backdrop of relatively low growth and continuing Brexit risk to the economy. Philip Hammond is always wary of announcing the ""end of austerity"", given the fragility of economic growth and the fact that many cuts, such as to benefits, have yet to work through the system. People are still feeling the pain. He is keener to emphasise that the effort expended bringing the public finances back towards balance - where the government raises in revenues the same at it spends on services - will not be put at risk with some form of ""spending splurge"". The PM just made that task harder. Earlier in the year, Theresa May announced a multi-billion pound boost for the NHS - a move she emphasised again today. She has said that taxes will have to rise to pay for it. Mr Hammond has beenobliged to agree. Today Mrs May announced the freezing of fuel duty for the ninth year in a row - which cuts out one potential tax rise available to the Treasury. She also said that the borrowing cap for local councils wanting to build new homes will be scrapped. Which, depending on how the Office for National Statistics account for it, could well add to the national debt and eat into the government's efforts at deficit reduction. This was the response of George Osborne's former chief of staff, Rupert Harrison. ""This is a big deal,""he tweeted,external. ""Treasury will hate it so TM [Mrs May] has clearly imposed it on No 11. ""Are the ONS going to change the way this borrowing is treated? ""If not then this will add to the deficit, even if it is in theory borrowing to create an asset."" Mr Harrison is still closely connected to those with Mr Hammond's ear. Yes, Mrs May did say that the ""end of austerity"" was dependent on a ""good Brexit deal"". And that's a pretty Godzilla-sized if. It is also a promise about future years, not a promise about now. But, the words are out and such details are likely to be lost in the public's mind. The Conservative Party even put the ""end of austerity"" text in bold in the speech text - just to make it extra clear. Before this PM's speech, Mr Hammond had a difficult hand to play on Budget day. Keeping the fiscal headroom - the public spending war chest - the Treasury believes it needs in case Brexit does turn into a calamitous, disorderly affair. Which could damage the economy significantly. The Chancellor also has to find money for the NHS. And discover which taxes, if any, he can possibly increase which will be palatable to a parliament where the Conservatives do not have a majority. After Theresa May's hour at the podium, that job just became considerably harder.

Why was May dancing? And did it work?,"This video can not be played Moves like May: The prime minister's dances What skills do you look for in a prime minister? Is it being a good communicator? Having business acumen? A connection with real people? Or is it how they shake their money maker to disco classics? On Wednesday, Theresa May seemed to focus on the latter, making her entrance for her big conference speechby boogieing to Abba's Dancing Queen. It's not the first time the PM has shown off her footwork.

Harry and Meghan thrill Sussex crowds,"The royal couple were given their titles on their wedding day Adoring crowds met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their first official visit to the county that features in their royal titles. The couple, who got married in May, visited some of the region's most well-known sites on a whistle-stop tour. They were greeted with cheers at each stop of their eagerly-anticipated trip and, in one case, chants of ""Harry"". The tour took Harry and Meghan to Chichester, Bognor, Brighton and Peacehaven. In Brighton, the duke's arrival was soundtracked by a chorus of ""Harry, Harry, Harry"" as well-wishers caught their first glimpse of the sixth in line to the throne. He was photographed at the town's pavilions eagerly exchanging handshakes and high-fives with a group of schoolchildren. This video can not be played The Duke dished out handshakes to excited schoolchildren in Brighton While on the final leg of the tour, in Peacehaven, Meghan was spotted rushing to the aid of one young girl who stood in the crowd in tears. The kind-hearted duchess was seen holding 10-year-old Kara Fairhall's hand and comforting the youngster for some time. As it happened: Harry and Meghan's first Sussex visit Speaking later, Kara said: ""I felt a lot better afterwards and I said thank you to her. ""She's really nice and I was really happy I got to meet her."" Elsewhere, Harry and Meghan met dozens of other royal fans, viewed historical artefacts and were treated to musical performances. Here's how the day unfolded. Warm welcome: The Duchess was handed flowers by some well-wishers When they finally arrived in the West Sussex cathedral city, Harry and Meghan were met with a rapturous reception. The duchess was seen dabbing her eyes and greeting people with smiles amid the chorus of cheers. Well-wishers held out a banner asking for a royal wave Both spent time mingling with crowds on a royal walkabout, where many school children waited, hoping to hand gifts and flowers to the royal pair.

Her lawyer Mr Stovall said she had left Las Vegas to escape the media scrutiny. ""She has decided not to make herself available to the media and stay out of the public because of her emotional state,"" he told reporters. ""It is not pleasant for her."" In a lawsuit, Ms Mayorga says she met Ronaldo at the Rain Nightclub in the Palms Hotel and Casino, and that he raped her in his penthouse suite. Mr Stovall said his client had suffered from major depression and considered suicide since the alleged assault almost a decade ago. He said a psychiatrist had diagnosed Ms Mayorga with post-traumatic stress disorder. Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegation ""fake news"" The lawyer said that Ronaldo has 20 days to respond to Ms Mayorga's lawsuit.

'Slavery victim lived in shed for 40 years'The 58-year-old was found during a dawn raid by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority.Cumbria,"The man was said to be living in a shed containing just a chair and soiled bedding A potential victim of modern slavery has been rescued after living in a shed for 40 years, according to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. Officers found the 58-year-old British man with just a chair and soiled bedding during a raid at a residential site north of Carlisle on Wednesday. He was taken away to be assessed by specialist medical staff. A 79-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of modern slavery offences. Martin Plimmer from the GLAA said: ""The information that was given to us was that he had been kept in the shed for a period of 40 years. ""When we found him he was like a rabbit in headlights and very confused. ""He was just in the clothes he stood up in and where he was sleeping in the shed there was just a soiled duvet on the floor. ""There was no heating and it was very cold. It was conditions that no human being should live in."" Mr Plimmer said the man appeared to have been made to carry out unpaid work from the age of 16 or 17. He said it was unclear whether the man had ever tried to leave. ""He has been traumatised for such a length of time that it will be a slow process to win back his trust,"" Mr Plimmer added. He said the 79-year-old arrested man would be questioned in due course. Mr Plimmer added: ""In my long career I've never come across anyone who has been held as a slave potentially for 40 years and this, I think, could be the longest period of captivity that we have dealt with. ""It's an extremely sad and serious case."" The raid resulted from a call to a confidential helpline, Mr Plimmer said. The operation was supported by the National Crime Agency and Cumbria Police. Carlisle City Council's private sector housing team, which was investigating possible health and safety breaches, was also involved.

X-Men actress Fan Bingbing fined millions,"Fan Bingbing is one of the world's highest paid actors Chinese mega star Fan Bingbing has been fined around 883 million yuan ($129m; Â£98.9m) for tax evasion and other offences, authorities said Wednesday. The star, who disappeared in July, posted a long apology on social media. Ms Fan, who is one of China's highest paid actors, will escape criminal charges if the fines are paid on time, said state news agency Xinhua. The actress had been linked to a government probe into how celebrities reported earnings in their contracts. Fan's 'disappearance' worries fans Vanished star 'not socially responsible' Praise in China for 'Tory slap' reporter Some film stars were alleged to have used so-called ""yin-yang contracts"" - a practice where one contract sets out an actor's real earnings, and another details a lower figure, with the latter submitted to the tax authorities. Authorities have now ordered Ms Fan and the companies she controls to pay the huge sum in taxes, fines and penalties. The 37-year-old actress, who appeared in the X-Men and Iron Man film franchises, has not been seen in public since 1 July and her whereabouts have been the subject of intense speculation. Her current location is unknown but reports say she has been held in secret detention. On Wednesday, the star posted an open apology to her tens of millions of fans on her Weibo account saying: ""I've been suffering unprecedented pain recentlyâ¦ I'm so ashamed of what I've done. Here, I sincerely apologise to everyone. ""I completely accept all the penalty decisions made according to law, after the investigation done by tax authorities. I will follow the order, try my best to overcome difficulties, raise fund, pay taxes and fines."" China to cap film star pay She also praised the ruling Chinese Communist Party in her statement, saying: ""Without the good policies of the party and the state, and without the love of the people, there would be no Fan Bingbing."" Ms Fan's agent has been detained by the police for further investigation. Her studio had previously said the star never signed ""yin-yang"" contracts. Ms Fan is a household name in China and has had roles in several Hollywood blockbusters BBC China correspondent Robin Brant said Ms Fan was the latest high profile figure outside of politics in China to disappear from view over allegations of corruption or tax evasion. The actress is one of China's most influential celebrities and last year topped Forbes magazine's list of top Chinese celebrities with income of around 300 million yuan ($43m). By Kerry Allen, China media analyst, BBC Monitoring Wednesday's Chinese media is dominated by reports on Fan Bingbing's reappearance, and hundreds of thousands of users of the popular Sina Weibo social media platform are discussing official media reports and her letter of apology. The official CCTV broadcaster stresses that she has not committed a crime but will be given an administrative punishment. However, Ms Fan has fallen out of favour with the Chinese public over the recent allegations, and users are not sympathetic towards her following her apology, given the millions of dollars in taxes state media say she evaded. Some express relief that she has reappeared on social media after her lengthy silence. But many say that they don't think her apology is sufficient and say she should go to prison or be blacklisted by the entertainment industry. Some feel her celebrity status has saved her from conviction and say that regular Chinese would be held criminally responsible for much smaller amounts of money. In any case, it is extremely difficult for Chinese celebrities to bounce back after a scandal - especially one of this magnitude. Fans question Chinese star's whereabouts Vanished China star gets 0% 'goodness' rating China puts limit on film stars' pay New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Republicans deplore Trump mocking accuserThe US president poked fun at Christine Blasey Ford for not recalling details of her alleged assault.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Mr Trump cast doubt on Prof Ford's credibility US President Donald Trump is facing criticism from fellow Republicans after he mocked a woman who says she was assaulted by his Supreme Court nominee. Senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, both key votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, called Mr Trump's remarks ""appalling"" and ""just plain wrong"". At a rally, Mr Trump poked fun at Christine Blasey Ford for not recalling key details of the alleged assault. Last week the Republican president called her a ""very credible witness"". What will the FBI investigation actually do? Are young men in America scared? If approved, Judge Kavanaugh, 53, would be expected to tilt the ideological balance of the Supreme Court in favour of conservatives. Its nine justices are appointed for life and have the final say on some of the most contentious issues in US public life, from abortion, to gun control, to voting laws. Mr Flake - who helped spur the FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh - told NBC's Today show: ""There's no time and no place for remarks like that. ""To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. It's just not right. I wish he hadn't had done it."" Judge Brett Kavanaugh (L) and Professor Christine Blasey Ford The Arizona senator is a closely watched swing vote as Republicans can potentially only afford one defection if they are to confirm their nominee. Ms Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, told reporters on Wednesday: ""The president's comments were just plain wrong."" She has not yet said whether she will vote for Judge Kavanaugh either. Later on Wednesday, moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski joined in the criticism, saying Mr Trump's speech was ""wholly inappropriate"" and ""unacceptable"". ""I am taking everything into account,"" Senator Murkowski said when asked by reporters if it may affect her vote. Prof Ford's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, described Mr Trump's words as ""a vicious, vile and soulless attack"" on her. ""Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well?"" he added. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday denounced Mr Trump's ""outright mockery of a sexual assault survivor"". At a briefing at the White House, Mr Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said she did not think the president's performance had made the approval more difficult. At Tuesday night's rally in Mississippi, Mr Trump mocked gaps in Prof Ford's memory about the alleged assault 36 years ago. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh He said: ""Where's the house? I don't know! Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know! But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Shortly after Prof Ford's testimony to the Senate last week, Mr Trump said she was a ""very fine woman"". When she spoke before the Senate committee last Thursday, Prof Ford recalled that the house where the alleged assault took place was in the Chevy Chase-Bethesda area in the Washington DC suburbs. The president seemed to suggest she did not know on what floor of the property the alleged attack had occurred, but Prof Ford told senators she remembered being pushed into a bedroom on the upstairs level. This video can not be played ""Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling"" She testified that Judge Kavanaugh held his hand over her mouth to prevent her shouts from being heard, and attempted to rape her at the party in the summer of 1982. Prof Ford did acknowledge in her testimony that she could not provide all the details asked of her - including how she arrived at the party or how she left it and where exactly it took place. Experts have said it is not unusual for victims of trauma to remember certain details vividly but have little recollection of other things. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Prof Ford's legal team has released a statement to rebut claims by a purported ex-boyfriend of hers. Fox News has obtained a letter,externalfrom the unnamed man contradicting her testimony that she had never given anyone advice on taking lie-detector tests. The unidentified man says he witnessed the California psychology professor coach a friend on how to take a polygraph while applying for a government job. Prof Ford's legal team released a statement from Prof Ford's friend, Monica McLean, the woman named in the purported ex-boyfriend's letter. Ms McLean denied that Prof Ford had ever had any ""type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at anytime"". Allow Twitter content?

Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans on Tuesday took the extraordinary step of releasing another letter attacking another Kavanaugh accuser, Julie Swetnick. The correspondence was sent by a man identifying himself as a former boyfriend of Ms Swetnick. Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, told the Washington Post the letter was ""bogus and outrageous"". Ms Swetnick accuses Judge Kavanaugh of involvement in alleged drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. The FBI's confidential investigation is due to be completed by Friday, but some reports have suggested it could be completed as early as Wednesday. According to US media reports, at least five people have been questioned so far. Four of those interviewed attended a 1 July 1982 event which was listed on a calendar that Mr Kavanaugh has produced to show what he did at the time.

Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, injured 22 people when he threw a corrosive substance in Mangle E8 in April 2017. The 25-year-old admitted throwing the liquid at the Dalston club but claimed he believed it was a date rape drug. In December, Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, wasjailed for 20 years at Wood Green Crown Court. Three judges at the Court of Appeal in London rejected his bid for a sentence reduction at a hearing on Wednesday. This video can not be played CCTV of the acid attack in London club Collins wasfound guilty of five counts of GBH with intent and nine counts of ABH. In January, he was jailed for another eight months for using a smuggled mobile phone to call Ms McCann from his prison cell. Rejecting the appeal, Lord Justice Simon said: ""We accept that this was a severe sentence, but these were exceptionally serious offences, and the severe sentence was fully justified."" Of the 22 people injured as a result of the attack, 16 suffered serious burns. One man suffered third-degree chemical burns to the left side of the face and required a skin graft. Others had eye injuries. Collins had six previous convictions including using threatening words, possession of cocaine, drink-driving and assault.

Pret to label products after allergy death,"Pret a Manger will list all ingredients, including allergens, on its freshly made products following the death of a teenager who had an allergic reaction after eating a Pret sandwich. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, went into cardiac arrest on a flight after buying a sandwich at Heathrow Airport in 2016. Theresa May called for a review of food labelling laws on Tuesday in the wake of her death. Clive Schlee, Pret chief executive, said again the firm was ""deeply sorry"". ""I said we would learn from this tragedy and ensure meaningful changes happen,"" he said. This video can not be played Pret a Manger's CEO Clive Schlee: ""We are making meaningful change"" ""I hope these measures set us on course to drive change in the industry so people with allergies are as protected and informed as possible. Nothing is more important to Pret right now."" The chain will start trialling full ingredient labelling on product packaging from next month and roll it out to all UK outlets as quickly as possible. Natasha's parents gave a ""cautious"" welcome to Pret's move: ""Pret says it has recognised there is much more it can do, we agree. We will be inviting them to meet with us to outline how we think they can contribute to genuinely meaningful change."" The Food Standards Agency has a poster campaign on allergens Other chains are considering how they label their goods. Greggs, which has almost 2,000 UK outlets, said it was urgently reviewing its practices and procedures to understand how best to provide ingredient information to customers. It added: ""In the meantime, we have taken immediate action to increase the prominence and signposting of our allergen information on the digital screens in our shops and on our website."" Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? EpiPen shortage 'worrying' users An inquest into Natasha's death began last week and heard the artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette the teenager ate contained sesame - to which she was allergic. The coroner found Natasha had been ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging. Beatrice, whose real identity the BBC has agreed not to disclose, is also allergic to sesame seeds. She was in hospital for 12 hours after suffering an allergic reaction caused by a Pret sandwich. She was told Pret had promised to start a full labelling trial at the start of this year. ""It's good that Pret has finally taken this action but the cost to the family is too high,"" she told the BBC. ""It should never have happened. Why has it taken so long for them to introduce full labelling?"" Foods packaged on-site before sale do not require a specific allergen label attached under existing regulations. Takeaways and restaurants are only required to let customers know if any of the 14 most common dangerous allergens - including peanuts, eggs and milk - are ingredients in their food. However, freshly made, non pre-packaged food does not have to be individually labelled, according to the UK'sFood Regulations 2014,external. Natasha's parents have been campaigning to change food labelling laws, which they described as having ""played Russian roulette"" with their daughter's life.

""What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know,"" Mr Trump said. ""But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Days earlier he had said Prof Ford was a ""credible"" and ""compelling"" witness. Prof Ford told a Senate committee that Mr Kavanaugh assaulted her as a teenager, an allegation he denies. Mr Trump ordered the FBI to examine the claims following the Senate testimony. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh However, Prof Ford's lawyers say the FBI has not yet spoken to her and say it is ""inconceivable"" that the agency could conduct a thorough investigation without interviewing her. The FBI investigation is due to be completed by Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate must vote on confirming Mr Kavanaugh this week. He told supporters in the town of Southhaven that his political opponents had been ""trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced"". He then mocked Prof Ford's testimony, saying she appeared not to remember basic details about the alleged assault.

Shortly after Prof Ford's dramatic testimony to the Senate committee last week, Mr Trump said she was ""very compelling"" and described her as a ""very fine woman"". Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump reiterated his support for Mr Kavanaugh, saying he believed the Senate would approve the judge. He told reporters it was a ""very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of"". On Wednesday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake - who joined a committee vote in favour of the judge with the caveat of an FBI investigation - called the president's comments mocking Prof Ford ""appalling"".

Experts have said it is not unusual for victims of trauma to remember certain details vividly but have little recollection of other things that the brain may have accorded less significance to. Investigators have spoken to the key witness to the alleged assault on Prof Ford, Mr Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge. Prof Ford alleges that Mr Judge also took part in the assault at a high school party in 1982. Mr Judge has denied any memory of the incident. The agency has also spoken to the Judge Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who alleges that he exposed his genitals to her during a drinking game at Yale university. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking The truth about false assault accusations What will the FBI investigation actually do? Reuters reported that investigators spoke to Ms Ramirez for more than two hours on Sunday and she provided a list of more than 20 possible witnesses. However, Prof Ford's lawyers say they have had no contact from the FBI despite having tried to get in touch with them. They said the agency had not responded to the offer to interview Prof Ford, or ""a series of emails and letters in which we identified witnesses and evidence that would likely assist the FBI"". At least three other people who knew Mr Kavanaugh from his time at Yale have tried unsuccessfully to contact the FBI about the claims against him, Reuters reported. A lawyer for a third woman, Julie Swetnick - who alleges Judge Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s - has questioned why she has not been contacted by the FBI. Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? The judge has said he did not know Ms Swetnick and that her allegations ""never happened"". Senate committee Republicans on Tuesday took the extraordinary step of releasing an explicit letter attacking Ms Swetnick, sent by a man who claims to be a former boyfriend.

Johnson speech made May 'cross',"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""There are one or two things that Boris said that I am cross about"" Theresa May has told the BBC she is ""cross"" with Boris Johnson after the former foreign secretary launched a fresh attack on her plan for Brexit. The PM said Mr Johnson, who addressed an audience of more than 1,000 people at the Tory conference, could always be relied upon to put on a ""good show"". But she said parts of his speech about Northern Ireland angered her. ""He wanted to tear up our guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the UK."" Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July in protest at Brexit policy, was cheered by activists when he urged Mrs May to drop her plan for future co-operation with the EU. Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' Would young voters back Tories for Â£10,000? Brexit: All you need to know DUP 'won't accept' Brexit sea checks In a speech in Birmingham, he argued her blueprint, called the Chequers plan, was ""undemocratic"" as it kept the UK within the ""tractor beam"" of Brussels and was not what people voted for. Urging Mrs May to return to the vision she originally set out in her Lancaster House speech in early 2017, he warned ""if we get it wrong we will be punished"". This video can not be played In full: Theresa May interview with Laura Kuenssberg The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg The prime minister, who is publicly as controlled as they come, revealed a flash of polite irritation telling me that she is ""cross"" with the things Boris Johnson has said. Trust me, the things that people in government have been saying about him privately are often far worse than that. The view of some of Mr Johnson's former colleagues is that he is a charlatan, who never showed that he could do the work needed, to show the responsibility required, to make decisions that would affect the lives of the public. There are numerous anecdotes of how the former foreign secretary would make promises he never kept, wouldn't properly focus on the documents, the detail, that came across his desk in one of the highest offices in the land. However, in a moment of proper candour, another of his former colleagues who knows him well, told me that the truth is, ""we're all a bit jealous"". Read more from Laura But Mrs May told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that she had not watched the speech and she was putting the national interest first in the negotiations. Her plan, she said, was the only one that would minimise disruption to trade while also upholding the UK's territorial integrity and Northern Ireland's constitutional status within the UK. Proposals put forward by the EU and others which did not do that were unacceptable, she said. ""There are one or two things that Boris said that I am cross about,"" she said. ""You know we, he and I are all members of the Conservative and Unionist Party. That's because we believe in the union of the United Kingdom. This video can not be played People were queuing for hours to hear Mr Johnson attack Theresa May's Brexit plan ""Northern Ireland is part of that union. And we have a guarantee for the people of Northern Ireland and we are upholding that. Our Chequers plan does that it's the only plan on the table at the moment that does."" Pressed on whether she believed Mr Johnson, who in his speech urged his party to cut taxes and make the case for free markets, was undermining her authority, she replied: ""There's one thing we all know about Boris is that he'll put on a good show. ""But what we've been doing here at conference of course and I think what matters to people out there is what the government does and what we focus on in terms of their day to day lives and what really matters to them."" Mrs May, who will make her leader's speech to conference on Wednesday, has also been defending the government's post-Brexit immigration policy, details of which were unveiled earlier. It will prioritise high-skilled workers and ensure EU nationals are treated the same as those from the rest of the world. Low-skilled migration would fall when EU free movement access ends, she said, although a future trade deal with the EU could include a ""mobility"" agreement to enable businesses to bring qualified people into the country for short periods of time. ""I think people will feel a difference because they will know that for the first time in decades it is the UK government that is deciding who can come into the country,"" she said. ""We will be able to decide the basis on which people come to the UK,"" she said. ""That hasn't been possible for many years for people coming from the EU. That will change.""

"No tax rises on petrol, says May","Mrs May will bring the Conservative Party conference to a close with her keynote address Fuel duty is to be frozen for the ninth year in a row, the prime minister is to announce - saying the government is ""on the side of ""hard-working families"".

Last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the policy saved drivers money, but would cost the Treasury Â£38bn if it continued for another three years.

But AA president Edmund King said the freeze would bring relief to millions of UK drivers and businesses. ""The high pump prices are already forcing many families to cut back on journeys, household expenditure or both,"" he said. The average UK petrol price is currently 130.6p per litre, while diesel is 134.5p. In the past 12 months, average petrol prices have gone up by 11.5p a litre, with diesel up by 14p a litre. According to the RAC Foundation,external, 61% of the price of petrol and nearly 60% of the price of diesel is taxation. Mrs Maywill close the Conservative conferenceby declaring Britain's post-Brexit future is ""full of promise"" and vowing the ""best days lie ahead of us"". And, in confirming the fuel duty freeze, she will say the difference having a ""little bit of money left to put away at the end of the month"" cannot be ""measured in pounds and pence"".

Putin denounces ex-spy Skripal as 'scum',"President Putin has maintained the suspects in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal are civilians Russian President Vladimir Putin has labelled poisoned ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"". In a speech, he complained that the media were treating Mr Skripal as ""some kind of human rights defender"", insisting he had betrayed his country. Mr Skripal and his daughter survived an attack in Salisbury, which the UK says was carried out by two agents of Russian military intelligence. But a British woman died in another poisoning that police say was linked. UK authorities believe Mr Skripal's door in the southern English city was targeted with the nerve agent Novichok. It was sprayed from a modified perfume bottle that was later picked up and given to Dawn Sturgess, who died in July, they say. Russian woman 'identifies' Salisbury suspect Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Last month, President Putin insisted that the suspects named by UK police were civilians not criminals, and urged them to come forward. They later gave a televised interview. He said on Wednesday that he thought the whole ""information campaign"" surrounding the former Russian spy had been ""blown up"" and that it would pass, ""the sooner, the better"". Mr Skripal is a former Russian intelligence officer, who was arrested in 2004 and put on trial for ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by a Moscow military court. Authorities accused him of being a double-agent who shared Russian state secrets with Britain's MI6. Mr Skripal has lived in the UK since being released in a prisoner swap He confessed and co-operated at trial and was then jailed for 13 years, but was pardoned in 2010 then released to the UK as part of a prisoner exchange. The former spy at centre of poison mystery Who is Sergei Skripal? ""I see that some of our colleagues are pushing the theory that Mr Skripal was almost some kind of human rights activist,"" Mr Putin said on Wednesday. The Russian leader, a former intelligence officer himself, then described Mr Skripal as a ""traitor to the motherland"". ""He's simply a scumbag, that's all."" By Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent The verbal attack on Sergei Skripal underlines Vladimir Putin's personal hatred of betrayal. He's said before it's the one thing he can't forgive. Many Russians share that contempt, and there was applause from some in the conference hall for the comments. But Mr Putin's outburst also seems meant to distract from increasing talk about the two key suspects in the poisoning. Last month, at another conference, he was asked about the men. He vouched for them personally, saying there was ""nothing special"" and ""nothing criminal"" about them. Crucially, he also insisted they were civilians. Since then, credible evidence has emerged that the men are in fact military intelligence officers and investigative journalists are still digging. On that, Vladimir Putin has so far remained silent. The UK says two Russian nationals who travelled under the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov tried to kill the ex-spy and his daughter Yulia. The two suspects gave a televised interview in Russia in which they claimed to be ""just tourists"" visiting the city of Salisbury because of their interest in its 123m (400ft) spire. Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far However, their story was widely mocked in Russia as well as the UK,  and one of the men was subsequently identified by an investigative website as Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, an officer in Russia's GRU military intelligence. The Bellingcat website released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) The website, Bellingcat, said Col Chepiga had been made ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" by President Putin himself in 2014. Speaking to the BBC,a woman in the town where Chepiga grew up then then identified the Salisbury suspectas the intelligence officer. On Wednesday Mr Putin dismissed the allegation that Russia was responsible for Ms Sturgess's death. ""Sometimes I'm amazed by what's going on around this case: so some guys came to Great Britain and started poisoning homeless people? What nonsense!"" he said. BBC Monitoring About a fortnight after the poisoning, President Putin said any suggestions of Russian involvement were ""total nonsense"", and called it ""unthinkable that anyone in Russia would do such a thing ahead of the presidential election and the Fifa World Cup"". In May, Mr Putin denied that Mr Skripal was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, saying he would have died ""on the scene"" if that was the case. ""A military toxic agent is so powerful that it kills a person instantaneously,"" the president added. He went on to deny that Russia had any chemical agents: ""We have destroyed all our chemical weapons."" After Sergei Skripal was discharged from hospital later in May, Mr Putin sounded delighted. ""God bless his health, we're very glad about this,"" the president told a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""Thank God he's recoveredâ¦ and I hope he'll be healthy.""

Pret to label products after allergy deathIt will fully label ingredients on freshly made products after a girl died following an allergic reaction.Business,"Pret a Manger will list all ingredients, including allergens, on its freshly made products following the death of a teenager who had an allergic reaction after eating a Pret sandwich. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, went into cardiac arrest on a flight after buying a sandwich at Heathrow Airport in 2016. Theresa May called for a review of food labelling laws on Tuesday in the wake of her death. Clive Schlee, Pret chief executive, said again the firm was ""deeply sorry"". ""I said we would learn from this tragedy and ensure meaningful changes happen,"" he said. This video can not be played Pret a Manger's CEO Clive Schlee: ""We are making meaningful change"" ""I hope these measures set us on course to drive change in the industry so people with allergies are as protected and informed as possible. Nothing is more important to Pret right now."" The chain will start trialling full ingredient labelling on product packaging from next month and roll it out to all UK outlets as quickly as possible. Natasha's parents gave a ""cautious"" welcome to Pret's move: ""Pret says it has recognised there is much more it can do, we agree. We will be inviting them to meet with us to outline how we think they can contribute to genuinely meaningful change."" The Food Standards Agency has a poster campaign on allergens Other chains are considering how they label their goods. Greggs, which has almost 2,000 UK outlets, said it was urgently reviewing its practices and procedures to understand how best to provide ingredient information to customers. It added: ""In the meantime, we have taken immediate action to increase the prominence and signposting of our allergen information on the digital screens in our shops and on our website."" Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? EpiPen shortage 'worrying' users An inquest into Natasha's death began last week and heard the artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette the teenager ate contained sesame - to which she was allergic. The coroner found Natasha had been ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging. Beatrice, whose real identity the BBC has agreed not to disclose, is also allergic to sesame seeds. She was in hospital for 12 hours after suffering an allergic reaction caused by a Pret sandwich. She was told Pret had promised to start a full labelling trial at the start of this year. ""It's good that Pret has finally taken this action but the cost to the family is too high,"" she told the BBC. ""It should never have happened. Why has it taken so long for them to introduce full labelling?"" Foods packaged on-site before sale do not require a specific allergen label attached under existing regulations. Takeaways and restaurants are only required to let customers know if any of the 14 most common dangerous allergens - including peanuts, eggs and milk - are ingredients in their food. However, freshly made, non pre-packaged food does not have to be individually labelled, according to the UK'sFood Regulations 2014,external. Natasha's parents have been campaigning to change food labelling laws, which they described as having ""played Russian roulette"" with their daughter's life.

Protein research takes Chemistry NobelThe 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research.Science & Environment,"The 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research. Americans Frances Arnold and George P Smith will share the prize with Briton Gregory Winter, who is based at Cambridge University. This year's winners used a technique called directed evolution to create new proteins. These have been used in areas as diverse as the manufacture of new drugs and green fuels. Frances Arnold, from Caltech in Pasadena, was first to use a method mimicking natural selection in order to develop enzymes that would perform specific tasks. Enzymes are biological catalysts - which speed up chemical reactions in biological cells. Prof Arnold's directed evolution techniques are now routinely used to develop new enzymes. George P Smith and Sir Gregory Winter developed a technique called phage display to evolve new proteins. They used bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, to generate new antibodies - large proteins that are used by the immune system to neutralise harmful bacteria and viruses. The first antibody based on this method, adalimumab, was approved in 2002 and is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Since then, phage display has produced antibodies that can neutralise toxins, counteract autoimmune diseases and treat metastatic cancer. Prof Dame Carol Robinson, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said that directed evolution of enzymes and antibodies ""are now transforming medicine.  It would have been hard to predict the outcome of this research at the start - this speaks to the need for basic research"". Frances Arnold is the fifth woman to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry; the last female winner was Ada Yonath from Israel, who shared the 2009 award for discoveries in the structure and function of the ribosome - a minute particle involved in the synthesis of proteins in the body. On Tuesday, Donna Strickland became only the third female winner of the physics prize, and the first woman to win it in 55 years. Arnold will take one half of the nine million Swedish kronor (Â£770,686; $998,618) prize, while Smith and Winter will share the other half. A bacterial ""motor"" as seen with cryo-electron microscopy 2017 - Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the prizefor improving images of biological molecules 2016 - Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Fraser Stoddart and Bernard Feringa shared the prize for themaking machines on a molecular scale. 2015 -Discoveries in DNA repairearned Tomas Lindahl and Paul Modrich and Aziz Sancar the award. 2014 - Eric Betzig, Stefan Hell and William Moerner were awarded the prize forimproving the resolution of optical microscopes. 2013 - Michael Levitt, Martin Karplus and Arieh Warshel shared the prize, fordevising computer simulations of chemical processes. 2012 - Work that revealedhow protein receptors pass signals between living cells and the environmentwon the prize for Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka.

ITV's This Morning brought its floating weather map back to Liverpool's Albert Dock for its 30th anniversary, but the segment didn't go entirely to plan. Alison Hammond was the stand-in weather host on Wednesday's programme, but she accidentally pushed a man dressed as a sailor off the map and into the dock. Hosts Phillip and Holly could barely contain themselves after the mishap. ""It's gonna be a little bit wet in Northern Ireland as you can see,"" Alison joked. This Morning: 'Completely different from any other TV show' This Morning's most iconic moments Hammond had the job of navigating the weather map with the aid of two male models in sailors' hats, who were topless apart from a pair of braces. They had the task of holding on to the presenter as she jumped across the Irish Sea - but she pushed one of them square in the chest, causing him to lose his balance and fall into the water. Back in the studio, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby looked stunned at what had just unfolded, with Phillip suggesting: ""Put your cape around him!"" Hammond apologised profusely as he hauled himself back onto the map, and as she duly wrapped him up in her multi-coloured cape. The map was made famous by Fred Talbot, who did the weather between 1988 and 2001 but went on to bejailed for indecently assaulting schoolboys. He wasn't mentioned on the anniversary. Some viewers were unhappy that it had been brought back at all, given its association with Talbot. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nightclub acid attacker loses appeal,"Arthur Collins had denied knowing the substance he threw was acid A man who threw acid across a packed London nightclub has lost an appeal against his 20-year jail sentence. Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, injured 22 people when he threw a corrosive substance in Mangle E8 in April 2017. The 25-year-old admitted throwing the liquid at the Dalston club but claimed he believed it was a date rape drug. In December, Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, wasjailed for 20 years at Wood Green Crown Court. Three judges at the Court of Appeal in London rejected his bid for a sentence reduction at a hearing on Wednesday. This video can not be played CCTV of the acid attack in London club Collins wasfound guilty of five counts of GBH with intent and nine counts of ABH. In January, he was jailed for another eight months for using a smuggled mobile phone to call Ms McCann from his prison cell. Rejecting the appeal, Lord Justice Simon said: ""We accept that this was a severe sentence, but these were exceptionally serious offences, and the severe sentence was fully justified."" Of the 22 people injured as a result of the attack, 16 suffered serious burns. One man suffered third-degree chemical burns to the left side of the face and required a skin graft.

Love Island star's Instagram post banned,"Love Island star Olivia Buckland has had an Instagram post which promoted an eye shadow banned. It's because it was not clear it was an advert, says the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The post showed Olivia discussing the eye shadow from cosmetic brand W7 along with a caption which included the words: ""Can't wait to see what you guys create #BucksBeauty"". She's been told to ensure future adverts are ""obviously identifiable"". Warpaint Cosmetics, which goes by the name W7, and Olivia released a joint statement which confirmed the reality star was a brand ambassador for the company. Olivia recently married Alex Bowen who she met on Love Island in 2016 The brand said Olivia wasn't paid specifically to post on social media and the post was in a ""blog style"" - which was outside of their agreement. Warpaint went on to say that the Love Island contestant's relationship with W7 was ""sufficiently obvious"", but it was willing to make changes to the hashtags on similar posts in the future. The ASA said the contract between Warpaint and Olivia required her to ""promote the brand and products in a positive light at all times"". It said this would ""in effect restrict aspects of Ms Buckland's control of her social media content"". Olivia is the latest reality TV star to have a social media post banned It did say that in Olivia's Instagram bio she'd written she was an ambassador for the brand and she had also published two posts announcing her role with the company. But it said Instagram users who might not follow Olivia could look at her posts without seeing this information. On Friday, the ASAlaunched a guide,externalto help influencers and bloggers stick to advertising rules. Several stars includingMade in Chelsea's Louise Thompson, Millie Macintosh and Geordie Shore's Marnie Simpson have been told off for failing to make clear their posts were ads.

Ex-Plaid AM made indecent child images,"Simon Thomas arriving at court on Wednesday Former Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas has pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children. He admitted all charges put before him at Aberystwyth Magistrates Court. The court heard Thomas admitted making more than 500 indecent photographs of children and more than 70 films. He was bailed on condition that he surrendered his passport with police and will have no unsupervised contact with children under 16. He will appear before Mold Magistrates court on 31 October while pre-sentence reports are being prepared. Thomas quit the Senedd and his party after being arrested in July. Helen Mary Jones, who was next on Plaid's regional list for the Mid and West Wales seat, returned to the assembly to replace Mr Thomas in August. An NSPCC Cymru spokesman said: ""Thomas has admitted very serious offences and by accumulating this vile material has helped fuel the demand for more to be created and for more harm to be inflicted on vulnerable, young people.""

Protein research takes Chemistry Nobel,"The 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research. Americans Frances Arnold and George P Smith will share the prize with Briton Gregory Winter, who is based at Cambridge University. This year's winners used a technique called directed evolution to create new proteins. These have been used in areas as diverse as the manufacture of new drugs and green fuels. Frances Arnold, from Caltech in Pasadena, was first to use a method mimicking natural selection in order to develop enzymes that would perform specific tasks. Enzymes are biological catalysts - which speed up chemical reactions in biological cells. Prof Arnold's directed evolution techniques are now routinely used to develop new enzymes. George P Smith and Sir Gregory Winter developed a technique called phage display to evolve new proteins. They used bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, to generate new antibodies - large proteins that are used by the immune system to neutralise harmful bacteria and viruses. The first antibody based on this method, adalimumab, was approved in 2002 and is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Since then, phage display has produced antibodies that can neutralise toxins, counteract autoimmune diseases and treat metastatic cancer. Prof Dame Carol Robinson, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said that directed evolution of enzymes and antibodies ""are now transforming medicine.  It would have been hard to predict the outcome of this research at the start - this speaks to the need for basic research"". Frances Arnold is the fifth woman to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry; the last female winner was Ada Yonath from Israel, who shared the 2009 award for discoveries in the structure and function of the ribosome - a minute particle involved in the synthesis of proteins in the body. On Tuesday, Donna Strickland became only the third female winner of the physics prize, and the first woman to win it in 55 years. Arnold will take one half of the nine million Swedish kronor (Â£770,686; $998,618) prize, while Smith and Winter will share the other half. A bacterial ""motor"" as seen with cryo-electron microscopy 2017 - Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the prizefor improving images of biological molecules 2016 - Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Fraser Stoddart and Bernard Feringa shared the prize for themaking machines on a molecular scale. 2015 -Discoveries in DNA repairearned Tomas Lindahl and Paul Modrich and Aziz Sancar the award. 2014 - Eric Betzig, Stefan Hell and William Moerner were awarded the prize forimproving the resolution of optical microscopes. 2013 - Michael Levitt, Martin Karplus and Arieh Warshel shared the prize, fordevising computer simulations of chemical processes. 2012 - Work that revealedhow protein receptors pass signals between living cells and the environmentwon the prize for Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka.

"Trump mocks Kavanaugh accuser's testimonyThe US president ridiculed Christine Blasey Ford, saying she could not remember important details.US & Canada","This video can not be played Mr Trump cast doubt on Prof Ford's credibility President Donald Trump has mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford against his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at a rally in Mississippi. ""What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know,"" Mr Trump said. ""But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Days earlier he had said Prof Ford was a ""credible"" and ""compelling"" witness. Prof Ford told a Senate committee that Mr Kavanaugh assaulted her as a teenager, an allegation he denies. Mr Trump ordered the FBI to examine the claims following the Senate testimony. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh However, Prof Ford's lawyers say the FBI has not yet spoken to her and say it is ""inconceivable"" that the agency could conduct a thorough investigation without interviewing her. The FBI investigation is due to be completed by Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate must vote on confirming Mr Kavanaugh this week. He told supporters in the town of Southhaven that his political opponents had been ""trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced"". He then mocked Prof Ford's testimony, saying she appeared not to remember basic details about the alleged assault. This video can not be played ""Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling"" The audience laughed as the president said: ""Thirty-six years ago this happened: I had one beer! Well, you think it wasâ¦? Nope! It was one beer. ""Oh, good. How'd you get home? I don't remember. How'd you get there? I don't remember. Where was the place? I don't remember. ""How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know! What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know. ""Where's the house? I don't know! Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know! But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Shortly after Prof Ford's dramatic testimony to the Senate committee last week, Mr Trump said she was ""very compelling"" and described her as a ""very fine woman"". Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump reiterated his support for Mr Kavanaugh, saying he believed the Senate would approve the judge. He told reporters it was a ""very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of"". On Wednesday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake - who joined a committee vote in favour of the judge with the caveat of an FBI investigation - called the president's comments mocking Prof Ford ""appalling"". ""There's no time and no place for remarks like that,"" he said on NBC's Today show. ""To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. It's just not right. I wish he hadn't had done it."" Senator Flake is a closely watched swing vote on this issue because Republicans can potentially only afford one defection if they are to confirm their nominee. Prof Ford's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, described Mr Trump's words as ""a vicious, vile and soulless attack"" on her. ""Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well?"" he added. This video can not be played Trump: ""Ford's testimony was very compelling"" When she spoke before the Senate committee last Thursday, Prof Ford recalled that the house where the alleged assault took place was in the Chevy Chase-Bethesda area in the wealthy suburbs of Washington DC. The president seemed to suggest she did not know on what floor of the property the alleged attack had occurred, but Prof Ford told senators she remembered being pushed into a bedroom on the upstairs level. She testified that it occurred in the summer of 1982.In her initial letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein,external, she wrote that the assault happened ""during high school in the early 1980's"". Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who questioned Prof Ford during testimony, said she had told a polygrapher the alleged assault happened in the early 80s, then crossed out the word ""early"". Prof Ford did acknowledge in her testimony that she could not provide all the details asked of her - including how she arrived at the party or how she left it and where exactly it took place. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor ""I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to,"" she said. ""But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget."" Experts have said it is not unusual for victims of trauma to remember certain details vividly but have little recollection of other things that the brain may have accorded less significance to. Investigators have spoken to the key witness to the alleged assault on Prof Ford, Mr Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge. Prof Ford alleges that Mr Judge also took part in the assault at a high school party in 1982. Mr Judge has denied any memory of the incident. The agency has also spoken to the Judge Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who alleges that he exposed his genitals to her during a drinking game at Yale university. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking The truth about false assault accusations What will the FBI investigation actually do? Reuters reported that investigators spoke to Ms Ramirez for more than two hours on Sunday and she provided a list of more than 20 possible witnesses. However, Prof Ford's lawyers say they have had no contact from the FBI despite having tried to get in touch with them. They said the agency had not responded to the offer to interview Prof Ford, or ""a series of emails and letters in which we identified witnesses and evidence that would likely assist the FBI"". At least three other people who knew Mr Kavanaugh from his time at Yale have tried unsuccessfully to contact the FBI about the claims against him, Reuters reported. A lawyer for a third woman, Julie Swetnick - who alleges Judge Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s - has questioned why she has not been contacted by the FBI. Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? The judge has said he did not know Ms Swetnick and that her allegations ""never happened"". Senate committee Republicans on Tuesday took the extraordinary step of releasing an explicit letter attacking Ms Swetnick, sent by a man who claims to be a former boyfriend. Ms Swetnick's lawyer, Michael Avenatti,told the Washington Post,externalthe letter was ""bogus and outrageous"" - a ""fabricated"" attack to help Republicans ""ram through this nomination"". On Sunday, the Senate Republican Communications Center said Ms Swetnick was ""not credible at all"". This video can not be played Kavanaugh: ""The Swetnick thing is a joke"" Some reports have suggested that the FBI could wind up its investigation well before the deadline of this Friday. Citing unnamed Republican aides,the Wall Street Journal reported that the bureau could finish ""as soon as"" Wednesday.,external The FBI will pass its findings to the White House, which will give them to the Senate. The contents are not expected to be made public. Senators will then vote on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The Senate leader has vowed to hold a vote on the nominee this week. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said Friday would be too soon. She argued that senators needed more time to evaluate the FBI's findings. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking What did the FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh result in?

Post-Brexit future full of promise - May,"This video can not be played The key moments from Theresa May's speech Theresa May has told the Conservatives they must be the ""party for everyone"" and said austerity was ending in her party conference speech in Birmingham. The prime minister said that a decade on from the financial crash, ""there are better days ahead"", signalling an increase in public spending. She also defended her under-fire Brexit strategy, saying she was ""standing up for Britain"". And she announced new borrowing powers for councils to build more homes. A cap on the amount councils can borrow to fund new developments ""doesn't make sense"" and would be scrapped, she said. Recap: How May's speech unfolded Freeze on fuel duty to continue, says May Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? May's warm-up act wows the Tories Reality Check: What are the plans to boost council homes? Other promises included a ""step change"" in how cancer is diagnosed with a strategy aimed at increasing early detection rates, plus another freeze in fuel duty. The prime minister - whose dancing in Kenya made headlines in August - danced on to the stage to the sounds of Abba, and immediately sought to make light of last year's difficult speech. She joked that if she had a cough this time, it was only because she had been up all night gluing the letters on to the backdrop. This video can not be played Theresa May opened her conference speech to the music of Abba's Dancing Queen The Tory conference has been dominated by Brexit, with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launching a fresh broadside against her Chequers plan - it is known by the country residence where it was agreed in July - for trade with the EU. And as she prepared to deliver the speech, Conservative MP James Duddridge announced he had submitted a letter to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for a leadership contest. In her speech there was no mention of ""Chequers"" specifically - with Mrs May describing her plan as a ""free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods"". Defending it, she warned delegates that pursuing ""our own visions of the perfect Brexit"" could lead to ""no Brexit at all"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""A second referendum would be a politiciansâ voteâ On austerity, Mrs May said people needed to know ""that the end is in sight"". The Tories could not just ""clean up a mess"" they should ""steer a course to a better future"", she said. ""Sound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition. Because you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead."" At next year's Spending Review she said ""debt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up"". ""Because, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off."" In her speech, Mrs May said the Tories must be ""a party not for the few, not even for the many but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best"". ""Our best days lie ahead of us"", she said, adding: ""Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes."" Why was May dancing? And did it work? Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' Kuenssberg: Why ministers can't ignore Johnson She also condemned the personal abuse of politicians, speaking up for Labour's Diane Abbott and calling for an end to ""the bitterness and bile which is poisoning our politics"". This video can not be played Let our puissant nation seize Brexit prize - Geoffrey Cox Mrs May made repeated attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's politics, criticising his opposition to military action and claiming he would raise taxes ""higher and higher"". But the Tories needed to ""do more than criticise"" Labour, she said, vowing to ""make markets work in the interests of ordinary people again"". This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Boris Johnson urges them to ""chuck Chequers"" This video can not be played What have been the big issues for Tory members? She said she wanted to help people on low incomes, ruling out any increase in fuel duty in the Budget on 29 October. Theresa May's performance With the complexities of Brexit, the divisions in her party, the calamity of last year's conference speech, the antics of the former foreign secretary, and of course, her own fragilities, Theresa May has struggled to find her voice - and that's got nothing to do with running out of Strepsils. Well today she found it, and in the words of one of her cabinet colleagues, not a particularly close ally, said ""she found her mojo"". From the moment she danced on to the stage (who would have thought we'd ever see that), she looked comfortable in her own skin, actually happy to be there. It sounds strange, but it is so rare to see her overtly enjoying her job. On so many occasions the public has seen a politician who seems constricted, conflicted, and ill-at-ease. For voters, frankly, if she doesn't look like she is enjoying being prime minister, why should any of us be happy about the fact she's doing it.Read Laura's full blog. The 'end of austerity' Philip Hammond is always wary of announcing the ""end of austerity"", given the fragility of economic growth and the fact that many cuts, such as to benefits, have yet to work through the system. People are still feeling the pain. He is keener to emphasise that the effort expended bringing the public finances back towards balance - where the government raises in revenues the same at it spends on services - will not be put at risk with some form of ""spending splurge"". The PM just made that task harder.Read Kamal's full blog. The housing proposal Lifting the cap on how much English local authorities can borrow to build traditional council houses could have a significant impact on the supply of homes for social rent. Currently, town halls have a housing debt of about Â£26bn, the value of their existing stock acting as collateral.  Doing away with the cap would conservatively allow an extra Â£10-15bn of borrowing.  This money could be used to build an extra 15-20,000 new council homes a year over ten years. Given that the latest annual figure for completed social rent homes is less than 6,000, this might well quadruple supply in the medium term. Even that increase would not get close to meeting demand for social housing, however. The extra borrowing will count against the government's balance sheet and may well mean some tough decisions on cuts to budgets elsewhere, although there are arguments that the money could be seen as an investment rather than a subsidy because the new housing would provide a reliable income stream. Since 2012, council housing in England has realised a net rental surplus. The extra borrowing would be ring-fenced for housing but it is unclear whether all of the new stock would be for social rent.  Some shared-ownership homes might be included, for example. Although the extra borrowing freedom could come into force after early as next year, with planning and land acquisition to be sorted out, it is unlikely the boost to social housing supply will come to pass for some years. The NHS plan The pledge to create a new cancer strategy is not surprising - it was already one of the priority areas for the 10-year plan NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been asked to draw up in return for the Â£20bn funding rise the health service has been promised by 2023. Her high profile promise was to increase early detection - defined as at stages one and two - from 50% to 75% by 2028. Progress is already being made towards this. The existing cancer strategy has already made that a priority and in the last four years there has been an 11% improvement, meaning the NHS is already well on course to achieve this target. Beyond that, there were few details on what it would mean for services so it looks like we will have to wait until the 10-year NHS plan is published, expected to be November, before we know more. In response, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mrs May's claim on austerity was a ""con"" unless the chancellor takes immediate action. He said: ""If the prime minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled."" The SNP's Ian Blackford said Mrs May had ""danced around the key issues - the disastrous impact of Tory austerity and a Tory hard Brexit"". ""There is a massive gulf between her rhetoric and the reality of what is now facing the UK,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby. But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her."" The Local Government Association, which has been calling for an end to the cap on borrowing for house-building, welcomed the council spending announcement. ""Many of the projects that are already under way could quickly be scaled up,"" Conservative councillor David Simmonds, the body's deputy chairman, said. ""Councils have been asking for this for a long time and clearly the announcement today is something that means we can get on with the job."" The CBI - which criticised Mrs May's immigration plans on Tuesday - welcomed her call to ""back business"" and urged MPs to support her Brexit plan to get a deal ""over the line"".

Last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the policy saved drivers money, but would cost the Treasury Â£38bn if it continued for another three years.

train is late you wonât have to waste more time getting your money back"". On housing, the prime minister says the Conservative government has announced it will charge a higher rate
of stamp duty on those buying homes who do not live and pay taxes in the UK, ""to

Tesco shares slump after profits disappoint,"Tesco shares have tumbled 8% after the company reported disappointing profits. While Tesco reported its 11th quarter in a row of rising sales, analysts were troubled by weak profit growth. During the first half of the year, pre-tax profits rose 2.2% to Â£564m. Across the group like-for-like sales, which remove the impact of new stores, rose 4.2% in the second quarter. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said this was the best sales growth in more than a decade. The firm had ""made a good start to the year"", Mr Lewis said, with profits mainly driven by growth in the UK and Ireland. Tesco: Why the supermarket is going discount with Jack's Sainsbury's-Asda deal faces investigation But some analysts were more cautious.

Bacon and sausages 'linked to breast cancer'The findings come from a review of 15 studies involving more than one million women.HealthComments,"Regularly eating foods like bacon and sausages may raise the risk of breast cancer, according to researchers. A review of studies found women who ate high levels of processed meat had a 9% increased risk of the cancer compared with those who ate little of it. The study backs up previous findings of the World Health Organization, which says processed meats cause cancer. Experts recommend caution about the findings and say the actual risk for individual women is ""very small"". Processed meats do cause cancer - WHO How much of a cancer risk are processed meats? Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer' This review, which included data on more than a million women, shows a link between processed meat consumption and breast cancer risk, but it's not clear if the food is actually causing this. There are also other pitfalls to consider. The 15 studies used in the analysis had different definitions of the highest consumptions. For example, one of the UK studies in the review classed high consumption as more than 9g a day - the equivalent of just two or three rashers a week - while in others it was much higher. The researchers in the majority of these studies noted what people said they ate and followed them up to see which of them developed breast cancer. But the problem with this is that people who eat different amounts of processed meat may also have other behaviours that might explain the differences in breast cancer risk, such as being more or less healthy in other ways. In the UK about 14 out of every 100 women will get breast cancer at some point in their lives. That means a 9% increase in risk in this population would be expected to translate into roughly one extra case of cancer in every 100 women. Cancer Research UK estimates that about 23% of breast cancers are preventable,external. It estimates that about 8% of cases are caused by being overweight and obese and another 8% by alcohol. Authors of this study,published in the International Journal of Cancer,external, say the link they found is only for processed meat, not red meat. TheWHO lists processed meat as carcinogenic,external, primarily because of evidence linking it to a raised risk of bowel cancer, while it says red meat is ""probably carcinogenic"". Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste, usually by smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives to meat. This includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham. There are different theories for why it may raise the risk of cancer, including that curing salt may react with protein in the meat to make it carcinogenic. Lead author Dr Maryam Farvid, of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in the US, recommends cutting down on the meat rather than eliminating it. Currently, the NHS recommends eating no more than 70g of red and processed meat a day. Dr Gunter Kuhnle, associate professor in nutrition and health at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study, said it was ""questionable"" whether people should lower their red and processed meat consumption on the back of this study. He said the actual risk posed by processed meats was ""very small"" for the individual and more relevant on a population-wide level. However, he said the study's findings should be followed up to investigate the links between processed meat and cancer and see whether the associated risk could be reduced, for example through new food production methods.

"Love Island star's Instagram post bannedOlivia Buckland failed to mark the post about an eye shadow as an advert, says the ASA.Newsbeat","Love Island star Olivia Buckland has had an Instagram post which promoted an eye shadow banned. It's because it was not clear it was an advert, says the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The post showed Olivia discussing the eye shadow from cosmetic brand W7 along with a caption which included the words: ""Can't wait to see what you guys create #BucksBeauty"". She's been told to ensure future adverts are ""obviously identifiable"". Warpaint Cosmetics, which goes by the name W7, and Olivia released a joint statement which confirmed the reality star was a brand ambassador for the company. Olivia recently married Alex Bowen who she met on Love Island in 2016 The brand said Olivia wasn't paid specifically to post on social media and the post was in a ""blog style"" - which was outside of their agreement. Warpaint went on to say that the Love Island contestant's relationship with W7 was ""sufficiently obvious"", but it was willing to make changes to the hashtags on similar posts in the future. The ASA said the contract between Warpaint and Olivia required her to ""promote the brand and products in a positive light at all times"". It said this would ""in effect restrict aspects of Ms Buckland's control of her social media content"". Olivia is the latest reality TV star to have a social media post banned It did say that in Olivia's Instagram bio she'd written she was an ambassador for the brand and she had also published two posts announcing her role with the company. But it said Instagram users who might not follow Olivia could look at her posts without seeing this information.

Tesco shares slump after profits disappointShares in the UK's biggest supermarket group fall more than 8% despite rising sales.BusinessComments,"Tesco shares have tumbled 8% after the company reported disappointing profits. While Tesco reported its 11th quarter in a row of rising sales, analysts were troubled by weak profit growth. During the first half of the year, pre-tax profits rose 2.2% to Â£564m. Across the group like-for-like sales, which remove the impact of new stores, rose 4.2% in the second quarter. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said this was the best sales growth in more than a decade. The firm had ""made a good start to the year"", Mr Lewis said, with profits mainly driven by growth in the UK and Ireland. Tesco: Why the supermarket is going discount with Jack's Sainsbury's-Asda deal faces investigation But some analysts were more cautious.

Costa ad banned for criticising avocadosThe coffee chain urged customers to buy a bacon roll or egg muffin rather than avocados.UK,"An advert for Costa Coffee has been banned for urging customers to buy a bacon roll rather than avocados. The radio ad featured a voiceover which said there was ""a great deal on ripen-at-home avocados"" but they will only ""be ready to eat for about 10 minutes, then they'll go off"". The advert told people to choose the ""better deal"" of a roll or egg muffin. Two listeners complained that the ad, which aired in June, discouraged people from opting for fresh fruit. Smartphone doctor ads ruled misleading The advertising watchdog agreed with the complaints and upheld them. Costa said its ad played on the ""frustration and unpredictability of the avocado"". The chain claimed it was not suggesting that listeners must choose between the two breakfast options, but that it was instead telling people about its promotional offer. The organisation which clears ads for broadcast, Radiocentre, said consumers would see the ad as a ""light-hearted remark"" about the experience of buying non-ripe avocados. But in its ruling, the Advertising Standards Authority said consumers would interpret the ad as a comparison between the experience of eating an avocado and a bacon roll or egg muffin. ""We considered that, although the ad was light-hearted, it nevertheless suggested avocados were a poor breakfast choice, and that a bacon roll or egg muffin would be a better alternative, and in doing so discouraged the selection of avocados,"" the ASA said. All radio and television adverts must comply with theUK Code of Broadcast Advertising (BCAP),externalwhich states that comparisons between foods must not discourage fruit and vegetables. The advert must not be broadcast again, and Costa has been told to make sure its future ads do not ""condone or encourage poor nutritional habits"".

"Trump mocks Kavanaugh accuser's testimonyThe US president ridiculed Christine Blasey Ford, saying she could not remember important details.","This video can not be played Mr Trump cast doubt on Prof Ford's credibility President Donald Trump has mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford against his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at a rally in Mississippi. ""What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know,"" Mr Trump said. ""But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Days earlier he had said Prof Ford was a ""credible"" and ""compelling"" witness. Prof Ford told a Senate committee that Mr Kavanaugh assaulted her as a teenager, an allegation he denies. Mr Trump ordered the FBI to examine the claims following the Senate testimony. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh However, Prof Ford's lawyers say the FBI has not yet spoken to her and say it is ""inconceivable"" that the agency could conduct a thorough investigation without interviewing her. The FBI investigation is due to be completed by Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate must vote on confirming Mr Kavanaugh this week. He told supporters in the town of Southhaven that his political opponents had been ""trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced"". He then mocked Prof Ford's testimony, saying she appeared not to remember basic details about the alleged assault. This video can not be played ""Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling"" The audience laughed as the president said: ""Thirty-six years ago this happened: I had one beer! Well, you think it wasâ¦? Nope! It was one beer. ""Oh, good. How'd you get home? I don't remember. How'd you get there? I don't remember. Where was the place? I don't remember. ""How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know! What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know. ""Where's the house? I don't know! Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know! But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Shortly after Prof Ford's dramatic testimony to the Senate committee last week, Mr Trump said she was ""very compelling"" and described her as a ""very fine woman"". Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump reiterated his support for Mr Kavanaugh, saying he believed the Senate would approve the judge. He told reporters it was a ""very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of"". On Wednesday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake - who joined a committee vote in favour of the judge with the caveat of an FBI investigation - called the president's comments mocking Prof Ford ""appalling"". ""There's no time and no place for remarks like that,"" he said on NBC's Today show. ""To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. It's just not right. I wish he hadn't had done it."" Senator Flake is a closely watched swing vote on this issue because Republicans can potentially only afford one defection if they are to confirm their nominee. Prof Ford's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, described Mr Trump's words as ""a vicious, vile and soulless attack"" on her. ""Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well?"" he added. This video can not be played Trump: ""Ford's testimony was very compelling"" When she spoke before the Senate committee last Thursday, Prof Ford recalled that the house where the alleged assault took place was in the Chevy Chase-Bethesda area in the wealthy suburbs of Washington DC. The president seemed to suggest she did not know on what floor of the property the alleged attack had occurred, but Prof Ford told senators she remembered being pushed into a bedroom on the upstairs level. She testified that it occurred in the summer of 1982.In her initial letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein,external, she wrote that the assault happened ""during high school in the early 1980's"". Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who questioned Prof Ford during testimony, said she had told a polygrapher the alleged assault happened in the early 80s, then crossed out the word ""early"". Prof Ford did acknowledge in her testimony that she could not provide all the details asked of her - including how she arrived at the party or how she left it and where exactly it took place. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor ""I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to,"" she said. ""But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget."" Experts have said it is not unusual for victims of trauma to remember certain details vividly but have little recollection of other things that the brain may have accorded less significance to. Investigators have spoken to the key witness to the alleged assault on Prof Ford, Mr Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge. Prof Ford alleges that Mr Judge also took part in the assault at a high school party in 1982. Mr Judge has denied any memory of the incident. The agency has also spoken to the Judge Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who alleges that he exposed his genitals to her during a drinking game at Yale university. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking The truth about false assault accusations What will the FBI investigation actually do? Reuters reported that investigators spoke to Ms Ramirez for more than two hours on Sunday and she provided a list of more than 20 possible witnesses. However, Prof Ford's lawyers say they have had no contact from the FBI despite having tried to get in touch with them. They said the agency had not responded to the offer to interview Prof Ford, or ""a series of emails and letters in which we identified witnesses and evidence that would likely assist the FBI"". At least three other people who knew Mr Kavanaugh from his time at Yale have tried unsuccessfully to contact the FBI about the claims against him, Reuters reported. A lawyer for a third woman, Julie Swetnick - who alleges Judge Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s - has questioned why she has not been contacted by the FBI. Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? The judge has said he did not know Ms Swetnick and that her allegations ""never happened"". Senate committee Republicans on Tuesday took the extraordinary step of releasing an explicit letter attacking Ms Swetnick, sent by a man who claims to be a former boyfriend. Ms Swetnick's lawyer, Michael Avenatti,told the Washington Post,externalthe letter was ""bogus and outrageous"" - a ""fabricated"" attack to help Republicans ""ram through this nomination"". On Sunday, the Senate Republican Communications Center said Ms Swetnick was ""not credible at all"". This video can not be played Kavanaugh: ""The Swetnick thing is a joke"" Some reports have suggested that the FBI could wind up its investigation well before the deadline of this Friday. Citing unnamed Republican aides,the Wall Street Journal reported that the bureau could finish ""as soon as"" Wednesday.,external The FBI will pass its findings to the White House, which will give them to the Senate. The contents are not expected to be made public. Senators will then vote on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The Senate leader has vowed to hold a vote on the nominee this week. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said Friday would be too soon. She argued that senators needed more time to evaluate the FBI's findings. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking What did the FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh result in?

First Sussex visit for Harry and Meghan,"The royal couple were given their titles on their wedding day Adoring crowds met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their first official visit to the county that features in their royal titles. The couple, who got married in May, visited some of the region's most well-known sites on a whistle-stop tour. They were greeted with cheers at each stop of their eagerly-anticipated trip and, in one case, chants of ""Harry"". The tour took Harry and Meghan to Chichester, Bognor, Brighton and Peacehaven. In Brighton, the duke's arrival was soundtracked by a chorus of ""Harry, Harry, Harry"" as well-wishers caught their first glimpse of the sixth in line to the throne. He was photographed at the town's pavilions eagerly exchanging handshakes and high-fives with a group of schoolchildren. This video can not be played The Duke dished out handshakes to excited schoolchildren in Brighton While on the final leg of the tour, in Peacehaven, Meghan was spotted rushing to the aid of one young girl who stood in the crowd in tears. The kind-hearted duchess was seen holding 10-year-old Kara Fairhall's hand and comforting the youngster for some time. As it happened: Harry and Meghan's first Sussex visit Speaking later, Kara said: ""I felt a lot better afterwards and I said thank you to her. ""She's really nice and I was really happy I got to meet her."" Elsewhere, Harry and Meghan met dozens of other royal fans, viewed historical artefacts and were treated to musical performances. Here's how the day unfolded. Warm welcome: The Duchess was handed flowers by some well-wishers When they finally arrived in the West Sussex cathedral city, Harry and Meghan were met with a rapturous reception.

Heart drug trials halted over Brexit fears,"Recardio had been due to test the drug dutogliptin for use after a heart attack Clinical trials of a new heart drug have been stopped in the UK because of concerns over Brexit. Medical research firm Recardio was due to try the drug dutogliptin on patients in Clydebank, Leeds and Exeter. It has suspended all UK activities due to uncertainty about how new medicines will be approved after Brexit. The department of health said it was confident the UK would continue to have the ""best possible environment"" for clinical trials. The UK is due to leave the EU in less than six months on 29 March 2019 and has yet to agree departure terms. Recardio was due to recruit patients at three sites in the UK including the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, near Glasgow. The Golden Jubilee National Hospital is Clydebank, near Glasgow, was among three UK sites due to host trials The California-based firm wants to establish that dutogliptin can be used safely and effectively in combination with another drug to help repair heart tissue after a heart attack. The Golden Jubilee said Recardio told its research team by email on 17 September that UK trials were being put on hold. The hospital said Recardio had cited ""uncertainty due to EU withdrawal"" and ""completely unresolved"" issues with the European Medicines Agency that ""represent a significant risk"" to its business. The hospital said Recardio's position could change ""when the regulatory situation has clarity"". A Scottish government spokesman said ""this is the first clinical study we are aware of to be suspended in Scotland as a result of Brexit - and a very concerning sign of what could happen"". A spokesman for the UK government's department of health and social care said: ""We are confident of reaching a deal with the EU that benefits patients and continues to deliver the best possible environment in which to support clinical trials. ""We want to ensure that patients in the UK and across the EU are still able to access the most innovative and effective medicines."" Recardio's founder and president, Dr Roman Schenk, told the BBC he did not want to comment on UK politics. However, he confirmed that uncertainty over Brexit had created a ""very difficult"" situation for his company. The UK clinical trials website has a ""not recruiting"" message in relation to the dutogliptin trials It is understood Recardio is worried that the research data it collects in the UK might not be acceptable to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) after Brexit. The EMA gives marketing authorisation for human medicines across the European single market. In a statement, the EMA said that it ""will continue to accept clinical evidence generated in the United Kingdom"" after Brexit on condition that trials continue to meet European standards. The UK government has said thatit intends to stay aligned with EU regulations for clinical trials,externalto avoid disruption even if there is no Brexit deal. The charity, Chest Heart & Stroke Scotland's chief executive Jane-Claire Judson said she remained ""seriously concerned at the lack of priority and focus given to providing detailed solutions to the health ramifications of Brexit"". Recardio is understood to be at an advanced stage in setting up its heart drug trials in the EU and the United States but has not yet recruited patients. The UK clinical trials websiteconfirms that Recardio is ""not recruiting"",externalin this country despite being due to do so between April 2018 and April 2019. The UK trials were also supposed to involve Leeds General Infirmary and Royal Devon and Exeter hospital, both of which declined to comment. Work appears to be continuing ondutogliptin trials in various EU countries,externalincluding Austria, Belgium and Hungary.

'I don't want to look like a cry baby',"This video can not be played Tinchy Stryder has shared his experience of giving blood for the first time withBBC Radio 5 Live, in the hope of encouraging more people to donate. The rapper has close friends and family members with sickle cell disease. People with sickle cell have misshapen blood cells which do not carry oxygen efficiently around the body. This can cause extreme pain and life-threatening infections. Blood transfusions help to reduce and prevent these symptoms. There is a particular need for the rare blood sub-type Ro, which is more common in people of African/Caribbean descent. Tinchy told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""A lot of people know about sickle cell but are not aware of how they can help. ""Six minutes of my time donating blood can save three lives. That's deep.""

Helicopter jailbreak gangster captured,"Redoine Faid (pictured in 2010) RÃ©doine FaÃ¯d, a French gangster who broke out of jail using a hijacked helicopter in July, has been recaptured. The country's most wanted fugitive, he was detained north of Paris, reportedly with his brother and two men. FaÃ¯d, 46, is a fan of gangster films, which he credits with teaching him how to pull off raids. He was first arrested in 1998 for armed robbery.The 1 July jailbreak was his second and most dramatic escape. He was sprung from a prison in RÃ©au, south-east of Paris, by three heavily armed men who broke into the visitors' room. They then bundled him into a helicopter flown by a flying instructor who had been taken hostage. Why does France love its gangsters? A history of dramatic prison escapes FaÃ¯d had been serving a 25-year sentence for masterminding a botched robbery in which a policewoman was killed in 2010. He was recaptured in the early hours of Wednesday in the town of Creil. French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told Europe 1 radio: ""We're going to put him in a high-security facility where he will be watched extremely closely."" Redoine FaÃ¯d was arrested overnight in his hometown, Creil The arrest came hours after Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb - the country's top law-enforcement official - resigned to run for mayor in Lyon, France's second-largest city. The move is regarded as a fresh setback for President Emmanuel Macron, whose popularity has fallen sharply in recent weeks. The interior ministry will be temporarily headed by Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe. Born in 1972, he grew up in Creil. In the 1990s he ran a gang involved in armed robbery and extortion. He has said Hollywood movies, such as the Al Pacino thriller Scarface, inspired his lifestyle and some of his schemes. During a 1997 attack on a security van, he used and his accomplices used ice-hockey goalkeeper masks, mimicking Robert de Niro's gang in the film Heat. He later said he had watched that movie ""hundreds of times"" on DVD and once told its director, Michael Mann, at a Paris film festival: ""You were my technical adviser."" Redoine Faid was placed on Interpol's most-wanted list after his 2013 escape His fame was helped by a 2009 book outlining his younger days on the streets of Paris and his descent into the life of a professional criminal. That earned him the nickname ""L'Ãcrivain"" - or ""the writer"" - among French police. FaÃ¯d's cycle of imprisonment and escape began with his arrest in 1998 for armed robbery and bank theft. In 2009 he was freed on parole, swearing that he was a changed man - but by 2011, he had breached his terms of release and was back behind bars. In 2013, he escaped from a prison near Lille, using explosives to blast his way through five prison doorswhile holding guards hostage as human shields. In 2017, FaÃ¯d was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for that jailbreak. He was also given 18 years for masterminding the 2010 robbery. In 2018, following a failed appeal, FaÃ¯d was given a heavier sentence of 25 years. Why does France love its gangsters?

The Tories 'must deliver' for people - May,"This video can not be played The key moments from Theresa May's speech Theresa May has told the Conservatives they must be the ""party for everyone"" and said austerity was ending in her party conference speech in Birmingham. The prime minister said that a decade on from the financial crash, ""there are better days ahead"", signalling an increase in public spending. She also defended her under-fire Brexit strategy, saying she was ""standing up for Britain"". And she announced new borrowing powers for councils to build more homes. A cap on the amount councils can borrow to fund new developments ""doesn't make sense"" and would be scrapped, she said. Recap: How May's speech unfolded Freeze on fuel duty to continue, says May Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? May's warm-up act wows the Tories Reality Check: What are the plans to boost council homes? Other promises included a ""step change"" in how cancer is diagnosed with a strategy aimed at increasing early detection rates, plus another freeze in fuel duty. The prime minister - whose dancing in Kenya made headlines in August - danced on to the stage to the sounds of Abba, and immediately sought to make light of last year's difficult speech. She joked that if she had a cough this time, it was only because she had been up all night gluing the letters on to the backdrop. This video can not be played Theresa May opened her conference speech to the music of Abba's Dancing Queen The Tory conference has been dominated by Brexit, with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launching a fresh broadside against her Chequers plan - it is known by the country residence where it was agreed in July - for trade with the EU. And as she prepared to deliver the speech, Conservative MP James Duddridge announced he had submitted a letter to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for a leadership contest. In her speech there was no mention of ""Chequers"" specifically - with Mrs May describing her plan as a ""free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods"". Defending it, she warned delegates that pursuing ""our own visions of the perfect Brexit"" could lead to ""no Brexit at all"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""A second referendum would be a politiciansâ voteâ On austerity, Mrs May said people needed to know ""that the end is in sight"". The Tories could not just ""clean up a mess"" they should ""steer a course to a better future"", she said. ""Sound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition. Because you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead."" At next year's Spending Review she said ""debt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up"". ""Because, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off."" In her speech, Mrs May said the Tories must be ""a party not for the few, not even for the many but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best"". ""Our best days lie ahead of us"", she said, adding: ""Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes."" Why was May dancing? And did it work? Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' Kuenssberg: Why ministers can't ignore Johnson She also condemned the personal abuse of politicians, speaking up for Labour's Diane Abbott and calling for an end to ""the bitterness and bile which is poisoning our politics"". This video can not be played Let our puissant nation seize Brexit prize - Geoffrey Cox Mrs May made repeated attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's politics, criticising his opposition to military action and claiming he would raise taxes ""higher and higher"". But the Tories needed to ""do more than criticise"" Labour, she said, vowing to ""make markets work in the interests of ordinary people again"". This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Boris Johnson urges them to ""chuck Chequers"" This video can not be played What have been the big issues for Tory members? She said she wanted to help people on low incomes, ruling out any increase in fuel duty in the Budget on 29 October. Theresa May's performance With the complexities of Brexit, the divisions in her party, the calamity of last year's conference speech, the antics of the former foreign secretary, and of course, her own fragilities, Theresa May has struggled to find her voice - and that's got nothing to do with running out of Strepsils. Well today she found it, and in the words of one of her cabinet colleagues, not a particularly close ally, said ""she found her mojo"". From the moment she danced on to the stage (who would have thought we'd ever see that), she looked comfortable in her own skin, actually happy to be there. It sounds strange, but it is so rare to see her overtly enjoying her job. On so many occasions the public has seen a politician who seems constricted, conflicted, and ill-at-ease. For voters, frankly, if she doesn't look like she is enjoying being prime minister, why should any of us be happy about the fact she's doing it.Read Laura's full blog. The 'end of austerity' Philip Hammond is always wary of announcing the ""end of austerity"", given the fragility of economic growth and the fact that many cuts, such as to benefits, have yet to work through the system. People are still feeling the pain. He is keener to emphasise that the effort expended bringing the public finances back towards balance - where the government raises in revenues the same at it spends on services - will not be put at risk with some form of ""spending splurge"". The PM just made that task harder.Read Kamal's full blog. The housing proposal Lifting the cap on how much English local authorities can borrow to build traditional council houses could have a significant impact on the supply of homes for social rent. Currently, town halls have a housing debt of about Â£26bn, the value of their existing stock acting as collateral.  Doing away with the cap would conservatively allow an extra Â£10-15bn of borrowing.  This money could be used to build an extra 15-20,000 new council homes a year over ten years. Given that the latest annual figure for completed social rent homes is less than 6,000, this might well quadruple supply in the medium term. Even that increase would not get close to meeting demand for social housing, however. The extra borrowing will count against the government's balance sheet and may well mean some tough decisions on cuts to budgets elsewhere, although there are arguments that the money could be seen as an investment rather than a subsidy because the new housing would provide a reliable income stream. Since 2012, council housing in England has realised a net rental surplus. The extra borrowing would be ring-fenced for housing but it is unclear whether all of the new stock would be for social rent.  Some shared-ownership homes might be included, for example. Although the extra borrowing freedom could come into force after early as next year, with planning and land acquisition to be sorted out, it is unlikely the boost to social housing supply will come to pass for some years. The NHS plan The pledge to create a new cancer strategy is not surprising - it was already one of the priority areas for the 10-year plan NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been asked to draw up in return for the Â£20bn funding rise the health service has been promised by 2023. Her high profile promise was to increase early detection - defined as at stages one and two - from 50% to 75% by 2028. Progress is already being made towards this. The existing cancer strategy has already made that a priority and in the last four years there has been an 11% improvement, meaning the NHS is already well on course to achieve this target. Beyond that, there were few details on what it would mean for services so it looks like we will have to wait until the 10-year NHS plan is published, expected to be November, before we know more. In response, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mrs May's claim on austerity was a ""con"" unless the chancellor takes immediate action. He said: ""If the prime minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled."" The SNP's Ian Blackford said Mrs May had ""danced around the key issues - the disastrous impact of Tory austerity and a Tory hard Brexit"". ""There is a massive gulf between her rhetoric and the reality of what is now facing the UK,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby. But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her."" The Local Government Association, which has been calling for an end to the cap on borrowing for house-building, welcomed the council spending announcement. ""Many of the projects that are already under way could quickly be scaled up,"" Conservative councillor David Simmonds, the body's deputy chairman, said. ""Councils have been asking for this for a long time and clearly the announcement today is something that means we can get on with the job."" The CBI - which criticised Mrs May's immigration plans on Tuesday - welcomed her call to ""back business"" and urged MPs to support her Brexit plan to get a deal ""over the line"".

Kuenssberg: Johnson can't be ignored,"This video can not be played In full: Theresa May interview with Laura Kuenssberg ""It's over!""... ""He's forgotten the electorate""... ""Who cares?"" These are some of the more polite ways that cabinet ministers have responded to Boris Johnson's recent behaviour. The prime minister who is, publicly, as controlled as they come, revealed a flash of polite irritation telling me - in the interview you can watch on this page - that she is ""cross"" with some of the things he said. Trust me, the things that people in government have been saying about him privately are often far worse than that. Johnson speech made me 'cross', says May Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' The view of some of Mr Johnson's former colleagues is that he is a charlatan, who never showed that he could do the work needed, to show the responsibility required, to make decisions that would affect the lives the public. There are numerous anecdotes of how the former foreign secretary would make promises he never kept, wouldn't properly focus on the documents, the detail, that came across his desk in one of the highest offices in the land. However, in a moment of proper candour, another of his former colleagues who knows him well, told me that the truth is, ""we're all a bit jealous"". That's the crux. You may not trust Boris Johnson to run a bath, let alone the country. But just as in the Vote Leave campaign, we saw today that there is a constituency of people who want to hear him, who want to watch him, who care what he thinks and find that what he says inspires them. And on a serious point, that's not soap opera, some insiders close to the Brexit negotiations agree with him that the prime minister's Chequers proposal is not going to work. The government's official position of course is that it is the only offer that's workable and deliverable, and many ministers believe it can be at least the basis for a final deal. But today, baldly, one minister told me: ""Chequersisdead, and the prime minister will have to pivot."" That's why although his colleagues, and No 10, are more and more annoyed about his behaviour, he brought the Tory conference to life today, and why Boris Johnson cannot be ignored.

Tesco sales growth 'best in a decade',"Tesco shares have tumbled 8% after the company reported disappointing profits. While Tesco reported its 11th quarter in a row of rising sales, analysts were troubled by weak profit growth. During the first half of the year, pre-tax profits rose 2.2% to Â£564m. Across the group like-for-like sales, which remove the impact of new stores, rose 4.2% in the second quarter. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said this was the best sales growth in more than a decade. The firm had ""made a good start to the year"", Mr Lewis said, with profits mainly driven by growth in the UK and Ireland. Tesco: Why the supermarket is going discount with Jack's Sainsbury's-Asda deal faces investigation But some analysts were more cautious. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst with investment bank Bernstein, said that Tesco has delivered strong sales growth in food in the UK and at Booker, but overall profits were ""soft"". Others had concerns over profit margins. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said analysts had been expecting profits margins to be about 4% by 2020, but the supermarket chain saw margins of closer to 3.5%. Neil Wilson of Markets.com said investors may have been expecting too much of Tesco. ""This looks rather like expectations had maybe been set a little too high, rather than Tesco underperforming,"" he said. Last month Tesco unveiled a new discount chain called Jack's to take on discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Mr Lewis said he was ""really very happy so far"" with the performance of the two new stores. ""So far, so very very good,"" he said. ""The two stores are trading very well, consumer feedback is really very good."" Two more Jack's will launch on Thursday in Edge Hill and St Helens in Liverpool, he added. Sales at Booker, the food wholesaler that Tesco bought at the end of last year, jumped 15.1%. Mr Lewis said that retail market conditions were tough, and that the supermarket was making contingency plans for Brexit. ""The biggest single challenge will be in a no-deal scenario, will be what happens with fresh food,"" he said. ""It's all about product flow [over borders]. The possibility of stockpiling fresh food is very, very limited."" Mr Lewis said in the lead-up to Brexit Tesco was focusing on how to ensure movements of fresh food were not held up. He added that the retailer was looking at stockpiling grocery products, with contingency planning stepping up after Christmas if a deal is still not struck.

Australia ends controversial 'tampon tax',"Women campaigning for an end to the tax in 2015 Australia will remove a controversial tax on female sanitary products following years of campaigning by women's groups. Currently, tampons and sanitary pads are sold with a 10% goods and services tax (GST) because they are categorised as non-essential items. Women have argued it is an unfair classification, noting items such as condoms and sunscreen are exempt. Federal and state governments agreed on Wednesday to remove the levy. ""We're really delighted that everyone's come on board to scrap what is an unfair tax,"" Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer told Sky News Australia. ""Millions of women right across the nation will be very thankful for it."" Widely known as the ""tampon tax"", the levy on sanitary products has drawn protests since the GST was introduced in 2000. Many women, including long-time campaigners, celebrated the change on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

French jailbreak gangster caught by police,"Redoine Faid (pictured in 2010) RÃ©doine FaÃ¯d, a French gangster who broke out of jail using a hijacked helicopter in July, has been recaptured. The country's most wanted fugitive, he was detained north of Paris, reportedly with his brother and two men. FaÃ¯d, 46, is a fan of gangster films, which he credits with teaching him how to pull off raids. He was first arrested in 1998 for armed robbery.The 1 July jailbreak was his second and most dramatic escape. He was sprung from a prison in RÃ©au, south-east of Paris, by three heavily armed men who broke into the visitors' room. They then bundled him into a helicopter flown by a flying instructor who had been taken hostage. Why does France love its gangsters? A history of dramatic prison escapes FaÃ¯d had been serving a 25-year sentence for masterminding a botched robbery in which a policewoman was killed in 2010. He was recaptured in the early hours of Wednesday in the town of Creil. French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told Europe 1 radio: ""We're going to put him in a high-security facility where he will be watched extremely closely."" Redoine FaÃ¯d was arrested overnight in his hometown, Creil The arrest came hours after Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb - the country's top law-enforcement official - resigned to run for mayor in Lyon, France's second-largest city. The move is regarded as a fresh setback for President Emmanuel Macron, whose popularity has fallen sharply in recent weeks. The interior ministry will be temporarily headed by Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe. Born in 1972, he grew up in Creil. In the 1990s he ran a gang involved in armed robbery and extortion. He has said Hollywood movies, such as the Al Pacino thriller Scarface, inspired his lifestyle and some of his schemes. During a 1997 attack on a security van, he used and his accomplices used ice-hockey goalkeeper masks, mimicking Robert de Niro's gang in the film Heat. He later said he had watched that movie ""hundreds of times"" on DVD and once told its director, Michael Mann, at a Paris film festival: ""You were my technical adviser."" Redoine Faid was placed on Interpol's most-wanted list after his 2013 escape His fame was helped by a 2009 book outlining his younger days on the streets of Paris and his descent into the life of a professional criminal. That earned him the nickname ""L'Ãcrivain"" - or ""the writer"" - among French police. FaÃ¯d's cycle of imprisonment and escape began with his arrest in 1998 for armed robbery and bank theft. In 2009 he was freed on parole, swearing that he was a changed man - but by 2011, he had breached his terms of release and was back behind bars. In 2013, he escaped from a prison near Lille, using explosives to blast his way through five prison doorswhile holding guards hostage as human shields. In 2017, FaÃ¯d was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for that jailbreak. He was also given 18 years for masterminding the 2010 robbery. In 2018, following a failed appeal, FaÃ¯d was given a heavier sentence of 25 years. Why does France love its gangsters?

Tories 'must deliver' for people,"This video can not be played The key moments from Theresa May's speech Theresa May has told the Conservatives they must be the ""party for everyone"" and said austerity was ending in her party conference speech in Birmingham. The prime minister said that a decade on from the financial crash, ""there are better days ahead"", signalling an increase in public spending. She also defended her under-fire Brexit strategy, saying she was ""standing up for Britain"". And she announced new borrowing powers for councils to build more homes. A cap on the amount councils can borrow to fund new developments ""doesn't make sense"" and would be scrapped, she said. Recap: How May's speech unfolded Freeze on fuel duty to continue, says May Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? May's warm-up act wows the Tories Reality Check: What are the plans to boost council homes? Other promises included a ""step change"" in how cancer is diagnosed with a strategy aimed at increasing early detection rates, plus another freeze in fuel duty. The prime minister - whose dancing in Kenya made headlines in August - danced on to the stage to the sounds of Abba, and immediately sought to make light of last year's difficult speech. She joked that if she had a cough this time, it was only because she had been up all night gluing the letters on to the backdrop. This video can not be played Theresa May opened her conference speech to the music of Abba's Dancing Queen The Tory conference has been dominated by Brexit, with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launching a fresh broadside against her Chequers plan - it is known by the country residence where it was agreed in July - for trade with the EU. And as she prepared to deliver the speech, Conservative MP James Duddridge announced he had submitted a letter to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for a leadership contest. In her speech there was no mention of ""Chequers"" specifically - with Mrs May describing her plan as a ""free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods"". Defending it, she warned delegates that pursuing ""our own visions of the perfect Brexit"" could lead to ""no Brexit at all"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""A second referendum would be a politiciansâ voteâ On austerity, Mrs May said people needed to know ""that the end is in sight"". The Tories could not just ""clean up a mess"" they should ""steer a course to a better future"", she said. ""Sound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition. Because you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead."" At next year's Spending Review she said ""debt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up"". ""Because, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off."" In her speech, Mrs May said the Tories must be ""a party not for the few, not even for the many but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best"". ""Our best days lie ahead of us"", she said, adding: ""Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes."" Why was May dancing? And did it work? Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' Kuenssberg: Why ministers can't ignore Johnson She also condemned the personal abuse of politicians, speaking up for Labour's Diane Abbott and calling for an end to ""the bitterness and bile which is poisoning our politics"". This video can not be played Let our puissant nation seize Brexit prize - Geoffrey Cox Mrs May made repeated attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's politics, criticising his opposition to military action and claiming he would raise taxes ""higher and higher"". But the Tories needed to ""do more than criticise"" Labour, she said, vowing to ""make markets work in the interests of ordinary people again"". This video can not be played Delegates cheer as Boris Johnson urges them to ""chuck Chequers"" This video can not be played What have been the big issues for Tory members? She said she wanted to help people on low incomes, ruling out any increase in fuel duty in the Budget on 29 October. Theresa May's performance With the complexities of Brexit, the divisions in her party, the calamity of last year's conference speech, the antics of the former foreign secretary, and of course, her own fragilities, Theresa May has struggled to find her voice - and that's got nothing to do with running out of Strepsils. Well today she found it, and in the words of one of her cabinet colleagues, not a particularly close ally, said ""she found her mojo"". From the moment she danced on to the stage (who would have thought we'd ever see that), she looked comfortable in her own skin, actually happy to be there. It sounds strange, but it is so rare to see her overtly enjoying her job. On so many occasions the public has seen a politician who seems constricted, conflicted, and ill-at-ease. For voters, frankly, if she doesn't look like she is enjoying being prime minister, why should any of us be happy about the fact she's doing it.Read Laura's full blog. The 'end of austerity' Philip Hammond is always wary of announcing the ""end of austerity"", given the fragility of economic growth and the fact that many cuts, such as to benefits, have yet to work through the system. People are still feeling the pain. He is keener to emphasise that the effort expended bringing the public finances back towards balance - where the government raises in revenues the same at it spends on services - will not be put at risk with some form of ""spending splurge"". The PM just made that task harder.Read Kamal's full blog. The housing proposal Lifting the cap on how much English local authorities can borrow to build traditional council houses could have a significant impact on the supply of homes for social rent. Currently, town halls have a housing debt of about Â£26bn, the value of their existing stock acting as collateral.  Doing away with the cap would conservatively allow an extra Â£10-15bn of borrowing.  This money could be used to build an extra 15-20,000 new council homes a year over ten years. Given that the latest annual figure for completed social rent homes is less than 6,000, this might well quadruple supply in the medium term. Even that increase would not get close to meeting demand for social housing, however. The extra borrowing will count against the government's balance sheet and may well mean some tough decisions on cuts to budgets elsewhere, although there are arguments that the money could be seen as an investment rather than a subsidy because the new housing would provide a reliable income stream. Since 2012, council housing in England has realised a net rental surplus. The extra borrowing would be ring-fenced for housing but it is unclear whether all of the new stock would be for social rent.  Some shared-ownership homes might be included, for example. Although the extra borrowing freedom could come into force after early as next year, with planning and land acquisition to be sorted out, it is unlikely the boost to social housing supply will come to pass for some years. The NHS plan The pledge to create a new cancer strategy is not surprising - it was already one of the priority areas for the 10-year plan NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been asked to draw up in return for the Â£20bn funding rise the health service has been promised by 2023. Her high profile promise was to increase early detection - defined as at stages one and two - from 50% to 75% by 2028. Progress is already being made towards this. The existing cancer strategy has already made that a priority and in the last four years there has been an 11% improvement, meaning the NHS is already well on course to achieve this target. Beyond that, there were few details on what it would mean for services so it looks like we will have to wait until the 10-year NHS plan is published, expected to be November, before we know more. In response, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mrs May's claim on austerity was a ""con"" unless the chancellor takes immediate action. He said: ""If the prime minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled."" The SNP's Ian Blackford said Mrs May had ""danced around the key issues - the disastrous impact of Tory austerity and a Tory hard Brexit"". ""There is a massive gulf between her rhetoric and the reality of what is now facing the UK,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby. But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her."" The Local Government Association, which has been calling for an end to the cap on borrowing for house-building, welcomed the council spending announcement. ""Many of the projects that are already under way could quickly be scaled up,"" Conservative councillor David Simmonds, the body's deputy chairman, said. ""Councils have been asking for this for a long time and clearly the announcement today is something that means we can get on with the job."" The CBI - which criticised Mrs May's immigration plans on Tuesday - welcomed her call to ""back business"" and urged MPs to support her Brexit plan to get a deal ""over the line"".

Kuenssberg: The man who can't be ignored,"This video can not be played In full: Theresa May interview with Laura Kuenssberg ""It's over!""... ""He's forgotten the electorate""... ""Who cares?"" These are some of the more polite ways that cabinet ministers have responded to Boris Johnson's recent behaviour. The prime minister who is, publicly, as controlled as they come, revealed a flash of polite irritation telling me - in the interview you can watch on this page - that she is ""cross"" with some of the things he said. Trust me, the things that people in government have been saying about him privately are often far worse than that. Johnson speech made me 'cross', says May Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' The view of some of Mr Johnson's former colleagues is that he is a charlatan, who never showed that he could do the work needed, to show the responsibility required, to make decisions that would affect the lives the public. There are numerous anecdotes of how the former foreign secretary would make promises he never kept, wouldn't properly focus on the documents, the detail, that came across his desk in one of the highest offices in the land. However, in a moment of proper candour, another of his former colleagues who knows him well, told me that the truth is, ""we're all a bit jealous"". That's the crux. You may not trust Boris Johnson to run a bath, let alone the country. But just as in the Vote Leave campaign, we saw today that there is a constituency of people who want to hear him, who want to watch him, who care what he thinks and find that what he says inspires them. And on a serious point, that's not soap opera, some insiders close to the Brexit negotiations agree with him that the prime minister's Chequers proposal is not going to work. The government's official position of course is that it is the only offer that's workable and deliverable, and many ministers believe it can be at least the basis for a final deal. But today, baldly, one minister told me: ""Chequersisdead, and the prime minister will have to pivot."" That's why although his colleagues, and No 10, are more and more annoyed about his behaviour, he brought the Tory conference to life today, and why Boris Johnson cannot be ignored.

"Would young people vote Tory for ÃÂ£10,000?","""Kids say 'I believe in Conservative things, but I can't vote Tory, they're evil'. How do we deal with that situation?"" Carly, a former teacher from Watford, knows what it's like to belong to a political tribe that dare not speak its name. ""Being a Conservative teacher, you learn to keep very quiet,"" she told a packed meeting at the party conference. ""Walking into a teachers' room is like walking into a socialist convention."" Her fellow sufferers - let's call them ""Tories Anonymous"" - nodded in sympathy and applauded. They knew what she was talking about. ""I am afraid of commenting on my opinions about things on social media. I even say I'm voting Labour,"" said a man from the West Midlands. Another woman said she had tried to organise a talk by Health Secretary Matt Hancock - a man so down with the kidshe even has his own app- only to be told by her contact that, actually, it might not be such a great idea. ""She said 'my entire university house is Conservative but I can't own up to it and I can't possibly have him come and talk to us'."" The Tories seeking young voters Tories taught to be 'real' on Instagram But don't all young people go through a rebellious left-wing phase before growing up and becoming a Tory, asked one man at the Resolution Foundation meeting. No, he was told by the MPs on the panel, it was different this time. ""Not enough people feel they have a stake in this country,"" said former Education Secretary Justine Greening. The dream of getting on to the property ladder - something that had sustained her when she was growing up in Rotherham - was now out of reach for many young people, she said. And the Conservatives were never going to win another election if they did not take action to win back a ""lost generation"" of voters. Theresa May and Philip Hammond reach out to some young apprentices The key number was 47 - below that age the majority of people vote Labour, above it they vote Tory. All the stats suggested that figure was getting higher all the time, the meeting was told. There were some things the Tories could do immediately to win back younger voters, said MP George Freeman, such as scrapping the 6% interest rate on student loans and building far more affordable homes. But it was also about ""tone"". Take this party conference - it was too boring and corporate, he said. It should be more like a music festival. ""For a young community, being a culture-free zone in an age of culture politics is very toxic. We begin to look like the besuited bank managers of austerity, who have no vision of the spirit and the soul that makes life worth living. ""And if we become like that I think they will treat us like that."" The room was packed for the session The Conservatives had to speak out more against corporate greed and were in danger of looking like ""the landlords' party, not the tenants' party"", said Mr Freeman, a former policy adviser to Theresa May, who was now on a roll. Why not let top universities charge more than Â£9,000 in tuition fees - but only if they offer zero-fee bursaries for ""bright kids from low income backgrounds""? Why not set up a work experience scheme for ""blue-collar youngsters"" to experience life in Africa, to be funded by the Department for International Development? Then there was Brexit. Journalist Rachel Sylvester's suggestion that the Tories get behind a second EU referendum had been earlier been met with boos and jeers from Tory members in the room. Mr Freeman said he was no fan of Brexit, but his party should be sounding a bit more positive about it. ""Brexit could still be a moment of profound and inspiring renewal. But it's starting to look, after two years, like a street alley-cat fight between lawyers, bureaucrats and people hoping to wrestle the crown off the PM."" The ""religious zealotry"" of Conservative hard Brexiteers looks ""completely weird to a generation under 45 and I fear will lead us to Corbyn having the keys to Brexit Britain"", he said. George Freeman and Justine Greening fear their party has lost the youth vote But perhaps the most radical idea was proposed by the organisers of the meeting, the Resolution Foundation think-tank. Why not give all young people Â£10,000? This ""citizen's inheritance"" would be made available to all under-30s in work from 2030, but it would be phased in from 2020, to be used for housing deposits, skills training, pensions savings or ""entrepreneurship"". ""That more than doubles the wealth of the majority of people aged 30,"" said Lord Willetts, the think-tank's chairman. If Conservatives wanted to get more people on the property ladder ""we need to provide some means of getting them started"", he added. His defence of the policy had been prompted by a complaint from the audience. This sounds exactly like the sort of ""moon-on-stick"", unfunded promise that Jeremy Corbyn would come up with, the Tory party member had thundered. He looked like he was still in his teens.

US to end visas for gay diplomat partners,"The US has announced it will deny diplomatic visas to same-sex partners of foreign diplomats and United Nations employees. The change went into effect on Monday, giving partners currently in the US until 31 December to leave, get married or otherwise change their visa. It is a reversal of rules introduced in 2009. Currently, 25 countries have recognised same-sex marriage. Homosexuality remains illegal in 71 countries. The new Trump administration policy update was circulated in a United Nations (UN) memo. The memo states: ""As of 1 October 2018, same-sex domestic partners accompanying or seeking to join newly arrived United Nations officials must provide proof of marriage to be eligible for a G-4 visa or to seek a change into such status."" G-4 visas are granted to employees of international organisations and their immediate families. Where is gay sex still against the law? Straight civil unions get green light in UK According to the State Department, ""only a relationship legally considered to be a marriage in the jurisdiction where it took place establishes eligibility as a spouse for immigration purposes"". Same-sex marriage remains unrecognised or illegal across much of the world In a 12 July note to the UN, the US Mission to the UN lauded the change as a step towards equality, saying ""same-sex spouses of US diplomats now enjoy the same rights and benefits as opposite-sex spouses"", US media report. But critics have called the move unfair to homosexual partners, given a large number of countries do not recognise same-sex marriage. Former US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power decried the policy, calling it ""needlessly cruel and bigoted"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UN-Globe, advocates for LGBT equality in the UN,said the Trump administration's new policy was ""an unfortunate change in rules"",external. ""Couples already inside of the United States could go to city hall and get married. But they could potentially be exposed to prosecution if they return to a country that criminalises homosexuality or same-sex marriages."" After the end of this year, unmarried same-sex partners of diplomats and UN employees will be expected to leave the US within 30 days if they remain unmarried and without a visa status change. Sad story of Australia's first gay wedding How tide turned on same-sex marriage The only exception, however, would be same-sex partners of officials coming from countries that do not recognise same-sex marriage,external. They will be granted a diplomatic visa if the government which sends them to work in their embassies in the US grants the same privileges to same-sex partners of US officials sent to that country. A senior State Department official told the BBC that they are concerned about the human rights implications of the change and are willing to discuss individual concerns. The new policy is a reversal of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2009 decision to allow same-sex domestic partners of foreign officials diplomatic visas.

Trump: 'Scary time for young men',"This video can not be played Trump: ""Somebody could accuse you of something and you're automatically guilty."" President Donald Trump has told reporters it is a ""difficult"" and ""scary"" time for young men in the US. Mr Trump's remarks came as he reiterated his support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is battling sexual misconduct claims by several women. A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh has been delayed as the FBI investigates the claims, which he denies. Mr Trump said he believed the Senate would approve the judge. His appointment would be expected to tilt America's top court in favour of conservatives for years to come. #BelieveWomen v #BackBrett Key takeaways from the Kavanaugh hearings Watch: 'They're using #MeToo politically' Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said: ""My whole life I've heard, 'you're innocent until proven guilty', but now you're guilty until proven innocent. That's a very, very difficult standard. ""It's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of."" The president said he was waiting to see what would come out of the FBI investigation into his top court pick, and he did not want to ""interrupt"" anything. At a rally later in Southaven, Mississippi, Mr Trump mocked last week's Senate testimony by Prof Christine Blasey Ford, without mentioning her by name. She says Judge Kavanaugh, 53, assaulted her when they were teenagers. This video can not be played How US teens talk about sexual assault The audience laughed as the president said: ""Thirty-six years ago this happened: I had one beer! Well, you think it wasâ¦? Nope! It was one beer. ""Oh, good. How'd you get home? I don't remember. How'd you get there? I don't remember. Where was the place? I don't remember. ""How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know! What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know. ""Where's the house? I don't know! Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know! But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Mr Trump then criticised those who he accused of manipulating the accusers for political reasons. ""They want to destroy people,"" he said. ""These are really evil people."" The crowd chanted: ""We want Kavanaugh! We want Kavanaugh!"" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America correspondent The president has come to the defence of young (presumably white, presumably privileged) men, innocent or guilty, who suddenly find their reputations and livelihood threatened a year after the #MeToo whirlwind first swept on to the scene. In a nation whereyoung black men are incarcerated at a rate five times,externalthose of their white counterparts, the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"" in criminal proceedings may ring hollow. For the rest of the nation, however - particularly the wealthy and well-connected - it has been central to the American concept of justice and due process. Those guarantees are proving to be scant protection now, however, when it's the court of public opinion, the court of the mass media, the court of American culture at large that are rendering their verdicts. Judge Kavanaugh's critics have been quick to point out that his nomination process is more akin to a job interview, where the worst that can happen is he doesn't get a promotion to the most powerful court in the nation. But is it just a promotion at play? Judge Kavanaugh's defenders counter that the accusations against him risk making the man a professional and social pariah. He has been disavowed by students and faculty of his alma mater, and his Harvard Law School teaching job has been terminated. If his nomination fails, he may still be a judge - but he will be always be the accused judge. The court of public opinion may not send people to prison, but - as the president notes - its verdicts come with their own sharp bite. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday only senators will see the FBI's report on its investigation. Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans want the FBI inquiry over this week. Meanwhile, a lawyer for Prof Ford said they had yet to be contacted by investigators, five days after the inquiry was launched. ""It's inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her,"" her legal team wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Republicans accuse Democrats of seeking to delay a vote until after the mid-term elections, in the hope they will win control of Congress and derail Judge Kavanaugh's appointment. But Democrats say they should not be rushed into a vote and the FBI should be allowed more time to investigate all allegations against the nominee. Why US top court is more political than UK's Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court Top judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein said Friday would be too soon to vote on the nomination, as Republicans are thought to be planning. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has fiercely championed the nominee, said the president should put Judge Kavanaugh forward again if the Senate fails to confirm him. Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who helped spur the FBI inquiry, criticised the judge for ""sharp and partisan"" remarks in his own Senate testimony last week. ""That concerns me,"" Mr Flake said at an event in Washington on Tuesday. ""We can't have this on the court."" It is not clear how Mr Flake will vote, but Republicans narrowly control the Senate by 51-49 and can only afford one defection. In his recent testimony, Judge Kavanaugh portrayed the allegations against him as a smear plot ""on behalf of the Clintons"". Appearing at the same event as Mr Flake on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton scorned the nominee's claim. ""I mean, really,"" she said. ""Yes, it deserves a lot of laughter."" What will the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh actually do? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Judge Kavanaugh denies the claims of three women: Psychology lecturer Prof Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to come forward, says he tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a house party in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17 Deborah Ramirez, a student at Yale at the same time as him, says he exposed himself to her during a college drinking game Julie Swetnick says she went to house parties attended by him in the early 1980s, where she said he and his friends had tried to ""spike"" girls' drinks Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers?

FBI 'hasn't spoken to Kavanaugh accuser',"This video can not be played Mr Trump cast doubt on Prof Ford's credibility President Donald Trump has mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford against his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at a rally in Mississippi. ""What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know,"" Mr Trump said. ""But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Days earlier he had said Prof Ford was a ""credible"" and ""compelling"" witness. Prof Ford told a Senate committee that Mr Kavanaugh assaulted her as a teenager, an allegation he denies. Mr Trump ordered the FBI to examine the claims following the Senate testimony. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh However, Prof Ford's lawyers say the FBI has not yet spoken to her and say it is ""inconceivable"" that the agency could conduct a thorough investigation without interviewing her. The FBI investigation is due to be completed by Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate must vote on confirming Mr Kavanaugh this week. He told supporters in the town of Southhaven that his political opponents had been ""trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced"". He then mocked Prof Ford's testimony, saying she appeared not to remember basic details about the alleged assault. This video can not be played ""Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling"" The audience laughed as the president said: ""Thirty-six years ago this happened: I had one beer! Well, you think it wasâ¦? Nope! It was one beer. ""Oh, good. How'd you get home? I don't remember. How'd you get there? I don't remember. Where was the place? I don't remember. ""How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know! What neighbourhood was it in? I don't know. ""Where's the house? I don't know! Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know! But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters."" Shortly after Prof Ford's dramatic testimony to the Senate committee last week, Mr Trump said she was ""very compelling"" and described her as a ""very fine woman"". Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump reiterated his support for Mr Kavanaugh, saying he believed the Senate would approve the judge. He told reporters it was a ""very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of"". On Wednesday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake - who joined a committee vote in favour of the judge with the caveat of an FBI investigation - called the president's comments mocking Prof Ford ""appalling"". ""There's no time and no place for remarks like that,"" he said on NBC's Today show. ""To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. It's just not right. I wish he hadn't had done it."" Senator Flake is a closely watched swing vote on this issue because Republicans can potentially only afford one defection if they are to confirm their nominee. Prof Ford's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, described Mr Trump's words as ""a vicious, vile and soulless attack"" on her. ""Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well?"" he added. This video can not be played Trump: ""Ford's testimony was very compelling"" When she spoke before the Senate committee last Thursday, Prof Ford recalled that the house where the alleged assault took place was in the Chevy Chase-Bethesda area in the wealthy suburbs of Washington DC. The president seemed to suggest she did not know on what floor of the property the alleged attack had occurred, but Prof Ford told senators she remembered being pushed into a bedroom on the upstairs level. She testified that it occurred in the summer of 1982.In her initial letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein,external, she wrote that the assault happened ""during high school in the early 1980's"". Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who questioned Prof Ford during testimony, said she had told a polygrapher the alleged assault happened in the early 80s, then crossed out the word ""early"". Prof Ford did acknowledge in her testimony that she could not provide all the details asked of her - including how she arrived at the party or how she left it and where exactly it took place. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor ""I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to,"" she said. ""But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget."" Experts have said it is not unusual for victims of trauma to remember certain details vividly but have little recollection of other things that the brain may have accorded less significance to. Investigators have spoken to the key witness to the alleged assault on Prof Ford, Mr Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge. Prof Ford alleges that Mr Judge also took part in the assault at a high school party in 1982. Mr Judge has denied any memory of the incident. The agency has also spoken to the Judge Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who alleges that he exposed his genitals to her during a drinking game at Yale university. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking The truth about false assault accusations What will the FBI investigation actually do? Reuters reported that investigators spoke to Ms Ramirez for more than two hours on Sunday and she provided a list of more than 20 possible witnesses. However, Prof Ford's lawyers say they have had no contact from the FBI despite having tried to get in touch with them. They said the agency had not responded to the offer to interview Prof Ford, or ""a series of emails and letters in which we identified witnesses and evidence that would likely assist the FBI"". At least three other people who knew Mr Kavanaugh from his time at Yale have tried unsuccessfully to contact the FBI about the claims against him, Reuters reported. A lawyer for a third woman, Julie Swetnick - who alleges Judge Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s - has questioned why she has not been contacted by the FBI. Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? The judge has said he did not know Ms Swetnick and that her allegations ""never happened"". Senate committee Republicans on Tuesday took the extraordinary step of releasing an explicit letter attacking Ms Swetnick, sent by a man who claims to be a former boyfriend. Ms Swetnick's lawyer, Michael Avenatti,told the Washington Post,externalthe letter was ""bogus and outrageous"" - a ""fabricated"" attack to help Republicans ""ram through this nomination"". On Sunday, the Senate Republican Communications Center said Ms Swetnick was ""not credible at all"". This video can not be played Kavanaugh: ""The Swetnick thing is a joke"" Some reports have suggested that the FBI could wind up its investigation well before the deadline of this Friday. Citing unnamed Republican aides,the Wall Street Journal reported that the bureau could finish ""as soon as"" Wednesday.,external The FBI will pass its findings to the White House, which will give them to the Senate. The contents are not expected to be made public. Senators will then vote on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The Senate leader has vowed to hold a vote on the nominee this week. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said Friday would be too soon. She argued that senators needed more time to evaluate the FBI's findings. Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking What did the FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh result in?

"Would young people vote Tory for Â£10,000?","""Kids say 'I believe in Conservative things, but I can't vote Tory, they're evil'. How do we deal with that situation?"" Carly, a former teacher from Watford, knows what it's like to belong to a political tribe that dare not speak its name. ""Being a Conservative teacher, you learn to keep very quiet,"" she told a packed meeting at the party conference. ""Walking into a teachers' room is like walking into a socialist convention."" Her fellow sufferers - let's call them ""Tories Anonymous"" - nodded in sympathy and applauded. They knew what she was talking about. ""I am afraid of commenting on my opinions about things on social media. I even say I'm voting Labour,"" said a man from the West Midlands. Another woman said she had tried to organise a talk by Health Secretary Matt Hancock - a man so down with the kidshe even has his own app- only to be told by her contact that, actually, it might not be such a great idea. ""She said 'my entire university house is Conservative but I can't own up to it and I can't possibly have him come and talk to us'."" The Tories seeking young voters Tories taught to be 'real' on Instagram But don't all young people go through a rebellious left-wing phase before growing up and becoming a Tory, asked one man at the Resolution Foundation meeting. No, he was told by the MPs on the panel, it was different this time. ""Not enough people feel they have a stake in this country,"" said former Education Secretary Justine Greening. The dream of getting on to the property ladder - something that had sustained her when she was growing up in Rotherham - was now out of reach for many young people, she said. And the Conservatives were never going to win another election if they did not take action to win back a ""lost generation"" of voters. Theresa May and Philip Hammond reach out to some young apprentices The key number was 47 - below that age the majority of people vote Labour, above it they vote Tory. All the stats suggested that figure was getting higher all the time, the meeting was told. There were some things the Tories could do immediately to win back younger voters, said MP George Freeman, such as scrapping the 6% interest rate on student loans and building far more affordable homes. But it was also about ""tone"". Take this party conference - it was too boring and corporate, he said. It should be more like a music festival. ""For a young community, being a culture-free zone in an age of culture politics is very toxic. We begin to look like the besuited bank managers of austerity, who have no vision of the spirit and the soul that makes life worth living. ""And if we become like that I think they will treat us like that."" The room was packed for the session The Conservatives had to speak out more against corporate greed and were in danger of looking like ""the landlords' party, not the tenants' party"", said Mr Freeman, a former policy adviser to Theresa May, who was now on a roll. Why not let top universities charge more than Â£9,000 in tuition fees - but only if they offer zero-fee bursaries for ""bright kids from low income backgrounds""? Why not set up a work experience scheme for ""blue-collar youngsters"" to experience life in Africa, to be funded by the Department for International Development? Then there was Brexit. Journalist Rachel Sylvester's suggestion that the Tories get behind a second EU referendum had been earlier been met with boos and jeers from Tory members in the room. Mr Freeman said he was no fan of Brexit, but his party should be sounding a bit more positive about it. ""Brexit could still be a moment of profound and inspiring renewal. But it's starting to look, after two years, like a street alley-cat fight between lawyers, bureaucrats and people hoping to wrestle the crown off the PM."" The ""religious zealotry"" of Conservative hard Brexiteers looks ""completely weird to a generation under 45 and I fear will lead us to Corbyn having the keys to Brexit Britain"", he said. George Freeman and Justine Greening fear their party has lost the youth vote But perhaps the most radical idea was proposed by the organisers of the meeting, the Resolution Foundation think-tank. Why not give all young people Â£10,000? This ""citizen's inheritance"" would be made available to all under-30s in work from 2030, but it would be phased in from 2020, to be used for housing deposits, skills training, pensions savings or ""entrepreneurship"". ""That more than doubles the wealth of the majority of people aged 30,"" said Lord Willetts, the think-tank's chairman. If Conservatives wanted to get more people on the property ladder ""we need to provide some means of getting them started"", he added. His defence of the policy had been prompted by a complaint from the audience. This sounds exactly like the sort of ""moon-on-stick"", unfunded promise that Jeremy Corbyn would come up with, the Tory party member had thundered. He looked like he was still in his teens.

Mixed-sex civil partnerships to go aheadAnyone in England and Wales will soon be able to choose a civil partnership instead of a marriage.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan are looking forward to setting a date All couples in England and Wales will be able to choose to have a civil partnership rather than get married, Theresa May has announced. The move, which follows a Supreme Court ruling, will give mixed-sex couples and their families the option of greater security, the government said. And it will address the ""imbalance"" that allows same-sex couples to choose, but not mixed-sex couples. A couple who campaigned for the right said it was a ""major step"" forward. But they said they would only celebrate ""when legislation is agreed"". Others have taken to social media to welcome the news and even take the extra step of proposing civil partnerships to their partners. Catherine Oakley sent a message on WhatsApp to her boyfriend Sam,who she describes as ""the embodiment of understatement"", asking him to ""not marry me"". Allow Twitter content?

""It's not the most romantic or conventional of proposals,"" she told the BBC. ""Marriage comes with historical, religious and gendered connotations - this offers a blank canvas. ""It's uncharted territory, so you can make it your own."" 'Time is running out for us' 'Why we want a civil partnership' US to end visas for gay diplomat partners The proposed change comes afterthe Supreme Court, in June, ruled in favour of Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, who wanted to be allowed to have a civil partnership. The court said that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Scottish government is also now carrying out a consultation on allowing mixed-sex couples to enter into civil partnerships. They were created in 2004 to give same-sex couples - who at the time couldn't marry - similar legal and financial protection to a marriage. They weren't available to mixed-sex couples. Then, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales and the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 did the same there. Since then, same-sex couples there have been able to choose between marriage or civil partnerships - except in Northern Ireland, where they are still not able to marry. But the opposite didn't become true - mixed-sex couples didn't get the right to a civil partnership. That's what's now set to change. A civil partnership is formed by signing a document. There is no requirement for a ceremony to take place or to exchange vows - unlike for a marriage - but you can do so if you wish. There are a range of reasons people give for not wanting to get married. High on the list, the feeling among some that marriage as an institution doesn't reflect their equal relationship because of its roots in traditional gender roles. Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan campaigned for four years to get the law changed and more than 130,000 people signed an online petition in support of civil partnerships for everyone. The couple said the ""legacy of marriage... treated women as property for centuries"" and was not an option for them. ""We want to raise our children as equal partners and feel that a civil partnership - a modern, symmetrical institution - sets the best example for them,"" they added. Beyond the issues of principle, there are many practical reasons for why some unmarried couples might now want to enter into a civil partnership. As the BBC's legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman explains, many of the 3.3 million co-habiting couples in the UK believe they possess similar rights and protections to those enjoyed by married couples - but they don't. Civil partnership win for mixed-sex couple Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal? It can cause enormous distress when co-habiting partners find out - often on separation or the death of their partner - that they have far fewer inheritance, property and pension rights than they had thought. Becoming civil partners means couples will get these benefits without having to get married. The government said there were ""a number of legal issues to consider, across pension and family law"" and ministers would now consult on the technical detail. Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt promised that the change in the law would happen ""as swiftly as possible"". Mr Keidan said the couple had become ""accidental campaigners"" on the issue, but told BBC News: ""It wasn't just about us. ""There are many, many thousands of couples who would wish to form a civil partnership."" He said he now wanted the law to change and to know when the first mixed-sex civil partnerships would happen. Ms Steinfeld added: ""Charlie and myself can finally formalise our relationship in the way we see fit."" The couple fought for four years before winning their case at the Supreme Court Martin Loat, of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign, also welcomed it as ""another important step forward towards civil partnerships for all"". He added: ""Legislation would be fair, popular and promote stable families. It's a shame it won't be introduced before April 2019, as that is when I am set to get married and I would much rather be ""civilly partnered"". Slow process I guess, but good news that consultations are happening. As the legal precedent is now there, it should be legislated for as soon as possible.Salli LaBelle Platt I'm so pleased. We have been together since 1979 and have two grown up children. I never wanted to get married, for me it carries too many connotations of ""belonging"" to a man.Ann Storey Richard and I were one of the first couples to sign a Civil Partnership in December 2005. Unexpectedly, Richard died suddenly in 2013.  Having the law on my side - especially when it came to dealing with pension rights etc - was important.Stuart Warburton-Smith Conservative MP Edward Leigh tweeted saying civil partnerships should be extended to include siblings as well.

"Freeze on fuel duty to continue, says May","Mrs May will bring the Conservative Party conference to a close with her keynote address Fuel duty is to be frozen for the ninth year in a row, the prime minister is to announce - saying the government is ""on the side of ""hard-working families"". Mrs May will tell the Conservative conference: ""They are the people for whom this party must deliver."" A car is a necessity ""not a luxury"" for millions of people, she will add. Last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the policy saved drivers money, but would cost the Treasury Â£38bn if it continued for another three years. A tax on fuel - currently 57.95p per litre of petrol, diesel, biodiesel, and bioethanol VAT of 20% is also charged on most fuel Fuel duty isexpected to raise Â£28.2bn,externalfor the government in 2018-19 The Green Party has criticised previous freezes, saying the extra money could be spent on public transport, walking, and cycling. But AA president Edmund King said the freeze would bring relief to millions of UK drivers and businesses. ""The high pump prices are already forcing many families to cut back on journeys, household expenditure or both,"" he said. The average UK petrol price is currently 130.6p per litre, while diesel is 134.5p. In the past 12 months, average petrol prices have gone up by 11.5p a litre, with diesel up by 14p a litre. According to the RAC Foundation,external, 61% of the price of petrol and nearly 60% of the price of diesel is taxation. Mrs Maywill close the Conservative conferenceby declaring Britain's post-Brexit future is ""full of promise"" and vowing the ""best days lie ahead of us"". And, in confirming the fuel duty freeze, she will say the difference having a ""little bit of money left to put away at the end of the month"" cannot be ""measured in pounds and pence"". ""It's the joy and precious memories that a week's holiday with the family brings,"" she will say. ""It's the peace of mind that comes with having some savings."" Follow this link for Fuel Calculator,external Mr Hammond said the policy had come ""at a significant cost to the Exchequer"". ""But the high oil price and the near-record pump price of petrol and diesel are also imposing a significant burden on motorists,"" he added.

What the PM's cross about,"This video can not be played In full: Theresa May interview with Laura Kuenssberg ""It's over!""... ""He's forgotten the electorate""... ""Who cares?"" These are some of the more polite ways that cabinet ministers have responded to Boris Johnson's recent behaviour. The prime minister who is, publicly, as controlled as they come, revealed a flash of polite irritation telling me - in the interview you can watch on this page - that she is ""cross"" with some of the things he said. Trust me, the things that people in government have been saying about him privately are often far worse than that. Johnson speech made me 'cross', says May Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' The view of some of Mr Johnson's former colleagues is that he is a charlatan, who never showed that he could do the work needed, to show the responsibility required, to make decisions that would affect the lives the public. There are numerous anecdotes of how the former foreign secretary would make promises he never kept, wouldn't properly focus on the documents, the detail, that came across his desk in one of the highest offices in the land. However, in a moment of proper candour, another of his former colleagues who knows him well, told me that the truth is, ""we're all a bit jealous"". That's the crux. You may not trust Boris Johnson to run a bath, let alone the country. But just as in the Vote Leave campaign, we saw today that there is a constituency of people who want to hear him, who want to watch him, who care what he thinks and find that what he says inspires them. And on a serious point, that's not soap opera, some insiders close to the Brexit negotiations agree with him that the prime minister's Chequers proposal is not going to work. The government's official position of course is that it is the only offer that's workable and deliverable, and many ministers believe it can be at least the basis for a final deal. But today, baldly, one minister told me: ""Chequersisdead, and the prime minister will have to pivot."" That's why although his colleagues, and No 10, are more and more annoyed about his behaviour, he brought the Tory conference to life today, and why Boris Johnson cannot be ignored.

Tinchy Stryder: 'Why I am giving blood',"This video can not be played Tinchy Stryder has shared his experience of giving blood for the first time withBBC Radio 5 Live, in the hope of encouraging more people to donate. The rapper has close friends and family members with sickle cell disease. People with sickle cell have misshapen blood cells which do not carry oxygen efficiently around the body. This can cause extreme pain and life-threatening infections. Blood transfusions help to reduce and prevent these symptoms. There is a particular need for the rare blood sub-type Ro, which is more common in people of African/Caribbean descent. Tinchy told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""A lot of people know about sickle cell but are not aware of how they can help. ""Six minutes of my time donating blood can save three lives. That's deep."" NHS Blood and Transplant says one blood donation can save or improve up to three lives, including sickle cell patients.
