The hospital boy misinformation war,"Near identical claims about a faked photo were posted on multiple social media accounts It's the image that catapulted the NHS to the forefront of the election and led to a difficult day on the campaign trail for Boris Johnson. Leeds General Infirmary has apologised to the family of Jack, four, who was pictured sleeping on the floor of the hospital after being admitted with suspected pneumonia. The hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Yvette Oade, said she was ""extremely sorry"" that no bed was available because the unit was experiencing ""exceptionally high levels of demand"". But despite this statement, numerous posts have been spreading on social media claiming the photo was staged. So where did these claims come from? The photo, which was printed on the front page of the Yorkshire Evening Post and the Daily Mirror, was taken by Jack's mother. She said he'd been seen as soon as he arrived and given a bed and oxygen, but a few hours later the bed had to be given to another patient and Jack was left without one for more than four hours. His mother saidshe then made a makeshift bed for her son with coats and took the picture. On Monday, an ITV journalist tried to show Boris Johnson the photo on his phone but the prime minister initially refused to look at it. Johnson criticised over reaction to sick boy image The footage has been viewed millions of times on Twitter alone. Within hours of the exchange with the prime minister, this post emerged on Facebook claiming that, according to ""a good friend"" who is a senior nursing sister at Leeds Hospital, the mother staged the photo to send to the media and that, in fact, the boy did have a hospital trolley. It was first posted on Facebook we think at about 18:30 GMT on 9 December. This post, shared at least 20,000 times, has since been deleted. Near-identical versions of this statement have been posted on social media BBC Newsnight has spoken to the owner of this account who said that they do not, in fact, have a good friend who is a senior nursing sister at Leeds hospital. The woman, in her 50s, who does not want to be named, said she'd accepted a friend request from someone claiming to be an old school friend on Monday afternoon. Despite not recognising them, she accepted and then looked at her new friend's Facebook page. She saw the post about the hospital and copied and pasted it into her own account. She said the way it suddenly went viral made her suspect she'd been the victim of a co-ordinated ploy. She's now taken down her social media accounts. Posts with identical wording to the original Facebook post emerged on Twitter within a few hours on Monday evening. The posts gained wider traction after they were shared by accounts including Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson and the Conservative politician Michael Fabricant. Facebook later said the ""I know a nurse..."" claim had been rated as false by fact-checking organisationFull Fact,externaland would be flagged as such to readers. ""So if it's still being shared it will now appear much lower in people's news feeds with a grey overlay screen saying 'false information' linking to Full Fact's post."" A different post suggested that the object next to the boy was a bed and so the photo was staged. But the hospital in its apology to Jack's family had said there was no bed there: ""We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed."" This claim was first posted on Facebook in a pro-Brexit group and shared by similar accounts. It then made its way on to Twitter as well. The third post claims to be from a former paediatric nurse who questions the photo based on the type of oxygen mask the boy was using. It was shared by a number of Twitter accounts including one called PickleBertie and their post, according to the archived version of the tweet, which has now been deleted, was retweeted 529 times and liked 739 times. PickleBertie's account has now been deleted, but an archived version of their Twitter page from early December reveals a high level of anonymity (a generic picture of a dog with a UK flag and no personal details such as a name or link to other social media pages).

"Roxette singer Marie Fredriksson dies, aged 61","Roxette sold more than 80 million records worldwide Roxette singer Marie Fredriksson has died aged 61, her manager has confirmed. The Swedish star achieved global success in the 1990s with hits like Joyride, The Look and It Must Have Been Love, from the film Pretty Woman. A statement said,externalthe singer had died on Monday, 9 December ""following a 17-year long battle with cancer"". ""You were the most wonderful friend for over 40 years,"" her bandmate Per Gessle said. ""Things will never be the same."" Allow YouTube content?

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Fredriksson was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2002, after collapsing in her kitchen following a workout. The tumour cost her the vision in her right eye - but after three years of treatment, she returned to public life and toured successfully again with Roxette from 2008 to 2016. However, the cancer eventually returned: Fredriksson's family said she had died following a recurrence of ""her previous illness"" earlier this week. ""Thank you, Marie, thanks for everything,"" said Gessle in a heartfelt statement. ""You were an outstanding musician, a master of the voice, an amazing performer. Thanks for painting my black and white songs in the most beautiful colours. You were the most wonderful friend for over 40 years. ""I'm proud, honoured and happy to have been able to share so much of your time, talent, warmth, generosity and sense of humour. All my love goes out to you and your family."" ""Marie leaves us a grand musical legacy,"" added her manager Marie Dimberg. ""Her amazing voice - both strong and sensitive - and her magical live performances will be remembered by all of us who were lucky enough to witness them. But we also remember a wonderful person with a huge appetite for life, and woman with a very big heart who cared for everybody she met."" Hailing from Halmstad, Sweden, Roxette first met in the late 1970s, when Fredriksson was a member of the pop outfit Strul & Ma Mas Barn and Gessle was playing with Gyllene Tider, one of Sweden's biggest groups. They teamed up in 1986, becoming huge stars in their homeland with the single Neverending Love, followed by a hit album, Pearls of Passion. Despite their popularity in Scandinavia, Capitol Records declined to release their records in the US. It wasn't until an American student studying in Sweden brought a copy of their second album home to Minneapolis, and persuaded a local radio DJ to play The Look, that they achieved international fame. That song became the first of four US number ones for the band, while its parent album, Look Sharp!, went platinum. They achieved their biggest success when their 1987 Christmas single, It Must Have Been Love, was re-written for inclusion on the Pretty Woman soundtrack in 1990. It topped the charts in more than 10 countries, and gave the band their biggest UK hit, reaching number three. Roxette continued to tour and release albums throughout the 1990s - eventually selling more than 80m records worldwide. Known for breezy pop hits like Dressed For Success and power ballads such as Listen To Your Heart, they cheekily summarised their songwriting philosophy in the title to their 1995 greatest hits album, Don't Bore Us, Get To The Chorus. After a brief hiatus, during which Gessle reunited with Gyllene Tider, the duo scored further hit albums with 1999's Have a Nice Day, and 2001's Room Service. The singer retired from touring in 2015 Fredriksson's devastating cancer diagnosis came the following year. She spent three years receiving treatment, and later wrote about the ""fear"" she'd experienced in a solo record, called The Change. ""Suddenly the change was here,"" she sang, ""Cold as ice and full of fear / There was nothing I could do / I saw slow motion pictures / Of me and you."" In 2005, Fredriksson told Sweden's Aftonbladet newspaper her treatment had been successful, saying: ""It's been three really hard years [but] I'm healthy."" The singer took up painting during her treatment, but surprised Roxette fans by making a return to the stage with Gessle in Amsterdam in 2008. The band later mounted a comeback tour that sold out venues across Europe, and released several new albums but, by 2016, Fredriksson's health was failing and doctors advised her to stop touring. In her autobiography, the singer wrote about the impact cancer had on her life. ""At last, it feels like I have reconciled myself to having a radiation injury to live with. That this is how it turned out,"" she said in The Love Of Life. ""I have lost many years through the disease. And it is also a sadness to age. But every day I think I'm grateful to be sitting here. And that I can still sing."" In her final single, 2018's Sing Me A Song, the star appeared to address her mortality, singing: ""The love I had and gave / Makes it hard to say goodbye"" over an elegant, mournful jazz backing.

Maurice Saatchi quits own advertising firm,"Maurice Saatchi has quit the advertising agency he co-founded in 1995 along with three other directors in the wake of an accounting scandal. M&C Saatchi shares have collapsed this year from a high of about Â£4 each to 103 pence after profit warnings. The company also revealed a Â£11.6m hole in its earnings last week. Lord Saatchi founded the firm with his brother Charles after being forced out of Saatchi & Saatchi after a shareholder revolt. As well as Lord Saatchi, Lord Dobbs, Sir Michael Peat and Lorna Tilbian all quit the board of the firm. Lord Dobbs, a Conservative politician, is best known for creating the House of Cards novels, which were turned into TV series in the UK and the US. Sir Michael is a former accountant and courtier, and Ms Tilbian is a media analyst and stock broking executive. M&C Saatchi is famous for the controversial New Labour, New Danger campaign for the Conservatives in 1997. Labour won with a majority of 179. Much more successful was the brothers' 1979 Conservative campaign, Labour Isn't Working. Jeremy Sinclair, the company's chairman, said: ""We have accepted the decision of these directors to resign. We are determined to restore the operational performance and profitability of the business."" Last week the company warned 2019 profit would be ""significantly below the levels expected"". In September it revealed a slide in sales and profit for the first half of the year. Profit fell 67% to Â£2.5m.

Deadly gun battle erupts in Jersey City,"This video can not be played Witnesses described hearing rounds of gunfire during the incident A police officer and at least five other people have died in a series of gun battles in Jersey City, in the US state of New Jersey. Two other police officers were wounded during the incident, which ended in a shootout after two gunmen barricaded themselves in a kosher supermarket. A motive for the incident is not yet known. But the mayor said investigators believe the location was ""targeted"". Several local schools and businesses were also put on temporary lockdown. Authorities identified the police officer who died as Joseph Seals, 39, who was part of a state-wide programme to confiscate illegal weaponry. Speaking to reporters, Jersey City Police Chief Mike Kelly said Mr Seals was a ""leading police officer in removing guns from the street"". Dozens of armed officers were deployed as the suspects took shelter at a supermarket Mr Kelly said violence first erupted at a cemetery just after 12:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Local media reported that confrontation between police and the suspects was linked to a murder investigation, but this has not been confirmed by authorities. Police at the scene immediately came under ""high-powered rifle fire"", Mr Kelly told reporters, and it is believed that Mr Seals was killed while approaching the two suspects, who have not been publicly identified. The pair fled the scene in a van and took shelter in a kosher supermarket where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Investigators believe the two gunmen killed three people in the shop before they were shot dead. At least one survivor from the shop is being treated for injuries. Mr Kelly said investigators also believe the suspects' van contained an ""incendiary device"" which was removed and taken away for examination by police disposal specialists. Officials initially said they believed the shop was chosen at random and that they did not believe it was an act of terrorism. But on Tuesday night, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on Twitter that authorities ""now believe the active shooters targeted the location they attacked"". Police said three people in the shop may have been killed by the suspects ""Due to an excess of caution the community may see additional police resources in the days/weeks ahead,"" Mr Fulop said, noting there has been no indication of further threats. Officials have not elaborated on why they believe the location was targeted. They have also not commented further on whether the attack was driven by anti-Semitism. But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said while there was no known threat to the city, he had also placed police on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area. ""This tragically confirms that a growing pattern of violent anti-Semitism has now turned into a crisis for our nation,"" he said in a tweet. ""And now this threat has reached the doorstep of New York City.""

Hundreds of fake McDonald's coffee stickers seized,"Police searched the man's vehicle and found multiple sheets of fake coffee stickers A motorist stopped by police was found with hundreds of fake McDonald's coffee stickers in his car. The driver in Bradford was found with multiple sheets of stickers, similar to ones McDonald's customers are given when they buy hot drinks. Police said he was trying to defraud the loyalty scheme, in which six stickers can be exchanged for a free coffee. McDonald's said anyone with counterfeit stickers would be refused a free drink. The man was stopped on Westgate Hill Street on Sunday by the Steerside Enforcement Team, which deals with anti-social and criminal use of the roads in Bradford. West Yorkshire Police confirmed the driver was given a ""community resolution"" for fraud in relation to the stickers and also arrested on suspicion of drug-driving. He will be summonsed to court for the drug-driving offence. Writing on Twitter, the enforcement team said: ""It may seem inconsequential, but it is illegal to cheat a company like this. ""Just pay for your coffee!""

"Vote tactically, urges Farage","Nigel Farage has urged traditional Labour supporters in Leave-voting seats to vote ""tactically and sensibly"" to ensure Brexit Party MPs are elected. He said his party needed a ""bridgehead"" in the next Parliament to ensure Boris Johnson did not ""sell out"" the 17.4 million people who backed Brexit. Mr Farage said his party could get ""over the line"" in a handful of seats. And he warned of ""years of indigestion"" unless there were major changes to the PM's ""oven-ready"" Brexit deal. At his final press conference of the campaign, Mr Farage defended his party's election strategy, which has seen it focus on Labour-held seats such as Grimsby, Hartlepool and Barnsley which voted to leave the EU in 2016. He has come under fire from within his own party for not doing more to help the Conservatives win a Commons majority, an outcome which Mr Johnson has said will enable the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Parties focus on key messages as poll day nears Young voters quiz politicians on housing and Brexit Four Brexit Party MEPs were suspended last week for urging Mr Farage, who has campaigned for the UK to leave the EU for decades, to scale back the party's efforts to help the Conservatives. A number of Brexit Party candidates in target Tory seats have said they have stopped campaigning in the final 48 hours before Thursday's election and urged people to vote for their opponents. Mr Farage suggested his candidate in Lincoln, Reece Wilkes, may have been effectively coerced into backing the Conservatives, saying he could ""only imagine the pressure that individuals would have come under"". He dismissed suggestions that the party was at risk of splitting the Leave vote, saying it was ""tearing chunks"" out of the Labour vote in seats like Grimsby, leaving the Conservatives in a strong position to win. ""Far from splitting the vote, in some parts of the country we are actually making Boris Johnson's life rather easier,"" he said. Mr Farage said it was important his party was represented in the next Parliament to deliver a ""proper"" Brexit and keep Mr Johnson to his pledge to negotiate a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU, allowing the UK to fully diverge from EU rules and standards. The PM has insisted he can negotiate an agreement by the end of 2020 before the transition period agreed with the EU ends, citing the existing close economic alignment between the UK and the bloc. But Mr Farage said the EU would have the ""upper hand"" in the ""agonising"" negotiations that lay ahead and there was a risk of the UK getting trapped in an arrangement where it had to follow EU rules and standards without any say in setting them. Unless there were significant changes to the UK's blueprint for future relations, he said Mr Johnson's deal - which the PM has said is ""oven-ready"" and could be swiftly passed by Parliament - would give the country ""indigestion for years and years to come"". ""We can avoid that by establishing a bridgehead of Brexit Party MPs,"" he said. ""It does not matter if there aren't too many of them."" He added: ""As much as I want Brexit, I don't want to see Brexit sold out. I am convinced that without the Brexit Party's voice we will not get the Brexit that 17.4 million people voted for. ""I am also convinced that in some of our strongest seats we are going to get some over the line. ""My appeal is to Leave voters in those constituencies which have been Labour for ever and will be Labour when you wake up on Friday morning unless you use your vote tactically and sensibly... don't waste your vote"".

NZ volcano rescuer tells of 'Chernobyl'-like scene,"This video can not be played Paramedic Russell Clark: ""Everything was blanketed in ash"" A paramedic who flew to New Zealand's White Island to rescue tourists after Monday's volcanic eruption has said the scene was like something out of ""the Chernobyl mini-series"". ""Everything was blanketed in ash,"" Russell Clark told TVNZ. Dozens of tourists were on the island at the time. Six have been confirmed dead. Eight others are feared to have died and about 30 have serious burns. New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern praised the crews of four rescue helicopters. ""Those pilots made an incredibly brave decision under extraordinarily dangerous circumstances in an attempt to get people out,"" she told reporters on Tuesday. ""To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your unfathomable grief and in your sorrow."" Who are the White Island victims? As it happened: Details emerge of eruption In his interview, Mr Clark said he and his fellow rescuers had found a ""devastating scene"" when they landed. ""There was a helicopter on the island that had obviously been there at the time and its rotor blades were off it."" A clip posted on Twitter showed an ash-covered helicopter on the island as the eruption took place At least 47 people from around the world were on the island at the time of the eruption. Questions are being asked about why tourists were allowed to approach New Zealand's most active volcano three weeks after seismologists raised its alert level, describing the situation as ""moderate to heightened volcanic unrest"". ""These questions must be asked and they must be answered,"" Ms Ardern said in parliament on Tuesday. A police investigation is under way. Geological hazard monitoring group GeoNet warned last week that White Island ""may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal"" - but it also said ""the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors"". This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island Currently, the alert level is at three, indicating the risk of a ""minor volcanic eruption"". Thirty-four people were rescued, one of whom later died. Most of the victims are still receiving treatment in hospital. Officials say they have burns to more than 30% of their bodies. Several others are also suffering from inhalation burns. Police said they were ""unsure"" what state the bodies that remained on the island were in, saying they were probably ""covered in ash"". The privately-owned volcano that is always active This video can not be played New Zealander who lost leg in previous eruption talks about his experience, in the aftermath of White Island tragedy White Island remains too dangerous to access, but reconnaissance flights conducted earlier on Tuesday saw no survivors. Ms Ardern said there were no signs of life and that the focus was now ""on recovery"". There were 24 visitors from Australia, nine from the US, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two from China, two from the UK, and one person from Malaysia. The first victim to be identified was tour guide Hayden Marshall-Inman, a local of nearby town Whakatane, who according to New Zealand media has been named by his brother on Facebook. The second person confirmed to have died is from Malaysia, the country's High Commission said. Another tour guide from New Zealand, 23-year old Tipene Maangi, is among the missing. His family told media he had been called in on his day off. In pictures: White Island eruption New Zealand profile Two British women were among those receiving treatment, said the UK High Commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he ""feared"" three of the five confirmed dead were Australian. Mr Morrison said that 24 Australians had been on board a cruise ship exploring the island in the Bay of Plenty when the volcano erupted. Of those, 13 were in hospital and 11 were unaccounted for, he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy, a time of great innocence and joy interrupted by the horror of that eruption,"" Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney. A web page has been set up by theNew Zealand Red Cross for families to register missing loved ones.,external White Island, also called Whakaari, is privately owned and a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. The volcano erupted in two explosions in quick succession at around 14:11 (01:11 GMT) on Monday, sending up a thick plume of ash and vapour. A live feed from the volcano showed several visitors inside the crater before the stream went dark. A group of visitors (circled) could be seen inside the crater before images went dark Some survivors were rescued by boat in the immediate aftermath of the explosion, but police said it was too dangerous to mount a rescue operation. But later four rescue helicopter missions picked up several people from the island. Since then, emergency services have been unable to search the area because of dangerous conditions, with plumes of ash continuing to rise above the volcano. Authorities on Tuesday said there was a 50% chance of a second eruption of the same size or smaller in the next 24 hours, but that it was unlikely there would be a bigger eruption that would affect the mainland.

Conservatives âsee highest rise in Twitter abuseâ,"The abuse of candidates on Twitter has escalated during the election campaign, research suggests, with Conservatives seeing the biggest rise. Abuse spiked after TV debates, a study by the University of Sheffield found - with abuse of Tories rising and Labour and Lib Dem levels remaining stable. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn received most, followed by Tory leader Boris Johnson. Others have reported being threatened with sledgehammers and targeted by abusive graffiti and vandalism. Conservative candidate Andrea Jenkyns told the BBC some of the abuse she received had been ""sexually violent"", while the SNP's Lisa Cameron said social media trolls had threatened to behead her. MPs describe threats, abuse and safety fears Ex-MPs talk about abuse and mental health Women MPs say abuse forcing them from politics Researchers looked at the abusive replies candidates received on Twitter during the first four weeks of the general election campaign. They cross-referenced a database of slurs and offensive words with the contents of responses to tweets sent by candidates standing on 12 December. While the Labour and Conservative leaders received the most abuse, the study found that Health Secretary Matt Hancock, cabinet minister Michael Gove and Labour candidate David Lammy received the next highest levels. Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, and Labour's Diane Abbott also received substantial levels of abuse. Of the top 20 recipients of abuse between 3 November and 4 December, the study found that 11 were Conservative, seven were Labour and two were Lib Dem. And while candidates of all parties received abusive tweet replies, Conservative candidates saw a rising level of abuse towards them as the campaign got under way - something that was not echoed in responses to either Labour or Lib Dem candidates, researchers said. Professor Kalina Bontcheva, who leads the research team behind the study, said the overall rise in abuse suggested ""extreme voter polarisation"", with people using a variety of insults to attack the political orientation or opinion of candidates. ""This is combined with an even more disturbing rise in vitriolic personal abuse and threats - often targeting the candidates due to their race, gender, country of birth, or religion,"" she said. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external Michael Gove saw a spike in abuse levelled at him around the time of Channel 4's election debate on climate change, the study found. He had offered to take the place of Mr Johnson in the debate, but the broadcaster refused, saying the invitation was for leaders only. Instead, the programme ""empty chaired"" Mr Johnson. More generally, Brexit, immigration and policing all drew fire on Twitter for the Conservatives, while Labour was attacked for tweets on immigration, Brexit, democracy and business and enterprise, according to the study. The Lib Dems drew disproportionate amounts of abuse for posts on Brexit, democracy, community and society, it said. Candidates Andrea Jenkyns, Sarah Wollaston and Luke Pollard have all been victims of abuse Andrea Jenkyns, Conservative candidate for Morley and Outwood, has noticed the type and level of online abuse directed at her get worse. She said abuse had been directed at her from people with fake profiles. One of her campaign team was recently chased down the street by a man with a sledgehammer. ""It can be pretty horrific, some of it, actually,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm a blunt northern lass who believes in fighting, but I think the sad thing is my threshold - my tolerance levels - has widened. I probably accept a lot more now than, ordinarily, I would have done."" The SNP's Lisa Cameron added: ""I've already had people online, particularly over the Halloween period, calling me a witch and a monster and, you know, making fun and mocking me, mocking my parents, mocking me in general."" ""Then I received death threats online from individuals saying they were coming to behead me, sending pictures of beheaded corpses,"" she added. For Sarah Wollaston, Liberal Democrat candidate for Totnes, abuse can feel relentless, with ""torrents"" of it often being whipped up online. ""It's a great shame. It's become normalised. For me I just don't notice it. I set my filters higher. Unpleasant messages I mute them. A lot of people I want to interact with but if you do, you are just feeding it."" She added: ""It is coming at you in every form - online, in the mail, even things like dirty underwear being delivered to my office - unpleasant stuff that my team then have to deal with."" The word ""pedo"" was sprayed across the front of a Labour candidate's office in Plymouth Luke Pollard, Labour candidate for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, has also received abuse on social media and hashad his constituency office daubed with homophobic graffiti. Although there was no place for such abuse, he said, he called on politicians on all sides to take responsibility for the tone of the current debate. ""In the heated, divisive, contested atmosphere of a general election, you know people respond to the hate they see and the division they see from politicians - and that contributes to this very toxic atmosphere,"" he said. Police told the BBC they had received almost 200 reports relating to election candidate security between 15 November and 4 December. However, about half of the reports did not constitute a crime. Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, advised election candidates and their volunteers to familiarise themselves withpolice safety guidance,externaland to contact police with any concerns. ""Police will investigate all reports of abuse and will seek to prosecute those who act outside the law,"" he added. It comes as separate research revealedthe extent of misleading advertisingon social media by political parties and campaign groups at this election. Non-profit organisation First Draft looked at every paid-for Facebook ad from the three main UK-wide parties run over the first four days of December. For the Conservatives, the group said 88% (5,952) of the party's most widely promoted ads either featured claims that had been flagged by independent fact-checking organisations, including BBC Reality Check, as not correct or not entirely correct. For the Lib Dems, it said hundreds of potentially misleading ads had featured identical unlabelled graphs, with no indication of the source data, to claim it was the only party that could beat either Labour, the Conservatives, or the SNP ""in seats like yours"" For Labour, it said it could not find any misleading claims in ads run over the period. However, it noted that the party's supporters were more likely to share unpaid-for electioneering posts than those of its rivals.

UK ports 'preparing to host EU customs checks',"The shipping industry is drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland. The BBC has learned that freight could be diverted through ports with space for inspections such as Liverpool and Stranraer, despite the government denying checks will be necessary. Customs staff at the relevant ports could include EU representatives, under the details of the new withdrawal deal. The government said it has secured a ""great new deal."" There is also a proposal for smaller ""pop up labs"" at ports - mobile testing labs for health checks on food exports. There has been at least one meeting this month between officials and shippers to discuss suitable ports. One key issue is the diversion of freight to ports with enough capacity to process the freight traffic and carry out the necessary checks required by the Brexit deal. The Port of Liverpool has an existing Border Inspection Point for exports outside of the EU. Stranraer could be used to process checks for ships using the nearby Cairnryan port, which has limited space. Industry figures spoke to the BBC after leaks from within Whitehall clearly listed ""facilities for high levels of checks and controls"" as one of ""a number of challenges"" with delivering the PM's Brexit deal by December 2020. Despite claims by Boris Johnson that there will not be any checks on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, the industry is planning for them on the basis of the detail of the deal secured with the EU in October. One senior industry figure said that there was an ""implicit understanding"" that such checks for food products would be in Great Britain, partly because of sensitivities about new infrastructure representing a form of trade barrier within the UK. Reality check: Will there be checks between Great Britain and NI? Johnson's Brexit plan 'presents major challenge' Brexit: Where the parties stand on it The BBC also understands that EU officials suggested that the checks should be in Great Britain, to avoid having to send back foodstuffs not compliant with EU single market rules. The precise nature of the border checks depends on how aligned the UK remains with the EU, the decisions of the Joint Committee of the EU and the UK to be set up after Brexit, and whether UK authorities are willing to accept security and revenue risks in order to keep trade flowing. Technology could also help alleviate some of the checks. On Sunday the prime minister said there was ""no question"" NI/GB checks Paperwork and some checks will be required for agrifood imports into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, on the regulatory compliance of goods with the single market, and for trade tariffs for goods deemed to be at risk of being taken to the Republic of Ireland. Goods remaining in Northern Ireland should have their tariffs repaid by the UK government, but a system for this is yet to be implemented. The prime minister has also argued that only goods destined for the EU would face checks, but the industry says even verifying that would mean checking some intra-UK trade. Both the leaked memo from DExEU - the Department for Exiting the European Union - and a similar Treasury note last week confirm scepticism that the necessary changes to infrastructure are possible within the PM's self-imposed deadline of December 2020. The leaked DExEU memo suggests that work would have to start before negotiations on a future deal finish. ""The Prime Minister has been clear that the great new deal he has struck will not introduce new checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,"" the Conservative Party said in an email. ""We have struck a great new deal which will take the whole UK - including Northern Ireland - out of the EU and the EU's Customs Union. As we leave we will strengthen our union and ensure all parts of our country benefit from the opportunities that Brexit offers.""

UK growth slowest since early 2009,"The economy suffered its worst three months for more than a decade after official figures revealed output failed to grow once again in October. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed the economy flatlined month-on-month in October, after two months of declines. It was the weakest three months since early 2009. The figures come ahead of Thursday's general election, with the main parties all promising to boost growth. Although the service sector expanded 0.2% in the August-to-October period, that was offset by a 0.7% contraction in manufacturing and 0.3% fall in construction. The ONS said there had been ""a notable drop in housebuilding and infrastructure in October"". UK wage growth slows as unemployment falls Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy PwC, blamed Brexit-related uncertainty for the economy's ""loss of momentum"". He said: ""Growth seems likely to remain subdued through the rest of 2019, but we would hope for a gradual revival in activity over the course of 2020 if current political and economic uncertainties ease. Our main scenario is for 1% GDP growth in 2020 assuming an orderly Brexit."" Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool's management school, described the figures as ""quite poor"". ""The main point is that our economy continues to disappoint badly, which will probably bring a Bank of England interest rate cut much closer especially if Thursday's election turns out very inconclusive,"" he said. Jack Leslie, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that the UK's domestic challenges come against a weak global economic outlook for next year. ""While the main parties have avoided any discussion of this challenging economic environment during the election campaign, navigating it will be a central task for the next government nonetheless,"" he said. However, the pound shrugged off the figures, continuing to rise on Tuesday after gains on Monday. In early London trading, sterling was up 0.2% at $1.3157, and against the euro rose 0.1% to 84.18p ""Sterling price action is all about the upcoming parliamentary election and real economic data should continue to play second fiddle,"" ING analysts said in a note sent to clients. Separately, the ONS released trade data which showed Britain's goods trade deficit widened by more than expected to nearly Â£14.5bn in October from Â£11.5bn in September.

Drugs and guns found on Juice Wrld's jet,"Stars including Drake, Chance The Rapper and Ellie Goulding have paid tribute to the star Police say they found guns and drugs on the private jet that carried rapper Juice Wrld to Chicago before he died on Sunday morning. Law enforcement officials were waiting for the plane when it landed, having received information that banned substances might be onboard. It was during a subsequent search of the aircraft that the rapper had a seizure that led to his death. An autopsy on the 21-year-old has proved inconclusive. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said on Monday that additional studies were needed before they could determine the cause of death. Allow Twitter content?

Police in Chicago said they did not suspect foul play; but gave some additional details that shed light on the sudden death of one of hip-hop's brightest rising stars. Their search uncovered 41 ""vacuum-sealed"" bags of marijuana, six bottles of prescription codeine cough syrup, two 9 mm pistols, a .40-caliber pistol, a high-capacity ammunition magazine and metal-piercing bullets, authorities told the US media, including theChicago Tribune,externaland theNew York Times,external. Two men identified by police as Juice Wrld's security guards have been charged with illegally possessing guns and ammunition. Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman, said the star ""began convulsing (and) going into a seizure"" as  authorities were searching two carts of luggage at about 2am on Sunday morning. Federal agents quickly administered Narcan, a drug used to revive people thought to be overdosing on opioids, and the Chicago Fire Department was on the scene in under seven minutes, Guglielmi said.

"Clean air plan targets cars, stoves and industry","Port Talbot is at risk from fine particle pollution thanks to its industry and road system A clean air plan targeting emissions from industry, roads and wood-burning stoves has been published. Public Health Wales estimates air pollution contributes to up to 1,400 deaths a year. As well as tackling issues from cars and industry,the plan,externalexamines the trend for wood-burning stoves at home and impacts of fireworks and bonfires. ""We have made good progress but we must continue to improve,"" said Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths. As well as using existing regulations, the Welsh Government wants to publish a new Clean Air Act in this assembly term. But the issue is complicated because levels of pollution can change depending on weather and atmospheric conditions, while concentrations can be higher near busy roads and industry. Pollution trends in Wales are influenced by emission sources linked to the iron and steel industry Nitrogen dioxide - a widespread problem, largely due to emissions from transport Particulate matter - a fine dust, known as PM10, continues to be a risk in Port Talbot, which has heavy industry and the M4 running through it Nickel - levels from industrial processes exceed European targets in Pontardawe near Swansea Benzo(a)pyrene - from industry and domestic solid fuel burning, and levels exceed European targets Ground level ozone - again, levels exceed long-term European objectives, and is higher in summer due to the effect of sunlight on nitrogen dioxide Fine dust pollution from roads and industry - and how concentration levels could be reduced ""Long term exposure to the lower levels of pollution in today's atmosphere remains one of the biggest public health challenges, shortening life-spans and damaging the quality of life of many,"" the report says. But it estimates that if Wales succeeds in reducing the impact of air pollution from fine particulate matter by 2030 it could have health benefits worth between Â£50m to Â£96m a year. Ministers now want a panel of experts to advise on the right approach and for targets to be part of the new clean air act. How can Wales tackle air pollution? Public health crisis 'urgent' from poor air British power plant promises to go carbon negative by 2030 The plan stops short of an outright ban on burning solid fuels such as wood and coal in the home. Although far fewer people are burning coal, since 2002 there has been a rise in people burning wood in stoves and fires, especially in urban areas in Cardiff, Swansea and along the north Wales coast. An expert group is already looking at the issue and the report suggests developing a ""comprehensive package of interventions,"" including looking into the burning of wet wood and making sure appliances are up to standard and properly maintained. The plan also wants to raise awareness of schemes such asWoodsure's ready to burn,external. ""It's really important that the wood is dry not wet - and we could look to ban wet wood for instance - and if you burn wood which has wood or varnish on, it's the chemicals which could do the damage, it's issues around that,"" said Ms Griffiths. The consultation looks at reviewing the duties councils have to tackle emissions from domestic fires. ""We want to reduce, and in time eradicate, all emissions from domestic sources including through burning of solid fuels,"" says the plan. ""However, we do recognise a proportion of people rely on solid fuels as a primary means to heat their home."" The report wants to assess the contribution domestic bonfires and fireworks make to pollution - recognising they could harm healthy people as well as those already suffering from respiratory diseases. Smoke control regulations and areas could be part of enforcement, depending on pollution levels. Road traffic is responsible for around 80% of nitrogen dioxide emissions, with diesel vehicles responsible for most of that It promises to look at ways to cut car use, like road pricing and clean air zones - a report is out in March - and incentives to scrap higher polluting vehicles. More charging points for electric vehicles and increasing the share of ""ultra low emission"" vehicles. The issue of ""idling"" - drivers waiting with their engines running. Measures could include ""no-idling"" zones outside schools. Increasing air quality monitoring outside places such as schools, hospitals and care homes to protect those most vulnerable from transport emissions. The Welsh Government also wants to invest an extra Â£60m over three years on implementingthe Active Travel Act, meaning councils must consult locally on developing a safe network for walking and cycling. Homes on one of UK's most polluted roads could be knocked down Life on Wales' most polluted road Dangerous levels of roadside pollution in Wales 'overlooked' The ""right tree in the right place"" can help improve air quality, as well as bring wider benefits, such as restoring sensitive habitats damaged by air pollution, the plan says. There are pockets of Wales which have some of the worst air quality in the UK. Take the infamous Hafodyrynys road in Caerphilly county for example - said to the most polluted outside London. And Cardiff and Port Talbot have both recorded higher levels of harmful particulate matter than Birmingham or Manchester. It's ""killing hundreds of people every year"", the environment minister Lesley Griffiths said today. There are lots of ideas floated in this long-promised plan to tackle the problem. Recorded levels of nitrogen dioxide on the A472 at Hafodyrynys were higher than anywhere else apart from central London in 2015 and 2016 But making many of them work will require a new law - a Clean Air Act - something First Minister Mark Drakeford promised to deliver in his manifesto for the leadership job. And today we've been told there may not be enough time to pass that before the next assembly election in 2021, though we should definitely get a first draft - known as a white paper. The government insists this issue is a top priority, but clean air campaigners are saying their proposed timescale for action ""does not match the severity of the situation"". A12-week consultation,externalhas been launched on the plan. But Ms Griffiths admitted that while she would have preferred it becomes law in this assembly term, it will not be possible before 2021 because of ""all our other priorities"" and Brexit preparations. ""I think it's really important we get that white paper out, we can build on the consultation responses we'll be getting to the clean air plan, to go forward with the bill,"" she added. Joseph Carter, chair of Healthy Air Cymru, a group of charities, said:  ""It's important that we hit the ground running. The plan includes the majority of what we as a collective have been asking for over the past year, but now we would like to see more detail on how key aspects will be delivered, to what exact timescale and how it will be funded"". Friends of the Earth Cymru's director Haf Elgar said it was encouraging to see a comprehensive range of actions across different areas. 'But we need to act urgently,"" she said. ""We cannot wait years to have legislation in place.""

Parties focus on key messages as poll day nears,"Labour and the Tories are focusing on key messages around the NHS and Brexit in the final days of the campaign. While Labour talks about under-funding risks to patients, the Conservatives are promising an end to ""gridlock"". But it is not all plain sailing, asa recording has been leaked of shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthcriticising Labour's election chances. AndBoris Johnson is still facing criticismover his reaction to an image of a sick boy on a hospital floor. Party leaders are campaigning in key constituencies, with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson telling campaigners in Bath that her message to stop Brexit was part of a ""fight for the soul of our country"". She added: ""This is about whether we are open or closed, generous or selfish, whether we reach out and work with others or pull up the drawbridge."" And the SNP is proposing legislation to protect the NHS in Scotland from ""exploitative"" trade deals, with Nicola Sturgeon warning Mr Johnson poses the greatest threat to Scotland of ""any prime minister in modern times"". In other election developments: Ms Sturgeon and other Scottish leaderswill take part in a debate on BBC Scotland later Nigel Farage has criticised Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, claiming it would lead to ""years of agonising negotiations"" TheGreens are focusing on a pledgeto cancel student debt built up since 2012. Labour is pledging a ""relentless focus"" on the health service if it wins power after Thursday's poll, promising changes in the first 100 days. The party says reports produced by NHS trusts in England this month show a health service ""in crisis and on the brink"". An analysis it has conducted of more than 120 NHS trust board papers identified hundreds of risks to patient safety classed as ""catastrophic"" or ""extreme"". The majority were linked to spending, staff shortages or failures of privatisation, the party said. It promised that a Labour government would conduct an immediate audit of the risks revealed. The BBC's Reality Check team said the quotes from the NHS boards were genuine but did not give the nationwide picture, which was more mixed. Johnson's bad day shows election not over Tories target Labour Leave seats in final push Labour Budget to 'end austerity' in first 100 days Speaking in Carlisle, Mr Corbyn said there were four million people waiting for operations on the NHS, along with ""a mental health care crisis and social care crisis"". He added: ""I do not blame the nurses, I do not blame the doctors, I do not blame the health service. ""I blame the government that has underfunded our NHS."" However, the leaked recording of Mr Ashworth -  which shows him telling a Tory activist friend the situation for Labour was ""dire"" and the party had made a mistake by not getting rid of Mr Corbyn as leader - has distracted from the campaign. Mr Ashworth has insisted his apparent criticism of the Labour leader was ""banter"", telling the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire he was ""joshing"" when he told his friend that he thought there was no way Labour could win the election. He also apologised to Labour members on BBC Politics Live. Mr Corbyn said it was ""not the sort of thing I would do"", but claimed the story was ""irrelevant"" and Mr Ashworth was ""making jokes"". He said the reports on the comments were ""just trying to deflect away from the Tories' mess of the National Health Service"". The prime minister is trying to keep the focus on Brexit and the ""danger"" of another inconclusive result in Thursday's election. Speaking at the JCB factory in Staffordshire, Mr Johnson said that without a working majority for the Conservatives it was ""very hard to see"" how the UK could leave the EU, and he was ""fighting for every vote"" to stop a hung Parliament. He said backing him will allow the country to go forward, ""punching through the current deadlock and achieving a brighter future together"". This video can not be played WATCH: Boris Johnson warns of coalition ""disaster"" But there is distraction for the PM too, as he continued to face criticism over his response to a photograph of a four-year-old boy sleeping on the floor of a Leeds hospital due to a lack of beds. On Monday, an ITV reporter tried to show Mr Johnson the picture on his phone, but the prime minister initially refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. He later looked, returned the phone and apologised to the family. This video can not be played Moment Boris Johnson put ITV reporter's phone in his pocket Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that the ""family want their privacy to be maintained"" and for their son Jack ""not to be used as a political football"". He said the prime minister expressed ""sorrow and regret"" for what he saw and apologised to the family, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock also went to Leeds to apologise. There were a number of angry protesters outside the hospital who shouted at Mr Hancock and his team when they left. Two sources told journalists that one of Mr Hancock's advisers had been punched by one of the activists, but footage later showed that had not happened and instead that the aide had walked into a protester's outstretched arm. Challenged on the footage, Mr Buckland said he did not know ""who briefed what to whom"", adding ""what I saw was a very confusing scene of public disorder"". Mr Corbyn has denied politicising Jack's case, but said the incident ""says an awful lot about the NHS"" and the ""shortage of staff"".

Farage in last-ditch appeal to Leave supporters,"Nigel Farage has urged traditional Labour supporters in Leave-voting seats to vote ""tactically and sensibly"" to ensure Brexit Party MPs are elected. He said his party needed a ""bridgehead"" in the next Parliament to ensure Boris Johnson did not ""sell out"" the 17.4 million people who backed Brexit. Mr Farage said his party could get ""over the line"" in a handful of seats. And he warned of ""years of indigestion"" unless there were major changes to the PM's ""oven-ready"" Brexit deal. At his final press conference of the campaign, Mr Farage defended his party's election strategy, which has seen it focus on Labour-held seats such as Grimsby, Hartlepool and Barnsley which voted to leave the EU in 2016. He has come under fire from within his own party for not doing more to help the Conservatives win a Commons majority, an outcome which Mr Johnson has said will enable the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Parties focus on key messages as poll day nears Young voters quiz politicians on housing and Brexit Four Brexit Party MEPs were suspended last week for urging Mr Farage, who has campaigned for the UK to leave the EU for decades, to scale back the party's efforts to help the Conservatives. A number of Brexit Party candidates in target Tory seats have said they have stopped campaigning in the final 48 hours before Thursday's election and urged people to vote for their opponents. Mr Farage suggested his candidate in Lincoln, Reece Wilkes, may have been effectively coerced into backing the Conservatives, saying he could ""only imagine the pressure that individuals would have come under"". He dismissed suggestions that the party was at risk of splitting the Leave vote, saying it was ""tearing chunks"" out of the Labour vote in seats like Grimsby, leaving the Conservatives in a strong position to win. ""Far from splitting the vote, in some parts of the country we are actually making Boris Johnson's life rather easier,"" he said. Mr Farage said it was important his party was represented in the next Parliament to deliver a ""proper"" Brexit and keep Mr Johnson to his pledge to negotiate a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU, allowing the UK to fully diverge from EU rules and standards. The PM has insisted he can negotiate an agreement by the end of 2020 before the transition period agreed with the EU ends, citing the existing close economic alignment between the UK and the bloc. But Mr Farage said the EU would have the ""upper hand"" in the ""agonising"" negotiations that lay ahead and there was a risk of the UK getting trapped in an arrangement where it had to follow EU rules and standards without any say in setting them. Unless there were significant changes to the UK's blueprint for future relations, he said Mr Johnson's deal - which the PM has said is ""oven-ready"" and could be swiftly passed by Parliament - would give the country ""indigestion for years and years to come"". ""We can avoid that by establishing a bridgehead of Brexit Party MPs,"" he said. ""It does not matter if there aren't too many of them."" He added: ""As much as I want Brexit, I don't want to see Brexit sold out. I am convinced that without the Brexit Party's voice we will not get the Brexit that 17.4 million people voted for. ""I am also convinced that in some of our strongest seats we are going to get some over the line. ""My appeal is to Leave voters in those constituencies which have been Labour for ever and will be Labour when you wake up on Friday morning unless you use your vote tactically and sensibly... don't waste your vote"".

Ted Baker bosses quit in latest blow for retailer,"Ted Baker boss Lindsay Page, who was only appointed in April, has resigned in the latest blow for the troubled fashion retailer. The brand's chairman David Bernstein has also quit, and it has issued another profit warning. Ted Baker shares fell by as much as 36% on the news before paring some losses. The firm, which is struggling with falling sales, said the past year had been the ""most challenging in our history"". It has also been dealing with the fallout of amisconduct scandal involving previous boss Ray Kelvin. Mr Kelvin denies the allegations which centre on claims of ""forced hugging"". Issuing its profit warning, Ted Baker said it had seen worse-than-expected trading in November, including on Black Friday. Ted Baker probes Â£25m stock inventory blunder Ted Baker to 'learn lessons' of hugs probe As such, it said its full-year profit - previously forecast by analysts at Â£28.4m - was now likely to be just Â£5m to Â£10m, depending on how well it trades over Christmas. The firm said it had hired consultants Alix Partners to carry out an urgent review of the group's business. It also announced it had suspended its shareholder dividend payout. Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said price discounting across the retail sector was hurting Ted Baker. ""It has left profits unravelling, and the higher price tags on Ted's clothes means it's more vulnerable to price-slashing than some rivals."" She also warned that weak consumer spending in its key UK and Europe markets showed no signs of strengthening. ""Ted isn't down and out at this point, but further blows can't be discounted,"" she said. Shares in Ted Baker have fallen by more than 75% since January, in a year which has seen it give four profit warnings. Last week its bosses also revealed that the group'sinventory had been overstatedby between Â£20m and Â£25m, sparking another tumble in the share price. Chief financial officer Rachel Osborne will become acting chief executive with immediate effect, with Mr Page helping with the transition. Non-executive director Sharon Baylay will take on the role of acting chair following the departure of Mr Bernstein.

"NZ volcano rescuer tells of 'Chernobyl'-like sceneA paramedic who saved tourists says conditions were like something from ""the Chernobyl mini-series"".AsiaRelated contentVideoThe moment after eruption hitWho are the victims of White Island eruption?The active tourist volcano","This video can not be played Paramedic Russell Clark: ""Everything was blanketed in ash"" A paramedic who flew to New Zealand's White Island to rescue tourists after Monday's volcanic eruption has said the scene was like something out of ""the Chernobyl mini-series"". ""Everything was blanketed in ash,"" Russell Clark told TVNZ. Dozens of tourists were on the island at the time. Six have been confirmed dead. Eight others are feared to have died and about 30 have serious burns. New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern praised the crews of four rescue helicopters. ""Those pilots made an incredibly brave decision under extraordinarily dangerous circumstances in an attempt to get people out,"" she told reporters on Tuesday. ""To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your unfathomable grief and in your sorrow."" Who are the White Island victims? As it happened: Details emerge of eruption In his interview, Mr Clark said he and his fellow rescuers had found a ""devastating scene"" when they landed. ""There was a helicopter on the island that had obviously been there at the time and its rotor blades were off it."" A clip posted on Twitter showed an ash-covered helicopter on the island as the eruption took place At least 47 people from around the world were on the island at the time of the eruption. Questions are being asked about why tourists were allowed to approach New Zealand's most active volcano three weeks after seismologists raised its alert level, describing the situation as ""moderate to heightened volcanic unrest"". ""These questions must be asked and they must be answered,"" Ms Ardern said in parliament on Tuesday. A police investigation is under way. Geological hazard monitoring group GeoNet warned last week that White Island ""may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal"" - but it also said ""the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors"". This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island Currently, the alert level is at three, indicating the risk of a ""minor volcanic eruption"". Thirty-four people were rescued, one of whom later died. Most of the victims are still receiving treatment in hospital. Officials say they have burns to more than 30% of their bodies. Several others are also suffering from inhalation burns. Police said they were ""unsure"" what state the bodies that remained on the island were in, saying they were probably ""covered in ash"". The privately-owned volcano that is always active This video can not be played New Zealander who lost leg in previous eruption talks about his experience, in the aftermath of White Island tragedy White Island remains too dangerous to access, but reconnaissance flights conducted earlier on Tuesday saw no survivors. Ms Ardern said there were no signs of life and that the focus was now ""on recovery"". There were 24 visitors from Australia, nine from the US, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two from China, two from the UK, and one person from Malaysia. The first victim to be identified was tour guide Hayden Marshall-Inman, a local of nearby town Whakatane, who according to New Zealand media has been named by his brother on Facebook. The second person confirmed to have died is from Malaysia, the country's High Commission said. Another tour guide from New Zealand, 23-year old Tipene Maangi, is among the missing. His family told media he had been called in on his day off. In pictures: White Island eruption New Zealand profile Two British women were among those receiving treatment, said the UK High Commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he ""feared"" three of the five confirmed dead were Australian. Mr Morrison said that 24 Australians had been on board a cruise ship exploring the island in the Bay of Plenty when the volcano erupted. Of those, 13 were in hospital and 11 were unaccounted for, he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy, a time of great innocence and joy interrupted by the horror of that eruption,"" Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney. A web page has been set up by theNew Zealand Red Cross for families to register missing loved ones.,external White Island, also called Whakaari, is privately owned and a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. The volcano erupted in two explosions in quick succession at around 14:11 (01:11 GMT) on Monday, sending up a thick plume of ash and vapour. A live feed from the volcano showed several visitors inside the crater before the stream went dark. A group of visitors (circled) could be seen inside the crater before images went dark Some survivors were rescued by boat in the immediate aftermath of the explosion, but police said it was too dangerous to mount a rescue operation. But later four rescue helicopter missions picked up several people from the island. Since then, emergency services have been unable to search the area because of dangerous conditions, with plumes of ash continuing to rise above the volcano. Authorities on Tuesday said there was a 50% chance of a second eruption of the same size or smaller in the next 24 hours, but that it was unlikely there would be a bigger eruption that would affect the mainland.

Who are the victims of White Island eruption?,"People have left tributes for those who died Forty-seven people were on White Island, or Whakaari, volcano when it erupted. At least 16 people have died in the tragedy, with two more still missing but presumed dead. More than 30 people were injured with many suffering severe burns.

Marie Browitt stayed on board the ship but her husband Paul and daughters Stephanie and Krystal were on the island at the time of the eruption. Paul and Stephanie have both been badly burned. Tour guide Tipene Maangi had apparently only been working for White Island Tours for a few months before the eruption. A relative said he was not supposed to be at work on Monday. Loved ones described the 24-year-old, known as Tip, as ""the entertainer"" and ""confident and outspoken"". A vigil was held in his honour last week, with relatives calling for his safe return home. In a message on Facebook, his cousin said: ""You've got more than enough attention, it's time to make an entrance, it's time to come out singing your heart out."" Engineer Lisa Hosking is in hospital with severe burns but her daughter, 15-year-old Zoe, and partner, 53-year-old Gavin Dallow, have been confirmed as dead. The family from Adelaide were on a two-week cruise and it is believed they were on a day trip when the volcano erupted. ""We mourn the loss of Gavin and Zoe,"" a family statement said. ""Gavin was a wonderful son and brotherâ¦ he was a generous man, always helping his family and his community. ""Our hearts break at the loss of Zoe at such a young age. We know her loss will also devastate her school community and the local Girl Guides, of which she was an active member."" Kristine and Anthony Langford are among the missing Anthony Langford, 51, his wife Kristineâ, and their two children Jesse, 19, and Winona, 17, were visiting the island as part of their cruise holiday.

Police later confirmed that Kristine also died in the disaster. Winona has been listed as missing but is presumed dead, believed to be in the water off White Island. Local tour guide Hayden Marshall-Inman was the first person named as having died, confirmed by his family. Officially, he remains missing but is presumed dead, also believed to be in the water off White Island. His brother confirmed his death on Facebook, writing: ""Friends and family, very sad news this evening. My bro Hayden Marshall-Inman has past [sic] away doing the one thing he loved. ""Thanks for all your messages. I'll be in touch when we know more."" The post was accompanied by a picture of the family dressed in animal outfits. His brother, who did not want to be named, told local media that Hayden had been doing tours for the past 15 years and knew the risks. ""It is what it is, he died doing what he loved,"" he said. Mother and daughter Julie and Jessica Richards, aged 47 and 20, have also died. Jessica Richards had been studying veterinary science at the University of Queensland and shared with her mother a love of the outdoors, said family spokesman John Mickel. He told reporters on Wednesday that relatives were ""united in grief"". ""For this family, [the festive season] will be one of deep poignancy,"" he said. ""You live in hope that it's not going to be your loved one's name that comes up. The hope was snuffed out this morning."" Berend (left) and Matthew Hollander Brothers Berend Hollander, 16, and Matthew Hollander, 13, died in hospital from their injuries, according to their school. They were US citizens and had moved to Australia six years ago. In a statement cited by Australian media, relatives said they were ""absolutely heartbroken"" at the loss of ""wonderfully kind and spirited boys who lived short but fulsome lives"". Knox Grammar School headmaster Scott James described them as enthusiastic and popular students who had been actively involved in school life. The boys' parents have also been declared dead. Jason Griffiths, 33, died in hospital on Wednesday. He was part of a group of nine friends on a trip that his brother-in-law, Steve Jarzynski, said he had been talking about since last year. Six of the friends said in a statement that they had found Jason in a hospital in the early hours of Tuesday morning. ""From that moment until the moment of his passing, Jason was surrounded by friends and family members,"" they said in a statement released on Wednesday. Jason Griffiths went to the island on a day trip with two others from the group, Australian couple Karla Mathews and Richard Elzer, both 32. One Australian man caught in the eruption has died in hospital in Australia. Local reports said his family requested for his name and age not to be released. US newlyweds Lauren and Matt Urey were on their honeymoon. Lauren's mother,Barbara Barham, told the Washington Post the couple from Virginia had plans to visit a live volcano,externaland were not concerned about possible eruptions. Matt, 36, left his mother a voicemail message saying they had been ""burned very bad"". ""He said he would try to call as soon as he could, but talking and making phone calls was difficult,"" Ms Barham said of the message that Matt's mother relayed to her. ""His hands were so badly burned it was hard for him to make a phone call."" Matt's mother, Janet, revealed he underwent three hours of surgery but was now able to talk, take in fluids and eat jelly. However, Lauren, 32, who is in a different hospital, was still sedated on Tuesday. She revealed the couple, who were wearing respirators at the time of the explosion, had taken shelter ""behind a large rock"". ""Ten minutes... could have meant life or death for them, but luckily they were already down the volcano close to the water, sothey sheltered themselves a little bit,"" she told local news channel 21WFMJ,external. New Zealand tour guide Jake Milbank wasworking on the island on his birthday on Monday when the volcano erupted, according to the New Zealand Herald,external. He is now in hospital with burns to 80% of his body and his family by his side, the paper says. A fundraising page to help with his ""long journey to recovery"" has been set up by a family friend. In September his high school posted on Facebook about a trip to the island and paid tribute to its ex-student, described as an ""awesome tour guide"". The couple from the Sydney suburb of Engadine were initially reported missing but later discovered in hospital, according to Australian media reports. Marion, 56, is said to be in a critical condition, while Nick has severe hand injuries. A Malaysian national is in a critical condition following the eruption, the High Commission of Malaysia in Wellington said in a statement. Officials say the Malaysian, who has not yet been named, is a permanent resident of Australia. A foreign ministry official told AFP news agency that the victim had previously been mistakenly reported to have died in the eruption. ""The victim will be flown to Australia for further treatment,"" the official said. Two British women were hospitalised after the eruption, according to British High Commissioner to New Zealand Laura Clarke. She said assistance was being offered to the families of the women, who have not yet been publicly identified.

The active tourist volcano,"White Island is a popular tourist destination Moments before New Zealand's most active volcano erupted on Monday, tourists were seen walking inside its rim. The privately-owned White Island, or Whakaari, is a popular destination for day tours and scenic flights. It has been dubbed by some tour operators a ""living, breathing, geological giant"" and ""the world's most accessible active marine volcano"". Six people have been confirmed dead since Monday's eruptionand eight are still missing on the island - though police say they are also likely to have died. The incident has raised questions over the safety of the White Island tourism industry and the reliability of volcanic warning systems. Here, two experts explain the background of the volcano and its latest eruption. The volcano is located in the Bay of Plenty, about 48km (29 miles) from the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. GeoNet, New Zealand's geological hazard information site, says White Island has been classified as New Zealand's most active volcano since 1976, when it began 24 years of almost continuous eruption. A second ""eruptive episode"" started in 2011 and continues today. Jan Lindsay, a professor at the University of Auckland, said White Island was ""persistently active in the sense that it has a very active hydrothermal system"". Rather than having lots of eruptions involving magma, she said this meant it saw periodic ash explosions and had lakes ""churning over with gases"". ""The spectacular thing about White Island is that there is so much gas coming out of the volcano and lots of minerals crystallising,"" said Ben Kennedy, a professor of physical volcanology at the University of Canterbury. ""What that also means is that there are minerals crystallising deeper down and creating blockages - that allows pressure to build, and the volcano needs to periodically clear its throat."" He said there had been six small eruptions in the past eight years, but that on previous occasions there had been no tourists on the island ""mostly due to the time or weather conditions"". In 1914, a landslide destroyed a mining village on the island and killed 10 workers. There was a warning of unusual activity at the volcano ahead of Monday's eruption. In November, the alert level was raised from one - meaning minor volcanic unrest - to two, indicating moderate to heightened volcanic unrest. ""There was a heightened level of unrest and everyone was aware,"" Prof Lindsay said. But, she added, ""even though there was increased activity, there was no sense of what was going to happen."" An eruption can occur at any volcanic alert level, but there are also times when a volcano alert is raised to level two and there is no subsequent eruption, according to GeoNet. Prof Lindsay said it was possible there was no magma involved in Monday's eruption, which may have made it harder to detect. ""If you have something that's being driven by the hydrothermal system it's... not like when you have a magma chamber building beneath the volcano and you get lots of seismic activity,"" she said. ""If it's a shallow burp, you may not see that."" This video can not be played How to speak volcano like a pro Prof Kennedy noted that the volcano had been in a ""state of heightened activity"" for the past eight years and that ""the type of volcano it is means small eruptions can happen at any time"" with little to no warning. But, he said, high levels of sulphur dioxide were the ""tell-tale sign"" that prompted the raised alert in November. Monday's eruption was classified as ""moderate"" on the volcanic alert system, according to GeoNet. Prof Kennedy said this was because it only affected the crater area. About 70% of the volcano is underwater, with the crater and surrounding peak standing some 321m (1,053ft) above sea level. Including its underwater base, White Island is the largest volcanic structure in New Zealand. Officials said some 47 people from around the world were on the White Island when it erupted on Monday. Thousands of tourists visit the volcano every year. It was bought by Auckland stockbroker George Raymond Buttle in 1936. He later refused to sell it to the government but agreed in 1952 to have it declared a private scenic reserve. The island is today still owned by the Buttle Family Trust. According to the New Zealand Tourism Guide, the owners of White Island Tours were appointed as the official guardians of the island and access is only granted through designated tour operators. The BBC has contacted White Island Tours for comment. This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island Government agency GNS Science ""put out their alert bulletins and have good communication with tour companies and they know what the risk is"", Prof Lindsay said. ""They go out so often and are used to the volcano's behaviour, but something like this - it happens and it has happened in the past, but you can go years without it happening. It may change the way they do things in the future."" People nearby a phreatic eruption - an eruption driven by superheated steam and gas - are typically killed by ""hot steam and water and what we call ballistic projectiles - blocks being thrown out of the vent"", Prof Lindsay told the BBC. Prof Kennedy compared the incident to the 2014 eruption of Japan's Mount Ontake, where most people hurt were hit by flying rocks ejected out of the volcano. ""There also tends to be a cloud of ash and gas and rocks that might be moving sideways out of the crater,"" he said. White Island reportedly got its English-language name from explorer Capt James Cook in 1769 because it always appeared to be in a white cloud. A number of stories have been written about the volcano and in more recent years it has provided a backdrop to movies including the third instalment of The Chronicles of Narnia series. ""It's a spectacular, otherworldly place,"" said Prof Kennedy. ""It's an environment that you should wear gas masks on because of strong sulphuric gases. You can hear the noise of the gas coming out of the volcano. It's quite an intense but beautiful experience if you do a little circuit and then get off pretty quickly.""

UK growth slowest since early 2009The economy sees the weakest three months for more than a decade and the worst October since mid-2012.,"The economy suffered its worst three months for more than a decade after official figures revealed output failed to grow once again in October. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed the economy flatlined month-on-month in October, after two months of declines. It was the weakest three months since early 2009. The figures come ahead of Thursday's general election, with the main parties all promising to boost growth. Although the service sector expanded 0.2% in the August-to-October period, that was offset by a 0.7% contraction in manufacturing and 0.3% fall in construction. The ONS said there had been ""a notable drop in housebuilding and infrastructure in October"". UK wage growth slows as unemployment falls Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy PwC, blamed Brexit-related uncertainty for the economy's ""loss of momentum"". He said: ""Growth seems likely to remain subdued through the rest of 2019, but we would hope for a gradual revival in activity over the course of 2020 if current political and economic uncertainties ease. Our main scenario is for 1% GDP growth in 2020 assuming an orderly Brexit."" Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool's management school, described the figures as ""quite poor"". ""The main point is that our economy continues to disappoint badly, which will probably bring a Bank of England interest rate cut much closer especially if Thursday's election turns out very inconclusive,"" he said. Jack Leslie, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that the UK's domestic challenges come against a weak global economic outlook for next year. ""While the main parties have avoided any discussion of this challenging economic environment during the election campaign, navigating it will be a central task for the next government nonetheless,"" he said. However, the pound shrugged off the figures, continuing to rise on Tuesday after gains on Monday. In early London trading, sterling was up 0.2% at $1.3157, and against the euro rose 0.1% to 84.18p ""Sterling price action is all about the upcoming parliamentary election and real economic data should continue to play second fiddle,"" ING analysts said in a note sent to clients. Separately, the ONS released trade data which showed Britain's goods trade deficit widened by more than expected to nearly Â£14.5bn in October from Â£11.5bn in September.

House Democrats have levelled two charges at President Trump: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On Thursday, members of the House Judiciary Committee will assemble to vote on both articles, which need to be approved separately. The articles are expected to be passed in the Democratic-controlled committee, before being sent on to the entire House of Representatives for debate. Looking for more? Democratic support for impeachment of Trump is levelling off, new polling suggests. And a majority of all voters oppose the move in three crucial swing states. A poll by FireHouse Strategies released on Tuesday found that Trump's impeachment and removal from office is opposed by 50.8% of voters in Michigan, 52.2%  in Pennsylvania and 57.8% of Wisconsin voters. Meanwhile, an analysis of 50 national polls conducted by FiveThirtyEight indicates that Democratic support for impeachment is slipping slightly. Only nine percent of Republicans support impeachment. The move is supported by 84% of Democrats and 43% of independent voters. FiveThirtyEight found that impeachment is currently supported by 47.9% of Americans and opposed by 43.6%.

The BBC's Tara McKelvey at the White House is getting reaction from those inside on today's announcement.  California Democrat Zoe Lofgren gave her assessment to the BBC in Washington. ""I think the articles are very well founded, they're supported by the evidence,"" said Lofgren, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee. ""But it's not a time for joy, when a president threatens the constitutional order in this way."" Lofgren is the only member of Congress who was part of both the Nixon and Clinton impeachments and is still serving today. Asked by the BBC's Katty Kay if impeachment had become a ""political tool"", Lofgren said she believed the US Founding Father's intended it to ""curb an ongoing threat, which is present in this case"". ""If it talks like a ducks, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, the Republicans are calling it an avocado,"" Lofgren says, quoting a headline in the Washington Post newspaper over an article detailing the Republicans' defence of the president. ""I still hope that the Republicans will look at the facts and reach a conclusion to defend our country."" The articles of impeachment are now written, and are expected to be voted through by the full House in the coming days. You can read them for yourself here: Allow Twitter content?

Congressional Republicans are now speaking, and accusing the Democrats using impeachment to try to overturn the 2016 presidential election. ""Back in 2016, Democrats called those who supported Donald Trump deplorable,"" House Minority Speaker Kevin McCarthy said, referring to a quote from Trump's former rival Hillary Clinton. ""And now, theyâre trying to disqualify their votes,"" he added. ""Democrats still cannot get over the fact that the president won the election and they lost,"" he told reporters, speaking alongside other Republican lawmakers. Trump held a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, in 2016 Trump is holding a re-election rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, tonight - home of the country's most famous chocolate brand. He will undoubtedly denounce the impeachment inquiry, as he has consistently since it began in late September. He then will travel to Michigan with Vice-President Mike Pence for his first visit to the swing state in nine months. Shortly before the Thanksgiving holiday, Trump visited another swing state, Florida, for a ""Keep America Great"" campaign rally. All three swing states were won by Trump in 2016, and will be central to his 2020 campaign. The partial US-Ukraine call log was picked over by lawmakers during November's impeachment hearings Trump has tweeted that Democrats who argue ""that I 'pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 Election',"" know ""that it's not true"". ""Both the President & Foreign Minister of Ukraine said, many times, that there 'WAS NO PRESSURE,' he wrote. He also argued that his request to the president of Ukraine in a 25 July phone call - ""I would like you to do us a favour, though"" - was made on behalf of the United States and not himself. ""Read the Transcripts! 'us' is a reference to USA, not me!"" he says. Democrats say that request for a ""favour"" - which was made after Trump's Ukrainian counterpart mentioned US military aid - was an attempt to have Ukraine meddle in the 2020 US presidential election. That favour, Democrats say, would take the form of a Ukrainian investigation into Trump's political rival, Joe Biden, and another probe into the unsubstantiated ""CrowdStrike"" conspiracy theory that argues that Ukraine - not Russia - sought to meddle in the 2016 election.  Less than an hour after announcing the articles
of impeachment, Pelosi appeared at a different podium with House Democrats to announce they had reached agreement on changes to a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico - Trump's renegotiation of NAFTA. ""This is a day we've all been working to and working for on the path to yes,"" Pelosi said. It's an apparent victory for President Trump, who has promoted the deal across the country and tweeted this morning calling it ""the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA"". Pelosi was peppered by questions from reporters on the timing of the deal, asking how Democrats could give the president a bipartisan win on the same day impeachment articles were announced. ""We're declaring victory for the American worker,"" Pelosi said, stressing the changes made by Democrats to Trump's original deal. ""It's a whiplash morning,"" a reporter said to Pelosi. ""And the day is young,"" she replied. White House Press Secretary Sephanie Grisham and Donald Trump White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham issued a statement following the Democrats' announcement. ""Today, in a baseless and partisan attempt to undermine a sitting president, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats announced the pre-determined outcome of their sham impeachment - something they have been seeking since before President Trump was inaugurated."" ""The announcement of two baseless articles of impeachment does not hurt the president, it hurts the American people... The president will address these false charges in the Senate and expects to be fully exonerated, because he did nothing wrong."" This video can not be played Democrats announce charges of impeachment The US House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The president is accused of pressuring Ukraine to intervene in US domestic politics. Trump denies any wrong doing.
If the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee votes to approve the articles later this week, they will then be submitted to the full House of Representatives for a full vote. If the articles are approved by the House - which is controlled by the Democrats - an impeachment trial in the Republican-held Senate will take place, possibly early in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Ever
since Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she was instructing the Judiciary
Committee to draft articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, speculation
swirled as to what exactly they would look like. Would they be broad, sweeping
in a hodgepodge of alleged presidential misdeeds that include evidence gathered
over the course of Mr Trumpâs three-year presidency? Or would they go narrow,
and focus primarily on this latest Ukraine controversy. Now
we have our answer. Narrow it is. Democrats
probably decided to, as the saying goes, ""keep it simple, stupid"". They have
what they hope will be an easy-to-understand case of presidential abuse of
power, by using the vast tools of foreign policy at his disposal for personal
political gain. As a backstop to these charges, they are accusing the president
of attempting to obstruct Congressâs investigation by denying relevant
documents and witness testimony. At
stake, they will argue, is the security of the 2020 presidential election and
the protection of congressional authority as a co-equal branch of government. The main
script from here appears clear â a quick vote in the Judiciary Committee,
followed by one on the floor of the House of Representatives; presidential
impeachment and a Senate trial. In the
meantime, much to the consternation of some liberals, congressional Democrats
will move to hand the president a policy victory â by approving his
renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And
during all of this, a fever of allegations and accusations â of intelligence
agency misconduct in its investigation of 2016 Trump-Russia ties, presidential
Twitter barbs at his own FBI director, criminal investigations of the
presidentâs personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and much more â continue to swirl
and threaten to erupt and disrupt the process in one way or another. While
the main script may be clear, beneath the surface unpredictability is the only
predictable result. A Roman relief depicts Hercules taming Cerberus, the three-headed beast that guards the gates of Hades, the mythological underworld Jonathan
Turley, professor of constitutional law at George Washington
University,  was called by Republicans to testify on the legal grounds for impeachment last week. He writes that Democrats have made an underwhelming case for removing a president. For three years, Democratic
members have pledged to unleash the dogs of impeachment to devour a president
despised by their base. Today, the doors
finally opened and the public found itself staring not at a multi-headed Cerberus
from Hades, but a couple of underfed chihuahuas. In my testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last week, I focused
on the crimes like bribery that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence
Committee Chairman Adam Schiff declared repeatedly were now well-established. Those claims were legally unfounded and
untenable, though the other witnesses and members vociferously insisted that
they were clear and established.The
response was all too familiar. For three
years, the same Democratic leadership told the public that a variety of
criminal and impeachable acts were proven in the Mueller investigation. None of those crimes are now part of this
impeachment. Why? Because it would have
been too easy an impeachment? Instead, the House will go forward on the only
two plausible grounds that I outlined in my testimony: abuse of power and
obstruction of Congress. Unlike the other claims, the problem is not with the legal
basis for such impeachable offenses but the evidentiary record. This record remains both incomplete and
conflicted. The Democrats have insisted
on impeaching by Christmas rather than build a record to support such
charges. This is now the fastest
investigation with the thinnest record supporting the narrowest impeachment in
modern history. It is precisely what
President Trump (who not surprisingly has supported the Democratic move for a
fast impeachment) would relish. The
Democrats just gave him the best Christmas gift he could hope for. Two chihuahuas with barely the energy to make the walk over to the Senate. Announcing the charges today, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrod Nadler said that ""nothing could be more urgent"" than impeachment, as top Democrats continue to push the process along. So what happens next? 1. Judiciary committee votes on articles of impeachment Nadler's committee plans to vote on Thursday on the two articles which will have to be approved separately. Members are expected to toe the party line,  with the committee's 24 Democrats voting to approve, and the 17 Republicans voting against. 2. House of Representatives debate articles of impeachment As House Speaker, Pelosi will run the show, but Republicans may attempt to slow the process down. 3. House votes on articles of impeachment Each article will be voted on separately and must be approved by a simple majority. Again, the vote is expected to fall along party lines. With Democrats holding a 233-197 advantage, and independent Republican Justin Amash supporting impeachment, the articles are likely to pass. A vote might take place before Christmas. 4. Senate trial Here's where the Democratic-led process will meet a formidable barrier: the Republican-controlled Senate. With Republicans holding a 53-47 majority, the two-thirds majority required to convict the president will be a difficult hurdle to clear. Around 20 Republicans would have to defect from their party for Trump to be removed from office.  Jon SopelBBC North America Editor We knew it was coming. The talk has been of little else. Impeachment seems to be the only thing Iâve been reporting on for these past
couple of months. But even still when the chairman of the Judiciary Committee
charged the president with ""high crimes and misdemeanours"", it still made the
hairs on the back of my neck stand up. For all the sound and fury of today's
politics this is not an everyday occurrence. If the House of Representatives
votes to impeach Donald J Trump, he will join Andrew Johnson (1868) and Bill
Clinton (1998) as only the two other presidents to be sanctioned in this way
since American independence. But that's for the history books. It's what
happens next that matters. Will this be a grievous blow to Donald Trump winning
a second term or will the American people see this as a political hit-job
against their president? The language is of upholding the constitution - but
donât be gulled - there is raw political calculation too. Democrats have made many claims against Trump, but ultimately only chose two articles of impeachment - obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. There had been talk of charging him with ""bribery"", with some Democrats claiming that Trump's requests of Ukraine - in exchange for US military aid - amounted to an illegal quid pro quo (Latin for ""this for that""). They also did not allege ""obstruction of justice"". There had been predictions this might be used in connection with the Mueller report into allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to defeat Democrats in 2016. Mueller did not find evidence of Russian collusion, but did cite 10 instances in which Trump attempted to impede the investigation. The Mueller report did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice, and left it up to Attorney General William Barr - a Trump appointee - to determine that Trump did not break the law. In strategy sessions, the Democrats decided to keep the articles as narrow as possible, so as not to alienate moderate lawmakers who only backed impeachment once the Ukraine issue came centre stage. Speaking to MSNBC after Democrats announced charges, Democratic Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, said his party's role is simple. ""Do we know what happened, can we put it before the American people, and can we hold the president accountable?"" said the New York lawmaker, who represents a district won by Trump in 2016.

"Roxette singer Marie Fredriksson dies, aged 61The singer, whose hits included The Look and It Must Have Been Love, had had a brain tumour.","Roxette sold more than 80 million records worldwide Roxette singer Marie Fredriksson has died aged 61, her manager has confirmed. The Swedish star achieved global success in the 1990s with hits like Joyride, The Look and It Must Have Been Love, from the film Pretty Woman. A statement said,externalthe singer had died on Monday, 9 December ""following a 17-year long battle with cancer"". ""You were the most wonderful friend for over 40 years,"" her bandmate Per Gessle said. ""Things will never be the same."" Allow YouTube content?

Fredriksson was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2002, after collapsing in her kitchen following a workout. The tumour cost her the vision in her right eye - but after three years of treatment, she returned to public life and toured successfully again with Roxette from 2008 to 2016. However, the cancer eventually returned: Fredriksson's family said she had died following a recurrence of ""her previous illness"" earlier this week. ""Thank you, Marie, thanks for everything,"" said Gessle in a heartfelt statement. ""You were an outstanding musician, a master of the voice, an amazing performer. Thanks for painting my black and white songs in the most beautiful colours. You were the most wonderful friend for over 40 years. ""I'm proud, honoured and happy to have been able to share so much of your time, talent, warmth, generosity and sense of humour. All my love goes out to you and your family."" ""Marie leaves us a grand musical legacy,"" added her manager Marie Dimberg. ""Her amazing voice - both strong and sensitive - and her magical live performances will be remembered by all of us who were lucky enough to witness them. But we also remember a wonderful person with a huge appetite for life, and woman with a very big heart who cared for everybody she met."" Hailing from Halmstad, Sweden, Roxette first met in the late 1970s, when Fredriksson was a member of the pop outfit Strul & Ma Mas Barn and Gessle was playing with Gyllene Tider, one of Sweden's biggest groups. They teamed up in 1986, becoming huge stars in their homeland with the single Neverending Love, followed by a hit album, Pearls of Passion. Despite their popularity in Scandinavia, Capitol Records declined to release their records in the US. It wasn't until an American student studying in Sweden brought a copy of their second album home to Minneapolis, and persuaded a local radio DJ to play The Look, that they achieved international fame. That song became the first of four US number ones for the band, while its parent album, Look Sharp!, went platinum. They achieved their biggest success when their 1987 Christmas single, It Must Have Been Love, was re-written for inclusion on the Pretty Woman soundtrack in 1990. It topped the charts in more than 10 countries, and gave the band their biggest UK hit, reaching number three. Roxette continued to tour and release albums throughout the 1990s - eventually selling more than 80m records worldwide. Known for breezy pop hits like Dressed For Success and power ballads such as Listen To Your Heart, they cheekily summarised their songwriting philosophy in the title to their 1995 greatest hits album, Don't Bore Us, Get To The Chorus. After a brief hiatus, during which Gessle reunited with Gyllene Tider, the duo scored further hit albums with 1999's Have a Nice Day, and 2001's Room Service. The singer retired from touring in 2015 Fredriksson's devastating cancer diagnosis came the following year. She spent three years receiving treatment, and later wrote about the ""fear"" she'd experienced in a solo record, called The Change. ""Suddenly the change was here,"" she sang, ""Cold as ice and full of fear / There was nothing I could do / I saw slow motion pictures / Of me and you."" In 2005, Fredriksson told Sweden's Aftonbladet newspaper her treatment had been successful, saying: ""It's been three really hard years [but] I'm healthy."" The singer took up painting during her treatment, but surprised Roxette fans by making a return to the stage with Gessle in Amsterdam in 2008. The band later mounted a comeback tour that sold out venues across Europe, and released several new albums but, by 2016, Fredriksson's health was failing and doctors advised her to stop touring. In her autobiography, the singer wrote about the impact cancer had on her life. ""At last, it feels like I have reconciled myself to having a radiation injury to live with. That this is how it turned out,"" she said in The Love Of Life. ""I have lost many years through the disease. And it is also a sadness to age. But every day I think I'm grateful to be sitting here. And that I can still sing."" In her final single, 2018's Sing Me A Song, the star appeared to address her mortality, singing: ""The love I had and gave / Makes it hard to say goodbye"" over an elegant, mournful jazz backing.

The 13 key policies in the Conservative manifesto,"The Conservative Party launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan Get Brexit Done, Unleash Britain's Potential. It sets out the policies the party aimed to introduce should it win the election, which it has now done by a huge majority. Thefull document,externalran to 59 pages. But what were the promises that the party hoped would grab the public's attention? Reintroduce maintenance grants for nursing students. At present, there are just under 300,000 full-time equivalent posts. The party hopes to train more nurses by reintroducing maintenance grants of between Â£5,000 and Â£8,000 a year for students. The scrapping of these grants in 2017 was controversial and was followed by a fall in applicants. So, it is something of a U-turn. However, the policy will not involve a return to the pre-2017 policy of free tuition for nursing students. The 50,000 figure is reached by including foreign recruitment and policies for better retention of nurses. Labour promised to recruit 24,000 nurses - based on higher numbers in training - and introduce free tuition fees and maintenance grants. Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales would benefit from the funding. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? This video can not be played Boris Johnson launches the party's manifesto Get Brexit ""done"" early in 2020. In the least surprising promise in this manifesto, Boris Johnson made a personal guarantee that he would get Brexit ""done"" in January if he won a majority. He said that will end the political divisions in the country, but that seems unlikely. The Conservatives also promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and confirm that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? A little bit more spending - and a bit more tax. There were no rabbits out of the hat, no huge tax cuts, or rises, and no big ticket new spending item. By design, the tax and spend numbers were smaller than those of the Liberal Democrats and, especially, Labour. They have space to do a lot more within the new borrowing rules. But Chancellor Sajid Javid and Prime Minister Boris Johnson want to keep a tight ship. There will be a little bit more spending and a bit more tax too. But it amounts to less than 1% of the size of the economy. The big picture is several billion a year of extra spending, but not several tens of billions. Keep the so-called triple lock on the state pension. Keeping the popular ""triple lock"" means the state pension will be increased by the CPI measure of inflation, wage growth or 2.5% each year - whichever is the highest. Critics say that keeping it in place is unaffordable and that it doesn't help the poorest and oldest pensioners who are on the old state pension. But tampering with it would have been politically radical - all of the major parties have committed to it in this election. The Conservatives have learned from past mistakes. Theresa May pledged to scrap the 2.5% guarantee in the 2017 election, and was forced to abandon the pledge to win support from the DUP. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. A cross-party consensus on care will be built. Boris Johnson promised tofix the crisis in adult social care, but the manifesto contains little more than the guiding principle that no-one will have to sell their home to pay for care. As things stand, few would call these details an ambitious plan, but the Conservatives' pledge to urgently build a cross-party consensus on future care will be welcomed. The system is already at breaking point, and experts warn the extra Â£1bn a year promised for the next five years won't be enough to prop it up. Not least, because the money will be shared with equally overstretched children's services. The Tory calculation appears to be that it is best to say as little as possible, rather than risk being tripped up by an issue that cost them dearly at the last election. Social care is devolved so this will only apply in England. Meet the pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero. Conservative climate policies will attract scrutiny. In June, they set aworld-leading goal of cutting emissions to virtually zero by 2050. And they've created a boom in cheap offshore wind energy. Butinterim emissions targets are already slipping away,external. What's more, some scientists are warning that the climate needs even more urgent repair. That led the Lib Dems and SNP to propose an earlier clean-up date of 2045. Labour says it should be by the 2030s. The Greens want 2030 - which would mean practically all petrol and diesel vehicles banned, all homes insulated and all central heating boilers changed within a decade. So, it's not just a question of the date - it's whether the policy can be delivered. Energy policy applies to the whole of the UK, as does policy relating to exports. What is a climate emergency? Where the UK's recycling really goes CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Improve the energy efficiency of social housing. The UK's homes are so poorly insulated that to meet the country's 2050 climate commitments we need a nationwide programme to upgrade them. This pledge to spend Â£2,860 per household on improving the energy efficiency of social housing would affect 2.2m homes. But there's no mention of what would be done for those who own their own home. The claim that households could save up to Â£750 a year on their energy bills sounds optimistic and could only apply to homes with terrible energy efficiency. The typical saving after such work on housing, experts say, tends to be more like Â£50. The policy is dwarfed by Labour's promises of spending Â£9,300 per home on almost all of the 27 million homes in the UK, at a cost of Â£250bn. Housing is devolved so this will only apply to England. Fewer lower-skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. The last Conservative manifesto reiterated the leadership's intention to reduce net migration to less than 100,000. It became an albatross - a much-criticised target that was never achieved.  Boris Johnson had already jettisoned it in favour of an Australian style points-based system, attracting ""the brightest and the best"". The focus on control means that fewer lower skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. But while the Conservatives can argue this will mean less pressure on public services, it is these services which often rely on migrant labour. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Reduce poverty through changes to tax and benefits. The Conservatives confirm they will continue the roll out of universal credit, despite the controversy that has dogged the new benefits system. As has already been announced they are ending the freeze on benefits, which will mean a 1.7% increase in the money people get next April. They also pledge to reduce the number of reassessments that people with disabilities face for their benefits, with a national strategy for disabled people promised by the end of 2020. There is a commitment to reduce poverty, including child poverty, through changes to tax and benefits. But there is little detail on how ongoing complaints about the failings of universal credit will be addressed. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Help parents by making childcare available in the holidays. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are offering multi-billion pound, universal childcare policies for pre-school children. But for the Tories this is a much more strategic offer - aiming to create 250,000 extra childcare places during the holidays for primary school-age children - about 5% of that age group. It would cost Â£250m per year for three years, with Â£250m for one-off costs such as buildings. This recalls the era of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, with its pre-austerity expansion of breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday clubs. Much of this will be delivered through schools, so it will depend on them being able to make their premises available over the summer holidays. Childcare is devolved so will only apply to England. Freeze of tuition fees at Â£9,250 likely to continue. For most degree students and their universities there is little in this manifesto. Simply a promise to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding, led by Philip Augar. In the short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their current level of Â£9,250 will continue. That could eventually have the same effect as the cut proposed by the Augar panel because of inflation. Interest rates on student loans are to be reviewed again. On lifelong learning, the offer is more modest than both the Lib Dems training wallet and Labour's promise of six years of free adult learning. Instead the manifesto says the Conservatives would work towards a right to retrain. Tuition fees and education are devolved, so any policy changes will apply to England only. And there's Â£2bn to fill potholes. It's telling that top of the Tories' transport list is a promise to build a new rail line linking Manchester and Leeds. It's a long-held and well-founded grievance in the north of England that transport infrastructure is substandard compared with the south. But the project isn't expected to be complete before 2040. The more immediate infrastructure conundrum is High Speed 2 which is already under way. Given how much that project polarises opinion it wasn't a surprise when a Conservative government said it would make a decision after the election. And by singling-out funding of Â£2bn for potholes and a further Â£29bn for roads, the Conservatives are more at ease than the other main parties in reaffirming their commitment to the car as a predominant mode of transport. In truth, on transport there are no huge policy surprises. It will look into the constitutional power balance. The Supreme Court's ruling in September - that Boris Johnson's advice to the Queen to prorogue (suspend) Parliament was unlawful - was the latest and most dramatic example of judicial review. There is now almost no area of government decision-making that cannot be subject to scrutiny by judges. Some feel it has pulled the judiciary too far into areas of political decision-making. The Conservatives' proposed ""constitution, democracy and rights"" commission is intended to look afresh at the constitutional power balance between the three great institutions of state, the executive (government and crown), Parliament and the judiciary.

The Brexit Party's 12 key policies,"The Brexit Party has set out the policies on which it plans to fight the 2019 general election According to its leader, Nigel Farage,the 22-page document,externalis not a manifesto but a ""contract with the people"". But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and, potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? The Brexit Party continues to talk about a ""clean-break Brexit"". The Brexit Party has changed its tune on, yes, Brexit. Until recently its leader, Nigel Farage, said a no-deal Brexit ""was the only acceptable deal"". This policy moves the goalposts.  Gone is the criticism of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement - now the party simply promises there will be ""no extended transition period"". At the moment the proposed transition period - during which the UK would follow EU rules and regulations without having any say in making them - finishes at the end of next year. Without saying so explicitly, the Brexit Party is warning that it will campaign to ensure Mr Johnson sticks to his promise not to extend the transition. That gives very little time to agree the terms of a future free trade deal. The Brexit Party continues to talk about a ""clean-break Brexit"". But whoever wins this election, the UK is likely to be negotiating with the EU about the nature of its future relationship for years to come. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Will this be a Brexit election? This video can not be played Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage makes election pitch The NHS must remain a publically-owned, comprehensive service that is free at the point of use. Comments by Nigel Farage about encouraging the use of private health insurance to help take the pressure off the NHS led to speculation about what this might mean for the service. The party states though that the NHS must remain a publicly-owned, comprehensive service, free at the point of use and with privatisation ruled out. There is no mention of a role for insurers or any long-term aspiration to encourage the better off to save for private healthcare. Interesting policies include 24-hour opening for GP surgeries and broadening training for nurses and midwives without the need for a degree. But there are no costings to underpin those specific measures. Health is devolved so this policy would only apply to England. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? The party wants a ""fair points system"" and a ""crackdown"" on illegal immigration. Nigel Faragehas written about cutting net migration,external- immigration minus emigration - to 50,000 per year. But it is not among the policies the Brexit Party has published. The document simply promises to ""reduce annual immigration"", which is not the same thing and won't necessarily lead to lower net migration. Nevertheless, the direction of travel is clear - even if the precise destination is not. A ""clean break"" from the EU, a ""fair points system"" and a ""crackdown"" on illegal immigration are the vehicles which the Brexit Party will use to achieve its goals. But details are lacking. And there's no acknowledgement that to do this while addressing the UK's skills gap and welcoming ""genuine"" refugees - which are also manifesto pledges - is a major challenge. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. A package of tax cuts includes a reduction in Corporation Tax. Detail is quite vague on tax and spend, and not many pledges are costed. There is little detail about the type of trade vision to be pursued after a ""clean-break Brexit"". There is no mention of income tax or VAT. No number put on the amount of money put into NHS and social care, nor investments in strategic industries than can ""create thousands of jobs"". The post-Brexit elimination of VAT on domestic fuel (currently charged at 5%) is estimated to benefit households by Â£65 each or Â£1.7bn a year. These numbers, previously used by Vote Leave, are about right. The Â£200bn the party says it will raise over the five-year Parliament appears to include the entire lifetime cost of HS2. Other notable tax cuts are for small business Corporation Tax, creating a Â£10,000 tax-free allowance. VAT policy and corporation tax are set UK-wide by Westminster. What are the challenges for the UK's economy? How much tax do British people pay? Recycle our own waste and make it illegal for it to be exported across the world to be burnt, buried or dumped at sea. This is not the first time this idea has surfaced. Every year nearly two million tonnes of British paper, cardboard and plastic are bought by recycling companies in countries like Malaysia, India and Turkey. International law already prohibits industrialised nations like the UK from exporting waste unfit to be processed. Banning the exports totally would force the British waste industry to build many new treatment plants, with repercussions for local authorities and maybe householders too. Export policy is managed at a UK level; inspections of waste shipments are handled by the devolved administrations. What is a climate emergency? There should also be free wi-fi on public transport The Brexit Party's pledge to provide ""base level domestic broadband"" in deprived regions does not specify exactly what sort of service will be offered. However, the telecoms regulator Ofcom considers speeds of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) to be""the speed which enables full participation in a digital society"".,external It has said about 16% of broadband lines across the UK could not reach those speeds. In rural areas, 32% of lines fell below this threshold. The Brexit Party's ""base level"" promise for ""deprived regions"" will reduce bills for homes which may be struggling to afford a fast broadband connection. But both the Conservatives and Labour have gone further. It has also pledged to offer free wi-fi on public transport. Some train and bus companies already provide this, and while the service can be patchy on moving vehicles, it will be welcomed by those with data-capped mobile phone tariffs. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? To phase out the BBC licence fee, which is currently Â£154.50 a year for most people. The question that immediately arises is, what do you replace it with? Advertising is one solution, but that would have a huge impact on other commercial broadcasters competing for ad spending. Direct government funding would still be a compulsory charge and could be seen to undermine the BBC's political independence. Another alternative is a Netflix-like subscription. But the challenge is how to introduce a paywall and stop people watching and listening to the BBC's many TV and radio channels. Turning the BBC into a subscription service would also fundamentally change what the BBC provides. Large parts of the BBC would disappear. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. The tax raises less than 1% of total tax revenue, the Brexit Party says. Inheritance tax is always a political battleground, and the Brexit Party is making a clear pledge to abolish it - aiming for the support of those who worry about its complexity and whether they have to pay. The tax is a 40% levy on the estate - the property, money and possessions - of someone who has died, above a threshold of Â£325,000. No tax is paid if the estate is valued at less than Â£325,000, or if more than that is left to a husband or wife, civil partner, charity, or a community amateur sports club. There is also some relief when passing on the family home. But few people do actually pay. It was charged following 28,100 deaths in 2016-17 (4.6% of those in the UK) although the number has been rising. Abolishing it would cut off the government's receipt of Â£5.4bn a year at the last count. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Inheritance tax: Rules on gifts to loved ones 'should be simplified' And invest Â£50bn in regional road and rail project The Brexit Party's flagship transport policy is scrapping the HS2 high-speed rail link. That's a goal it shares with the Green Party. Nigel Farage's party says the money saved will help raise Â£200bn for regional regeneration and supporting key sectors of the economy. It calls this a ""Brexit Dividend"". It also pledges to invest Â£50bn in regional road and rail projects in development-starved regions, but does not say how many years this investment will be spread over. It is a significant sum, but falls short of what other parties are offering. Local roads are devolved, but national roads such as motorways are dealt with by Westminster. Similarly, rail services that start and end in Scotland are the responsibility of the Scottish executive. HS2 route: How much will the rail scheme cost? The amount of debt recovered from graduates would be improved by scrapping interest on student loans. The interest rates on student tuition loans have long added to the sense of injustice graduates have about their debt. Few realise until their first statement arrives the April after graduation just how much they were charged while studying for their degree. For this year's students that means 5.4%, far above the cost of government borrowing. Getting rid of the additional interest above RPI would reduce the loan balance on graduation by Â£3,000, according to Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis two years ago. After graduation, the interest rate currently varies according to your income. Student finance is devolved so this would apply to England only. And make it easier to build on brownfield sites Political parties of all colours have come a cropper on housebuilding targets. They are almost never met. So the Brexit Party has avoided them. Instead of putting a number on how many new homes it wants built, it has some relatively broad pledges to ""accelerate the pace of development"". They include simplifying the planning system, particularly on previously developed ""brownfield"" sites, and giving more flexibility to builders. None of these ideas is particularly new, but they have been notoriously difficult to fulfil. It may be telling of the party's priorities that this issue is left to last on its ""contract with the people"". Housing is devolved so this policy would only apply to England, although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would also benefit from any extra funding. The plans would mean a move towards a US-style system. This would mean a move towards a US-style system where senior judges are subject to confirmation hearings, where their views are scrutinised by elected politicians. There has always been a great reluctance to introduce such a system in the UK. However, since the early 1980s, there has been a significant rise in something known as judicial review - this enables an individual or group to ask a court to determine whether a decision taken by a public body, including ministers, is lawful or not. Many regard judicial review as a critical democratic check on the abuse of government power and a way of ensuring that no-one, including ministers, is above the law. However, some feel that judges - unelected and unaccountable - are now too involved in political decision-making and more should be known about their political views.

Are these the 6 most controversial numbers so far?,"The Reality Check team navigates the most questionable figures that have cropped up in the election campaign. One of the biggest numbers to come out of the campaign so far was Â£1.2tn, which was the extra amount the Conservative Party said that Labour would spend over the next five years. The initial verdicton this was that the Conservatives could not possibly know this because the Labour manifesto had not yet been published. The dossier,externalwas released on 10 November, well beforethe Labour manifesto,externalwas published on 21 November. Now that we do have the manifesto, we can make a list of some of the items that were included in the Conservative costing that were not included, together with how much the Tories said they would cost over five years. Abolishing private schools - Â£35bn Free school meals for secondary school students - Â£6.8bn Excluding pensions from the 2% target for defence spending - Â£3bn That's nearly Â£45bn. Some of the Conservative costings also seemed somewhat inflated. For example, they used the figure of Â£196bn (from the Confederation of British Industry) as the cost of nationalisation,which is hotly contested. It assumed that a Labour government would pay a 30% premium above the market value of the assets it wanted to nationalise. On the other hand, it came before the announcement of the plan to nationalise part of BT. Even if you accept that costing, a rough overall calculation comes up well short. Labour has committed to a National Transformation Fund, which will invest Â£55bn a year over the next five years on things like housing and green projects. Its manifesto costings ""grey book"" says it will be spending another Â£83bn a year on day-to-day spending, by the fifth year of the parliament. Even if you assume that it spends that much every year (Â£415bn over five years), add Â£275bn for five years of investment, Â£196bn for nationalisation and Â£58bn tocompensate Waspi women, you still come up more than quarter of a trillion pounds short of the Conservative figure. The Conservatives used the Â£1.2tn figure to come up with an estimate that the extra spending would cost the average taxpayer an extra Â£2,400 a year, which is similarly dubious. That's partly because its starting point was the Â£1.2tn claim, and also because there were additions such as the claim that Labour is considering a homes tax, which would cost households up to Â£375 more than the current Council Tax system, raising an extra Â£10.2bn. However, this seems to be based on a policy-proposal document put forward by Guardian columnist George Monbiot in June, and commissioned for the Labour Party. It did not appear in the manifesto. Claims about the cost of Labour's spending have featured heavily in Conservative adverts on social media. The Â£1.2tn and/or Â£2,400 figures have appeared in more than 600 ads on Facebook, Instagram, Google and YouTube. An approximate collective reach of these adverts amounts to at least one million users. You can read more about both claims here. The Labour Party used the figure in a post on its official Facebook page Labour claimed that a Conservative trade deal with the US would mean the NHS having to spend an extra Â£500m a week on drugs. The party even mocked up a picture of a bus on its Facebook page, with Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg standing in front of it, saying: ""We'll send Trump Â£500m a week. Let's fund US drug firms, not our NHS."" The figure comes from an academic study which looked at how much more the US pays for drugs, per head, than the UK - about 2.5 times more, according to the OECD. But the report's authors described it as ""a crude estimate"" and ""a worst-case scenario"" - not an attempt to work out how much the NHS could actually spend on drugs, after a UK/US trade deal. At the moment, according to the Office for National Statistics, 9% of all medicines imported by the NHS come directly from the US, while 79% of medicine imports come from the European Union. That may be an underestimate of US imports, on the grounds that some US pharmaceutical companies may be selling drugs to the UK via their European subsidiaries. Nonetheless, while it is possible that a UK trade deal with the US could lead to the NHS paying higher prices for drugs from the US, it is highly unlikely that those higher prices would also be paid for drugs coming from the EU, and indeed for the ones made in the UK. After the figure was widely questioned, Labour figures generally stopped using it. Although the Â£500m claim has not been widely promoted in Labour's digital adverts, an ad featuring the figure, which ran on Facebook and Instagram early in the campaign, has been shown between 175,000 and 200,000 times. You can read more about the claim here. Leeds General Infirmary will be one of the first six funded projects The prime minister has repeatedly pledged to build 40 new hospitals over 10 years. The Conservative manifesto went as far as to say the party was proud ""to have begun work on building 40 new hospitals across the country"". But while the plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years, a further 34 hospitals will share only an initial Â£100m in funding to start developing future projects. A substantial amount of extra money would be needed to bring those plans to fruition. And there is some question about whether even the six initially funded ones are actually new hospitals, or refurbishments, or additions to existing ones. Either way, building work hasn't yet begun at these sites -as Reality Check reported. Also,Radio 4's More or Less foundthat 12 of the remaining 34 hospitals would be community hospitals in Dorset, which are relatively small hospitals - what used to be called cottage hospitals, and perhaps not what people would have been thinking about when Mr Johnson talked about 40 new hospitals. Labour said the Conservatives' failure to curb household bills had cost the average household almost Â£6,000 a year since 2010. These are all based on figures for rising bills for things like prescriptions, broadband and rail tickets, even though some of the items on the list have gone up less than the rate of inflation, which means their prices were rising less than the price of a typical ""basket"" of goods and services. Also, the household that has lost out by Â£6,000 is quite a specific one, having two adults who buy annual rail season tickets and a two-year-old child, which is not necessarily representative. And Labour said that the cost was Â£6,000 a year since 2010, but its calculations were for the increased costs in the final year. Clearly the price rises, even for this specific household, would have been considerably smaller in 2011, for example. You can read more about the claim here. Nigel Farage keeps saying he is targeting the five million people who voted Leave in 2016 and voted Labour in 2017. We don't have precise figures for this because both were secret ballots, but a number of respected organisations have conducted large surveys looking into this. Most estimates fall between three million and four million. Even the top of the margin of error of the highest estimate does not get to five million. The 5m figure was mentioned in a Brexit Party election broadcast that aired on the BBC, and Facebook ads promoting the same broadcast have been shown to users more than 500,000 times. Facebook ads targeting Labour seats - from Bootle to Bassetlaw - also included the figure. You can read more about the claim here. This chart was posted on the Bath and North East Somerset Liberal Democrats' Twitter feed. It makes it look as if it's a close race between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems. Read the small print, however, and it turns out this reflects a Survation poll of only 405 people asked the leading question: ""Imagine that the result in your constituency was expected to be very close between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidate and none of the other parties were competitive. In this scenario, which party would you vote for?"" And Labour still had 8% support. See more examples of misleading election material here.

Question Time under-30s special fact-checked,"This video can not be played Under-30s Question Time - The highlights Representatives from seven parties took part in a Question Time special with an audience of 18- to 30-year-olds. BBC Reality Check looked at some of their claims during the 90 minute-long debate in York. Reality Check:It's true that since 2010 about 450,000 affordable homes have been added to the housing supply in England. Not all of them are newly built - some have been converted from commercial properties or by splitting one dwelling up into two or more. That is slightly more on average a year than the previous Labour government - 50,107 a year compared with 42,854 between 1997 and 2010. But these figures cover all types of affordable housing including homes for social rent. And that means looking at the total number of affordable houses added each year doesn't tell the whole story. Since 2010, the balance has shifted away from homes for social rent and towards more expensive affordable rented homes, which make up the majority of those added under the Conservatives. The Affordable Rented Homes scheme stipulated that rents should be a maximum of 80% of the market rate. Homes for social rent are generally more like 50% of the market rate. Just under half as many homes for social rent were added over the past nine years as were added in the nine years prior to that. Reality Check:There is no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there were about four million children living in low-income households in 2017-18,according to government statistics,external. In this case, low-income means less than 60% of the median income (half of people earn more than the median and half earn less). Reality Check:These claims are largely true. The Department of Climate Change was abolished - but the Conservatives would argue that climate is now covered by the department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) which introduced the target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The Green Investment Bank was sold off in 2017 - attracting controversy at the time. New onshore wind installations fell by nearly 80% in 2018,according to figures from RenewableUK,external. This followed a decision by the Conservatives to end subsidies for new onshore wind projects in 2016. The government has chosen to back offshore wind instead. Reality Check:Official figures,externalshow that 86,157 affordable houses have been completed in Scotland since 2007. The Scottish government has set a target to build 50,000 affordable homes between 2016 and 2021. After three years of that programme, it is halfway to that target but the Chartered Institute of Housing said in October that the rate of completions would need to increase further to meet it. Reality Check:Yes, but this is a complex issue. Dung from grazing animals can increase the amount of carbon captured in soils depleted by over-intensive farming. But that soil becomes saturated with carbon, so if more dung is deposited beyond that point, it continues to cause environmental problems. What's more, carbon is not the only pollutant. Sheep and cows also produce lots of methane - another powerful greenhouse gas. Because of the complexity of the equation between tackling methane and tackling carbon, it's not established firmly yet whether it would be good to stop sheep pastures and replace them with woods. The independent UK Committee Committee on Climate Change saysthe number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a halfto help combat climate change because beef and lamb produce most greenhouse gases from farms. Reality Check:It's true that they were first introduced under Labour in 1998 and tripled from Â£1,000 to Â£3,000 from 2006. They were tripled again to Â£9,000 in England under the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government from 2012. Reality Check:According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, the average weekly hours for full-time workers have remained broadly the same over the past 30 years. In 1992, the average person worked 38.1 hours compared to 37.3 hours in the latest figures in 2019. On mental health, an NHS survey shows that between 1993 and 2014 (the last year it was done), the number of 16- to 64-year-olds experiencing common mental health problems in the previous week had increased from 15.5% to 18.9%.

UK growth slowest in nearly seven years,"The economy suffered its worst three months for more than a decade after official figures revealed output failed to grow once again in October. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed the economy flatlined month-on-month in October, after two months of declines. It was the weakest three months since early 2009. The figures come ahead of Thursday's general election, with the main parties all promising to boost growth. Although the service sector expanded 0.2% in the August-to-October period, that was offset by a 0.7% contraction in manufacturing and 0.3% fall in construction. The ONS said there had been ""a notable drop in housebuilding and infrastructure in October"". UK wage growth slows as unemployment falls Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy PwC, blamed Brexit-related uncertainty for the economy's ""loss of momentum"". He said: ""Growth seems likely to remain subdued through the rest of 2019, but we would hope for a gradual revival in activity over the course of 2020 if current political and economic uncertainties ease. Our main scenario is for 1% GDP growth in 2020 assuming an orderly Brexit."" Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool's management school, described the figures as ""quite poor"". ""The main point is that our economy continues to disappoint badly, which will probably bring a Bank of England interest rate cut much closer especially if Thursday's election turns out very inconclusive,"" he said. Jack Leslie, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that the UK's domestic challenges come against a weak global economic outlook for next year. ""While the main parties have avoided any discussion of this challenging economic environment during the election campaign, navigating it will be a central task for the next government nonetheless,"" he said. However, the pound shrugged off the figures, continuing to rise on Tuesday after gains on Monday. In early London trading, sterling was up 0.2% at $1.3157, and against the euro rose 0.1% to 84.18p ""Sterling price action is all about the upcoming parliamentary election and real economic data should continue to play second fiddle,"" ING analysts said in a note sent to clients.

Golden Globes criticised for all-male director nominees,"The Golden Globes has released its list of nominees for best director, and it's been criticised for featuring no women, again. Since 2000, the awards show has nominated more than 100 men for the category, and only four women. These figures aren't rare, with the Oscars nominating only three women for best director in the past 20 years, compared with 87 men. This isn't the first time the Golden Globes have faced backlash over their nominations list. Last year, when presenting the award, Natalie Portman made a point to say ""here are the all-male nominees"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Afterincreased pressure on the industry over female representation last year, you could be forgiven for thinking the organisation might have made steps to change the landscape this year. Instead, the hopefuls for best director are Quentin Tarantino, Bong Joon Ho, Sam Mendes, Todd Phillips and Martin Scorsese. Rebecca Goldman, from the Time's Up Foundation, said: ""The omission of women isn't just a Golden Globes problem - it is an industry-wide crisis and it's unacceptable. ""Time's Up will continue to fight until talented female directors get the opportunities and recognition they deserve."" Actress Charlize Theron says the lack of female nominees in the best director category is ""really, really ridiculous"". Shetold the LA Times,external:  ""No woman wants to get nominated because it's the right thing to do. ""It's not cool... we've got to keep making noise until we're heard and these stories get recognised.""

It's thought, by some, that women are put off pursuing a career in directing because they don't see their role models getting accolades they feel they deserve. ""[Directing] has not been a role where women have seen many other women role models,"" the Chair of Time's Up UK, Heather Rabbatts told the BBC in 2018. ""The more that we see women directors coming through, the greater encouragement that will give to other women to believe that they too can do these roles."" Some expected Greta Gerwig to be nominated for directing Little Women.

Sydney 'choking' on thick smoke from bushfires,"Many people are wearing face masks on the streets A shroud of smoke from Australia's bushfires has caused chaos in Sydney, bringing dangerous air quality, setting off smoke alarms and ruining visibility in its typically sparkling harbour. The haze on Tuesday was described by many people as the thickest to blanket the city amid this year's fire crisis. It caused the cancellation of ferry and boat rides, while smoke permeating buildings forced evacuations citywide. Locals described the situation as ""apocalyptic"" and ""insane"". Sydney has been covered by thick smoke from bushfires outside of the city The Sydney Harbour Bridge is almost entirely obscured by the smoke The smoke from inland fires has reached all the way to the coast and Bondi Beach Online, Sydney residents reported breathing problems and said they were ""choking"" on the smoke.

Health officials advised people to stay indoors, while many who ventured outside donned face masks. Hospital admissions have risen by at least 25% in the past weeks due to an influx of people with respiratory and breathing problems, officials said. The smoke worsened throughout Tuesday as fires intensified Not everyone has listened to warnings to avoid exercise outdoors Trips on the city's harbour ferries were suspended due to the poor visibility Daycare centres and schools were also keeping children inside during lunch and recess.

Thomas Cook customers get apology for refund delay,"The body repaying money owed to Thomas Cook customers after the tour firm collapsed has apologised to thousands of customers facing refund delays. Paul Smith, director at the Civil Aviation Authority, said ""we are very sorry"" and promised the CAA is ""working tirelessly"" to process payments. Despite Â£160m having already been refunded, he told the BBC well over 50,000 customers were still owed money. Incomplete claim forms and attempted fraud were adding to delays, he said. Thomas Cook collapsed on 23 September, after failing to obtain rescue funds from its banks. Some 150,000 travellers had to be repatriated back to the UK during a two-week operation run by the CAA. A refund process was opened on 7 October for customers covered by Atol-protected insurance. 'Thomas Cook crash almost ruined my engagement' Thomas Cook customers face refund delays Although the CAA said it expected to pay the tens of thousands of people who registered on the first day within 60 days, only about two-thirds were refunded by the weekend deadline. Mr Smith, the CAA's consumers and markets director, said: ""This is the biggest refund operation in UK travel. We have paid out already about Â£160m, and expect over the next couple of days to get that up above Â£180m. ""We have had to put some extra checks in because we were concerned about fraud. And we had some challenges with the data we received from the company. We are sorry for those people we have not yet been able to pay."" Some claimants had provided incomplete forms, and he urged them to update the details as soon as possible. ""We really want to make these payments as quickly as we can because it is money people are entitled to,"" he said. Some 300,000 Thomas Cook claims have been received so far, 215,000 of which have been confirmed as valid. However, this figure includes about 90,000 direct debit customers in October whose money was automatically returned.

"Young voters quiz politicians on housing and BrexitThe BBC Question Time debate also saw fiery exchanges on climate change, electoral reform and trust.Election 2019","This video can not be played Nigel Farage and Angela Rayner argue on Question Time Senior politicians faced questions on housing, climate change and trust from an audience of young people in a Question Time election special. The election debate also saw exchanges over Brexit and the possibility of another referendum. Labour's Angela Rayner clashed with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage over what she said was a racist referendum poster, in one of the fieriest clashes. The UK goes to the polls in a general election on Thursday. As it happened: Youth debate special Will the election 'youthquake' be more of a tremor? Sir John Curtice: Why age not class matters most Sitting on the panel were: Conservative Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson SNP Justice Secretary in the Scottish government Humza Yousaf Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage Analysis by political correspondent Sean Curran This special edition of Question Time certainly didn't lack passion or drama. At times it was lively and bad tempered, with the politicians talking over one another as they tried to win over younger voters. We heard the now familiar arguments about Brexit which have been at the heart of this election campaign, but the politicians were also challenged over other issues such as changing the voting system which haven't made the headlines. This wasn't a debate that saw seven party leaders go head-to-head, although four did take part, and as such was unlikely to deliver a knockout blow or even produce a clear winner. And it probably won't have converted anyone who was already determined to vote for a particular party. The young voters in the audience will deliver their verdict, along with the rest of the country on Thursday. But the gap between the current generation of political leaders and the under 30s was most vividly illustrated by the question about home ownership and underlined the challenge facing whoever is in power on Friday morning. This video can not be played General election 2019: Politicians on when they bought their first house On the subject of housing, the panel were asked what age they were when they bought their own home. Mr Farage was the youngest, buying a property at 22, and Mr Price was the oldest at 30. Mr Farage linked housing problems to population growth which prompted Mr Yousaf to accuse the Brexit Party leader of blaming ""everything on immigrants"". He argued that ""One of the best things that we [the Scottish government] didwas abolish the right to buy when it came to council houses."" Mr Jenrick said it was his ""personal mission to help more young people on to the housing ladder"" adding that his party would ""offer discounts and help with deposits"". While Ms Rayner said she would ""make no apologies"" for Labour wanting to build 100,000 council homes or introduce rent controls. How will millennials be helped to beat the housing crisis? Audience member Aiden Booth asked the panel how governments could say they are serious about climate change without dealing with one of the biggest contributors, meat consumption. Mr Jenrick said the Conservatives would not ""ban people from eating meat"", but would instead encourage people to live environmentally by investing in public transport and energy efficient measure. But Ms Swinson attacked the government's record saying it had abolished the climate change department and blocked subsidies for wind farms. She said tackling climate change ""cannot wait"" drawing attention to the case of Ella Kissi-Debrahwho died aged nine in 2013 after having seizures for three years. Mr Bartley said: ""We can solve the climate emergency and reverse austerity if we're willing to make the right choices."" He added: ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now."" On Brexit, Ms Rayner said in another referendum she would vote to leave the EU if ""we get a deal that protects jobs and the economy"". Labour has said that, if elected, it would renegotiate a new Brexit deal which would then be put back to the country in a referendum along with an option to remain in the EU. Mr Price, whose party wants another referendum, argued that ""the people are entitled to change their mind"". He said ""the opinion polls show a shift"" in opinion but added that ""only the people can end the impasse"". Asked if he took responsibility for the instability in politics in the years since the referendum, Mr Jenrick said he wished ""we had managed to get Brexit done a long time ago"", claiming that Parliament had blocked the process. This video can not be played Under-30s Question Time: The Highlights Mr Yousaf said Scotland was the only nation ""to get shafted"" in the wake of Brexit. He argued that England and Wales voted to Leave, while Northern Ireland who voted to Remain would get a ""differentiated deal"". Mr Farage accused the other five parties of having ""broken their promise"" to respect the result of the referendum. The debate became particularly heated over a poster on immigrationMr Farage unveiled during the 2016 Brexit referendum. Ms Rayner told the Brexit Party leader to ""stop peddling hate in our country"". Mr Farage hit back accusing the Labour politician of ""bile and prejudice"". The panellists were also asked about how they would improve trust in politics. Mr Price said he would introduce a bill to ""make lying by politicians a criminal offence"" while Mr Farage promised to tackle postal vote fraud and abolish the House of Lords. ""I won't lie and I'll call out the people who do,"" replied Ms Rayner. Mr Jenrick vowed to ""deliver the outcome of the referendum"" while Ms Swinson said she would ""stick to my principles"" on Brexit ""whether it is popular or not"". Mr Yousaf said his party would ""fulfil the promise of the manifesto we stood on"". And Mr Bartley proposed lifting ""the ceiling on the fines"" that can be implemented by the Electoral Commission. Young people make up a big share of non-voters in the UK - the British Election Study estimates that between 40-50% of those aged 18 to their mid-20s voted in 2015 and 2017 compared with about 80% of voters aged in their 70s. Polling expert Sir John Curtice says age is ""the division that nowadays lies at the heart of British party politics and will play a significant role on 12 December"".

"Parties focus on key messages as poll day nearsThe Tories attack Labour's spending plans and warn of a hung Parliament, while Labour focuses on the NHS.Election 2019","Labour and the Tories are focusing on key messages around the NHS and Brexit in the final days of the campaign. While Labour talks about under-funding risks to patients, the Conservatives are promising an end to ""gridlock"". But it is not all plain sailing, asa recording has been leaked of shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthcriticising Labour's election chances. AndBoris Johnson is still facing criticismover his reaction to an image of a sick boy on a hospital floor. Party leaders are campaigning in key constituencies, with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson telling campaigners in Bath that her message to stop Brexit was part of a ""fight for the soul of our country"". She added: ""This is about whether we are open or closed, generous or selfish, whether we reach out and work with others or pull up the drawbridge."" And the SNP is proposing legislation to protect the NHS in Scotland from ""exploitative"" trade deals, with Nicola Sturgeon warning Mr Johnson poses the greatest threat to Scotland of ""any prime minister in modern times"". In other election developments: Ms Sturgeon and other Scottish leaderswill take part in a debate on BBC Scotland later Nigel Farage has criticised Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, claiming it would lead to ""years of agonising negotiations"" TheGreens are focusing on a pledgeto cancel student debt built up since 2012. Labour is pledging a ""relentless focus"" on the health service if it wins power after Thursday's poll, promising changes in the first 100 days. The party says reports produced by NHS trusts in England this month show a health service ""in crisis and on the brink"". An analysis it has conducted of more than 120 NHS trust board papers identified hundreds of risks to patient safety classed as ""catastrophic"" or ""extreme"". The majority were linked to spending, staff shortages or failures of privatisation, the party said. It promised that a Labour government would conduct an immediate audit of the risks revealed. The BBC's Reality Check team said the quotes from the NHS boards were genuine but did not give the nationwide picture, which was more mixed. Johnson's bad day shows election not over Tories target Labour Leave seats in final push Labour Budget to 'end austerity' in first 100 days Speaking in Carlisle, Mr Corbyn said there were four million people waiting for operations on the NHS, along with ""a mental health care crisis and social care crisis"". He added: ""I do not blame the nurses, I do not blame the doctors, I do not blame the health service. ""I blame the government that has underfunded our NHS."" However, the leaked recording of Mr Ashworth -  which shows him telling a Tory activist friend the situation for Labour was ""dire"" and the party had made a mistake by not getting rid of Mr Corbyn as leader - has distracted from the campaign. Mr Ashworth has insisted his apparent criticism of the Labour leader was ""banter"", telling the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire he was ""joshing"" when he told his friend that he thought there was no way Labour could win the election. He also apologised to Labour members on BBC Politics Live. Mr Corbyn said it was ""not the sort of thing I would do"", but claimed the story was ""irrelevant"" and Mr Ashworth was ""making jokes"". He said the reports on the comments were ""just trying to deflect away from the Tories' mess of the National Health Service"". The prime minister is trying to keep the focus on Brexit and the ""danger"" of another inconclusive result in Thursday's election. Speaking at the JCB factory in Staffordshire, Mr Johnson said that without a working majority for the Conservatives it was ""very hard to see"" how the UK could leave the EU, and he was ""fighting for every vote"" to stop a hung Parliament. He said backing him will allow the country to go forward, ""punching through the current deadlock and achieving a brighter future together"". This video can not be played WATCH: Boris Johnson warns of coalition ""disaster"" But there is distraction for the PM too, as he continued to face criticism over his response to a photograph of a four-year-old boy sleeping on the floor of a Leeds hospital due to a lack of beds. On Monday, an ITV reporter tried to show Mr Johnson the picture on his phone, but the prime minister initially refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. He later looked, returned the phone and apologised to the family. This video can not be played Moment Boris Johnson put ITV reporter's phone in his pocket Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that the ""family want their privacy to be maintained"" and for their son Jack ""not to be used as a political football"". He said the prime minister expressed ""sorrow and regret"" for what he saw and apologised to the family, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock also went to Leeds to apologise. There were a number of angry protesters outside the hospital who shouted at Mr Hancock and his team when they left. Two sources told journalists that one of Mr Hancock's advisers had been punched by one of the activists, but footage later showed that had not happened and instead that the aide had walked into a protester's outstretched arm. Challenged on the footage, Mr Buckland said he did not know ""who briefed what to whom"", adding ""what I saw was a very confusing scene of public disorder"". Mr Corbyn has denied politicising Jack's case, but said the incident ""says an awful lot about the NHS"" and the ""shortage of staff"".

Ted Baker bosses quit amid profit warning,"Ted Baker boss Lindsay Page, who was only appointed in April, has resigned in the latest blow for the troubled fashion retailer. The brand's chairman David Bernstein has also quit, and it has issued another profit warning. Ted Baker shares fell by as much as 36% on the news before paring some losses. The firm, which is struggling with falling sales, said the past year had been the ""most challenging in our history"". It has also been dealing with the fallout of amisconduct scandal involving previous boss Ray Kelvin. Mr Kelvin denies the allegations which centre on claims of ""forced hugging"". Issuing its profit warning, Ted Baker said it had seen worse-than-expected trading in November, including on Black Friday. Ted Baker probes Â£25m stock inventory blunder Ted Baker to 'learn lessons' of hugs probe As such, it said its full-year profit - previously forecast by analysts at Â£28.4m - was now likely to be just Â£5m to Â£10m, depending on how well it trades over Christmas. The firm said it had hired consultants Alix Partners to carry out an urgent review of the group's business. It also announced it had suspended its shareholder dividend payout. Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said price discounting across the retail sector was hurting Ted Baker. ""It has left profits unravelling, and the higher price tags on Ted's clothes means it's more vulnerable to price-slashing than some rivals."" She also warned that weak consumer spending in its key UK and Europe markets showed no signs of strengthening. ""Ted isn't down and out at this point, but further blows can't be discounted,"" she said. Shares in Ted Baker have fallen by more than 75% since January, in a year which has seen it give four profit warnings. Last week its bosses also revealed that the group'sinventory had been overstatedby between Â£20m and Â£25m, sparking another tumble in the share price. Chief financial officer Rachel Osborne will become acting chief executive with immediate effect, with Mr Page helping with the transition. Non-executive director Sharon Baylay will take on the role of acting chair following the departure of Mr Bernstein.

Ukraine and Russia agree to implement ceasefire,"(L-R) Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, France's Emmanuel Macron, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Germany's Angela Merkel at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace in Paris Ukraine and Russia have agreed to implement a ""full and comprehensive"" ceasefire in eastern Ukraine by the end of 2019, after top-level talks. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky met face to face at a Paris summit on Monday. Mr Zelensky was downbeat, saying little had been achieved at the meeting and he had wanted to see more resolved. Five-and-a-half years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels have cost 13,000 lives. The negotiations were brokered by the leaders of France and Germany. They follow a big prisoner swap and the withdrawal of Ukraine's military from three key areas on the front line. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a written statement, the countries agreed to the release and exchange of all ""conflict-related detainees"" by the end of the year. The two sides also pledged to disengage military forces in three additional regions of Ukraine by the end of March 2020, without specifying which regions would be affected. Additional talks will be held in four months to take stock of the ceasefire's progress. Vladimir Putin arrives for talks in Paris aimed at tackling the conflict in eastern Ukraine At a press conference after the talks in France's ElysÃ©e Palace, President Putin hailed them as an ""important step"" towards a de-escalation of the conflict. President Zelensky said the issue of Russian gas exports via pipelines through Ukraine had been ""unblocked"" after a dispute about transit tariffs, and an agreement would now be worked out. But Russia and Ukraine continue to disagree on issues such as the withdrawal of Russian-backed troops, and elections in areas of Ukraine held by the separatist rebels. Mr Putin also called for a change in Ukraine's constitution to give special status to the Donbas region, which is held by the rebels. He also pushed for an amnesty for people who had taken part in the seizure of Ukrainian territory. Will a deal with Russia bring peace to Ukraine? What's the background to the crisis? Mr Zelensky told reporters that Ukraine would not make any territorial concessions in exchange for peace. ""We saw differences today,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron, who hosted the talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""We didn't find the miracle solution, but we have advanced on it,"" he added. Mr Zelensky, a former comic actor, was elected president of Ukraine in a landslide victory in April following a campaign built around bringing peace to eastern Ukraine. Since then, his strategy has focused on trying to restart talks with Moscow. For that to happen Mr Zelensky has had to agree to some Russian conditions, including pulling back Ukrainian troops in the eastern towns of Stanytsia Luhansk, Petrivske, and Zolote. In June, Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists withdrew a kilometre from Stanytsia Luhanska. By late October, the Ukrainians and separatists had disengaged from Zolote and early in November they pulled back from Petrivske. Nato and Western intelligence experts have repeatedly accused Russia of sending heavy weapons and combat troops into eastern Ukraine to help the rebels. Russia denies that, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. In September, Mr Zelensky won praise for a long-awaited prisoner swap with Russia - he described it as a ""victory"" that had emerged from personal phone contact with the Russian president. This video can not be played Freed Ukrainians meet families in September after months of separation To pave the way for the summit, President Zelensky accepteda 2016 deal granting special status to the separatist-held parts of Ukraine's Donbas region. The ""Steinmeier formula"" aims to break the impasse over peace agreements reached at the height of the fighting. It details free and fair elections in the east under Ukrainian law, verification by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and then self-governing status in return. Pro-Russian separatists seized control of large swathes of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April 2014, just after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. It was an insurgency against the new pro-Western authorities in the capital Kyiv, who had ousted the pro-Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych, in street protests dubbed the ""Maidan Revolution"". The separatists later declared independence from Ukraine - but no country has recognised their ""republics"".

British power plant promises to go carbon negative,"Drax, which generates 5% of the UK's power, has said it plans to capture more carbon than it produces by 2030. The firm's power plant in North Yorkshire is already largely powered by renewable fuel such as wood pellets. But now it hopes to scale up a system that will allow it to capture millions of tons of carbon emissions from the plant. However, the scheme will require its government subsidies - currently due to expire in 2027 - to be extended. Drax, which is the UK's largest power station, used to run exclusively on coal, but it has converted four of its six units to burn wood as the country seeks to end its dependence on finite fossil fuels. The firm said it plans to cut emissions in two ways. First, the sustainably farmed trees that provide its wood pellets absorb carbon emissions as they grow. What would carbon neutrality mean for the UK? UK 'has the technology' for zero carbon emissions The second takes place at the power plant site as carbon-capture technology traps the emissions created by burning the wood. At present, a pilot project at the site captures a tonne of carbon each day. But Drax said it hopes to install the system at two of its units by the end of the next decade, removing eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year. The power station's control room It also plans to close the two remaining coal-generating units at its North Yorkshire plant by 2025, although the company did not say how that would affect power output. Biomass power generation has proved controversial with some environmental campaigners. AChatham House report from 2017suggests burning wood is not carbon-neutral, as young trees planted as replacements absorb and store less carbon than the ones that have been burned. Others say it can lead to deforestation. But Drax defends the sustainability record of its biomass supply chain. However, the firm has yet to secure the subsidies it needs to help grow its carbon capture project to a scale that could make a difference to the UK's climate ambitions. The firm currently receives around Â£2m a day from the state to support its green transition, but this support will run out in less than 10 years. Prof Nilay Shah, head of the chemical engineering department at Imperial College London, told the BBC the country would need to produce up to 150 million tonnes of ""negative emissions"" to meet its net zero target. Drax boss Will Gardiner said: ""The UK Government is working on a policy and investment framework to encourage negative emissions technologies, which will enable the UK to be home to the world's first carbon negative company. ""This is not just critical to beating the climate crisis, but also to enabling a just transition, protecting jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth - delivering for the economy as well as for the environment.""

Young voters quiz politicians on housing and Brexit,"This video can not be played Nigel Farage and Angela Rayner argue on Question Time Senior politicians faced questions on housing, climate change and trust from an audience of young people in a Question Time election special. The election debate also saw exchanges over Brexit and the possibility of another referendum. Labour's Angela Rayner clashed with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage over what she said was a racist referendum poster, in one of the fieriest clashes. The UK goes to the polls in a general election on Thursday. As it happened: Youth debate special Will the election 'youthquake' be more of a tremor? Sir John Curtice: Why age not class matters most Sitting on the panel were: Conservative Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson SNP Justice Secretary in the Scottish government Humza Yousaf Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage Analysis by political correspondent Sean Curran This special edition of Question Time certainly didn't lack passion or drama. At times it was lively and bad tempered, with the politicians talking over one another as they tried to win over younger voters. We heard the now familiar arguments about Brexit which have been at the heart of this election campaign, but the politicians were also challenged over other issues such as changing the voting system which haven't made the headlines. This wasn't a debate that saw seven party leaders go head-to-head, although four did take part, and as such was unlikely to deliver a knockout blow or even produce a clear winner. And it probably won't have converted anyone who was already determined to vote for a particular party. The young voters in the audience will deliver their verdict, along with the rest of the country on Thursday. But the gap between the current generation of political leaders and the under 30s was most vividly illustrated by the question about home ownership and underlined the challenge facing whoever is in power on Friday morning.

Mr Farage was the youngest, buying a property at 22, and Mr Price was the oldest at 30. Mr Farage linked housing problems to population growth which prompted Mr Yousaf to accuse the Brexit Party leader of blaming ""everything on immigrants"". He argued that ""One of the best things that we [the Scottish government] didwas abolish the right to buy when it came to council houses."" Mr Jenrick said it was his ""personal mission to help more young people on to the housing ladder"" adding that his party would ""offer discounts and help with deposits"". While Ms Rayner said she would ""make no apologies"" for Labour wanting to build 100,000 council homes or introduce rent controls. How will millennials be helped to beat the housing crisis? Audience member Aiden Booth asked the panel how governments could say they are serious about climate change without dealing with one of the biggest contributors, meat consumption. Mr Jenrick said the Conservatives would not ""ban people from eating meat"", but would instead encourage people to live environmentally by investing in public transport and energy efficient measure. But Ms Swinson attacked the government's record saying it had abolished the climate change department and blocked subsidies for wind farms. She said tackling climate change ""cannot wait"" drawing attention to the case of Ella Kissi-Debrahwho died aged nine in 2013 after having seizures for three years. Mr Bartley said: ""We can solve the climate emergency and reverse austerity if we're willing to make the right choices."" He added: ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now."" On Brexit, Ms Rayner said in another referendum she would vote to leave the EU if ""we get a deal that protects jobs and the economy"". Labour has said that, if elected, it would renegotiate a new Brexit deal which would then be put back to the country in a referendum along with an option to remain in the EU. Mr Price, whose party wants another referendum, argued that ""the people are entitled to change their mind"". He said ""the opinion polls show a shift"" in opinion but added that ""only the people can end the impasse"". Asked if he took responsibility for the instability in politics in the years since the referendum, Mr Jenrick said he wished ""we had managed to get Brexit done a long time ago"", claiming that Parliament had blocked the process.

The debate became particularly heated over a poster on immigrationMr Farage unveiled during the 2016 Brexit referendum. Ms Rayner told the Brexit Party leader to ""stop peddling hate in our country"". Mr Farage hit back accusing the Labour politician of ""bile and prejudice"". The panellists were also asked about how they would improve trust in politics.

"Young voters quiz politicians on housing and BrexitThe BBC Question Time debate also saw fiery exchanges on climate change, electoral reform and trust.","This video can not be played Nigel Farage and Angela Rayner argue on Question Time Senior politicians faced questions on housing, climate change and trust from an audience of young people in a Question Time election special. The election debate also saw exchanges over Brexit and the possibility of another referendum. Labour's Angela Rayner clashed with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage over what she said was a racist referendum poster, in one of the fieriest clashes. The UK goes to the polls in a general election on Thursday. As it happened: Youth debate special Will the election 'youthquake' be more of a tremor? Sir John Curtice: Why age not class matters most Sitting on the panel were: Conservative Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson SNP Justice Secretary in the Scottish government Humza Yousaf Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage Analysis by political correspondent Sean Curran This special edition of Question Time certainly didn't lack passion or drama. At times it was lively and bad tempered, with the politicians talking over one another as they tried to win over younger voters. We heard the now familiar arguments about Brexit which have been at the heart of this election campaign, but the politicians were also challenged over other issues such as changing the voting system which haven't made the headlines. This wasn't a debate that saw seven party leaders go head-to-head, although four did take part, and as such was unlikely to deliver a knockout blow or even produce a clear winner. And it probably won't have converted anyone who was already determined to vote for a particular party. The young voters in the audience will deliver their verdict, along with the rest of the country on Thursday. But the gap between the current generation of political leaders and the under 30s was most vividly illustrated by the question about home ownership and underlined the challenge facing whoever is in power on Friday morning.

Catch up with ElectioncastNeed a recap on yesterday? Catch up with ElectioncastLive Latest on campaigning as election day nears  5 minutes ago,"It's the penultimate day of campaigning, ahead of Thursday's general election The BBC has hosted leaders' debates in Scotland and Northern Ireland Boris Johnson faced criticism for his reaction to a photo of a sick child lying on a hospital floor A Conservative minister said the PM did ""apologise and empathise"", but Labour says the picture shows the impact of Tory ""under-funding"" Labour's Jon Ashworth was recorded saying his party would not win the election The shadow health secretary later insisted he was joking, and Mr Corbyn said he supported his colleague Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay and Alice Evans What happened today? That's the end of today's live coverage of the general election campaign. Tuesday's headlines included:  Join us tomorrow for the final day of campaigning before the UK heads to the polls on Thursday. The full BBC paper review will be published later this evening. The five main Stormont parties discussed Brexit, healthcare and the collapse of the assembly in the BBC election debate. It took place in the BBC's studios in Belfast on earlier this evening. The general election takes place on Thursday with 18 Westminster seats in Northern Ireland at stake. Four of the Stormont leaders attended the debate, while the Democratic Unionist Party was represented by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. On Brexit, there was little meeting of minds between the parties. Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill came under fire for her party's policy of abstentionism. To read the full story of the debate, click here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics As a
reminder, the 2017 version of this model correctly predicted there would be a hung Parliament 10 days before polling day, and it called 93% of seats correctly. But thereâs
     not enough of a track record for us to know whether that was a one-off
     success or not. There is also a wide margin of error of around 30 seats for Conservative seat shares and 25
     for Labour. Also, in 2017, YouGov's correct-call-rate was lower (80%) for marginal seats - so we must be  extra wary of predictions
     about individual seats - especially, alas, the interesting close ones. Things
     can change between now (or the fieldwork dates) and polling day. There was a big dealmade of the last YouGov poll,released towards the end of the last month. The model, based on the views of 100,000 voters, applies national trends to individual constituencies. But it comes with a big margin of error and does not reflect local issues that can have an impact on polling day. YouGov said the margin of error could put the final number of Tory seats anywhere between 311 and 367, suggesting a hung Parliament cannot be ruled out. If an election was held tomorrow, the poll predicts: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The last question on the BBC Northern Ireland election debate is on climate change. How will your party tackle the climate crisis, and what do you do personally? Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken since his party wants to get to net-zero carbon by 2035 in Northern Ireland. (For context - the UK government is currently working towards a target of 2050 for the same thing.) But first of all, ""we must accept the fact there is a climate emergency,"" he says. Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood says his party would like to hit the net-zero carbon target by 2030. ""I have two daughters... we are leaving them some inheritance if we don't tackle this,"" he says. Alliance leader Naomi Long says ""no one needs to convince most of us here that the climate emergency is real"". ""We have set a target of zero emissions by 2030"", she says, and wants to see more investment in renewables. Challenged over whether the DUP believe in climate change, the party's chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says: ""Yes we do believe that we need to change radically to prevent this climate change and its impact on the planet."" And Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says the party wants to see an independent climate change agency as well as a green new deal to create green jobs. ""Personally by myself, I'm becoming so much more aware,"" she says, citing Greta Thunberg as raising awareness of the issue. You can read the full story of the debate here. A major YouGov poll has predicted the Tories will win a parliamentary majority of 28 seats at the general election. The second YouGov MRP poll - the final one before the election - suggests the Conservatives will win 339 seats in 2019, a rise of 22 from 2017, while Labour will lose 31 and end up with a total of 231. It is a smaller Tory majority than predicted in a previous YouGov poll in November that said the Tories would have a 68-seat majority. The research suggests that if the election was held tomorrow, the Lib Dems would win 15 seats, while the SNP would gain six. An MRP poll - which stands for the punchy multi-level regression and post-stratification - uses data from a poll to discover relationships between peopleâs characteristics and their answers to the voting intention question, YouGov says. It then constructs estimates of how vote intention would look in each constituency. Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker here. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Jonathan Ashworth was forced to explain secretly taped comments As the Tories discovered to their cost yesterday, the election is not over. Boris Johnson'sweirdly robotic response to a young child's experiencein an NHS hospital saw to that. Conservatives were certainly cross with their boss's unforced political error. But one cabinet minister told me they didn't think it ""would really tip things""; it was simply too late in the day. There is no question it gave Labour an opportunity to hammer home their message all day yesterday, and may well have planted more seeds of doubt in voters' minds about which way to go. A group of women in Staffordshire today, some of whom hadn't yet made their up their minds, all said worries about the health service were the number one factor for them, mentioning the picture that caused such a stir yesterday. But another last minute story bust its way into these closing moments of the campaign, grabbing headlines today, and putting Labour on the back foot this time. Read more from Laura here. Sinn Fein's vice-president Michelle O'Neill The next question comes from a bank worker from Belfast, who asks whether, considering Sinn Fein and the DUP can't work together, is it time we have direct rule to tackle the health crisis? The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson goes first. ""We need our assembly back and we need it back today,"" he says, adding that health will be the priority. He says once talks are back up and running next week, if there's no agreement in Stormont by 13 January ""then I think we have to look at handing this back to Westminster"". He reminds the audience of the Â£1.5bn the DUP MPs negotiated in 2017, in exchange for their support for the Tory government. Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says ""direct rule is not an option"". ""We can never go backwards, we can only go forwards,"" she says. ""I believe we need to give people the hope and the vision which was there back in 1998 when we signed the Good Friday Agreement."" She says people in the community ""want the assembly up and running... but it also needs to be sustainable and credible"". On the health service, she says: ""I think we need to have a very substantial financial injection from the British government...The health service is in crisis because of Tory austerity. ""The health service is on its knees."" Read more here about the deadlock over Northern Ireland's power sharing government. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood - who is backing another referendum - tells the Northern Ireland election debate that the DUP ""had all the power"" in 2017. ""They had 10 MPs, they had Theresa May at their beck and call,"" he says. ""The DUP at any point, at the beginning of all of this, could have forced Theresa May to seek the softest possible Brexit. They could have had their political Brexit, but not an economic Brexit. ""But they didn't. They refused to do it, they followed Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of them down the rabbit hole and they've been left behind. ""And now we're in a situation where we're forced to protect this deal... which does real, real economic damage."" Alliance leader Naomi Long says ""business will have to adapt"" to Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. ""But will business be as economically sound as stable as if we don't Brexit? No."" She adds: ""So yes business will adapt... but that does not mean to say we will be in a good situation post-Brexit."" Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken The panel are still on the same question: how could Northern Ireland make the best of a new reality? Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken says there is ""such a degree of uncertainty"" among business from Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. ""It's going to fundamentally undermine the principles of the Northern Ireland economy. ""That's why we need to have Ulster Unionist MPs in Westminster because we need to negotiate suitable mitigation factors that means... that we can't have any borders north, south, east or west."" Alliance leader Naomi Long replies: ""Because, like every other policy, Steve, whatever you might say... when I speak to the next Ulster Unionist candidate, they'll be saying something entirely different."" Answering the original question, Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says we need to ""adapt to that new changing situation"". ""We need a new economic strategy that looks at sector by sector. It looks at what are the needs of our industries. ""Even before Brexit, our economic performance is really poor,"" she says, adding that there's a ""dearth here in terms of economic development"". ""By the nature of business, people will adapt,"" she adds. Jeffrey Donaldson suggests DUP MPs could have the chance to use their influence again If Brexit happens, how could Northern Ireland make the best of a new reality? That's the next question, posed by a Bangor businessman, facing the line-up of politicians on the NI election debate. Asked how he will deal with the checks on goods -which would come into force under Boris Johnson's Brexit deal- DUP Chief Whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says this election ""is going to be quite close"" and he reckons there is ""every prospect"" NI MPs can use their influence again in the House of Commons to get the changes necessary to the Brexit deal. There will be opportunities to amend the bill to ""safeguard Northern Ireland"", he says. In the 2017 election, the DUP entered into a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives, meaning they had influence as they were being relied on to prop up the government. Alliance leader Naomi Long says she thinks that despite having 10 MPs in Westminster, Sir Jeffrey's DUP team have delivered ""chaos and uncertainty"". She says we have to assume that the Conservative MPs elected on Friday will support Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. ""I think first of all we look for mitigations,"" she says to ensure there are no hard borders at all. LBC This video can not be played LISTEN: Excerpt from secret recording Labour's shadow health secretaryhas been in the news all day because of a leaked secret recording of him criticising Jeremy Corbyn to his Tory friend. And now Jonathan Ashworth is telling LBC radio listeners he's been the victim of a ""dirty trick"". ""Greig [Baker, Mr Ashworth's Tory friend] had been telling me in a panic that Jeremy Corbyn was going to win and all these terrible things were going to happen and he had been saying this throughout the campaign via text,"" he tells presenter Iain Dale. ""We spoke on the phone and he started asking me all these bizarre questions... he was sort of doing my head in with all of this. I gave him a bit of nonsense and said we weren't going to win so don't worry about it."" He adds: ""In the past he has been very rude about the Conservatives to me and at some points he has given us little bits and pieces to undermine his own Conservative government."" Mr Ashworth says it was a ""dirty trick"" to record the conversation and that he's been ""too trusting"". ""I've been stitched up like a kipper, played like a fiddle - whatever the right metaphor is,"" Mr Ashworth says. Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood The first question in the Northern Ireland leaders' debate is: Do
you believe Brexit makes a united Ireland more likely? Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood is first to answer. ""We have to deal with the crisis that we're in, which is Brexit,"" he says, adding: ""It's already shaken our peace process."" Mr Eastwood says he's backing another referendum and wants to be part of a ""pro-Remain coalition"". DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he does not believe there's an ""existential threat"" to NI's position within the UK. ""We can't go on with this situation where we ignore what people say,"" he says. ""The poll was held, the people voted."" He said the DUP has been ""absolutely crucial"" when it comes to Brexit, adding that it blocked the Brexit deal. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken clashes with Sir Jeffrey over the DUP's stance on the Brexit deal. Mr Aiken says that on the 2 October, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the deal was sensible. ""You agreed on the 2 October to put a border down the Irish Sea."" Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says: ""There's nothing good to come from Brexit."" Referring to the original question about a united Ireland, she says Brexit ""certainly makes people focus their minds about where people think their interests are best served"". The leader of Alliance, Naomi Long, says Brexit has
""certainly made Northern Ireland less stable"". She says it has brought arguments around borders back to the
fore. Earlier, we reported on the comments from David Merritt, the father of Jack Merritt - who was killed in a knife attack by Usman Khan on London Bridge last month. Mr Merritt - who has been critical of Boris Johnson previously - told Sky News he believes Mr Johnson ""saw an opportunity"" to score political points, when ""what was required was just a dignified approach"". He's been tweeting again, this time to say that no one from Downing Street has ""expressed their condolences towards my family"". This directly contradicts a quote from a spokesperson for the PM,reported by Sky News,,externalwho said Mr Johnson had expressed his deepest condolences. Allow Twitter content?

Amazon oil boom under fire at UN climate talks,"Indigenous leaders at the COP asking for a moratorium on oil extraction in the Amazon A report presented at COP25 says that plans are in place for a huge expansion of oil drilling in the upper Amazon. The analysis says that Ecuador and Peru are set to sanction oil extraction across an area of forest the size of Italy. Indigenous leaders from both countries have travelled to Madrid to urge a moratorium on using the oil. They say using the five billion barrels under the forest would harm the region and the world. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Amazon fires fuel water crisis fears Volunteer firefighters 'did not start Amazon fires' Colombia dissident rebels kill indigenous leader The area in question is known as the sacred headwaters of the upper Amazon and spans some 30 million hectares (74 million acres) in Ecuador and Peru. Oil extraction in the Amazon has been linked with serious environmental problems The region is home to around 500,000 indigenous peoples from 20 nationalities, and is a hotspot of biodiversity. But a report prepared by campaign group, Amazon Watch, says that Ecuador and Peru are actively planning to expand extraction and auction new oil blocks across the area. Right now this is a pristine area, with few roads. The indigenous people have title to these lands and in the area several tribes are living in voluntary isolation. Campaigners fear that if the oil blocks are sold it will see new roads built, which will lead to illegal logging, deforestation and poor outcomes for the residents of the region. Ecuador is due to leave the OPEC oil consortium in 2020, allowing it to boost its oil production. The country is also under pressure from China to supply oil because of financial debts. ""There's about $14bn that Ecuador owes China right now and that's a big part of the drive to expand production and look for new oil,"" said Kevin Koenig, from Amazon Watch who authored the report. ""In addition there are about $6bn in hidden debt in these oil for loan deals between PetroChina and Petroecuador which Ecuador is paying in barrels of oil."" It's estimated that around five billion barrels of oils are to be found in the upper Amazon region, which would equate to two billion metric tonnes of CO2. Right now, around 50% of the current production from the western Amazon goes to California, The report has been presented at the COP to highlight the hypocrisy of countries including China, says Kevin Koenig. Indigenous protestors in Ecuador have fought against oil development for a long time ""All those countries are here making declarations about cutting emissions, Ecuador and Peru are making declarations about protecting the Amazon but what we are seeing is a whole different plan to expand extraction, there's a gap between what countries are committing too and what they are actually planning to do in terms of fossil fuel expansion."" Indigenous leaders here are pressing for a moratorium on drilling - they say the oil should stay in the ground. ""We have been protecting our forests. We have kept many oil companies away,"" said Sandra Tukup, an indigenous leader from Ecuador. ""We are asking for a model of development aligned with climate science that respects our rights and allows our forests to continue to flourish."" Others stress the importance of the Amazon region for the whole world. They believe it could help push global temperatures past 1.5C, a level beyond which scientists believe there could be dire consequences for the Earth. ""The world needs to understand that the Amazon goes beyond Brazil, and that us, the indigenous from Peru and Ecuador, can work hand in hand with governments and philanthropists in the creation of a new economic model for the Amazon Forest,"" said Lizardo Cauper, from Peru. Reflecting the scale of violence that many indigenous people from the Amazon region live under, a delegation of more than 20 Brazilian leaders held a protest at the COP against the murder of two people on Saturday.

A third of hospitals 'increased parking charges',"A third of hospitals in England put up car parking charges last year, with total income rising by a 10th, an investigation shows. The Press Association used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain data from more than 140 NHS trusts. The responses showed Â£254m had been raised during 2018-19 - up from Â£232m the year before, with hourly charges varying between Â£4 and Â£1 for an hour. A survey carried out for PA also showed dissatisfaction with charges. The poll of more than 7,800 people found 86% said parking added to the stress of their hospital visit. Respondents described the fees as a ""rip-off"", ""extortionate"" and ""astronomical"". But people were split over whether charges should be scrapped or not. Labour has proposed ending hospital charges, while the Tories have proposed free parking for those with the greatest need, including disabled people, parents of sick children staying overnight and those regularly needing appointments. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like the environment, Brexit and the NHS. General election manifesto guide 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Car parks are largely free in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Patients Association said parking should be free. ""Charges for car parking at hospitals are a charge on people who are unwell, levied on them because they are unwell,"" it said. ""We believe that patients should not be effectively charged for being ill. ""Practical arrangements to prevent car parks being used by other motorists can and should be installed, as they are at supermarkets, hotels and so on."" But Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, defended the charges. ""Car parks are expensive to run for the trusts that own them,"" she said. ""Parking facilities must be maintained, lit well, and secure. ""All charges by trusts for parking cover the day-to-day running of car parking at the hospital, with any surplus reinvested back into wider services for patients or improving these facilities."" Abolishing charges would mean trusts would have to find funding from elsewhere, which could ""impact on patient care"", Ms Cordery added.

Catch up with ElectioncastLive Latest on campaigning as election day nears  Less than a minute ago,"It's the penultimate day of campaigning, ahead of Thursday's general election The BBC has hosted leaders' debates in Scotland and Northern Ireland Boris Johnson faced criticism for his reaction to a photo of a sick child lying on a hospital floor A Conservative minister said the PM did ""apologise and empathise"", but Labour says the picture shows the impact of Tory ""under-funding"" Labour's Jon Ashworth was recorded saying his party would not win the election The shadow health secretary later insisted he was joking, and Mr Corbyn said he supported his colleague Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay and Alice Evans What happened today? That's the end of today's live coverage of the general election campaign. Tuesday's headlines included:  Join us tomorrow for the final day of campaigning before the UK heads to the polls on Thursday. The full BBC paper review will be published later this evening. The five main Stormont parties discussed Brexit, healthcare and the collapse of the assembly in the BBC election debate. It took place in the BBC's studios in Belfast on earlier this evening. The general election takes place on Thursday with 18 Westminster seats in Northern Ireland at stake. Four of the Stormont leaders attended the debate, while the Democratic Unionist Party was represented by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. On Brexit, there was little meeting of minds between the parties. Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill came under fire for her party's policy of abstentionism. To read the full story of the debate, click here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics As a
reminder, the 2017 version of this model correctly predicted there would be a hung Parliament 10 days before polling day, and it called 93% of seats correctly. But thereâs
     not enough of a track record for us to know whether that was a one-off
     success or not. There is also a wide margin of error of around 30 seats for Conservative seat shares and 25
     for Labour. Also, in 2017, YouGov's correct-call-rate was lower (80%) for marginal seats - so we must be  extra wary of predictions
     about individual seats - especially, alas, the interesting close ones. Things
     can change between now (or the fieldwork dates) and polling day. There was a big dealmade of the last YouGov poll,released towards the end of the last month. The model, based on the views of 100,000 voters, applies national trends to individual constituencies. But it comes with a big margin of error and does not reflect local issues that can have an impact on polling day. YouGov said the margin of error could put the final number of Tory seats anywhere between 311 and 367, suggesting a hung Parliament cannot be ruled out. If an election was held tomorrow, the poll predicts: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The last question on the BBC Northern Ireland election debate is on climate change. How will your party tackle the climate crisis, and what do you do personally? Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken since his party wants to get to net-zero carbon by 2035 in Northern Ireland. (For context - the UK government is currently working towards a target of 2050 for the same thing.) But first of all, ""we must accept the fact there is a climate emergency,"" he says. Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood says his party would like to hit the net-zero carbon target by 2030. ""I have two daughters... we are leaving them some inheritance if we don't tackle this,"" he says. Alliance leader Naomi Long says ""no one needs to convince most of us here that the climate emergency is real"". ""We have set a target of zero emissions by 2030"", she says, and wants to see more investment in renewables. Challenged over whether the DUP believe in climate change, the party's chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says: ""Yes we do believe that we need to change radically to prevent this climate change and its impact on the planet."" And Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says the party wants to see an independent climate change agency as well as a green new deal to create green jobs. ""Personally by myself, I'm becoming so much more aware,"" she says, citing Greta Thunberg as raising awareness of the issue. You can read the full story of the debate here. A major YouGov poll has predicted the Tories will win a parliamentary majority of 28 seats at the general election. The second YouGov MRP poll - the final one before the election - suggests the Conservatives will win 339 seats in 2019, a rise of 22 from 2017, while Labour will lose 31 and end up with a total of 231. It is a smaller Tory majority than predicted in a previous YouGov poll in November that said the Tories would have a 68-seat majority. The research suggests that if the election was held tomorrow, the Lib Dems would win 15 seats, while the SNP would gain six. An MRP poll - which stands for the punchy multi-level regression and post-stratification - uses data from a poll to discover relationships between peopleâs characteristics and their answers to the voting intention question, YouGov says. It then constructs estimates of how vote intention would look in each constituency. Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker here. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Jonathan Ashworth was forced to explain secretly taped comments As the Tories discovered to their cost yesterday, the election is not over. Boris Johnson'sweirdly robotic response to a young child's experiencein an NHS hospital saw to that. Conservatives were certainly cross with their boss's unforced political error. But one cabinet minister told me they didn't think it ""would really tip things""; it was simply too late in the day. There is no question it gave Labour an opportunity to hammer home their message all day yesterday, and may well have planted more seeds of doubt in voters' minds about which way to go. A group of women in Staffordshire today, some of whom hadn't yet made their up their minds, all said worries about the health service were the number one factor for them, mentioning the picture that caused such a stir yesterday. But another last minute story bust its way into these closing moments of the campaign, grabbing headlines today, and putting Labour on the back foot this time. Read more from Laura here. Sinn Fein's vice-president Michelle O'Neill The next question comes from a bank worker from Belfast, who asks whether, considering Sinn Fein and the DUP can't work together, is it time we have direct rule to tackle the health crisis? The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson goes first. ""We need our assembly back and we need it back today,"" he says, adding that health will be the priority. He says once talks are back up and running next week, if there's no agreement in Stormont by 13 January ""then I think we have to look at handing this back to Westminster"". He reminds the audience of the Â£1.5bn the DUP MPs negotiated in 2017, in exchange for their support for the Tory government. Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says ""direct rule is not an option"". ""We can never go backwards, we can only go forwards,"" she says. ""I believe we need to give people the hope and the vision which was there back in 1998 when we signed the Good Friday Agreement."" She says people in the community ""want the assembly up and running... but it also needs to be sustainable and credible"". On the health service, she says: ""I think we need to have a very substantial financial injection from the British government...The health service is in crisis because of Tory austerity. ""The health service is on its knees."" Read more here about the deadlock over Northern Ireland's power sharing government. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood - who is backing another referendum - tells the Northern Ireland election debate that the DUP ""had all the power"" in 2017. ""They had 10 MPs, they had Theresa May at their beck and call,"" he says. ""The DUP at any point, at the beginning of all of this, could have forced Theresa May to seek the softest possible Brexit. They could have had their political Brexit, but not an economic Brexit. ""But they didn't. They refused to do it, they followed Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of them down the rabbit hole and they've been left behind. ""And now we're in a situation where we're forced to protect this deal... which does real, real economic damage."" Alliance leader Naomi Long says ""business will have to adapt"" to Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. ""But will business be as economically sound as stable as if we don't Brexit? No."" She adds: ""So yes business will adapt... but that does not mean to say we will be in a good situation post-Brexit."" Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken The panel are still on the same question: how could Northern Ireland make the best of a new reality? Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken says there is ""such a degree of uncertainty"" among business from Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. ""It's going to fundamentally undermine the principles of the Northern Ireland economy. ""That's why we need to have Ulster Unionist MPs in Westminster because we need to negotiate suitable mitigation factors that means... that we can't have any borders north, south, east or west."" Alliance leader Naomi Long replies: ""Because, like every other policy, Steve, whatever you might say... when I speak to the next Ulster Unionist candidate, they'll be saying something entirely different."" Answering the original question, Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says we need to ""adapt to that new changing situation"". ""We need a new economic strategy that looks at sector by sector. It looks at what are the needs of our industries. ""Even before Brexit, our economic performance is really poor,"" she says, adding that there's a ""dearth here in terms of economic development"". ""By the nature of business, people will adapt,"" she adds. Jeffrey Donaldson suggests DUP MPs could have the chance to use their influence again If Brexit happens, how could Northern Ireland make the best of a new reality? That's the next question, posed by a Bangor businessman, facing the line-up of politicians on the NI election debate. Asked how he will deal with the checks on goods -which would come into force under Boris Johnson's Brexit deal- DUP Chief Whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says this election ""is going to be quite close"" and he reckons there is ""every prospect"" NI MPs can use their influence again in the House of Commons to get the changes necessary to the Brexit deal. There will be opportunities to amend the bill to ""safeguard Northern Ireland"", he says. In the 2017 election, the DUP entered into a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives, meaning they had influence as they were being relied on to prop up the government. Alliance leader Naomi Long says she thinks that despite having 10 MPs in Westminster, Sir Jeffrey's DUP team have delivered ""chaos and uncertainty"". She says we have to assume that the Conservative MPs elected on Friday will support Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. ""I think first of all we look for mitigations,"" she says to ensure there are no hard borders at all. LBC This video can not be played LISTEN: Excerpt from secret recording Labour's shadow health secretaryhas been in the news all day because of a leaked secret recording of him criticising Jeremy Corbyn to his Tory friend. And now Jonathan Ashworth is telling LBC radio listeners he's been the victim of a ""dirty trick"". ""Greig [Baker, Mr Ashworth's Tory friend] had been telling me in a panic that Jeremy Corbyn was going to win and all these terrible things were going to happen and he had been saying this throughout the campaign via text,"" he tells presenter Iain Dale. ""We spoke on the phone and he started asking me all these bizarre questions... he was sort of doing my head in with all of this. I gave him a bit of nonsense and said we weren't going to win so don't worry about it."" He adds: ""In the past he has been very rude about the Conservatives to me and at some points he has given us little bits and pieces to undermine his own Conservative government."" Mr Ashworth says it was a ""dirty trick"" to record the conversation and that he's been ""too trusting"". ""I've been stitched up like a kipper, played like a fiddle - whatever the right metaphor is,"" Mr Ashworth says. Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood The first question in the Northern Ireland leaders' debate is: Do
you believe Brexit makes a united Ireland more likely? Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood is first to answer. ""We have to deal with the crisis that we're in, which is Brexit,"" he says, adding: ""It's already shaken our peace process."" Mr Eastwood says he's backing another referendum and wants to be part of a ""pro-Remain coalition"". DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he does not believe there's an ""existential threat"" to NI's position within the UK. ""We can't go on with this situation where we ignore what people say,"" he says. ""The poll was held, the people voted."" He said the DUP has been ""absolutely crucial"" when it comes to Brexit, adding that it blocked the Brexit deal. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken clashes with Sir Jeffrey over the DUP's stance on the Brexit deal. Mr Aiken says that on the 2 October, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the deal was sensible. ""You agreed on the 2 October to put a border down the Irish Sea."" Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill says: ""There's nothing good to come from Brexit."" Referring to the original question about a united Ireland, she says Brexit ""certainly makes people focus their minds about where people think their interests are best served"". The leader of Alliance, Naomi Long, says Brexit has
""certainly made Northern Ireland less stable"". She says it has brought arguments around borders back to the
fore. Earlier, we reported on the comments from David Merritt, the father of Jack Merritt - who was killed in a knife attack by Usman Khan on London Bridge last month. Mr Merritt - who has been critical of Boris Johnson previously - told Sky News he believes Mr Johnson ""saw an opportunity"" to score political points, when ""what was required was just a dignified approach"". He's been tweeting again, this time to say that no one from Downing Street has ""expressed their condolences towards my family"". This directly contradicts a quote from a spokesperson for the PM,reported by Sky News,,externalwho said Mr Johnson had expressed his deepest condolences. Allow Twitter content?

Johnson's race for trade deal strengthens EU hand,"EU leaders and Boris Johnson agreed on a revised UK Brexit deal in October Over and over again in this election campaign you hear supporters of Boris Johnson confidently asserting that ""he did it with the Brexit deal: he got the EU to renegotiate when most people said it'd be impossible. ""So who cares about those who now openly doubt his ability to get a trade deal done with the EU by December next year? The doubters were wrong before. They'll be proved wrong again."" Except, it seems to be overlooked that Prime Minister Johnson did not charm or bully or manipulate the EU into reopening the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and changing the infamous backstop for the Irish border. It was only by breaking a deep red line of his, very late on in the negotiations, that EU leaders wholeheartedly agreed to a ""new"" Brexit deal (that in reality was almost identical to the one negotiated by Theresa May). If you remember, Mr Johnson had pledged never to allow a post-Brexit division between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But in the end that is exactly what he did. While on paper and in legal terms Mr Johnson has ensured that Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union and single market along with Great Britain, practically speaking Northern Ireland would continue adhering to the EU's customs code and being part of the EU's single market for goods. Boris Johnson's divorce deal introduces a customs barrier down the Irish Sea. A barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Something Mr Johnson had said he would never countenance. Johnson's Brexit plan 'presents major challenge' Will there be checks between Great Britain and NI? What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? EU leaders negotiated with Boris Johnson in the hope that he would better be able to sell a deal back home in the UK than his predecessor, Mrs May. But they only signed on the dotted line of the backstop's replacement because they were confident that it protected their single market on the island of Ireland after Brexit. The border at Newry: A majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU For the prime minister, ""getting it done"" seemed of greater importance when it came to the Brexit deal than keeping his word about the union and avoiding a line down the Irish Sea. So how might it be when it comes to trade negotiations? Would Boris Johnson give up post-Brexit ""sovereignty"" and ""control"" to get a quick deal done with the EU by next Christmas? Because if you earwig on EU internal conversations these days, you'll hear that the only way he has a real chance of getting a bare-bones free trade agreement (FTA) with Brussels done and dusted by next Christmas is if he crosses his own red lines again and gives in to EU concerns. This time over so-called level playing field provisions (such as adhering to EU environmental, labour and state aid rules after Brexit) and allowing EU countries fishing rights in UK waters. Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? If Mr Johnson signs up to ongoing alignment with EU rules, then where's the national sovereignty he promised voters? But if he doesn't, then trade negotiations with Brussels are likely to drag on a lot, lot longer. And could delay closing trade deals with other countries. Japan, Canada, Australia and others are unlikely to want to sign off on a new trade deal with a post-Brexit UK until they know what kind of relationship it will have with the EU. Something else to bear in mind: if Boris Johnson did maintain close ties with the EU, then Brexit-associated divisions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain would diminish; Brussels would have less need for checks, controls and paperwork to closely monitor what is coming in or going out of its single market/customs territory via the island of Ireland. It all comes down to not being able to have your cake and eat it. Those trade-offs - which so many politicians seem very reluctant to come clean about this election season.

The most controversial numbers of the campaign,"The Reality Check team navigates the most questionable figures that have cropped up in the election campaign. One of the biggest numbers to come out of the campaign so far was Â£1.2tn, which was the extra amount the Conservative Party said that Labour would spend over the next five years. The initial verdicton this was that the Conservatives could not possibly know this because the Labour manifesto had not yet been published. The dossier,externalwas released on 10 November, well beforethe Labour manifesto,externalwas published on 21 November. Now that we do have the manifesto, we can make a list of some of the items that were included in the Conservative costing that were not included, together with how much the Tories said they would cost over five years. Abolishing private schools - Â£35bn Free school meals for secondary school students - Â£6.8bn Excluding pensions from the 2% target for defence spending - Â£3bn That's nearly Â£45bn. Some of the Conservative costings also seemed somewhat inflated. For example, they used the figure of Â£196bn (from the Confederation of British Industry) as the cost of nationalisation,which is hotly contested. It assumed that a Labour government would pay a 30% premium above the market value of the assets it wanted to nationalise. On the other hand, it came before the announcement of the plan to nationalise part of BT. Even if you accept that costing, a rough overall calculation comes up well short. Labour has committed to a National Transformation Fund, which will invest Â£55bn a year over the next five years on things like housing and green projects. Its manifesto costings ""grey book"" says it will be spending another Â£83bn a year on day-to-day spending, by the fifth year of the parliament. Even if you assume that it spends that much every year (Â£415bn over five years), add Â£275bn for five years of investment, Â£196bn for nationalisation and Â£58bn tocompensate Waspi women, you still come up more than quarter of a trillion pounds short of the Conservative figure. The Conservatives used the Â£1.2tn figure to come up with an estimate that the extra spending would cost the average taxpayer an extra Â£2,400 a year, which is similarly dubious. That's partly because its starting point was the Â£1.2tn claim, and also because there were additions such as the claim that Labour is considering a homes tax, which would cost households up to Â£375 more than the current Council Tax system, raising an extra Â£10.2bn. However, this seems to be based on a policy-proposal document put forward by Guardian columnist George Monbiot in June, and commissioned for the Labour Party. It did not appear in the manifesto. Claims about the cost of Labour's spending have featured heavily in Conservative adverts on social media. The Â£1.2tn and/or Â£2,400 figures have appeared in more than 600 ads on Facebook, Instagram, Google and YouTube. An approximate collective reach of these adverts amounts to at least one million users. You can read more about both claims here. The Labour Party used the figure in a post on its official Facebook page Labour claimed that a Conservative trade deal with the US would mean the NHS having to spend an extra Â£500m a week on drugs. The party even mocked up a picture of a bus on its Facebook page, with Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg standing in front of it, saying: ""We'll send Trump Â£500m a week. Let's fund US drug firms, not our NHS."" The figure comes from an academic study which looked at how much more the US pays for drugs, per head, than the UK - about 2.5 times more, according to the OECD. But the report's authors described it as ""a crude estimate"" and ""a worst-case scenario"" - not an attempt to work out how much the NHS could actually spend on drugs, after a UK/US trade deal. At the moment, according to the Office for National Statistics, 9% of all medicines imported by the NHS come directly from the US, while 79% of medicine imports come from the European Union. That may be an underestimate of US imports, on the grounds that some US pharmaceutical companies may be selling drugs to the UK via their European subsidiaries. Nonetheless, while it is possible that a UK trade deal with the US could lead to the NHS paying higher prices for drugs from the US, it is highly unlikely that those higher prices would also be paid for drugs coming from the EU, and indeed for the ones made in the UK. After the figure was widely questioned, Labour figures generally stopped using it. Although the Â£500m claim has not been widely promoted in Labour's digital adverts, an ad featuring the figure, which ran on Facebook and Instagram early in the campaign, has been shown between 175,000 and 200,000 times. You can read more about the claim here. Leeds General Infirmary will be one of the first six funded projects The prime minister has repeatedly pledged to build 40 new hospitals over 10 years. The Conservative manifesto went as far as to say the party was proud ""to have begun work on building 40 new hospitals across the country"". But while the plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years, a further 34 hospitals will share only an initial Â£100m in funding to start developing future projects. A substantial amount of extra money would be needed to bring those plans to fruition. And there is some question about whether even the six initially funded ones are actually new hospitals, or refurbishments, or additions to existing ones. Either way, building work hasn't yet begun at these sites -as Reality Check reported. Also,Radio 4's More or Less foundthat 12 of the remaining 34 hospitals would be community hospitals in Dorset, which are relatively small hospitals - what used to be called cottage hospitals, and perhaps not what people would have been thinking about when Mr Johnson talked about 40 new hospitals. Labour said the Conservatives' failure to curb household bills had cost the average household almost Â£6,000 a year since 2010. These are all based on figures for rising bills for things like prescriptions, broadband and rail tickets, even though some of the items on the list have gone up less than the rate of inflation, which means their prices were rising less than the price of a typical ""basket"" of goods and services. Also, the household that has lost out by Â£6,000 is quite a specific one, having two adults who buy annual rail season tickets and a two-year-old child, which is not necessarily representative. And Labour said that the cost was Â£6,000 a year since 2010, but its calculations were for the increased costs in the final year. Clearly the price rises, even for this specific household, would have been considerably smaller in 2011, for example. You can read more about the claim here. Nigel Farage keeps saying he is targeting the five million people who voted Leave in 2016 and voted Labour in 2017. We don't have precise figures for this because both were secret ballots, but a number of respected organisations have conducted large surveys looking into this. Most estimates fall between three million and four million. Even the top of the margin of error of the highest estimate does not get to five million. The 5m figure was mentioned in a Brexit Party election broadcast that aired on the BBC, and Facebook ads promoting the same broadcast have been shown to users more than 500,000 times. Facebook ads targeting Labour seats - from Bootle to Bassetlaw - also included the figure. You can read more about the claim here. This chart was posted on the Bath and North East Somerset Liberal Democrats' Twitter feed. It makes it look as if it's a close race between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems. Read the small print, however, and it turns out this reflects a Survation poll of only 405 people asked the leading question: ""Imagine that the result in your constituency was expected to be very close between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidate and none of the other parties were competitive. In this scenario, which party would you vote for?"" And Labour still had 8% support. See more examples of misleading election material here.

Residents forced from homes by major blaze in flats,"This video can not be played More than 60 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze About 200 people had to leave their homes after a fire ripped through a block of flats in Glasgow. The fire broke out at the building on Lancefield Quay, on the north bank of the Clyde, at about 18:40 on Monday. Sixty firefighters and 15 appliances tackled the ""well-developed"" blaze in the second floor of the three-storey building. No-one was hurt. One senior firefighter said they did a ""remarkable job in very challenging circumstances"", due to wind and rain. Roddie Keith, area commander for Glasgow, said it was a ""very significant and complex incident"". ""The fire was extinguished earlier this morning so we've scaled the incident down but we will have resources on site for quite some time to make sure there are no deeper-seated pockets of fire that could flare up at a later stage,"" he said. The extent of the damage could be seen on Tuesday morning Some residents could be allowed to return to their homes at some point on Tuesday - at least to collect their belongings, he added. But he was unable to give a timescale on when people would be able to return to flats directly affected by the blaze. The property was an award-winning 1980s conversion of a quayside transit store, originally built in 1947, into 92 flats and maisonettes. One resident told the BBC she was sure the building would have to be demolished. Sheena Anderson, who has lived in the block for 17 years, said her home had been destroyed. ""It will be demolished,"" she said. ""They've got all the water that's coming down from the house above me. ""If a wee trickle comes, it pours down the walls, so my house will be demolished. Nothing surer. I can't believe it. ""I've got what I'm standing up in. ""OK, it could be worse, but that's a terrible fire. What caused it, they don't know."" The apartments face out onto the River Clyde The Lancefield Quay flats opened in 1989 as part of an urban renewal plan by house builders Wimpey. The homes were created from what had been a Glasgow City Council-owned warehouse between the Kingston Bridge and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The architectural design was described at the time as a ""triumph of ingenuity"" with each apartment's porthole-shaped windows looking out over the River Clyde. The Broomielaw side of the building has also since been redeveloped into luxury flats, offices, shops and restaurants. Abdullah Alharbi, who has lived in the neighbouring flat with his family for two years, said: ""I'm feeling terrible. ""All my documents and papers, everything is at my flat and I'm scared about it."" BBC reporter Graham Fraser said: ""There were lots of flames earlier. Now I can see a hole, about 15m long in the roof of the building with smoke pouring out still."" Firefighers were dampening down on Tuesday morning There were 60 firefighters on the scene at the height of the blaze Glasgow City Council said Lancefield Quay, the main road that runs alongside the Clyde in Glasgow, was closed between Elliot Street and Hydepark Street. It added thatLancefield Quay was also closed eastbound,externalat the junction with Finnieston Street. Anderston Quay is closed westbound at the junction with North Street. Residents of the building were sent to a local hotel, where support finding alternative accommodation was  offered.

Labour seeks to keep focus on NHS,"Labour and the Tories are focusing on key messages around the NHS and Brexit in the final days of the campaign. While Labour talks about under-funding risks to patients, the Conservatives are promising an end to ""gridlock"". But it is not all plain sailing, asa recording has been leaked of shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthcriticising Labour's election chances. AndBoris Johnson is still facing criticismover his reaction to an image of a sick boy on a hospital floor. Party leaders are campaigning in key constituencies, with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson telling campaigners in Bath that her message to stop Brexit was part of a ""fight for the soul of our country"". She added: ""This is about whether we are open or closed, generous or selfish, whether we reach out and work with others or pull up the drawbridge."" And the SNP is proposing legislation to protect the NHS in Scotland from ""exploitative"" trade deals, with Nicola Sturgeon warning Mr Johnson poses the greatest threat to Scotland of ""any prime minister in modern times"". In other election developments: Ms Sturgeon and other Scottish leaderswill take part in a debate on BBC Scotland later Nigel Farage has criticised Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, claiming it would lead to ""years of agonising negotiations"" TheGreens are focusing on a pledgeto cancel student debt built up since 2012. Labour is pledging a ""relentless focus"" on the health service if it wins power after Thursday's poll, promising changes in the first 100 days. The party says reports produced by NHS trusts in England this month show a health service ""in crisis and on the brink"". An analysis it has conducted of more than 120 NHS trust board papers identified hundreds of risks to patient safety classed as ""catastrophic"" or ""extreme"". The majority were linked to spending, staff shortages or failures of privatisation, the party said. It promised that a Labour government would conduct an immediate audit of the risks revealed. The BBC's Reality Check team said the quotes from the NHS boards were genuine but did not give the nationwide picture, which was more mixed. Johnson's bad day shows election not over Tories target Labour Leave seats in final push Labour Budget to 'end austerity' in first 100 days Speaking in Carlisle, Mr Corbyn said there were four million people waiting for operations on the NHS, along with ""a mental health care crisis and social care crisis"". He added: ""I do not blame the nurses, I do not blame the doctors, I do not blame the health service. ""I blame the government that has underfunded our NHS."" However, the leaked recording of Mr Ashworth -  which shows him telling a Tory activist friend the situation for Labour was ""dire"" and the party had made a mistake by not getting rid of Mr Corbyn as leader - has distracted from the campaign. Mr Ashworth has insisted his apparent criticism of the Labour leader was ""banter"", telling the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire he was ""joshing"" when he told his friend that he thought there was no way Labour could win the election. He also apologised to Labour members on BBC Politics Live. Mr Corbyn said it was ""not the sort of thing I would do"", but claimed the story was ""irrelevant"" and Mr Ashworth was ""making jokes"". He said the reports on the comments were ""just trying to deflect away from the Tories' mess of the National Health Service"". The prime minister is trying to keep the focus on Brexit and the ""danger"" of another inconclusive result in Thursday's election. Speaking at the JCB factory in Staffordshire, Mr Johnson said that without a working majority for the Conservatives it was ""very hard to see"" how the UK could leave the EU, and he was ""fighting for every vote"" to stop a hung Parliament. He said backing him will allow the country to go forward, ""punching through the current deadlock and achieving a brighter future together"". This video can not be played WATCH: Boris Johnson warns of coalition ""disaster"" But there is distraction for the PM too, as he continued to face criticism over his response to a photograph of a four-year-old boy sleeping on the floor of a Leeds hospital due to a lack of beds. On Monday, an ITV reporter tried to show Mr Johnson the picture on his phone, but the prime minister initially refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. He later looked, returned the phone and apologised to the family. This video can not be played Moment Boris Johnson put ITV reporter's phone in his pocket Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that the ""family want their privacy to be maintained"" and for their son Jack ""not to be used as a political football"". He said the prime minister expressed ""sorrow and regret"" for what he saw and apologised to the family, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock also went to Leeds to apologise. There were a number of angry protesters outside the hospital who shouted at Mr Hancock and his team when they left. Two sources told journalists that one of Mr Hancock's advisers had been punched by one of the activists, but footage later showed that had not happened and instead that the aide had walked into a protester's outstretched arm. Challenged on the footage, Mr Buckland said he did not know ""who briefed what to whom"", adding ""what I saw was a very confusing scene of public disorder"". Mr Corbyn has denied politicising Jack's case, but said the incident ""says an awful lot about the NHS"" and the ""shortage of staff"".

'No survivors' on NZ island after volcano eruption,"This video can not be played Paramedic Russell Clark: ""Everything was blanketed in ash"" A paramedic who flew to New Zealand's White Island to rescue tourists after Monday's volcanic eruption has said the scene was like something out of ""the Chernobyl mini-series"". ""Everything was blanketed in ash,"" Russell Clark told TVNZ. Dozens of tourists were on the island at the time. Six have been confirmed dead. Eight others are feared to have died and about 30 have serious burns. New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern praised the crews of four rescue helicopters. ""Those pilots made an incredibly brave decision under extraordinarily dangerous circumstances in an attempt to get people out,"" she told reporters on Tuesday. ""To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your unfathomable grief and in your sorrow."" Who are the White Island victims? As it happened: Details emerge of eruption In his interview, Mr Clark said he and his fellow rescuers had found a ""devastating scene"" when they landed. ""There was a helicopter on the island that had obviously been there at the time and its rotor blades were off it."" A clip posted on Twitter showed an ash-covered helicopter on the island as the eruption took place At least 47 people from around the world were on the island at the time of the eruption. Questions are being asked about why tourists were allowed to approach New Zealand's most active volcano three weeks after seismologists raised its alert level, describing the situation as ""moderate to heightened volcanic unrest"". ""These questions must be asked and they must be answered,"" Ms Ardern said in parliament on Tuesday. A police investigation is under way. Geological hazard monitoring group GeoNet warned last week that White Island ""may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal"" - but it also said ""the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors"". This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island Currently, the alert level is at three, indicating the risk of a ""minor volcanic eruption"". Thirty-four people were rescued, one of whom later died. Most of the victims are still receiving treatment in hospital. Officials say they have burns to more than 30% of their bodies. Several others are also suffering from inhalation burns. Police said they were ""unsure"" what state the bodies that remained on the island were in, saying they were probably ""covered in ash"". The privately-owned volcano that is always active This video can not be played New Zealander who lost leg in previous eruption talks about his experience, in the aftermath of White Island tragedy White Island remains too dangerous to access, but reconnaissance flights conducted earlier on Tuesday saw no survivors. Ms Ardern said there were no signs of life and that the focus was now ""on recovery"". There were 24 visitors from Australia, nine from the US, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two from China, two from the UK, and one person from Malaysia. The first victim to be identified was tour guide Hayden Marshall-Inman, a local of nearby town Whakatane, who according to New Zealand media has been named by his brother on Facebook. The second person confirmed to have died is from Malaysia, the country's High Commission said. Another tour guide from New Zealand, 23-year old Tipene Maangi, is among the missing. His family told media he had been called in on his day off. In pictures: White Island eruption New Zealand profile Two British women were among those receiving treatment, said the UK High Commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he ""feared"" three of the five confirmed dead were Australian. Mr Morrison said that 24 Australians had been on board a cruise ship exploring the island in the Bay of Plenty when the volcano erupted. Of those, 13 were in hospital and 11 were unaccounted for, he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy, a time of great innocence and joy interrupted by the horror of that eruption,"" Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney. A web page has been set up by theNew Zealand Red Cross for families to register missing loved ones.,external White Island, also called Whakaari, is privately owned and a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. The volcano erupted in two explosions in quick succession at around 14:11 (01:11 GMT) on Monday, sending up a thick plume of ash and vapour. A live feed from the volcano showed several visitors inside the crater before the stream went dark. A group of visitors (circled) could be seen inside the crater before images went dark Some survivors were rescued by boat in the immediate aftermath of the explosion, but police said it was too dangerous to mount a rescue operation. But later four rescue helicopter missions picked up several people from the island. Since then, emergency services have been unable to search the area because of dangerous conditions, with plumes of ash continuing to rise above the volcano. Authorities on Tuesday said there was a 50% chance of a second eruption of the same size or smaller in the next 24 hours, but that it was unlikely there would be a bigger eruption that would affect the mainland.

Johnson criticised over reaction to sick boy imageThe PM initially refused to look at the picture of the boy and took a reporter's phone away.,"Jack waited for four hours in a room without a bed, despite being admitted under blue light to Leeds General Infirmary Boris Johnson has been criticised after initially refusing to look at a picture of a sick four-year-old boy who had to sleep on the floor of a Leeds hospital. The picture inthe Daily Mirror,externalof Jack, who had suspected pneumonia, spurred complaints about NHS cuts. An ITV reporter tried to show Mr Johnson the picture on his phone, but he refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. He later looked and returned the phone. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: ""He just doesn't care"", while Independent Group for Change leader Anna Soubry called his actions ""appalling"". Kuenssberg: Johnson's bad day shows election not over Mr Johnson was asked by other reporters why he had not looked at the photo, but he did not answer the question directly, instead repeating Conservative pledges for the NHS and promising to rebuild ""the whole of Leeds General Infirmary from top to bottom"". This video can not be played Moment Boris Johnson put ITV reporter's phone in his pocket Health Secretary Matt Hancock later visited the hospital to speak to management about the case. He said he was ""horrified"" by the incident involving Jack, adding: ""It's not good enough and I have apologised."" But Mr Hancock would not comment on the PM's reaction, saying: ""What people care about is what are we doing to improve care at Leeds General and across the NHS."" As he left, the health secretary was met by a group of protesters shouting at him. The boy's mother has said she does not want her son's treatment being used as a ""political football"". In a formal complaint to press regulator IPSO, she said she had initially given permission to two newspapers to use her son Jack's image but -  after the story was widely reported across other news outlets - she now wanted to prevent any further publication of the picture or his details.

Jack was taken into Leeds General Infirmary last week after being ill for six days, his mother told the Mirror. His mother said he had been seen as soon as he arrived and given a bed and oxygen, but a few hours later the bed had to be given to another patient and Jack was left without one for more than four hours. His mother said she then made a makeshift bed for her son with coats and took the picture. She told the newspaper the doctors and nurses were ""lovely people"", but she was ""angry at the lack of funding and the lack of beds"", accusing the government of ""failing our children"". Boris Johnson was on the campaign trail when he was shown the picture of Jack Dr Yvette Oade, chief medical officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""Our hospitals are extremely busy at the moment and we are very sorry that Jack's family had a long wait in our emergency department. ""We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed. This falls below our usual high standards, and for this we would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family."" ITV reporter Joe Pike tweeted,externalabout his interview with Mr Johnson, which took place in Grimsby on the campaign trail. He asked the PM to look at the photo of Jack on his phone several times. Mr Johnson said he had not seen the picture yet but refused to look at it while Mr Pike questioned him. Eventually, he took Mr Pike's phone and put it in his pocket, saying: ""If you don't mind, I'll give you an interview now."" Mr Pike said: ""You refuse to look at the photo. You've taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. ""His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What's your response to that?"" Mr Johnson then removed the phone from his pocket and looked at the screen. ""It's a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family, and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS,"" he said. ""But what we are doing is supporting the NHS, and on the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had. ""That's why we're making huge investments into the NHS, and we can only do it if we get Parliament going, if we unblock the current deadlock, and we move forward.""

"Five dead, eight missing in New Zealand eruption","This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island New Zealand police have confirmed that five people have died and eight are missing after White Island volcano erupted on Monday as tourists visited. Thirty-four people survived, with 31 still receiving treatment in hospital. Two British women were among those receiving treatment, said the UK High Commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he ""feared"" three of the five confirmed dead were Australian. Mr Morrison said that 24 Australians were on board a cruise ship exploring the island in the Bay of Plenty when the volcano erupted. Of those, 13 people had been hospitalised and 11 were unaccounted for, he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy, a time of great innocence and joy interrupted by the horror of that eruption,"" Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney. The volcano early on Tuesday Also among those listed as missing or injured were US, Chinese, Malaysian and New Zealand citizens. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a press conference on Tuesday that she shared the ""unfathomable grief"" of those who had lost loved ones. Tourists were seen walking inside the crater of White Island volcano moments before it erupted. Ms Ardern said further rescue efforts for the missing were now ""very sadly a recovery operation"". This satellite radar image shows White Island volcano after the eruption - radar is able to take images that are not obscured by ash, steam and cloud The survivors of the eruption were taken off the uninhabited island by boat or by helicopter. Emergency services have so far been unable to search the area because of dangerous conditions, with plumes of smoke and ash continuing to rise above the volcano on Tuesday. Ms Ardern acknowledged the apparently high number of Australian victims. ""Can I say to our Australian family, there are no two countries closer and we are devastated at what has happened here and particularly want to acknowledge those from Australia who have been caught up in this horrific, horrific incident,"" she said. The privately owned volcano that is always active In pictures: White Island eruption New Zealand profile White Island, also called Whakaari, is the country's most active volcano. Despite that, the privately owned island is a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Whakatane At sunrise in  Whakatane, smoke could be seen rising from White Island or Whakaari - 50km across the ocean. The waterfront was eerily quiet - save for the Australian and New Zealand TV networks (along with the BBC) sombrely conveying the latest updates on the dead, the missing and the injured. None of those hurt remain in the local hospital which was a hive of activity less than 24 hours earlier. Three patients have been discharged. Others - too sick for this small town facility - have been sent to specialist burns departments across the country. Many of them are critically ill. Earlier, as we drove to Whakatane through the night from Auckland we passed the illuminated outline of the Ovation of the Seas - the cruise ship which should have been continuing its tour around New Zealand. Instead it remains moored, as its passengers - some of them the friends and families of those hurt, killed and missing - try to fathom how this happened. Police confirmed that a total of 47 people had been on the island when the disaster happened on Monday afternoon local time. Rescuers will only go to the island when it is safe to do so, said Superintendent Bruce Bird. But reconnaissance flights detected no signs of life there. ""We will be relying on advice coming from the scientific and technical committee in Wellington who are currently meeting at the moment and hope to hear further advice on when we may potentially return to the island,"" Supt Bird said. A group of visitors (circled) could be seen inside the crater before images went dark Speaking at the same news conference, Prime Minister Ardern paid tribute to helicopter crews who had flown to the island on Monday to bring people out despite the dangers. ""I want to acknowledge the courageous decision made by first responders and those pilots who in their immediate rescue efforts made an incredibly brave decision under extraordinarily dangerous circumstances in an attempt to get people out,"" she said. White Island erupted at around 14:11 (01:11 GMT) on Monday, sending up a thick plume of ash and smoke which was filmed by visitor Michael Schade. Mr Schade, who was on a boat leaving the island after a morning tour, told the BBC he had been at the crater just 30 minutes before the disaster. Allow Twitter content?

""We had just got on the boat... then someone pointed it out and we saw it,"" he said. ""I was basically just shocked. The boat turned back and we grabbed some people that were waiting on the pier."" Another witness, Brazilian Allessandro Kauffmann, said in anInstagram post in Portuguese,externalthat his boat had left five minutes before the eruption. ""This other tour that arrived right after, unfortunately they did not manage to leave in time, and there were some people that suffered serious burns,"" he added. A live feed from the volcano showed a group of visitors inside the crater before the stream went dark. There are few details about those caught in the eruption. Some who had gone to the island were passengers from the Ovation of the Seas, a cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean. It left Sydney last week and stopped near Auckland on New Zealand's North Island before arriving in the city of Tauranga, near White Island, on Sunday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians had ""been caught up in this terrible event"" and the authorities were ""working to determine their wellbeing"". A web page has been set up by the New Zealand Red Cross for families to register missing loved ones.,external The island, also known as Whakaari, is privately owned and is typically visited by thousands of tourists every year, despite the fact that it has been erupting in some form since 2011. Geological hazard monitors GeoNet pass on information about the volcano's activity to tour operators and the police, but tourists make their own decisions about whether to visit. Visitors are supplied with hard hats and gas masks,externalto protect against sulphurous steam and must have suitable footwear to make the tour, according to New Zealand website Stuff. The owners of Whakatane-based company White Island Tours are the official guardians of the island, which was declared a private scenic reserve in 1952, and they grant access through designated tour operators. According to the New Zealand Herald, White Island Tours warned on its website that visitors ""should be aware that there is always a risk of eruptive activity regardless of the alert level"", while stating it followed a ""comprehensive safety plan which determines"" its activities on the island ""at the various levels"". Company chairman Paul Quinn said the event on the island had been a ""terrible tragedy"" and the company's ""thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been impacted"". The BBC has contacted White Island Tours for comment. Last Tuesday GeoNet warned of a heightened level of activity at the site, but also said that ""the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors"". White Island has seen several eruptions over the years, most recently in 2016 but no-one was hurt in that event.

Four big things stopping voters from making a decision,"Not yet made up your mind how to vote on Thursday? You're not alone. Three days before the election, many voters are struggling to find a party that offers what they want. This is a snapshot of the undecided voters of 2019. The BBC has commissioned an opinion research consultancy, Britain Thinks, to put together a sample of voters - representative in age, location, gender, race, class and voting history. Some common themes emerge: theNHS,Brexit, alack of trustin politicians andmoney. We asked our participants to fill in a survey about themselves, their voting history - and what's stopping them from making up their minds. The answers below have been edited for clarity. Then it's over to our correspondents to tell us what the answers reveal about the voters in 2019 - and why so many of them are dissatisfied with the choice on offer. For many of our participants, such asRob,Kate,RachelandLeanne(left to right, below) the NHS and its future are among their top concerns. For Sutton Coldfield residentRob, 48, the NHS is by far the most important issue of the campaign. He's a regular at the gym, and credits his wife with keeping him and their son on a healthy diet. He voted Remain in 2016, and Labour at the last three elections. The NHS is ""a fantastic service that underpins who we are as a nation"", he says. ""It deserves every penny and more that it can get from the public purse."" Thirty-six-year-oldKatealso lives in Sutton Coldfield and is frustrated with the number of people who don't turn up for NHS appointments, when she has to wait days to get one. She voted solidly Conservative in the last three elections and Leave in 2016. ""I believe they should operate a three-strikes-and-out policy. If you miss three appointments without notification or a genuine reason (eg hospitalisation), you should be charged before a doctor will see you again."" Rachel, 49, worries about over-stretched GPs and mental health services, as well as the difficulty of retaining qualified staff. Her youngest son had to wait six hours to get his suspected fractured wrist looked at. Rachel, who lives in Cheshire and works as a teaching assistant, has voted Lib Dem (2017), Labour (2015) and Conservative (2010). She didn't vote in the 2016 referendum. ""What we do not want is an American-style system,"" she says. Self-described ""fitness fanatic""Leanne, 34, is suspicious of claims that the NHS will be privatised or sold to the Americans. She voted Leave in 2016 and Conservative in 2010, 2015 and 2017. She says friends and family who work for the NHS are under enormous pressure. ""How will our NHS be managed from now on to ensure that our population is cared for correctly?"" she wants to know. The NHS has undoubtedly been one of the key issues of the election. That should come as no surprise - Lord Lawson, a former Conservative chancellor, perhaps best summed it up when he said the NHS was the ""closest thing the English people have to a religion"". The parties have tried to outdo each other with their attempts to be seen as the party of the NHS, promising extra funding, increases in staff and more money for buildings. But while the budget has been increasing over the past decade, it has not gone up fast enough to cope with demand. It has meant longer waiting times for all sorts of treatment. The NHS has also been dragged into the Brexit debate, with Labour saying it is at risk from a post-Brexit US trade deal - something the Tories deny. The US pharmaceutical industry would certainly want the NHS to pay more for drugs, but this will undoubtedly be strongly resisted. Still undecided? More background here: 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS What do parties' NHS promises really mean? NHS claims fact-checked Most of our undecideds want certainty above all. More than three years on from the referendum, the likes ofMark,Chioma,ClaireandLeslie(left to right, below) don't understand why Brexit hasn't been resolved, one way or the other. Mark, 52, owns a small childcare company in London and has two teenage children with his wife, who recently recovered from cancer. She was treated on the NHS, although she has private health insurance. For Mark, a Leave voter, Brexit is the most important issue. ""Who is going to get Brexit done so that the country can move on and business conditions can return to some semblance of normality?"" he asks. Trade, immigration, the NHS: all will be affected by Brexit, saysChioma,37, a committed Christian originally from Nigeria, now living in Scotland. For that reason, she sees it as the most important issue facing the country. She voted Conservative in 2017 but Labour in 2015 and 2010. She didn't vote in the referendum. ""How soon can Brexit be decided?"" she asks. ""So we can know what we have to work with."" Clairelives in London and teaches adults with learning disabilities. She worries about knife crime and acid attacks in her local area. Claire, who voted Remain in 2016 and Labour in two of the last three elections, thinks Brexit will be ""a disaster"" for the country and wants another referendum. ""I'm worried it's going to be a one-issue election and [I'm] scared that could be very bad for the country. At the same time I think the Brexit question is already damaging Britain and is urgent."" Cheshire-born and bred,Leslie, 64, voted UKIP in 2017, Conservative before that, and Leave in 2016. He's not sure ""which of the main two parties are telling the truth"". He works as an engineer for an Italian company, but the owners haven't wanted to invest in the UK until Brexit is resolved. ""I would like the incoming government to move forward with this issue, then we could have the investment in staff needed,"" he says. He also worries about the impact of Brexit on the NHS and whether medical supplies will be protected. The trouble with Brexit is that all parties want to make the solutions sound simple, but it's actually a very complicated process. That's because leaving the EU would make huge changes to the way our whole economy operates - and loads of other issues like security cooperation and sharing data with our nearest neighbours would need to be renegotiated as well. The Tories promise to get Brexit done but they haven't even started trade talks. Labour says it will renegotiate a better deal and hold another referendum, but it's not clear whether it wants to leave or remain. And the Liberal Democrats' manifesto proposed stopping Brexit altogether, in effect ignoring the result of the 2016 referendum without giving anyone another say. The country has been divided quite sharply - and sometimes unpleasantly - by Brexit. The idea any party will be able to click their fingers and bring those divisions to a sudden end doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.  Whatever happens in this election, Brexit is going to be a long haul. Still undecided? More background here: How Remainers and Leavers plan to vote Brexit - where do the parties stand? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Another thread running through many of our participants' answers is trust - or the lack of it. Just askMariam,Akeel,CliveandJames(left to right, below). Even if people like what the parties are saying, they don't believe the politicians will deliver. ""Why should I vote for you? What can you do to benefit peopleâ¦ and genuinely stick to your word?""Mariam, 24, from London has a challenge for the parties. She voted Conservative in the last two elections but didn't take part in the 2016 referendum. Mariam, who has a two-year-old daughter, is leaning towards voting Labour this time but questions the sincerity of the promises from all parties. Like Mariam,Akeelabstained in the 2016 referendum. He voted Labour in 2017 and Conservative in 2015. He's a truck driver, 38 years old, who lives in Birmingham and is concerned about the cost of living. He wants a contract with the politicians to hold them to account. ""If you can't do what you say you're going to do, what compensation do the public get?"" Clive, 62, worked in the mining industry and asbestos removal before retiring through ill health. He moved from Derbyshire to London, where he's now a volunteer working with homeless people and substance abusers. His view? ""Promise after promise from Labour or more of the same under the Tories"" - he considers the Lib Dems undemocratic and thinks no other parties have a chance. ""Who is the one that is believable? At the moment none of them are."" One possible outcome after 12 December is a hung parliament. If that's the case,James, 64 and from Glasgow, wants to know who the parties would work with. ""Don't treat us like little kids as if we know nothing and we need to believe every single word that comes out of their mouths,"" he fumes. He voted for the SNP in the last two elections and Remain in the referendum. He worries about what the future holds, especially the uncertainty over Brexit. Voters have always distrusted politicians but, at the start of this election campaign, a survey suggested just 14% of British adults believed they could trust them to tell the truth. That's a fall of five percentage points in a year, with politicians displacing advertising executives at the bottom of the truthfulness index. This rise in scepticism coincides with great volatility in UK politics, as the established parties tear themselves apart over Brexit. There have been 90 switches of allegiance by MPs in the past two years, a sign of how old tribalism is weakening. The Brexit divide has cut across traditional lines and that, I think, has added to voter uncertainty as to how individual politicians and indeed political parties will behave. The tone of politics has coarsened and the campaigns appear less bound by principles of honesty and integrity. Still undecided? More background here: Trust is the burning issue at this election Do people still vote according to class? Could undecided voters change the election? There's a lot of worry about public spending and how the parties will pay for their promises, but for many, such asBetty,Amelia,HumzaandGemma(left to right, below) financial concerns lie closer to home. Betty, who lives in Glasgow, has four children and five grandchildren. A Leave voter, she switched from Labour to the SNP in 2017, as she wanted Scotland's voice to be heard. She worries about the effect of austerity and Brexit on the economy. Her question to the candidates seeking her vote? ""What will you do to ensure that I will be able to pass on my family's inheritance that I have worked hard for?"" While Betty is retired, 18-year-oldAmeliais just starting out. She's a first-time voter who'd like another Brexit referendum so that she could vote to remain in the EU. She's preparing for A-levels and, after that, university. ""The large debt for tuition fees combined with maintenance loans will stick with me for a long proportion of my life,"" she says. Humza, 20, has finished his degree and is now eyeing the next stage: buying a property. He lives with his grandmother in south London and voted Labour in 2017. ""How are we going to tackle the issue of property prices to help people buy their first home for life security?"" he wants to know. Buying a house with her boyfriend was a major milestone forGemma, who owns a cleaning business in Nantwich. She voted Leave in 2016 and Liberal Democrat in the election the year before. She thinks the Conservatives are ""more for the wealthy than helping the working/lower class"" but worries about Labour's spending plans. The undecided voter can often be swayed by what politicians promise for the pound in your pocket. Average hourly wages, after accounting for the rising cost of living, are no higher than they were at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, and poverty is most likely to be found in working households. People have differing views on who to blame for that, but it does mean household budgets are at the front of many voters' minds. They might also consider the effect this has had on different generations. Put simply, the old have fared better than the young. All the parties confront this issue in part, particularly targeting young first-time buyers who feel they have been locked out of the property market. There are promises too for a more generous minimum wage, and plans on who to tax or not. But universal benefits for pensioners and the ""triple-lock"" state pension guarantee are untouched. Ultimately, management of the UK economy will have the greatest effect on jobs, wages, and financial prospects. There are fundamental differences between the parties on how to approach this task. The trouble is, economists at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies say the spending plans of the biggest two - Labour and the Conservatives - are""not credible"". Still undecided?
