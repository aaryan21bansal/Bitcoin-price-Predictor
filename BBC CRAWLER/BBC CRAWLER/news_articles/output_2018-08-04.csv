Venezuela leader 'survives drone attack',"This video can not be played Footage showed dozens of soldiers running away before the transmission was cut off Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says he has survived an assassination attempt involving explosive drones. Mr Maduro was speaking at a military event in Caracas when the alleged attack occurred. Live footage of his speech shows the president suddenly looking upwards - startled - and dozens of soldiers running away. Mr Maduro has blamed Colombia for the attack - something denied by Bogota as a ""baseless"" accusation. Seven soldiers were injured, and several people were later arrested, the Venezuelan authorities said. The incident happened when Mr Maduro was speaking at an event to mark the 81st anniversary of the national army. President Maduro (centre) and his wife Cilia Flores (left) react to a loud bang during the military event Two drones loaded with explosives went off near the president's stand, Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez said. Mr Maduro later said in a national address: ""A flying object exploded near me, a big explosion. Seconds later there was a second explosion."" Photos on social media showed bodyguards protecting Mr Maduro with bulletproof shields after the alleged attack. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Maduro accused neighbouring Colombia and elements within the US of instigating ""a right-wing plot"" to kill him. He added that he had ""no doubt"" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was ""behind this attack"". The Venezuelan leader, who has previously accused the US of plotting against him, provided no evidence to back his claim. The Colombian government has denied any involvement, saying there is ""no basis"" to Mr Maduro's allegations. Charred windows were seen near the place where President Maduro was speaking By contrast, Mr Rodriguez accused Venezuela's right-wing opposition of carrying out the attack. ""After losing the vote, they failed again,"" Mr Rodriguez said. He was referring to May's presidential elections, where Mr Maduro was re-elected for another six-year term. Maduro wins second term amid claims of vote rigging However, Hasler Inglesias, a youth leader with the opposition Voluntad Popular Party, told the BBC: ""We didn't know what was happening. It's hard to believe that the opposition is going to make an attempt when they have never made an attempt in this way in 20 years."" Meanwhile, a little-known group called Soldiers in T-shirts said on social media that it was behind the alleged attack. It said it had planned to fly two explosives-laden drones at Mr Maduro, but they were shot down by the military. The claim was not backed up by any evidence, and the group did not respond to media requests for comment. Soldiers sealed off the area after the alleged attack To add further to the confusion, firefighters at the scene disputed the government's version of events, the Associated Press reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity, three of them said the incident was actually a gas tank explosion inside an apartment, but did not provide further details, the news agency says. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent There are still lots of unanswered questions in this, the latest plot twist in surreal Venezuela. President Maduro and his people often accuse the opposition, Colombia or the US of trying to sabotage his government. Much like last year when a helicopter attacked the Supreme Court in what NicolÃ¡s Maduro called a ""terrorist"" attack, conspiracy theories will abound - and already different versions of events are being circulated. In a country where it's hard to operate as a journalist and where freedom of speech isn't respected, getting to the truth is hard. What many people fear though is that the government will use this incident to justify a crackdown on any political opponents. In June 2017, a helicopter attacked and dropped grenades on Venezuela's Supreme Court. This video can not be played Helicopter circles Caracas buildings before bang and sustained gunshots are heard Oscar PÃ©rez, a rogue elite helicopter pilot, claimed he carried out the helicopter attack and called on Venezuelans to rise up against the government of President Maduro. He was killed by police in a siegenear Caracas in January. Mr Maduro has managed to split opinion almost as much as his predecessor in office, Hugo ChÃ¡vez. Since assuming office in 2013, Mr Maduro's administration has drawn widespread condemnation from a string of nations worldwide for undermining democracy and violating human rights in his country. NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion How Venezuela's crisis developed and worsened His opponents paint him as a ruthless despot who detains his political rivals on overly harsh charges pressed by a judiciary under his party's control, while his followers say he is protecting the country from another coup. His re-election in May came amid a deep economic crisis which has been driving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans from the oil-rich country. However, there is still a loyal core of people who support Mr Maduro and his United Socialist Party (PSUV), saying Venezuela's problems are caused not by the government but by imperialist forces such as the US.

Venezuela crisis: How did we get here?,"Many Venezuelans want to see President Maduro gone from power but he remains in the presidential palace In Venezuela, the government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and the opposition are engaged in a bitter power struggle. The South American country has been caught in a downward spiral for years with growing political discontent further fuelled by skyrocketing hyperinflation, power cuts, and shortages of food and medicine. More than 5.6 million Venezuelans have left the country in recent years. So what exactly is behind the crisis rocking Venezuela? This would be an unusual question to ask in most countries, but in Venezuela many want to know exactly that after opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself acting president on 23 January 2019. Some countries say NicolÃ¡s Maduro (L) is the legitimate president while others are backing Juan GuaidÃ³ The move was a direct challenge to the power of President Maduro, who had been sworn in to a second six-year term in office just two weeks previously. Not surprisingly, President Maduro did not take kindly to his rival's move, which he condemned as a ploy by the US to oust him. He also said that he was the constitutional president and would remain so. Despite attempts by Mr GuaidÃ³ to get the military to switch their allegiance to him, the armed forces have remained largely loyal to President Maduro, whose socialist party has also got a firm grip on the electoral body and the supreme court. NicolÃ¡s Maduro was first elected in April 2013after the death of his socialist mentor and predecessor in office, Hugo ChÃ¡vez. At the time, he won by just 1.6 percentage points. During his first term, the economy went into freefall and many Venezuelans blame him and his socialist government for the country's decline. NicolÃ¡s Maduro was elected in 2013, after his mentor Hugo ChÃ¡vez died Mr Maduro was re-elected to a second six-year term in May 2018in highly controversial polls, which most opposition parties boycotted. Many candidates had been barred from running while others had been jailed or fled the country for fear of being imprisoned, and the opposition parties argued that the poll was neither free nor fair. Mr Maduro's re-election was not recognised by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which labelled Mr Maduro a ""usurper"" and argued that the presidency was vacant. Citing articles in the constitution which in such cases call for the leader of the National Assembly to step in, Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself acting president. More than 50 countries recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as the legitimate president, among them the US and many nations in Latin America. But Russia and China, among others, stood by President Maduro. Despite his broad international support, Mr GuaidÃ³ does not wield much power in practical terms. Juan GuaidÃ³ has been trying to dislodge Mr Maduro from power but the latter remains in the presidential palace The security forces have so far remained loyal to Mr Maduro, who has rewarded them with frequent pay rises and put high-ranking military men in control of key posts and industries. Mr Maduro remains in the presidential palace and some Venezuelans have become disillusioned by the failure of Mr GuaidÃ³ to dislodge his rival from power. Mr Maduro has the military on his side and has also got the support of the Bolivarian militia Talks between the government and the opposition held in 2019 made no progress. The US has imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela and on Mr Maduro and his inner circle but they have failed to weaken Mr Maduro enough to drive him from office. Some analysts argue that they offer the Maduro government a convenient scapegoat to blame for the dire state of the economy. Some of the problems go back a long time. However, it is President Maduro and his predecessor Hugo ChÃ¡vez who are the target of much of the current anger. Before the coronavirus pandemic, there were large anti-Maduro protests When Mr ChÃ¡vez became president in 1999, he promised, among other things, to drive down Venezuela's huge levels of inequality. While he managed to reduce inequality during his time in power, some of the socialist polices he brought in backfired. Take price controls, for example, which were aimed at making basic goods more affordable to the poor by capping the price of flour, cooking oil and toiletries. The controls meant that many Venezuelan businesses stopped production because they no longer made a profit, eventually resulting in shortages. A loosening of foreign currency controls originally brought in by President ChÃ¡vez in 2003 has eased those shortages as traders can sell goods in dollars but that means they have again become largely unaffordable to the poor or those without access to the US currency. Even street vendors have resorted to using US dollars Years of lack of investment in infrastructure further exacerbated by the more recent US sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector have crippled this key industry, which provides almost all of Venezuela's government revenue. Venezuela has been in the grip of an economic crisis for years now with hyperinflation one of the main problems. Business news website Bloomberg has been tracking the price of a cup of coffee in the Venezuelan capital,external, Caracas, to show how prices have increased. It has measured an increase of 2,597% in the 12 months to 1 August 2021 with a cup of coffee costing 7.8 million bolivares. According to figures compiled by the United Nations, more than 5.6 million Venezuelans have left the country since the crisis started to bite in 2014. The 'brutal' migrant route made tougher by pandemic The government has disputed the figures, saying they are inflated by ""enemy countries"".

The majority of those leaving have crossed into neighbouring Colombia, from where some move on to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Others have gone south to Brazil.

Donald Campbell's Bluebird returns to water,"The Bluebird was recovered from the bottom of Coniston Water in 2001 and has been rebuilt Donald Campbell's Bluebird has been launched in front of cheering crowds for the first time in over 50 years. The record-breaking hydroplane was floated as part of tests being carried out on Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute. It has been rebuilt after being recovered from the bottom of Coniston Water in 2001, following Campbell's fatal crash in 1967. The 45-year-old died trying to break his own water speed record when the Bluebird K7 flipped and crashed. A group of volunteers from Tyneside are testing the iconic craft to see if it is watertight and whether it can withstand a buffeting from the waves. Bluebird flipped as it travelled at more than 300mph Engineer Bill Smith has led the restoration project after salvaging the craft Donald Campbell had been travelling at speeds of more than 300mph to break his own 276mph record when the Bluebird K7 partially disintegrated. Lead engineer Bill Smith, said it had been a ""labour of love"" to put the hydroplane back on water. ""This project is 22 years old this year. ""We've been 15 years in the rebuild - five years to strip down, catalogue and clean, and ten years since we set the first rivet to bring her back to this condition. ""This is a fully working machine, completely original. This is the vehicle that Donald Campbell drove. The craft will stay on the island for the next few weeks An attempt to refloat the craft earlier in the afternoon stalled when it became snagged on the beach of the loch. Daughter marks Bluebird crash 50 years on Campbell's Bluebird roars back to life However, the team said they were determined to launch it in the near perfect conditions on the Isle of Bute. Mr Smith said the Bluebird had been made to operate on the ""flat calm"". Tim Walsh, who is the project's lead pilot, added: ""We are looking to assess how it copes with the water, are there any leaks and what challenge is there from different sizes of waves."" The craft is set to undergo a battery of tests on Loch Fad over the coming weeks before it returns to Coniston next year, where it is expected to run at speed. Campbell was born on 23 March 1921 in Surrey and was the son of speed record breaker Sir Malcolm Campbell He initially used his father's old boat Bluebird K4 in record-breaking attempts In 1960 he survived a horrific crash in the US while trying to break the land speed record The Bluebird K7 boat was already 12 years old at the time of the Coniston Water crash He set eight world speed records - seven on water and one on land Campbell's lucky mascot - a 9ins ""Mr Whoppit"" bear from 1956 - was recovered after the crash Campbell's Bluebird set for Scotland run Daughter marks Bluebird crash 50 years on Campbell's Bluebird roars back to life Museum move for Campbell's Bluebird Unseen Campbell speed film restored.

US nuclear stance alarming - N Korea,"The two men appeared friendly at a summit but North Korea has some strong words for the US North Korea's foreign minister has called US actions ""alarming"" as tensions over the North's nuclear programme again flared. Ri Yong-ho was responding to comments by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who urged other countries to keep up sanctions pressure on Pyongyang. A landmark summit between the two sides in Singapore in June saw the North agree to work towards denuclearisation. But details remain vague andthe UN says its nuclear programme continues. At a regional forum, also in Singapore, Mr Pompeo said it was important to maintain ""diplomatic and economic pressure"" on North Korea to achieve ""the final, fully verified denuclearisation"". Trump-Kim summit: Why did they meet? Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Timeline: Missile and nuclear activity,external Pyongyang is currently under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests. Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said discussions about the North Korean nuclear programme at the Asean regional forum had been ""brutally frank"" but there was some good news. ""People acknowledge that there has been some progress and that the summit in Singapore did change the tone of the conversation and hopefully will help set the stage for a peaceful resolution of the outstanding issues,"" he told AFP news agency. North Korea carried out a series of long-range missile tests in 2017 Mr Pompeo said he expected all nations to abide by sanctions, singling out Russia amid reports that it had potentially violated them by allowing thousands of North Korean labourers into the country. Russia has denied this. In response, Mr Ri said that North Korea ""stands firm"" in its commitment made at the June summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He added: ""What is alarming, however, is the insistent moves manifested within the US to go back to the old, far from its leader's intention."" Mr Ri and Mr Pompeo only met face-to-face briefly, exchanging smiles, handshakes and a few brief words. Also at Saturday's meeting, the US delegation delivered a letter from Mr Trump for Mr Kim. It is unclear what it contained. Mr Trump and Mr Kim made a commitment to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but it is still unclear how this could be achieved. This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? The commitment was included in a one-page agreement at the end of the summit aimed at reducing regional tensions. Aside from the written agreement, the US president also announced that joint military exercises with South Korea, which he described as ""provocative"", would end. Amid a tentative warming of relations since June,North Korea appears to have begun dismantling part of a key rocket launch site in the north-west, in compliance with a promise by Mr Kim to destroy an engine test site. And at the end of July,the North returned to the US remains believed to be of 55 US troopskilled during the Korean War, as agreed at the summit. The satellite imagery appears to show the dismantling of facilities at North Korea's Sohae site Butreports last month based on US intelligence leaks suggest Pyongyang is still upgrading its uranium enrichment sites. The reports are seen as undermining the spirit of the summit and casting doubt on the North's sincerity. Then last week,unnamed US officials said that Pyongyang appeared to be building new ballistic missilesafter spy satellites spotted continuing activity at one site. A UN Security Council-commissioned report on Friday said North Korea was continuing its nuclear and missile programmes,violating UN sanctions. It was increasing illegal ship-to-ship transfers of oil products and trying to sell weapons abroad, it said. The handshake moment explained in pictures Is Kim sticking with his nukes?

Russia detains several LGBT activists,"Police arrested those who unfurled rainbow banners or held placards Russian police have detained at least 25 LGBT rights activists during a protest in St Petersburg to promote the rights of sexual minorities. About 60 activists gathered at the main square in the city centre, despite a ban being placed on the rally. They held up placards and rainbow-coloured flags, and called for LGBT rights to be protected. In 2013, Russia passed legislation banning the spreading of what it described as gay propaganda. Smuggling the Pride flag into Russia This bus for gay pro footballers is empty The LGBT prom for people who missed out Organisers of Saturday's rally said that each demonstrator had protested alone, to avoid the rally being classified as a gathering. There were no clashes between Russian police and the activists, but those holding up protest materials were pulled into a police van against their will. Demonstrators were taken to a police station The demonstration's co-organiser Aleksei Nazarov told the AFP news agency that police had targeted demonstrators who had the ""most colourful flags and clothes"". Demonstrators at the rally told the Reuters they were there to show solidarity with the community. ""This topic is silenced in the mass media. These [gay] people exist, the authorities should work with them somehow and we should search for dialogue,"" one protester, Mikhail, said.

Two-thirds of plastic food pots unrecyclable,"Most of the plastic food containers that householders use are not recycled, it has emerged. Areport,externalfrom the charity Recoup shows that only a third of yoghurt pots, ready meal trays and other containers were collected for recycling in 2016-17, with the rest sent to landfill. The Local Government Association, which contributed to the research, has warned that the mixture of plastics used in these containers limited the ability of councils to recycle them. Up to 80% of packaging could be made more recyclable, the industry said. The British Plastics Federation said companies are working to use more recyclable containers and called for a financial incentive for manufacturers to use more recyclable plastics. This video can not be played Keith Freegard, from the recycling group at the British Plastics Federation says packaging manufacturers need an incentive. According to Recoup's figures, around 525,000 tonnes of plastic pots, tubs and trays are used by households in the UK every year, but only 169,000 tonnes of this waste is collected for recycling. It blames producers for using a mix of polymers, some of them poor quality. The LGA, which represents councils in England and Wales, blames producers for using a mix of polymers, some of them poor quality, and says the government should consider a ban on low-grade plastics. The LGA says simple tweaks could make a massive difference, highlighting the case of microwave meals which are often supplied in black plastic material. Black is the only colour that can't be easily scanned by recycling machines, meaning that process becomes unnecessarily complicated. The woman who found a new threat in plastic Lack of farm recycling sites 'ridiculous' Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Chile bans supermarket plastic bags Changing the colour of these items would significantly increase the amount that could be used again. ""It's almost criminal to think that some of the plastics being used are difficult to recycle, and black plastic is almost impossible to recycle,"" Cllr Peter Fleming from the LGA told BBC News. Microwave meal containers are often made from black plastic making it hard for scanners to recognise them ""The only reason we have black plastic being used by manufacturers is that it makes the food look good."" When it comes to punnets of fruit and vegetables many are made from up to three different types of plastic, including polystyrene, which can't be recycled. Some readers have said they want more transparency from shops about what packaging is recyclable. Sally Warburton from Guernsey said she wants to buy sustainable items, ""but it's a minefield and it sickens me that manufacturers are not being held to account"". Geraldine Fields said consumers ""should be told exactly what plastic containers are able to be recycled and what can't"". She added: ""I would like to see this information on the packaging so I can choose what products I buy based on their ability to be recycled."" Will this information change your shopping habits? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The LGA wants plastics manufacturers to work with councils to prevent materials that limit recycling entering the system in the first place. And ""if industry won't help us get there, then the government should step in to help councils"", said Cllr Judith Blake, who is the LGA environment spokesperson. As well as calling for a ban, the LGA is looking to the government to make plastics manufacturers pay for the costs of collecting and disposing of plastics that can't be recycled. ""Either they can make the change at the front end so their products are easier to recycle,"" said Cllr Fleming, ""or they can start to help pay for the disposal."" Find out more about plastics pollution and how people are cutting down Keith Freegard, from the recycling group at the British Plastics Federation - the leading association for the whole of the plastics industry - said designers often use the colour black for packs to indicate they are a more ""top of the range product"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""Unfortunately those designers didn't realise that when those packs arrived in the recycling factory after it had been separated by consumers, the black dye is not able to be seen by the sorting scanners in the recycling plant - so that does need to change."" He added: ""At the moment there's no fiscal or monetary system in the UK that makes designers go for the really good-to-recycle designs and those who make packs which are less easy to recycle, they should be paying more money into the system."" Simon Ellin, the head of the Recycling Association, said manufacturers do have a ""big responsibility"" and ""have got away with it for too many years"", but added that ""local authorities need to take responsibility as well"". ""We have nearly 350 different collection systems up and down the country,"" he said. ""There's widespread confusion, the public don't know how to use it, it's underfunded and it's the proverbial dog's dinner, to be honest."" Margarine and ice cream tubs:Often contain the polymer polypropylene which is very difficult to recycle. An alternative approach would be to make them from the same plastic as water bottles which is easily recycled. Microwave and meat packaging:The materials can be recycled but need to be sorted via an optical scanner first. However, as they are predominantly black this makes the process difficult. A simple change of colour could lead to a real increase in recycling. Fruit and vegetable punnets:A complicated construction often sees three different polymers used. Simpler designs and more use of recyclable materials could make a big difference. Yoghurt pots:Often made from a mixture of polypropylene and polystyrene, which can be hard to recycle. An alternative is to use polyethylene terephthalate, which is also used in plastic bottles and can be easily recycled. Baked goods trays:The lining on these trays for cakes and baked goods is often made from difficult to recycle materials. Other options are available which could boost recycling numbers. Dr Dominic Hogg, the chairman of waste management consultancy firm Eunomia, estimated the cost of dealing with packaging at the household level at around Â£1bn a year. ""The system we have at the moment, essentially the producers are covering probably something around Â£10-20 million of that cost,"" he said - adding that in some European countries, manufacturers would fund the entire amount. In a statement - which supermarkets Asda and Sainsbury's referred to as their response to the LGA - the British Retail Consortium said retailers were ""investing heavily"" to find alternatives. The Recoup report comes aftera study from the National Audit Officethat suggests half the packaging reported as recycled is actually being sent abroad to be processed.

"Melania backs NBA star after Trump insultsThe US first lady says Lebron James is doing ""good things"", hours after her husband insulted him.US & Canada","US First Lady Melania Trump has backed basketball player LeBron James, hours after her husband made insulting remarks about him on Twitter. James had said in an interview that Mr Trump was divisive and had emboldened racists. In response, Mr Trump questioned James' intelligence, saying it was not easy to make the NBA player ""look smart"". However, Mrs Trump's spokeswoman said James was ""working to do good things"" with a school in his Ohio hometown. She said Mrs Trump wanted ""to have an open dialogue about issues facing children"". Earlier this week, James told CNN during an interview with Don Lemon that sport had offered him the opportunity to meet people of different backgrounds and race. ""Sports has never been something that divides people. It's always been something that brings someone together,"" he said. ""He [Mr Trump] is dividing us and what I noticed over the last few months is that he's kinda used sport to divide us and that's something I can't relate to, because I know that sport was the first time I was ever around someone white."" He also argued that Mr Trump's actions had encouraged racists, saying: ""I think [racism's] always been there. But I think the president in charge now has given people - they don't care now, they throw it to your face."" On Saturday, the president responded on Twitter by saying: ""Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. ""He made Lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do.""

Bangladesh teens attacked during protest,"The students are demanding improved road safety and stricter enforcement of traffic laws About 25 students have been injured in clashes in Bangladesh's capital on the seventh day of a youth protest about road safety, reports say. Thousands of pupils have been out on Dhaka's roads stopping traffic and checking vehicles and drivers. It is not clear who attacked them but local media blamed a student group linked to the ruling party. Theprotesters want improved road safetyafter a boy and girl were killed by a speeding bus last Sunday. The government has blocked mobile internet access for 24 hours in response to the protests. Transport workers have in recent days staged their own strike, while the government has urged students to return to their classrooms. A government minister previously accused the students of hypocrisy, sparking further uproar. He later apologised. Unconfirmed reports say the protesters were attacked by pro-government students Reports said police used tear gas and rubber bullets as they tried to control the crowds on Saturday, though police denied this. A doctor and witnesses quoted by AFP news agency said the number of injured was much higher, at more than 100. Doctor Abdus Shabbir told the agency a few of the injured were ""in a very bad condition"" and some had rubber bullet injuries. Students chant slogans during the demonstration Local journalists told the BBC they were among those beaten up by members of the Bangladesh Chhatra League, a student organisation currently linked to the ruling Awami League and opposed to the protests. The journalists reported having their camera equipment destroyed. Bangladesh profile Amid reports of sexual assaults in the streets, a female reporter alleged on social media that she had been ""molested"" while trying to film the clashes. Chanting ""We want justice"", students have been calling for stricter enforcement of traffic laws, and have blocked major intersections in the capital for seven consecutive days. The students said they would not leave the roads until their demands were met ""We won't leave the roads until our demands are met. We want safe roads and safe drivers,"" said protester Al Miran to AFP news agency.

Ai Weiwei's Beijing studio demolished,"This video can not be played 'They said they would come and smash our windows' The dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei says the authorities in Beijing have demolished his studio there. In a series of clips on Instagram showing the former factory being torn down, Ai said that he had been given no notice of the decision. Another of his studios in Shanghai was destroyed in 2011. He also said at that time he had received no warning. The 60-year-old has lived in Germany since leaving China in 2015. He is a strong critic of China's government. On Instagram Ai said ""farewell"" to the space, which he had used since 2006. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

A small group of protesters criticised sponsor British Airways for its co-operation over government-ordered deportations. The firm said it was bound by law to deport people when asked to do so by the government. The airline had a float in the parade featuring someone dressed in an air hostess outfit in tribute to Britney's Toxic music video. Their arrival was also met with cheers from the crowd.

The pills, in a shape similar to the the logo of the children's lollipops, have been linked to a number of recent deaths, according to the city's drugs and alcohol service Pavilions. Police urged revellers to act responsibly, follow safety advice and report any suspicious behaviour. Ch Supt Neil Honnor said armed officers would be working in the city during the parade with ""public safety the main priority"". ""The weekend weather is due to be very hot and sunny so we would also like to remind people to stay hydrated and wear sun cream,"" he added. The parade began at Hove Lawns and worked its way along the seafront The theme for this year's event is ""Colour My World"" The BA protest came after activist groupLesbians and Gays Support the Migrants wrote an open letter to the Guardian newspaper on Friday,external, to call for the airline to ""stop being complicit"" in working with the government on deportations The open letter was signed by MPs and other public figures.

Sickness closes Severn Bridge westbound,"An ""unprecedented"" level of staff sickness led to the closure of the M48 Severn Bridge westbound. Tollbooths on the bridge were shut in order to protect the safety of staff and drivers, Highways England said. Motorists had been advised to travel via the second Severn crossing, now known as the Prince of Wales Bridge, instead. All westbound lanes were shut, between junctions one and two, from 05:00 BST before being reopened at 14:10 BST. Earlier, a spokeswoman for Highways England said: ""This is an unprecedented level of staff sickness. ""If we haven't got staff members in crucial roles on the toll plaza it is not safe for our team or the drivers so we have taken the decision to close the tolls. ""We are telling motorists to use the other bridge. ""Staff have been diverted to the second Severn crossing to assist staff there and keep traffic flowing."" The closure affected the stretch of motorway which links Chepstow in Monmouthshire and Aust in South Gloucestershire. It remained open in the eastbound direction, which is not controlled by tolls. The Grade I-listed bridge, which origÂ­iÂ­nally formed part of the M4 until the SecÂ­ond SevÂ­ern CrossÂ­ing opened in 1996, carries about 17,000 vehicles per day. Allow Twitter content?

Child chess prodigy in plea to stay in UK,"Shreyas Royal has competed in European and world championship tournaments The family of a nine-year-old chess prodigy from India who have been told they must leave the UK are calling on the government to let them stay. Shreyas Royal has been dubbed Britain's ""greatest chess prospect in a generation"" and is ranked number four in the world in his age group. But his father's visa will expire next month and the family, who came to the UK six years ago, must return to India. The Home Office said it assessed every case on its own merits. Shreyas was born in India but has lived in south London since the age of three when his father, Jitendra Singh, was offered a job as an IT project manager. Shreyas learnt to play the game in Britain and has since represented England internationally. He is currently competing in the British Chess Championships, which could be his last UK tournament. Shreyas learned to play chess in the UK Mr Singh, whose five-year work visa is due to expire next month, is calling on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to let the family stay. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We just want to request that you can give chance to my son whose talent developed here in England. ""The support and recognition that he's getting in England, I'm sure he will not get it in India."" Immigration rules would allow Mr Singh's visa to be extended if he earned Â£120,000 a year, but he does not. Two MPs have backed Shreyas' case. In a joint letter to the home secretary, Leeds West MP Rachel Reeves and Greenwich and Woolwich MP Matthew Pennycook said the UK would lose an ""exceptional talent"" if Shreyas was to leave. ""The UK should always encourage the world's brightest, most talented people to work and make their lives here,"" they wrote. ""Shreyas is recognised by the English Chess Federation as the country's greatest chess prospect in a generation."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Portugal battles blazes as Europe bakes,"The Algarve fire has been spreading through dense undergrowth More than 700 firefighters are battling a major wildfire in southern Portugal's Algarve region, as parts of Europe continue to swelter. Temperatures reached 46C (115F) in places, close to Portugal's national record of 47.4C (117.3F). Soaring temperatures continued in Spain, where three deaths by heatstroke were reported. A continent-wide heatwave in recent weeks has seen drought and wildfires from Greece to Sweden. Temperatures above 40C in Spain and Portugal are expected to continue at least until Sunday. The side effects of the European heatwave In pictures: Europe heatwave Portugal's Civil Protection Agency has been sending mobile text alerts warning of extreme fire risk in some areas, as they seek to avert casualties. Dozens of people were killed in two major forest fires last year. Friday saw local all-time record temperatures at almost half the country's weather stations. Temperatures in parts of Portugal have topped 40C A major fire broke out on Friday in Monchique, in Algarve, consuming more than 1,000 hectares of forest and forcing evacuations from one village. On Saturday the fire was boosted by 46C temperatures with ""a real feel of 50C"", rescue operations head Victor Vaz Pinto told local media. The fire has been spreading through eucalyptus forest and dense undergrowth, the Civil Protection Agency says. Ten water-dropping planes have been assisting the firefighters. Meanwhile in Spain, media reports said two people died of heatstroke in the southeastern Murcia region, while a third - believed to be homeless - died in Barcelona.

Vulnerable children facing 'catastrophe'The Children's Commissioner for England warns families cannot get help because of council funding shortfalls.Northampton,"Anne Longfield said she heard from families every day who could not get the help they needed Vulnerable children cannot get help from some cash-strapped councils, the Children's Commissioner for England has warned. Anne Longfield said she feared thefinancial crisis at Northamptonshire County Councilwould have ""catastrophic consequences"" for some children. Both Northamptonshire andEast Sussex councils are planning major service cutsdue to funding shortfalls. Ms Longfield wants the government to protect children from any council cuts. The Department for Education said it was working across government to ensure Tory-run Northamptonshire County Council met its legal duties to children despite its troubled finances. Earlier this week, the authority outlined a ""radical"" Â£70m savings plan, which did not rule out cuts to children's services. On Friday, the Conservative-led East Sussex County Council also put forward proposals to strip back services to a legal minimum. Ms Longfield said she was particularly worried that the situation in Northamptonshire meant it would not protect ""services for the most vulnerable children, which could have catastrophic consequences"". The number of children in England living in families with high needs such as ""severe mental health problems or domestic violence in the home"" who were going without ""substantial help"" numbered about 1.5 million, she said. Northamptonshire County Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss funding cuts Speaking toBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Longfield said the scale of the problem in England was highlighted by work carried out with the Institute for Fiscal Studies which showed ""half of all the spending on children's services goes on the 70,000 children who are in care"". The commissioner warned: ""If you add in those who are on the child protection registers, that's over 80%, leaving very, very little for any others. ""Councils have been warning for some time that they are not going to be able to meet their statutory requirements. ""I can see and hear every day from families and children who simply can't get help."" She continued: ""If you don't help children when the problems aren't at crisis point then the crisis is going to be developing and also it is going to be much more costly when it gets to that point."" Ms Longfield added that money in the system had remained the same for 10 years but was now being spent on ""fewer children who are costing more"", with the Local Government Association warning of a Â£2bn ""black hole"". However, Tory MP Chris Philp, ministerial aide to Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, said councils were getting more money. ""We have had to save money as a country because we had an enormous deficit eight or nine years ago,"" he said. ""But one of the areas that local councils across the country have quite rightly protected are children's services. ""The National Audit Office reported in March that real terms spending on children's services has gone up by about 3%."" Over the next two financial years ""the spending power that local authorities have in real terms is going to go up by about Â£2bn"", he added. East Sussex County Council has said it may only be able to offer services it is legally obliged to provide Labour's Shadow Local Government and Communities Secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said it was a ""national scandal that vulnerable children"" were being penalised for ""Tory austerity"". ""Austerity has hit some of the most vulnerable in our society the hardest,"" he said. ""Many local councils are doing all they can, but unprecedented funding cuts have made it impossible to continue delivering services that many depend on."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Nothing is more important than ensuring children are kept safe.

Is Kim sticking with his nukes?,"Reports that North Korea is continuing its weapons programme, despite pledges to denuclearise, have cast doubt on its sincerity in peace talks. The recent reports, based on US intelligence leaks, suggest the country is still upgrading its nuclear enrichment sites, among other activities. So what's actually going on? Here's what has been reported across US media: North Korea's only official nuclear enrichment site at Yongbyon is being upgraded. The country is stepping up enrichment at two or more secret sites besides Yongbyon. Pyongyang continues to produce more mobile launch vehicles for its ballistic missiles. It has also expanded missile production of solid fuel engines which are more mobile and easier to launch. How reliable are these reports? They are ""only"" reports but they are deemed accurate by respected North Korea watchers. The information is based on multiple unnamed sources from the US intelligence community as well as the38 North study of satellite images of the Yongbyon site,external. Allow Twitter content?

""None of that activity is in violation of any agreements made at the Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,"" explains Vipin Narang, MIT professor for political science and specialist on nuclear proliferation. In the declaration wrapping up that summit, Pyongyang merely agreed to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, something it sees as a phased process. Details of the process still remain to be worked out by the two sides. ""This was never going to be unilateral and immediate,"" says Mr Narang. ""So Kim Jong-un is free to continue operating the existing sites."" To trust or not to trust, that is the question Yet the reports that the North is continuing its nuclear activity is still seen as undermining the spirit of the summit and casts doubt on Pyongyang's sincerity to denuclearise. ""The bigger picture here is that North Korea's nuclear programme continues as directed by Kim Jong-un in his speech in January, where he urged the continued production of warheads and ballistic missiles,"" explains Ankit Panda, editor at The Diplomat magazine. What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? North Korean propaganda changes its tune N Korea still poses major threat - Trump Solid fuel engines are more mobile and hence a big step for Pyongyang. Together with the mobile launchers, it means that North Korea can fire missiles from sites that can be quickly set up and not be detected ahead of time by South Korea or the US. Yet the biggest revelation has been the details about North Korea's secret enrichment sites. So far, Pyongyang has only ever admitted to one enrichment site: Yongbyon. Solid fuel and mobile launchers would be a major step for Pyongyang It's been a longstanding suspicion though that there are more, secret sites. An exclusive NBC report based on US intelligence sources confirmed and named one such site and says there is at least one more secret enrichment site. ""You can imagine a North Korean strategy where - without a full disclosure of all their facilities - they can offer to shut down some of the known sites in order to get sanctions relief,"" explains Mr Narang. ""At the same time they would clandestinely push ahead at the secret sites."" A sacred mountain and other ideologies On board the train to Korea's music festival for peace Inside the North Korean place that âdoesnât existâ The information coming from the US intelligence sources is presumably something they have known for quite some time. Mr Trump is likely to have been briefed about that very information in the run-up to the Singapore summit. So why is it now being leaked to the media? ""The sheer number of leaks on nuclear activity makes it look like an authorised attempt to get that intel out into the public sphere,"" says Andray Abrahamian of the Griffith Asia Institute. Experts believe there are two reasons why the US intelligence community might have chosen to disclose its information at this point in time. Scenario one would be ""to counter the narrative coming from the White House that it's 'mission accomplished' and that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat,"" explains Mr Narang. It may therefore ""constrain Trump a bit so he can't claim successes that have not yet be reached"", agrees Mr Abrahamian. ""It gets the foreign policy community riled up and increases pressure on Trump not to be soft on the [North] Koreans."" The other scenario would be that it's in fact co-ordinated by the Trump administration to generate leverage. By revealing the extent of US intel, Washington can put pressure on North Korea to admit to its secret sites and operations. The leaked intel could be a way to say 'Mr Kim, we're watching you' ""The assumption was always that we would let the North Koreans disclose their own sites and check that against the list the US intelligence community maintains,"" explains Mr Panda. ""Immediately you would have a sense of whether or not the North Koreans are negotiating in good faith. ""Now that we have put out what we know about the covert enrichment sites, we can see if the North Koreans will choose to disclose those or not."" What remains is the bigger question of whether post-Singapore summit, this kind of pressure will really be able to steer Pyongyang into line. The flurry of recent reports of North Korea's continued nuclear and military efforts suggest the country is intent on maintaining its nuclear and ballistic capabilities and even to continuing to produce them. ""It could be that Pyongyang is calculating that no matter what, China is already off the maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against North Korea. And the US really can't sustain it without China,"" warns Mr Narang. ""Kim Jong-un might simply say 'I've done what I have to in order to break the maximum pressure campaign' - and I think he might be right."" On board Korea's peace train at the DMZ.

Finding a new threat in plastic,"Sarah-Jeanne Royer with some of the plastic she's studied It's your classic movie eureka moment. Young researcher Sarah-Jeanne Royer set out to measure methane gas coming from biological activity in sea water. Instead, in a ""happy accident"" she found that the plastic bottles holding the samples were a bigger source of this powerful warming molecule than the bugs in the water. Now she'spublished further details,externalin a study into the potential warming impact of gases seeping from plastic waste. 'Medical test led me to ocean plastic patch' Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution? Lack of farm recycling sites 'ridiculous' ""It was a totally unexpected discovery,"" Dr Royer told BBC News. ""Some members of the lab were experimenting with high density polyethylene bottles looking at methane biological production, but the concentrations were much higher than expected."" ""So we realised that the emissions were not just coming from the biology but from the bottle that we were using for the experiment."" After graduating from university in Barcelona, Dr Royer found herself in Hawaii, leading teams of volunteers who were helping to remove plastic from beaches at weekends, while working on the chemistry of the substance during the week. Now she's published her report after spending a year and a half testing different types of plastic in and out of seawater to see if they emit methane and ethylene, which both contribute to the greenhouse effect. Dr Royer found that the most widely-used plastic, the stuff used to make shopping bags, is the one that produces the greatest amount of these warming gases. At the end of the study, after 212 days in the sun, this plastic emitted 176 times more methane than at the start of the experiment. Ironically, when plastics were exposed to air the amount of methane emitted was double the level from sea water. In short it's the Sun. Solar radiation acts on the surface of plastic waste. As it breaks down, becomes cracked and pitted, these defects increase the surface area of plastic available to sunlight which accelerates gas production. Even in the dark, the gas continues to seep out. ""I'm in the field every week,"" said Dr Royer. Plastic waste washed up in a Hawaiian bay ""When I touch a piece of plastic, if there's a little impact on that plastic it's degrading into hundred of pieces pretty much as we look at it."" Up to now, the link between plastics and climate change was mainly focussed on the use of fossil fuels like oil and gas in the manufacture of plastic items. It's also known that when plastics degrade in the environment, they release CO2.  Experts have welcomed this report as it is the first time that anyone has tried to quantify other warming gases emerging from plastic waste. ""Low density polyethylene (LDPE) does emit ethylene, methane and propane, even at low temperatures that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions,"" Prof Ashwani Gupta from the University of Maryland, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News. ""It is nice to see some quantified emissions on greenhouse gases for the selected polyethylene. The results clearly show variation in gas emission levels among the different polyethylene sources."" While the amounts of methane and ethylene being produced right now from plastics are very small, Dr Royer is concerned about the future and the fact that as plastic breaks down, more surface area is exposed, increasing the amount of the gases that drifts into the atmosphere. ""If we look at all the plastic produced since 1950, it's pretty much all still on the planet, and it's just degrading into smaller and smaller pieces, so we know the industry is booming and in the next 30 years and more and more greenhouse gases will be produced - that's a big thing."" Nothing much at this point. According to Dr Royer, when she approached companies in the field, they weren't keen on talking about it. ""I told them I was a scientist and I was trying to understand the chemistry of the plastic,"" she said. ""I was trying to order some plastics of different densities and I was asking questions about the process and they all said we don't want to have contact with you anymore. ""I think the plastic industry absolutely knows, and they don't want this to be shared with the world."" ""Research on plastic waste is revealing it to be a disturbing pandora's box,"" said Dr Montserrat Filella, a chemist at the University of Geneva. ""As research expands our knowledge, we are realising that plastics can be insidious in many other ways. For instance, as vectors of 'hidden pollutants', such as heavy metals present in them or, now,  as a source of greenhouse gases.  And, in all cases, throughout the entire lifetime of the plastic."" Plastic debris from the tsunami in Japan is still causing problems in Hawaii Others agreed that further research was urgently needed. ""No one knows how much methane and ethylene are being released from these sources. We don't know if it is adding significant amounts of greenhouse gases to our atmosphere,"" said Dr Jennifer Lynch, a marine environment expert from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist). ""It's another consequence of the use of plastics and it needs further examination."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Recycling 'ends up in landfill',"Your yoghurt carton might be buried in landfill You try to be virtuous, wiping the curdling yoghurt off a plastic pot, then putting it in the recycling bin. Perhaps you envisage the pot eventually re-incarnated as a frisbee or maybe even a plastic bench. But donât rest easy. Your pot might get burned or buried in landfill, and youâd never know. The National Audit Office (NAO) says over half of the packaging reported as recycled is actually being sent abroad to be processed. As a result, it says, the government has little idea of whether the recyclables are getting turned into new products, buried in landfill or burned. While an illusion of success has been created by the UKâs system for recycling packaging, the NAO says, the reality may be quite different. Its report finds that: The government has turned a blind eye to underlying problems with the waste system Firms may be over-stating the amount they are recycling The Environment Agency has only carried out 40% of the recycling checks it planned to The UK is said to have increased recycling from under a third in 1998 to nearly two thirds last year, easily beating the EU target. It sounds good. But the NAO says most of the recorded increase in recycling has been due to the UK exporting its waste problem. Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, is already on record saying the UK has got to stop exporting its dirt. Reducing waste and using resources better, as well as tackling packaging waste is key to that. The environment department Defra estimates that UK packaging recycling rates have increased from 31% in 1998 to 64% in 2017. That beats the EU target of 55%. But since 2002 the quantity of packaging waste exported has increased six-fold, whilst the quantity recycled in the UK has remained the same. Whatâs more, the figures donât take into account the risk of undetected fraud and error. The NAO says thereâs nothing to prove that packaging sent for recycling actually gets recycled. Nor does Defra have evidence that the system has done what itâs supposed to have done by encouraging companies to minimise their use of packaging or make it easy to recycle. Is it time to scrap shrink-wrapped records? The NAO's report found only 25% of the firms most likely to misbehave over re-processing or exporting waste are inspected, while just 40% of planned compliance visits were actually carried out. An Environment Agency spokesperson, said ""where we find any evidence of fraud or error in data reported to us, we remove that information from the overall packaging recycling data and calculations"". But Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said ""a tighter grip on packaging recycling is needed"". âTwenty years ago, the government set up a complex system to subsidise packaging recycling, which appears to have evolved into a comfortable way of meeting targets without addressing the fundamental issues. âThe government should have a much better understanding of the difference this system makes and a better handle on the risks associated with so much packaging waste being recycled overseas."" Currently large firms handling over 50 tonnes of packaging a year need to show they have recycled a certain amount of packaging. They do this by paying for a credit note - a Packaging Recovery Note (PRN) - from a recycling firm to contribute to improving recycling. UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled Defra says the scheme raised Â£50m in 2016. The cash was to be used for ""capacity building"" in the recycling system through increasing collection and processing of recyclables. But critics say the scheme is so opaque it is hard to tell exactly how the money is spent. Local councils, which have to run waste collection and litter services,complain they donât see a penny of it. A government spokesman says that scheme has increased recycling rates ""significantly"". âHowever, there is much more to do. We donât recycle enough waste, and we export too much of it. âThatâs why we have already committed to overhaul the system, and we will set out our reforms in the Resources and Waste Strategy later this year.â Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Plastic pollution explained,"Marine life is facing ""irreparable damage"" from the millions of tonnes of plastic waste which ends up in the oceans each year, the United Nations has warned. ""This is a planetary crisis... we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean,"" UN oceans chief Lisa Svenssontold the BBC. But how does this happen, where is most at risk and what damage does this plastic actually do? Plastic as we know it has only really existed for the last 60-70 years, but in that time it has transformed everything from clothing, cooking and catering, to product design, engineering and retailing. One of the great advantages of many types of plastic is that they're designed to last - for a very long time. And nearly all the plastic ever created still exists in some form today. In July a paper published in the journal Science Advances by industrial ecologist Dr Roland Geyer, from the University of California in Santa Barbara, and colleagues,calculated the total volume of all plastic ever produced at 8.3bn tonnes. Of this, some 6.3bn tonnes is now waste - and 79% of that is in landfill or the natural environment. This vast amount of waste has been driven by modern life, where plastic is used for many throwaway or ""single use"" items, from drinks bottles and nappies to cutlery and cotton buds. Drinks bottles are one the most common types of plastic waste. Some 480bn plastic bottles were sold globally in 2016 - that's a million bottles per minute. Of these, 110bn were made by drinks giant Coca Cola. Some countries are considering moves to reduce consumption. Proposals in the UK includedeposit-return schemes, and the improvement offree-drinking water supplies in major cities, including London. It's likely that about 10m tonnes of plastic currently ends up in the oceans each year. In 2010 scientists from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the University of Georgia in Athens estimated the figure as 8m tonnes, and forecast that to rise to 9.1m tonnes by 2015. The same study,published in the journal Science in 2015,external, surveyed 192 coastal countries contributing to ocean plastic waste, and found that Asian nations were 13 of the 20 biggest contributors. China was top of the list of countries mismanaging plastic waste, but the US also featured in the top 20 and contributed a higher rate of waste per person. Plastic waste accumulates in areas of the ocean where winds create swirling circular currents, known as gyres, which suck in any floating debris. There are five gyres around the globe, but the best known is probably the North Pacific gyre. More on this topic: Blue Planet II advisers feel 'shame and anger' at extent of plastic Images of a global problem All the BBC's news on plastic pollution It is estimated debris takes about six years to reach the centre of the North Pacific gyre from the coast of the US, and about a year from Japan. All five gyres have higher concentrations of plastic rubbish than other parts of the oceans. They are made up of tiny fragments of plastic, which appear to hang suspended below the surface - a phenomenon that has led it to being described as plastic soup. And the hard-wearing qualities of most plastics means that some items can take hundreds of years to biodegrade. However, there are moves to clean up the North Pacific gyre. An operation led by a non-profit organisationOcean Cleanup,externalis due to begin in 2018. The Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100m stretch of beach surveyed during their recent Great British Beach Clean Up. That was a 10% increase on last year. Rubbish from food and drink constituted at least 20% of all litter collected,the MCS reported.,external The origin of a lot of the litter is difficult to trace, but the public contributes about 30%. ""Sewage-related debris"", or items flushed down toilets that should have been put in the bin, amounted to some 8.5%. For sea birds and larger marine creatures like turtles, dolphins and seals, the danger comes from being entangled in plastic bags and other debris, or mistaking plastic for food. Turtles cannot distinguish between plastic bags and jellyfish, which can be part of their diet. Plastic bags, once consumed, cause internal blockages and usually result in death. Larger pieces of plastic can also damage the digestive systems of sea birds and whales, and can be potentially fatal. Over time, plastic waste slowly degrades and breaks down into tiny micro-fragments which are also causing scientists concern. A recent survey by Plymouth University found that plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish. This can result in malnutrition or starvation for the fish, and lead to plastic ingestion in humans too. The effect on humans of eating fish containing plastic is still largely unknown. But in 2016 the European Food Safety Authority warned of an increased risk to human health and food safety ""given the potential for micro-plastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish"".

Surgeons' rows 'added to death rate',"A ""toxic"" row between surgeons at a cardiac unit contributed to a higher mortality rate, according to a leaked document. The report into the unit at St George's Hospital in London -seen by the Times,external- says the team was consumed by a ""dark force"" and patients were put at risk. The average mortality rate nationally is 2%, but the unit recorded 3.7%. The hospital said it was ""taking action"" and cardiac surgery at the unit was safe for patients. Fall in hospital mortality rates London NHS trust in special measures St George's commissioned an external review of the department after an alert in April about ""lower than expected survival rates"". Former NHS England deputy medical director Mike Bewick took on the task and wrote the report. In it, he claimed internal scrutiny of the department was ""inadequate"" and the surgeons were split into ""two camps"" exhibiting ""tribal-like activity"". Professor Bewick said: ""Some felt that there was a persistent toxic atmosphere and stated that there was a 'dark force' in the unit. ""In our view the whole team shares responsibility for the failure to significantly improve professional relationships and to a degree surgical mortality."" He added: ""The surgical team is viewed as dysfunctional both internally and externally."" The review saw 39 staff interviewed and while they were shocked at the mortality rate, ""most felt that poor performance was inevitable due to the pervading atmosphere"". It recommended stronger leadership and ""new blood"", and criticised the department for the ""defensive approach"" it took to the death rate. The report also called for ""radical solutions to breaking up the current surgical team"". A spokesman for St George's Hospital, in Tooting, south London, said the recommendations were being implemented ""at pace"", including the immediate relocation of all cardiac surgeons to a single-speciality practice. The hospital spokesman said: ""We would like to stress that the cardiac surgery service we provide for patients is safe. ""However, it is very clear that major and urgent improvements are required, which we are already taking action to deliver."" St George's has advertised for an additional consultant cardiologist to join the team. London's Guy's and St Thomas's Foundation Trust will also send ""on the ground leadership support"" in the form of cardiac surgeons from 6 August.

Vulnerable children facing 'catastrophe',"Anne Longfield said she heard from families every day who could not get the help they needed Vulnerable children cannot get help from some cash-strapped councils, the Children's Commissioner for England has warned. Anne Longfield said she feared thefinancial crisis at Northamptonshire County Councilwould have ""catastrophic consequences"" for some children. Both Northamptonshire andEast Sussex councils are planning major service cutsdue to funding shortfalls. Ms Longfield wants the government to protect children from any council cuts. The Department for Education said it was working across government to ensure Tory-run Northamptonshire County Council met its legal duties to children despite its troubled finances. Earlier this week, the authority outlined a ""radical"" Â£70m savings plan, which did not rule out cuts to children's services. On Friday, the Conservative-led East Sussex County Council also put forward proposals to strip back services to a legal minimum. Ms Longfield said she was particularly worried that the situation in Northamptonshire meant it would not protect ""services for the most vulnerable children, which could have catastrophic consequences"". The number of children in England living in families with high needs such as ""severe mental health problems or domestic violence in the home"" who were going without ""substantial help"" numbered about 1.5 million, she said. Northamptonshire County Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss funding cuts Speaking toBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Longfield said the scale of the problem in England was highlighted by work carried out with the Institute for Fiscal Studies which showed ""half of all the spending on children's services goes on the 70,000 children who are in care"". The commissioner warned: ""If you add in those who are on the child protection registers, that's over 80%, leaving very, very little for any others. ""Councils have been warning for some time that they are not going to be able to meet their statutory requirements. ""I can see and hear every day from families and children who simply can't get help."" She continued: ""If you don't help children when the problems aren't at crisis point then the crisis is going to be developing and also it is going to be much more costly when it gets to that point."" Ms Longfield added that money in the system had remained the same for 10 years but was now being spent on ""fewer children who are costing more"", with the Local Government Association warning of a Â£2bn ""black hole"". However, Tory MP Chris Philp, ministerial aide to Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, said councils were getting more money. ""We have had to save money as a country because we had an enormous deficit eight or nine years ago,"" he said. ""But one of the areas that local councils across the country have quite rightly protected are children's services. ""The National Audit Office reported in March that real terms spending on children's services has gone up by about 3%."" Over the next two financial years ""the spending power that local authorities have in real terms is going to go up by about Â£2bn"", he added. East Sussex County Council has said it may only be able to offer services it is legally obliged to provide Labour's Shadow Local Government and Communities Secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said it was a ""national scandal that vulnerable children"" were being penalised for ""Tory austerity"". ""Austerity has hit some of the most vulnerable in our society the hardest,"" he said. ""Many local councils are doing all they can, but unprecedented funding cuts have made it impossible to continue delivering services that many depend on."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Nothing is more important than ensuring children are kept safe.

US wildlife refuges end 'bee-killer' ban,"Neonicotinoid pesticides have been found to adversely affect bees and other insects The Trump administration has overturned bans on the use of pesticides linked to declining bee populations and the cultivation of genetically modified crops in US national wildlife refuges. The move, reversing a policy adopted in 2014, has attracted heavy criticism from environmentalists. It was announced in a memo by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Limited agricultural activity is allowed on some national wildlife refuges. Study 'shows neonic pesticides harm bees' The Fish and Wildlife Service's deputy director, Greg Sheehan, said in the memo that the blanket ban on neonicotinoid pesticides and GM crops on refuges would end, with decisions about their use being made on a case-by-case basis. He said genetically modified organisms helped ""maximise production"", and that neonics might be required ""to fulfil needed farming practices"". Mr Sheehan added that the move on GM crops would improve the supply of food for migratory birds including ducks and geese, which are shot by hunters on many of the nation's refuges. The memo names more than 50 national wildlife refuges where the new policy now applies, covering about 150 million acres across the US. Jenny Keating of the group Defenders of Wildlife condemned the move. ""Industrial agriculture has no place on refuges dedicated to wildlife conservation and protection of some of the most vital and vulnerable species,"" she said. The policy is the latest in a series of Obama administration environmental restrictions to be reversed by the government of President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a platform of rolling back government regulations on business.

Mars pulls ads from YouTube drill videos,"Mars' brands include Snickers, Twix and Starburst Mars has pulled its advertising from YouTube after one of its brands was shown with a drill rap music video. The move was prompted after an advert for Starburst sweets was put at the start of a video by group Moscow17. One of the group's members, Siddique Kamara, also known as Incognito and SK, wasstabbed to death in south Londonearlier this week. The confectionery company said it was ""unacceptable"" to see its brand alongside that type of content. A report from the Sun,externalsaid the advertising was worth around Â£5m to the video sharing website - but the company would not confirm this, saying it did not plan to provide any detail on its advertising budget. Grime: Dead, dying or back underground? Drill music video stopped by armed police The video featuring Mr Kamara, who was 23 when he was stabbed in Camberwell on Wednesday, sees the group rapping about being ""at war"" with the police. The Sun says that the music video uploaded on to YouTube for the group's track GB x Knockoutned - City of God was at one stage preceded by an advert for the sweets. The video, which has been viewed 40,000 times, is still on the website, but no advert now appears ahead of it. Two men are in custody on suspicion of the murder of Mr Kamara. The Metropolitan Police said ""one line of inquiry is this being gang-related"". Earlier this year, Mr Kamara was cleared at the Old Bailey ofmurdering 17-year-old Abdirahman Mohamed. Siddique Kamara was stabbed to death in south London on Wednesday A spokeswoman for Mars said: ""It is unacceptable and disappointing to see one of our brands advertised alongside this video content. ""This clearly breaches our brand safety guidelines and Mars adverts should never run alongside such content. ""We have taken the action to remove all our online advertising on YouTube and can confirm we are working with Google and our media buying agencies to understand what went wrong. ""Until we have confidence that appropriate safeguards are in place, we will not advertise on YouTube."" This video can not be played Is it right to blame drill music for violence? Drill music has been linked to violence in the capital by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. The music often sees rappers talking about violence and using gang-related symbols, such as wearing balaclavas. It has also been used to fuel rivalries between gangs. YouTube has deleted around 30 videos at the request of Ms Dick, which she says glamourised violence. A spokesman from YouTube told the Sun: ""We share the deep concern on this issue and don't want our platform used to incite violence.""

North Korea 'continuing nuclear programme',"North Korea carried out a series of long-range missile tests in 2017 North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes, violating UN sanctions, a report commissioned by the UN Security Council says. It also says Pyongyang has resorted to a ""massive increase"" of illegal ship-to-ship transfers of oil products and has been trying to sell weapons abroad. The confidential report by a panel of independent experts was submitted to the UN Security Council on Friday. North Korea has so far not commented on the document's findings. Last week, US officials said Pyongyang appeared to be building new ballistic missiles despite recent warming ties with US President Donald Trump's administration and pledges to denuclearise. Unnamed US officials told the Washington Post that spy satellites had spotted continuing activityat a site that has produced ballistic missiles. President Trump met North Korea's Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, and the two leaders then pledged to work towards denuclearisation, without specifying exactly what this would look like. Trump-Kim summit: Why did they meet? Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Pyongyang is currently under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests. The document was prepared by the experts monitoring the implementation of the UN sanctions against North Korea. It was seen by several media outlets early on Saturday. The report said: ""[North Korea] has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes and continued to defy Security Council resolutions through a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, as well as through transfers of coal at sea during 2018."" This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? It said that Pyongyang also ""attempted to supply small arms and lights weapons and other military equipment via foreign intermediaries"" to Libya, Yemen and Sudan. The experts concluded that North Korea's activities had made financial sanctions ineffective. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US Deciphering what happened in Singapore The report came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""optimistic"" that North Korean denuclearisation could be achieved. Speaking ahead of a summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) in Singapore, he said: ""The work has begun. The process of achieving denuclearisation of the [Korean] peninsula is one that I think we have all known would take some time."" He stressed that it was important to maintain ""diplomatic and economic pressure"" on North Korea to achieve ""the final, fully verified denuclearisation"". He also said he had seen reports that Russia was issuing permits allowing North Koreans to work on its territory, defying the sanctions. ""I want to remind every nation that has supported these resolutions that this is a serious issue and something that we will discuss with Moscow. ""We expect the Russians and all countries to abide by the UN Security Council resolutions and enforce sanctions on North Korea,"" Mr Pompeo said.

Javid promises forced marriage crackdown,"Forced marriage is a criminal offence, punishable by up to seven years in prison Home Secretary Sajid Javid has promised to do more to prevent forced marriages after charities warned the government was failing to protect women and girls. Officials have been accused of letting too many abusive marriages go unchallenged. Almost half of the 88 visa applications objected to on forced marriage grounds last year were approved. Mr Javid said forced marriage was a ""despicable, inhumane, uncivilised practice"". 'Monstrous' forced marriage parents jailed Spoons in pants to prevent forced marriage First male forced marriage order issued Figures obtained under Freedom of Information lawsby The Times,externalshowed that the Home Office had received 175 inquiries about trying to block spouses' visas last year. Of those, 88 became full cases - with objections coming directly from victims, from third parties, and from officials who suspect a forced marriage. Visas were issued in 42 of the cases, while 10 are still pending or on appeal. Mr Javid said people would pay for their crimes Mr Javid said: ""We will be doing more to combat it and support victims. ""Those who force British women into marriage, be warned that we are redoubling our efforts to make sure you pay for your crimes."" The cases examined by the Home Office involved women forced to marry men in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates. Charities working with forced marriage victims said that women and girls were at risk in cases where authorities took no action. Aneeta Prem, founder of Freedom, which aims to protect children from forced marriages and other forms of abuse, said she had seen ""a number of cases like this and they go unchallenged"". ""The girls are physically and sexually abused by the men that come over,"" she said. Jasvinder Sanghera, founder of Karma Nirvana, which also supports forced marriage victims, told The Times: ""Even when officials know it's a forced marriage, they see tradition, culture or religion and they're reticent to deal with it. They are turning a blind eye."" The Home Office said it ""categorically denies"" the suggestion that culture or religion affects the outcome of cases. In some cases, inquiries demonstrated that no further action was necessary, it said. A spokeswoman said: ""We take our safeguarding responsibilities very seriously. If an individual refuses to act as the sponsor for a visa application then under the immigration rules, that visa should not be issued."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government had been slow to act on preventing abusers from gaining visas through marriage. She said: ""Government immigration policy means that people in the system are routinely disregarded. But not listening to vulnerable women can have terrible consequences and lead to a life of abuse."" Laws against forced marriage were introduced in England and Wales in 2014, with a maximum sentence of seven years. Police were also given powers to issue Forced Marriage Protection Orders, which can impose restrictions and requirements on anyone involved in order to prevent the marriage taking place or to protect the victim. Breaching the orders is punishable by up to five years in prison. Since 2013, the number of people given help or support by the Home Office's Forced Marriages Unit has fallen from more than 1,300 to 1,196. But Mr Javid said that ""more needs to be done"" on the issue.

"Russian helicopter crash kills 18An MI-8 helicopter goes down in north-western Siberia, killing everyone on board.Europe","The helicopter burst into flames Eighteen people have died in a Russian helicopter crash in north-western Siberia, officials say. Russia's emergencies ministry said the MI-8 went down at 10:20 local time (03:20 GMT), about 180km (112 miles) from the town of Igarka, in Krasnoyarsk Territory. All those on board - three crew members and 15 passengers - were killed. The helicopter was reportedly taking workers to an oil station. A criminal investigation is under way. Initial assessments have suggested that the aircraft's blades struck cargo being carried by another helicopter just after take-off. It fell to the ground and burst into flames. The second helicopter was able to land safely. Two MI-8 helicopters belonging to Utair are shown in a company handout photo A government official, Svetlana Petrenko, said authorities were investigating allegations of negligence and whether safety guidelines had been violated.

Sickness closes Severn Bridge westboundThe crossing will be closed westbound until 14:00 BST on Saturday and drivers are being diverted via the Prince of Wales Bridge.,"An ""unprecedented"" level of staff sickness led to the closure of the M48 Severn Bridge westbound. Tollbooths on the bridge were shut in order to protect the safety of staff and drivers, Highways England said. Motorists had been advised to travel via the second Severn crossing, now known as the Prince of Wales Bridge, instead. All westbound lanes were shut, between junctions one and two, from 05:00 BST before being reopened at 14:10 BST. Earlier, a spokeswoman for Highways England said: ""This is an unprecedented level of staff sickness. ""If we haven't got staff members in crucial roles on the toll plaza it is not safe for our team or the drivers so we have taken the decision to close the tolls. ""We are telling motorists to use the other bridge. ""Staff have been diverted to the second Severn crossing to assist staff there and keep traffic flowing."" The closure affected the stretch of motorway which links Chepstow in Monmouthshire and Aust in South Gloucestershire. It remained open in the eastbound direction, which is not controlled by tolls. The Grade I-listed bridge, which origÂ­iÂ­nally formed part of the M4 until the SecÂ­ond SevÂ­ern CrossÂ­ing opened in 1996, carries about 17,000 vehicles per day. Allow Twitter content?

Denmark woman fined for wearing veilShe is the first to be fined under controversial new legislation banning full face coverings in public.Europe,"Hundreds of people protested against the ban on Wednesday A woman has become the first person in Denmark to be charged with wearing a full-face veil in public, after a ban came into effect on Wednesday. The 28-year-old came to the police's attention when a scuffle broke out between her and another woman at the top of an escalator at a shopping centre north of Copenhagen. She was fined when she refused to remove the veil. The new law has provoked protests and criticism from human rights groups. It does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". The Islamic veil across Europe What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? Reality check: Did EU court ban Islamic headscarf at work? An initial report into the altercation on Friday suggested that one woman was trying to remove the other's veil, but police said this was not clear. ""During the fight her niqab came off, but by the time we arrived she had put it back on again,"" police spokesperson David Borchersen told the Ritzau news agency. Police reviewed CCTV footage to determine whether the second woman had intentionally pulled off the veil, and believed it was incidental to the fight. They said both women were charged with violating the peace and said one had also been charged with violating the full-face veil law. She was given a 1,000 kroner fine ($155; Â£120) after refusing to take it off at their request. The niqab is a face veil that leaves the area around the eyes clear On Wednesday night protesters gathered in the capital to demonstrate against law, with women in traditional burqas and veils standing alongside people with makeshift coverings. Friday's incident is reported to have taken place at a shopping centre in Horsholm, 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen. People of all backgrounds demonstrated in Copenhagen in solidarity with women wearing the veil Some Muslim women have said they will not adhere to the law - which carries a 10,000 ($1,500; Â£1,200) kroner penalty for repeat offenders. Human Rights Watch has labelled the ban ""discriminatory"" and said it was the ""latest in a harmful trend."" Last year the European Court of Human Rights upheld a similar Belgian ban, saying that communal harmony trumped an individual's right to religious expression.

Anti-Semites don't speak for me - CorbynThe Labour leader makes a fresh attempt to draw a line under the anti-Semitism row engulfing his party.UK Politics,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said ""people who dish out anti-Semitic poison need to understand: you do not do it in my name"". In an article for the Guardian,external, he said anti-Semitism was a ""real problem"" that Labour was ""working to overcome"". But he did not give in to demands to adopt all the examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). Critics in the Labour Party said the article had changed nothing. Action against me ridiculous, says Hodge A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? In his article, he said he recognised the ""strong concerns"" about Labour's code of conduct and that many Jewish organisations believed it should include all 11 examples of contemporary anti-Semitism cited by the IHRA in its guidelines. Mr Corbyn, a long-standing supporter of the rights of Palestinians, defended Labour's decision not to include one of the examples - which warns against ""claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour"". He said this had ""sometimes been used by those wanting to restrict criticism of Israel that is not anti-Semitic"". But he added: ""I feel confident that this outstanding issue can be resolved through dialogue with community organisations, including the Jewish Labour Movement, during this month's consultation."" This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away The Labour leader also wrote that he would ""not for one moment accept that a Labour government would represent any kind of threat"" to Jewish life in the UK. ""That is the kind of overheated rhetoric that can surface during emotional political debates,"" he said. By Susana Mendonca, BBC political correspondent This was supposed to be Jeremy Corbyn reaching out to the Jewish community to repair frayed relations. The tone of some of what he said was conciliatory. He acknowledged the party had a problem with anti-Semitism and accepted the Jewish community should have been consulted earlier on the code of conduct. But there was no sudden change in policy on the code - and nothing short of that was ever going to silence his critics. The timing didn't help either as it was released just before the Jewish Sabbath, leading some to suggest that was intended to avoid reaction from the Jewish community. Labour tells me that was not the case and the article was supposed to have been published much earlier in the day. Nonetheless the reaction has come - and it hasn't been positive. ""Vague and meaningless"" was the assessment from the Campaign Against Antisemitism. Expect this row to continue rumbling on through this long hot summer. Labour MP Ian Austin, who isbeing investigated over his alleged behaviourduring a row about the party's code of conduct, said Mr Corbyn's article will ""make matters much worse"". ""Under his leadership, the Labour Party has caused huge offence and distress to the Jewish community yet he's not just completely failed to make a single change, but repeated some of the things that have caused this problem,"" he said. Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, a leading critic of Mr Corbyn's stance on anti-Semitism, told the BBC his party leader was guilty of ""the same old hand wringing we've heard time and time again"". A Jewish Labour Movement spokesperson said: ""Today, other than another article bemoaning a situation of the party's own making, nothing has changed. There is no trust left. We find ourselves asking once again for action, not words."" But Barnaby Raine, a Jewish Labour party member and supporter of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4 that the article demonstrated a significant step forward for the leader. ""He has acknowledged that anti-Semitism is a serious problem in the Labour party,"" he said. ""He has taken on those people that say that they support him, even though they are anti-Semities. ""And he has done somethingâ¦ which I think this is especially important - he has condemned those people, not just who hold anti-Semitic attitudes, but who dismiss this whole thing as just a smear on the Labour party."" Earlier it emerged that Labour had offered to drop disciplinary action against Dame Margaret Hodge if she issued an ""appropriate apology"" over an anti-Semitism row. The party launched an investigation into the veteran Labour MP after a confrontation she had with Mr Corbyn. She has published letters on social media between her lawyers and Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby. ""I'm still no wiser as to what I'm accused of; the nature of complaints received; who the investigating officer is; or what the time frame for the investigation will be. Is this fair?,"" Dame Margaret said. Solicitors from Mischon de Reya, which is acting for Dame Margaret, have told the Labour Party either to proceed with the investigation or to drop it, and if not, they have warned that she may take the Labour Party to court. They also say the Barking MP will not apologise as she does not accept that she breached Labour rules. Mr Corbyn had been hoping to make a speech addressing the anti-Semitism row at the Jewish Museum, in London, but the museum has now said there are ""no plans"" for a Labour event there.

Trump ex-campaign chief's 'income altered',"Cindy Laporta was testifying in court on the fourth day of the trial An accountant for Donald Trump's former election campaign chief Paul Manafort says she helped disguise his foreign income so he could pay less in tax. Cindy Laporta told the court in Alexandria, Virginia, she had been told to concoct a $900,000 (Â£690,000) loan on his tax return in 2015. Mr Manafort is facing charges of bank fraud, tax fraud, and failing to report foreign bank accounts. The former political consultant has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Last month, Mr Manafort, who ran the Trump campaign for three months, was accused by prosecutors of using numerous accounts in order to evade tax. He could face up to 30 years in jail if found guilty. Read more: The man who helped Trump win None of the charges that Mr Manafort faces at trial relate to the investigation into possible collusion in 2016 between Russia and the Trump campaign. Testifying on the fourth day of the trial, Ms Laporta, who has been given immunity in exchange for testifying, said she knew what she did with fabricating the loan was ""not appropriate"". ""You can't pick and choose what's a loan and what's income,"" she said. ""I very much regret it."" A courtroom sketch shows Mr Manafort seated during the opening day of his trial She added that she had agreed to do this under pressure from Mr Manafort's former associate Rick Gates, who had alleged that Mr Manafort did not have the money to pay the full tax. Ms Laporta said Mr Manafort had likely saved up to $500,000 in taxes in 2015. Mr Manafort's lawyers have previously argued that Mr Gates is the one responsible for the financial charges. ""This is about Mr Manafort placing his trust in the wrong person,"" defence lawyer Thomas Zehnle said in his opening statement. However, prosecutors argue that Mr Manafort was closely involved in managing his own finances. Mr Gates has already pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and lying to investigators. He has since been co-operating with the investigation into Mr Manafort. Before joining Mr Trump's team in summer 2016, Paul Manafort had worked on a number of Republican presidential campaigns, including those of Gerald Ford in the mid-1970s and Ronald Reagan from 1978 to 1980. Paul Manafort (L) in 1985 with fellow political consultants Roger Stone (C) and Lee Atwater (R) As a lobbyist, he developed a reputation for representing the unrepresentable, including former Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos, who was accused of torturing, abducting and killing thousands of opponents. Mr Manafort took over as chairman of the Trump campaign in May 2016 and aimed to present a more thoughtful candidate, who stuck to scripts instead of ad-libbing in campaign rallies. He was in the hot seat when Mr Trump eventually won the Republican nomination, and organised the Republican convention in July 2016. Who's who in Russia drama? How Trump-Russia scandal has unfolded What is the special counsel? But Mr Manafort quickly faced allegations that he had not disclosed millions of dollars he received for consultancy work he carried out in Ukraine for its then pro-Russian president. At the same time, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment. Mr Manafort quit Mr Trump's team in August 2016.

Surgeons 'toxic' rows added to death rate,"A ""toxic"" row between surgeons at a cardiac unit contributed to a higher mortality rate, according to a leaked document. The report into the unit at St George's Hospital in London -seen by the Times,external- says the team was consumed by a ""dark force"" and patients were put at risk. The average mortality rate nationally is 2%, but the unit recorded 3.7%. The hospital said it was ""taking action"" and cardiac surgery at the unit was safe for patients. Fall in hospital mortality rates London NHS trust in special measures St George's commissioned an external review of the department after an alert in April about ""lower than expected survival rates"". Former NHS England deputy medical director Mike Bewick took on the task and wrote the report. In it, he claimed internal scrutiny of the department was ""inadequate"" and the surgeons were split into ""two camps"" exhibiting ""tribal-like activity"". Professor Bewick said: ""Some felt that there was a persistent toxic atmosphere and stated that there was a 'dark force' in the unit. ""In our view the whole team shares responsibility for the failure to significantly improve professional relationships and to a degree surgical mortality."" He added: ""The surgical team is viewed as dysfunctional both internally and externally."" The review saw 39 staff interviewed and while they were shocked at the mortality rate, ""most felt that poor performance was inevitable due to the pervading atmosphere"". It recommended stronger leadership and ""new blood"", and criticised the department for the ""defensive approach"" it took to the death rate. The report also called for ""radical solutions to breaking up the current surgical team"". A spokesman for St George's Hospital, in Tooting, south London, said the recommendations were being implemented ""at pace"", including the immediate relocation of all cardiac surgeons to a single-speciality practice. The hospital spokesman said: ""We would like to stress that the cardiac surgery service we provide for patients is safe. ""However, it is very clear that major and urgent improvements are required, which we are already taking action to deliver."" St George's has advertised for an additional consultant cardiologist to join the team. London's Guy's and St Thomas's Foundation Trust will also send ""on the ground leadership support"" in the form of cardiac surgeons from 6 August.

Ryanair pilots agree to dispute mediation,"Ryanair pilots who have been staging a series of strikes have accepted the airline's proposal for mediation. The Ireland-based pilots staged a fourth one-day strike on Friday and announced another for Friday 10 August. They are in dispute with the airline over issues including annual leave, seniority and base transfers. They have now agreed that a former head of the Republic of Ireland's Workplace Relations Commission should act as a third-party mediator. In a statement, pilots' union FÃ³rsa said it looked forward to talking to Kieran Mulvey ""about when a process could begin"". However, next Friday's strike is still set to proceed - Ryanair pilots in Belgium and Sweden are also set to strike on the same day, The airline has criticised the action as needless, saying it would disrupt another 20 flights and 3,500 customers during the peak travel period. It said the latest action had no effect since all 3,500 customers had already been re-accommodated or refunded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Bocelli to sing for Pope during Dublin visit,"Andrea Bocelli said it would be a privilege to perform in front of the Pope World-renowned Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform at an event in Dublin to be attended by Pope Francis later this month. The Festival of Families concert will take place at Croke Park on 25 August, during the pontiff's two-day visit. More than 70,000 people will take part, organisers have said. Bocelli said performing before the Pope was a ""privilege for our soul; it is an honour for what the Supreme Pontiff represents in the world"". Profile: Pope Francis Remembering when the Pope came to Ireland ""It is a joy to be able to offer my most modest contribution on the occasion of this grand meeting and moment of reflection about the family,"" he added. ""The family remains the strongest building block of society, a cluster of affection and a privileged space in which one can teach and learn - in every action - how to choose a life that leads toward the greater good."" Bocelli will join other acts already announced for the event including Nathan Carter, Daniel O'Donnell, Moya Brennan, The Begley Family and The Priests. Pope Francis will arrive in Dublin on 25 August for a two-day tour, the first Irish papal visit for almost 40 years. Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to visit Ireland since John Paul II in 1979 As well as the Festival of Families concert, his tour includes events at Dublin's Phoenix Park and at the Knock shrine in County Mayo. Father Timothy Bartlett, secretary general of the World Meeting of Families 2018 event, said he was delighted that Bocelli would be performing. ""He will bring so much to our gathering not just because of his wonderful talent but because of his love for his faith,"" he said. ""We are honoured that he has taken time out of an intensely busy schedule to come to Ireland to be part of our global celebration of family life.""

"Russian helicopter crashes, deaths feared","The helicopter burst into flames Eighteen people have died in a Russian helicopter crash in north-western Siberia, officials say. Russia's emergencies ministry said the MI-8 went down at 10:20 local time (03:20 GMT), about 180km (112 miles) from the town of Igarka, in Krasnoyarsk Territory. All those on board - three crew members and 15 passengers - were killed. The helicopter was reportedly taking workers to an oil station. A criminal investigation is under way. Initial assessments have suggested that the aircraft's blades struck cargo being carried by another helicopter just after take-off. It fell to the ground and burst into flames. The second helicopter was able to land safely. Two MI-8 helicopters belonging to Utair are shown in a company handout photo A government official, Svetlana Petrenko, said authorities were investigating allegations of negligence and whether safety guidelines had been violated. Both aircraft belong to Russian national airline Utair. The helicopter's black box flight recorders have been recovered and appear undamaged, Russian news agency TASS quoted law enforcement agencies as saying.

"Weinstein seeks to dismiss criminal caseHarvey Weinstein's lawyers cite ""warm"" emails the producer received from an accuser.US & Canada","Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is seeking to get the criminal case against him thrown out of court. On Friday, his lawyers filed a defence motion citing dozens of ""warm"" emails they say Mr Weinstein received from one of his accusers after an alleged rape. His team argue prosecutors should have shared the evidence with the Grand Jury that indicted him. Mr Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to six charges involving three different women. The accuser in question has retained her anonymity. Mr Weinstein's lawyers say the case should be dismissed in its pre-trial stage, saying there had been a series of failings. Other objections included a lack of details on the timeline of an alleged assault in 2004, and the lack of advance warning from the District Attorney's office about the presentation of more serious charges. How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded In their motion, they included ""dozens of emails written by the anonymous accuser, who sent extensive warm, complimentary and solicitous messages to Mr Weinstein immediately following the now claimed event and over the next four-year period. ""These communications irrefutably reflect the true nature of this consensual intimate friendship, which never at any time included a forcible rape."" The New York District Attorney's Office has not yet commented. The 159-page motion presents details from more than 400 emails between Mr Weinstein and the accuser, sent between April 2013 and February 2017, the lawyers say. The alleged rape took place on 18 March 2013. The woman alleges Mr Weinstein trapped her in a New York City hotel room and forced himself on her. His defence says the emails continued after this date. ""I hope to see you sooner rather than later,"" she wrote on 11 April 2013, followed by ""I appreciate all you do for me"", sent the next day. ""I love you, always do,"" she wrote on February 8, 2017. ""But I hate feeling like a booty call. :)"" A footnote in the lawyers' document reads: ""This [motion] is not to ignore that rape can occur in relationships such as an abusive marriage or where the parties have been dating each other for a time."" The woman has not released a statement. After Mr Weinstein was fired by his company last year, the emails were turned over to his legal team, according to the LA Times. Who has accused Weinstein of what? The judge dealing with his separate bankruptcy case issued an order saying the private messages could not be released, because the accuser could lose her right to anonymity. On Thursday, that same judge conceded the correspondence could be used in Mr Weinstein's motion against the criminal case, as long as the woman's identity was protected. In 2017, dozens of women - including many famous actresses - came forward with allegations, ranging from rape to sexual harassment.They sparked a solidarity movement known as #MeToo. The allegations of three of the women underpin the criminal case: former actress Lucia Evans, former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and the anonymous accuser. One of the charges against him - predatory sexual assault - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr Weinstein has consistently denied any non-consensual sex. He is currently on a $1m (Â£770,000) bail bond and wears an electronic tag. He also faces a raft of civil lawsuits. In April,actress Ashley Judd sued him, claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. Mr Weinstein has denied the allegations. This video can not be played Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein London's Metropolitan Police have also been investigating claims against him, some of which date back to the 1980s. Unlike in the US,there is no statute of limitation on sexual abuse cases in the UK, meaning incidents from decades ago could still go to court.

Chile bans supermarket plastic bagsIt is the first South American country to enact a ban - and businesses flouting it will be fined $370.Latin America & Caribbean,"Only 10% of the 3.4 million bags Chileans use per year are recycled Chile has become the first South American country to legally ban the widespread commercial use of plastic bags. The new legislation, approved by Congress and enacted by President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, gives small shops two years to adapt to a total ban. Larger business will have six months to stop using plastic bags. In the meantime they will only be allowed to hand out two carrier bags per customer. Businesses that break the rules will face a fine of $370 (Â£280). The breath-taking alien world of plastic bags under the sea Guide: Why is plastic a problem? Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed Scientists say plastic pollution has a devastating impact on marine wildlife and affects the health of humans. Mr PiÃ±era said the new rules were a great step for a cleaner Chile. ""We want to go from a throwaway culture, where everything is used and chucked away, to the healthy culture of recycling,"" he said. ""There are 7.6 billion inhabitants in the world. We can't continue polluting as if each one of us owned the Earth."" He handed out reusable cloth bags at a ceremony marking the ban on Friday. The legislation was proposed by his predecessor, Michelle Bachelet, who banned the use of plastic bags in Chile's Patagonia region. Marine life in Chile and other countries have suffered for years the effects of plastic pollution Several other countries have also been taking steps to combat plastic pollution. In January, Panama approved legislation curbing the commercial use of plastic bags. Businesses there were given up to 24 months to phase out the use of plastic carrier bags.

Some of the funniest out-of-office repliesAniston 'fantasises' about Friends rebootAre heatwaves 'un-British'?Man puts out pier fire by peeing on itVideoVideoThe baby hair that shocked a midwife,"It's that time of year again. You send an email hoping to get something done and ping - it comes straight back to you with an out-of-office response. It's annoying because it means you have to email someone else, but also because it's a reminder that you're stuck in the office working while others are off having fun. For many people setting an out-of-office (OOO) response is a last-minute chore, the final obstacle standing between them and their holiday. But for some it has become a labour of love, a way to show off their sense of humour or tell everyone just how much fun they are having. Here are some of the best examples showing the potential of the humble out-of-office reply to become, well, something so much more. Sacha Romanovitch says she wants to encourage people to switch off Grant Thornton's chief executive Sacha Romanovitch's recent OOO read: ""I'm off with my family right now, back on 23 July. I'll be reading, diving and playing with my boys while they still want to play with me! ""My great team will be dealing with my emails while I'm off ensuring you get support from the right people to keep things moving."" Frankly it seems a bit smug. I'd like to spend time with my children too, but I'm stuck at work. But Ms Romanovitch - who is indeed out of the office so unable to speak to me in person - says via email that the point of her unusually detailed OOO is to let everyone know that it is ok to switch off. ""There is still so much that creates a sense of needing to work 24/7. ""My out-of-office is just one of those little things I do to signpost what I think should be the norm,"" she says. Of course, not everyone agrees. See more stories and videos like this Tyler BrÃ»lÃ©, the editor-in-chief of the magazine Monocle, declined to speak to me for this article. But he has writtenan entire column for The Financial Times,externalon why everyone, particularly those at the top, should say a big fat no to the OOO. He argues they are ""out of step with the ways of the modern world"" and suggests people who use them simply aren't committed enough. And if you thought the classic ""limited access to email"" was a good OOO excuse, Mr BrÃ»lÃ© says that unless you work ""200ft below the streets of New York repairing the sewers"" everyone will know you're telling fibs. Would you use your out-of-office to channel your inner Rick Astley? Such concerns haven't hindered Steven Nelson, a veteran writer of elaborate out-of-office responses. One of his most memorable OOOs was written in tune to eighties pop star Rick Astley's hit Never Gonna Give You Up. It went - you can sing along if you want - like this: ""Never gonna give you up, Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you, Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. ""I'm also never gonna reply to your message until 9th August as I'm off on holiday."" Mr Nelson, from the financial services consultancy The Lang Cat, admits he's now cringing with embarrassment about his message, but it hasn't stopped him writing them. In fact, he's now in fierce competition with a fellow out-of-office joker at the firm to try to outwit one another. ""It's got to the point where I feel an inordinate amount of pressure to come up with one,"" he admits. His jokey response was prompted by an urge to counteract all the serious ""self-important"" OOOs he received, telling people who to contact if their enquiry was ""urgent"". ""We work in financial services. What could possibly be classed as urgent?"" he says. But not everyone gets to find out how funny he is, as his most humorous responses are set to reply to internal emails only. ""It's a really fine line, you don't want to make your organisation look like a fun factory,"" he says. Edwyn McFarlane, a business innovation director at Awin - a firm that helps websites make money from referrals - also isn't brave enough to send his OOO response externally. But he says for junior staff members, who deal with clients they know, a funny out-of-office can ""be a good marketing tool"". Mr McFarlane's OOO reads: ""I am on annual leave until dd/mm/yyyy. I will allow each sender one email and if you send me multiple emails, I will randomly delete your emails until there is only one remaining. Choose wisely. Please note that you have already sent me one email."" Disappointingly, he says it is definitely a joke and he never actually deletes any unread emails. 'I wish I'd never gone on reality TV' Kidnapped Helen the shark 'recovering' Seven-year-old New Zealand girl fixes sexist road sign Puddle splash van driver loses job Some firms, however, actively encourage it. In 2014,German car firm Daimlerset up an optional service for workers going on holiday to have all new emails automatically deleted. France has gone even further by givingstaff the legal right to ""disconnect""and avoid work emails outside working hours. Such moves aren't purely altruistic. Compulsive out-of-hours email checking and the inability to switch off has been blamed for everything from burnout to sleeplessness as well as relationship problems. In Volkswagen's case it said research showed that staff who switched off properly performed better in the longer term. Interestingly, recipients of such emails say they don't find them offensive, perhaps wishing they had been told to do the same. BBC journalist Bill Thompson says he admires ""the honesty"" of such OOOs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Barbara Pachter, the author of The Essentials of Business Etiquette, says an out-of-office response is often the first impression someone in your professional life gets of you. Her advice is to keep it simple, warning that joking around or ""giving too much personal information"" is liable to annoy many recipients. The perfect out-of-office, she says must: be clear and concise provide actionable information such as an alternative person to contact not have any mistakes such as an incorrect number or detail be removed once you're back at work Not everyone will be amused by funny out-of-office replies One plus of being a bit more daring in your OOO reply is that it can soften the miserable feeling of having to get back to work after a week or two of fun. Rob Gilroy, a copywriter, who initially wrote funny out-of-office answers to amuse himself, says he now looks forward to his return just to read the replies. His recent OOO read: ""ERROR 405: Could not reach copywriter. Soz. Haha! What a brilliantly geeky joke, that. But in all seriousness, if you're wanting something done, no can do. ""I'm out of the office from now (Tues 27th June) to until then (Friday 30th June). ""And if you're that Nigerian Prince, asking for more money, then no. Not until you've paid that Â£12,000 back into my account. ""Other than that? I'll bring any and all answers on my return. Peace out."" Mr Gilroy admits not everyone will get it: ""I imagine there's a healthy dose of people who find them twee or annoying."" That of course is the risk. But in terms of getting it wrong it's unlikely anything will rivalthe out-of-office that ended up on a road sign,externalbecause officials assumed the auto-reply was the Welsh translation that they had requested. As a result, a sign meant to bar lorries from a road near a supermarket instead read in Welsh: ""I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated."" An embarrassing error, but quite fun. And after all, if no-one wrote amusing OOOs then us poor people left stuck in the office over the summer would have even less fun.

Aniston 'fantasises' about Friends rebootAre heatwaves 'un-British'?Man puts out pier fire by peeing on itVideoVideoThe baby hair that shocked a midwife,"Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow, pictured in 2003 Jennifer Aniston says she, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow have talked about a possible Friends reboot. In awide-ranging interview with InStyle,external, she added she ""fantasises"" about the show being brought back. ""Courteney, Lisa and I talk about it. I fantasise about it. It really was the greatest job I ever had,"" Aniston said. ""I don't know what it would look like today, but you never know. So many shows are being successfully rebooted."" (Shows to have been brought back recently include Will & Grace, Gilmore Girls, The X Files, Roseanne and Queer Eye... withBuffy on the way.) Friends ran for 10 years from from 1994 She pondered whether ""Lisa, Courteney, and I could reboot The Golden Girls and spend our last years together on wicker furniture"". (She's probably joking about this but we kind of hope she isn't.) Here are eight other things we learned from the interview: 1. ""First, with all due respect, I'm not heartbroken."" Earlier this year, Aniston announced she and Justin Theroux wereseparatingafter two years of marriage. ""The misconceptions are 'Jen can't keep a man', and 'Jen refuses to have a baby because she's selfish and committed to her career',"" Aniston told the magazine. ""Or that I'm sad and heartbroken. First, with all due respect, I'm not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions. ""They don't know what I've been through medically or emotionally."" 2. Women who don't have children are considered ""damaged goods"", she says Aniston pictured at her Hollywood Walk of Fame induction ceremony last year Since leaving Friends, Aniston has gone on to have a successful movie career - arguably the only former star of the series to do so. Her big-screen hits include We're The Millers, Horrible Bosses, The Break-Up and Marley & Me. But the 49-year-old has been followed by headlines along the way, suggesting she has prioritised her career over starting a family. ""There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they're deemed damaged goods,"" Aniston said. ""Maybe my purpose on this planet isn't to procreate. Maybe I have other things I'm supposed to do?"" 3. Media headlines about her life have become ""more and more absurd"". It's not just media stories about motherhood and her love life Aniston has struggled to escape over the years. ""For the most part I can sit back and laugh at the ridiculous headlines because they have gotten more and more absurd,"" she said. Later in the interview, McNearney asks Jen what the biggest misconception is about her, so the actress hits Google. ""Oh, look, I'm having a $100,000 revenge makeover!"" 4. Jen would struggle in a beauty pageant. Not because she's not good looking enough or anything, but because of the talents you have to perform. ""My talents are not baton twirling or Hula-Hooping or tap dancing or ventriloquism or yodeling. ""I would be eliminated right away. Out. No talent."" 5. She has zero time for double standards in the media. ""When a couple breaks up in Hollywood, it's the woman who is scorned. The woman is left sad and alone. She's the failure. F that."" 6. Fear of flying is the main thing she wishes she could overcome. ""It started in my 20s. It was a weird, scary flight,"" Aniston explained. ""Afterward I started noticing the stories on the news about plane crashes... So, yeah, that's something I'd like to get rid of. It's so irrational."" 7. She may have (secretly) checked out your Instagram account. The actress confirmed she doesn't have social media accounts, but added she's can be a ""creeper"" on Instagram. ""There are times when I'll look through and think, 'Oh my god, what a time suck!'"" She also added her name to the growing number of celebrities who are social media-sceptic, adding that such platforms are ""fueling narcissism"". 8. Women should be hired on merit, not just for the sake of it. Aniston's latest movie Dumplin' is written, produced, and directed primarily by women, with female lead characters. Praising the ""extraordinary"" team, she argued that women should not be hired for the sake of industry box-ticking, but on merit. ""We shouldn't be shoving female directors and producers down each other's throats because we have to. Then we're making those decisions from a place of fear.""

Are heatwaves 'un-British'?Man puts out pier fire by peeing on itVideoVideoThe baby hair that shocked a midwife,"How does Britain, known around the world for its famous grey skies and rain, react to a lengthy heatwave? ""Hallelujah,"" someone shouted, as a small boy ran into the street and started to dance. After weeks of hot, dry weather, it had begun to rain and in my London neighbourhood last week, the plump droplets splashing on to the pavement dust were a cause for celebration. People walked through the storm, getting soaked to the skin, with shiny faces upturned. The country, it seemed, had been holding its breath waiting for this moment, and now it could breathe again. We grumble about our rainy weather, but this summer has reminded us how much we value it. The strange scenes took me back to 1976, when after weeks of boiling weather and amid warnings of water rationing, the Prime Minister James Callaghan instructed one of his ministers, Denis Howell, to do a rain dance. When the heavens did indeed open the next day, the nation rejoiced. Denis Howell, appointed minister for drought in 1976, later served as minister for snow Euphoria, however, was short-lived. Less than a week later, the minister of state for drought had his title changed to minister of state for floods. Two years later, it changed again - Howell became minister of state for snow. I don't know whether No 10 had a word with Sam Gyimah, the minister with current responsibility for the Met Office, but in the days before the storm, many had taken to social media to suggest a bit of ministerial rain dancing was required. The heatwave is, well, it's just not British. Day after day after day of the same blue skies is foreign to us. Our climate is benign and our weather is changeable. The default is grey, a neutral backdrop against which the excitement of a sunny spell or squally shower is all the greater. We are famous for our greyness. In AD 94, the Roman historian Tacitus described Britain as a country where ""the sky is overcast with continual rain and cloud"". Two thousand years later and the American travel writer Bill Bryson made the same point: ""Sometimes it rained, but mostly it was just dull, a land without shadows. It was like living inside Tupperware."" Throughout history, Britain has been noted for its grey skies The cobwebs and dust of interminable sultriness, daily life which seems ever slower, it all feels alien to the British. It is often said thatour reserved national characteris shaped by our temperate climate. But is that true? Are we the product of our weather? How does the 2018 heatwave compare to that of 1976? Storms sweep in as temperatures cool Climate change driven by humans made heatwave 'twice as likely' In about 7 AD, the Greek historian and geographer Strabo hinted at an association between his assessments of the British climate (rain and fog) and the British temperament (simple and barbaric). The suggestion was that the damp, gloomy climate had incubated an uncivilised, backward race. In 1733, the doctor and writer John Arbuthnot came to the reverse conclusion. He suggested variations in atmospheric pressure found in cold northern climes resulted in ""greater activity and courage"" compared with people in hot countries who, ""free from the agitations and sensations of northern people"", were ""lazy and indolent"". The Mediterranean is renowned for its sun, scenery and food. But are its people happier than those in gloomier places? David Hume was unconvinced. The Scots philosopher responded to these ideas in a controversial essay entitled Of National Characters. In this, he argued that the only observable difference ""is the vulgar one, that people in the northern regions have a greater inclination to strong liquors, and those in the southern to love and women"". Even this association was ""doubtful"", Hume felt. During the last few decades a significant amount of research has been conducted into the relationship between mood and climate. Do high temperatures make people passionate? Does precipitation dampen enthusiasm? Are people happier in summer than in winter? Analysis in the '70s and '80s looking at the performance of students in America and Switzerland (by Howard & Hoffman [1984], Sanders & Brizzolara [1982] and Faust et al. [1974]) variously suggested that high pressure, high temperature and low humidity were associated with positive emotions: basically, nice weather seemed to put people in a good mood. More recent researchsuggests the link is close to non-existent,external. Even the wettest conditions fail to dampen the enjoyment of festival-goers like this couple Some in Britain instinctively believe that if they lived in a warm, sunny environment instead of enduring waves of Atlantic cloud and rain, everyone would be a lot happier. The idea that a warm, sunny climate makes us cheerier doesn't hold up. The happiest region in the UK, according to data from the ONS Wellbeing survey, is the most northerly:Shetland, Orkney and the Outer Hebrides,external. Some islands here see only around 1,000 hours of sunshine a year compared with a UK average of 1,340 hours. Andinternational lists of the happiest countriestend to find places like Norway, Sweden, Canada, Denmark and Finland at the top. There is no correlation between well-being and sunshine - if anything it looks like the opposite. Finland's people are among the happiest on earth And yet. And yet. And yet. Immediately following last week's thunderstorm, when a watery sun sparkled on puddles through clean, fresh air, colours brighter and senses somehow keener, those moments were profoundly exhilarating. Don't tell me that is not real. It is not the heat of this summer that is un-British. Already, I have heard familiar moans about the cooler cloudy weather and nostalgia for the summer sizzle. No, it is the invariability. When we pull back the curtains at the start of a new day, we need to be kept guessing at what we might see. That is the British way.

Man puts out pier fire by peeing on itVideoVideoThe baby hair that shocked a midwife,"Thomas Watson was visiting Southend Pier with his partner and daughter on Friday A man put out a fire on the world's longest pleasure pier by urinating on it. Thomas Watson noticed a small fire on the deserted Southend Pier and took matters into his own hands by relieving himself over the flames. The council thanked him for his ""quick-thinking tinkling"" but said it was confident its own sprinkler system would have worked,as The Sun reported,external. Essex Fire Service confirmed it was called but no action was required. Mr Watson, 22, from Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire, was visiting the 1.3 mile (2.1km) pier with his partner and daughter on Friday at about 19:30 BST, when he noticed smoke and small flames on the wooden planks. The weather had turned and ""we were literally the last people there"", he told the BBC. The 1.3 mile (2.1km) structure is the longest pleasure pier in the world Mr Watson said the fire was ""only small on top"", but a lot of smoke was coming from underneath and he ""thought it was all burning under there"". See more stories and videos like this ""I looked at it and the wood was proper charring away, like white with an orange glow. ""Using my initiative I decided to empty my bladder."" Although his partner had called the fire service, Mr Watson had tackled it by the time crews arrived. A section of Southend Pier was gutted by fire in October 2005... ...And left slightly charred in July 2018 A Southend Borough Council spokesman said: ""Whilst we have faith our sprinkler system would have soon sprung into action, we understand the visitor deployed his own sprinkler system to swiftly extinguish the miniature inferno."" He said the family could come back and visit the pier for free, but added: ""[We] kindly ask that he keeps his trousers firmly secured on this occasion.""
