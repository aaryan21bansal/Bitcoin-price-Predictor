Sending US troops to Ukraine not on table - Biden,"Mr Biden said he was confident Mr Putin got his message US President Joe Biden has said that putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion is ""not on the table"". But Mr Biden warned of severe consequences if Russia did invade. He was speaking a day after two hours of talks by video link with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The virtual summit was aimed at reducing tensions in the region after a major Russian troop build-up along Ukraine's eastern border. Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to Russia. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether President Putin has made a decision. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Putin refused to say whether he would order troops into Ukraine. But he said he could not sit back while the military alliance moved close to Russia. Mr Biden said he had made it clear to Mr Putin during Tuesday's meeting that there would be ""economic consequences like none he's ever seen"". He was confident that the Russian leader got the message, he added. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Putin-Biden talks: What next for Ukraine? But when asked about possible military action, Mr Biden said the US's moral and legal obligations to its Nato allies in the region did not extend to Ukraine, who is not a member of the 30-member organisation. ""The idea that the US is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not on the cards right now,"" he said. The US president said he hoped high-level meetings with Russia and at least four major Nato allies to discuss Russia's concerns would be announced by Friday. Mr Putin spoke from his residence in Sochi The US has not specified what economic consequences it has in mind, but on Tuesday National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Nord Stream 2 - a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany bypassing Ukraine which is not yet in operation - provided ""leverage"" for the US and its allies. Other possible measures include restrictions on Russia's banks converting roubles into foreign currencies, or even disconnecting Russia from the Swift global financial payment system, reports say. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that, while Tuesday's talks brought ""no sensations"", he was grateful for President Biden's ""unwavering support"". More than 90,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. The movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. A large part of the recent Russian military build-up is in Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula which Russia seized from Ukraine and then annexed in 2014. Troops are also gathering near Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which are under the control of Russian-backed separatists. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in seven years of conflict since Russian-backed forces seized large areas of Ukraine's east. By Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter Russia's military option could take a variety of forms from a large incursion, to a significant invasion of the eastern part of Ukraine. One aim would be to bring the main fighting elements of the Ukrainian army to battle and to inflict such a defeat upon them that the Kyiv government has to rethink its position. Invading territory amidst a hostile population has significant risks. Ukraine's armed forces have had some Western weaponry and training and are much improved since 2015. However, Russian forces have also improved over recent years. The firepower Russia is building up is impressive. For all the talk about Ukrainian sovereignty Nato cannot and will not come to Ukraine's aid. And additional weapons supplies might simply contribute to Russia's justification for war.

Scholz becomes German leader as Merkel bows out,"Olaf Scholz said goodbye to his predecessor at the chancellery, thanking her for her commitment to the role Olaf Scholz has been been sworn in as Germany's new chancellor, formally taking power after Angela Merkel's historic 16 years as leader. He promised he would do all he could to work towards a new start for Germany. As she left the chancellery in Berlin, ending a 31-year political career, Mrs Merkel told her former vice-chancellor to approach the task ""with joy"". His centre-left Social Democrats will govern alongside the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats. Mr Scholz, a soft-spoken 63-year-old, steered the Social Democrats to election victory in late September, positioning himself as the continuity candidate because he played a key role in the Merkel government as vice-chancellor. The German parliament, the Bundestag, backed him as chancellor by 395 votes to 303, and he was then formally appointed as the ninth federal chancellor by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. After the vote in parliament, he was asked by Bundestag President BÃ¤rbel Bas whether he accepted the appointment and said ""yes"".  He later took the oath of office but - unlike his predecessor - left out the religious reference ""so help me God"". Since the election, Mr Scholz's party has worked with the Greens and the Free Democrats on a coalition deal, which was finally signed on Tuesday. All 16 ministers took the oath of office on Wednesday, becomingGermany's first cabinet,externalto include as many women as men. Mr Scholz's cabinet includes seven Social Democrats, five Greens and four Free Democrats The new government has ambitious plans to fight climate change by phasing out coal early and focusing on renewable energy, but their initial priority will be tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Health authorities have recorded another 69,601 cases in the past 24 hours and a further 527 deaths - the highest number since last winter. Ready for power: Team Scholz promises a new Germany What Olaf Scholz means for the world economy Olaf Scholz takes on top job as German chancellor ""I said 'yes',"" tweeted Olaf Scholz drily, moments after the Bundestag elected him chancellor. This is the moment the career politician has long been waiting for. After 16 years of Angela Merkel, it's a case of out with the old and in with the new-ish. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Scholz is already a known and trusted face in Berlin and Brussels. He marketed himself to voters as sort of Merkel Mark Two, despite hailing from a different political party. But it's not all about continuity, and friends and trade partners of this rich and powerful nation will be watching closely. Mr Scholz's coalition government is a never-before-seen marriage of convenience. What unites them, they claim, is a determination to modernise Germany, while preserving the country's treasured stability. Immediate challenges for them are: Covid - Germany is in the midst of a pernicious fourth wave and considering mandatory vaccination The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine Angela Merkel was accused of putting trade before politics. Team Scholz is expected to be somewhat tougher on Moscow and Beijing despite the potential economic hit to German business. Relations with Washington may improve as a result, though, and that is a declared priority of Olaf Scholz's fledgling coalition. Read more from Katya Adler here. Mr Scholz's first foreign trip as chancellor will be to Paris and Brussels on Friday. He and Greens joint leader Annalena Baerbock, who becomes foreign minister, will have to respond to fears surrounding Russia's military build-up near the border with Ukraine. Although Russia has denied plans to invade its neighbour, Angela Merkel agreed with US President Joe Biden and the leaders of the UK, France and Italy late on Tuesday that they would adopt a joint strategy to respond by imposing ""significant and severe harm on the Russian economy"". One obvious economic measure would be to threaten Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, which has been completed but is still awaiting approval from the German energy regulator. US officials say they have reached an understanding with Germany that the pipeline would be shut down, which would be a significant intervention. In a message of congratulations to Mr Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he looked forward to constructive dialogue, and hoped that Germany continued to recognise ""there's no alternative to dialogue"". Leaving the chancellery on Wednesday afternoon, Mrs Merkel was applauded by staff as she told her successor to take over and work for the good of Germany. In turn, he spoke of the crises that had brought them together and of the ""deeply trusting collaboration"" they had developed. First elected in December 1990, Angela Merkel was immediately given a ministerial job by then Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But she then helped oust him and became Christian Democrat leader in 2000, before becoming chancellor herself in November 2005. She will still have an office close to the Bundestag, in a flat that was once used by Margot Honecker, once dubbed the most powerful woman in communist East Germany.

Blackmailer sold abuse 'box sets' to paedophiles,"Abdul Elahi admitted 158 offences ranging from blackmail to making, possessing and distributing indecent images An ""exceptionally dangerous predator"" targeted almost 2,000 victims to amass images of degrading sexual acts before selling the images to paedophiles. Abdul Elahi was described as being ""in a league of his own"" in terms of the scale of his online offending. Some women were blackmailed into abusing a baby or a sibling, with Elahi offering to pay off their debts. Elahi, 26, formerly of Allcroft Road, Sparkhill, Birmingham, is due to be sentenced later. He previously admitted158 charges committed against 72 complainants. It is believed he tried to exploit victims in 34 countries, with more than 500 from the UK and almost 2,000 identified altogether in the UK and US. At the start of the sentencing hearing at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday, it was said Elahi juggled many potential victims at any one time, using a fake persona to pose as a wealthy stockbroker offering financial assistance. The prosecution called him an ""exceptionally dangerous predator."" ""The whole persona, the whole arrangement, was a sham from the very beginning,"" prosecutor Adrian Langdale QC said. ""He simply, it would appear, saw his victims as a way of making money. Victims were targeted day after day, with no let-up from Mr Elahi."" Abdul Elahi, 26, will be sentenced later this week at Birmingham Crown Court Elahi also ""acted as a mentor"" to other online abusers, the court heard, with ""copy-cat"" offenders targeting some of his victims. So-called ""box sets"" of abusive images and videos compiled by Elahi were distributed in vast quantities, the court heard, after girls and young adults were blackmailed into providing humiliating and degrading sexual material. Mr Langdale said Elahi had switched online conversations to WhatsApp to cover his tracks, adding: ""Sixty-seven thousand indecent images of children have been recovered from numerous devices and cloud storage for Elahi."" Evidence suggested he ""carefully structured and logged all of his material,"" the court heard, as the offending spanned a three-year period from 2017 to 2019. The pictures were sold on irrespective of the damage he was causing, the court was told. Among those targeted on so-called ""sugar daddy"" websites were financially desperate victims, including mothers at risk of losing their homes or struggling to feed their children. During the offending, the court heard, Elahi was living in his family home and his only legitimate income was from working for a short period in a branch of McDonald's. Mr Langdale said: ""As he was eventually to admit... he said this was a full-time career and occupation.""

Home working a blow for small firms,"Clive Watson says office parties are now being cancelled Hospitality firms have warned they face a collapse in demand at their busiest time of year due to the government's new work-from-home guidance. The measures, designed to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, come in from Monday. One trade body called them a ""body blow"" to already-struggling pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues. Pub chain boss Clive Watson said some pubs could ""run out of cash"" without extra help from the government. However, the government is not planning any new economic support measures. Mr Watson said the City Pub Company, which has 44 sites in England and Wales, was just starting to get back on its feet after a rough 18 months. But he said the government was ""turning off the life support machine yet again"" by bringing back home-working. New rules on home working and masks in England What's the new guidance on working from home? How will Plan B affect the economy? ""From about 10 days ago office parties started to get cancelled [because of Omicron]. Going forward after yesterday's announcement that is only going to accelerate,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""What government has got to appreciate is for businesses, particularly in our sector, Christmas is always a key time."" The City Pub Company makes about a third of its annual profits in December, which tides it over in the quiet months of January and February. Hospitality firms fear losing vital passing trade as more people work from home. Businesses from dry cleaners to coffee houses depend on an office crowd, particularly in city centres. By contrast, those that cater to people in their homes, such as takeaways and supermarkets stand to gain from the new guidance. We talked to firms that rely on commuters about how the new home-working guidance will affect them. Passing trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abrahamovitch David Abrahamovitch runs Grind, a chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London, employing 250 staff. He also has a successful online store selling compostable coffee pods for Nespresso machines, and says he can ""fall back"" on that side of the business if things get tough. ""A lot of other hospitality businesses won't have that, so we're lucky,"" he told the BBC. ""But it will still be painful to watch the company go into reverse gear again."" Grind relies on people coming into central London and has also has seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since Omicron emerged, which Mr Abrahamovitch thinks will get worse. He is nervous about how the landlords he rents his shops from will react if things really slow down. ""They have already given a lot [of leeway in the pandemic], and everyone has their limits. They have businesses to run too."" James Greenhalgh says the uncertainty makes it impossible to plan ahead It's a similar story for James Greenhalgh, owner of the Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds city centre, who says about 50% his trade comes from the local office crowd. ""We've had such a hard time in the pandemic and things were just starting to pick up again. It's just so hard. I've genuinely thought about throwing in the towel."" His thinks the government's approach will stifle business growth. He was just about to agree a lease on bigger second shop but has now put that plan on ice. ""The rules seem to change every week, which makes it impossible for businesses to plan ahead,"" he said. ""The government should have been clear with business owners what might happen if a new variant came along. They should have told us about the contingency plans."" A study from the University of Sheffield suggests city centres stand to lose Â£3bn in 2022 due to more people working from home. Dr Jesse Matheson, lead author of the paper, said: ""This decrease will be concentrated in a few very dense centres; for example, the City of London will experience a spending decrease of 31.6%, and central Birmingham will experience a decrease of 8%. ""Some of this spending will be realised in the residential areas where these workers live, but some may be lost altogether."" Rich Bool was already noticing more staff working from home, even before the latest restrictions. He runs a mobile cafÃ©, making up to 30 trips a day to offices and industrial estates. ""It can be so difficult trying to work out from one week to the next what stocks and sandwiches you need,"" he told the BBC. ""There are just so many variables. More uncertainty is never welcome."" He has, however, learned a lot from previous lockdowns and mass home-working. Having a van means his Chippenham-based Cafe2U service can be nimble, going to where the best custom might be. Mr Bool now even visits some customers at their homes. ""We've built up a trusted relationship with some of our customers when we went to their offices. Now we take our food and drink to a few of them at home,"" he said. ""Obviously it's easy to make your own sandwich. But when you're working from home all the time, sometimes it's good to buy something if it's on your doorstep."" New rules on home working and masks for England How will Plan B affect the economy?

LiveLiveHome working and mask rules change in England - PM2 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson has announced tougher Covid-19 measures in England to control the spread of the Omicron variant Guidance to work from home will return on Monday and face masks will also have to be worn in more public venues Covid passes proving vaccination or a negative test will be required at nightclubs and venues with large crowds The Plan B restrictions are ""proportionate and responsible"", the PM says Health Secretary Sajid Javid meanwhile tells the Commons that Omicron is much more transmissible than the Delta variant Earlier the PM apologised for a video that showed his staff joking about a Christmas party held during lockdown last December and ordered an inquiry The Met Police has said it will not investigate the video because it does not ""provide evidence"" regulations were breached Allegra Stratton, who was Johnson's spokeswoman at the time, has resigned from No 10 over the video Edited by Emma Owen and Claire Heald We're drawing coverage of today's busy coronavirus news to a close. But do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott, Nathan Williams, Sophie Williams, Dulcie Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Joshua Cheetham and Mal Siret. And the page was edited by Emma Owen, Claire Heald and Kevin Ponniah. It's been an eventful and fast-moving day of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main stories: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva At its weekly Covid 19 briefing, today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was some initial evidence that the Omicron variant was more infectious, that vaccines could be somewhat less effective against it, but that its health effects might be less severe. But officials stressed that more research is needed, and warned again that countries must act now to prepare for another pandemic wave. A priority must be vaccinating the unvaccinated, and reliable public health measures such as mask wearing, testing, and social distancing. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told governments waiting to act until hospitals started to fill up would be too late. WHO officials also said booster vaccines should not be a priority - saying all the evidence shows existing vaccines provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalisations, and death. Governments must instead make every effort to reach vaccine hesitant people, and ramp up mass vaccination in largely unvaccinated countries. The new rule for some venues to introduce Covid certification is an ""unfair double
standard"" the live music industry says. Pubs and bars will not have to ask for Covid passports ""whilst
live music venues get hit with certification"", according to industry trade association Live. Covid health certificates will be required for people to enter English unseated indoor venues with more than 500 attendees. Meanwhile, The Theatres Trust said the rise of the Omicron variant and the new measures will ""have a big
impact on the willingness of people to travel and go to theatres over Christmas"". The organisation's director Jon Morgan said: ""This will have a knock-on effect on theatresâ viability at a vital time of year
for the industry and Christmas shows that are just emerging from the
significant loss of revenue in 2020 and early 2021."" Mark Harper and other Tory backbenchers expressed opposition to Plan B Back to the announcement of Plan B restrictions for England - and there is an indication that some backbench Tory MPs will not support the government when it puts them to a vote. The Workington MP Mark Jenkinson says the rules are ""divisive, discriminatory and are unlikely to stop spread"". In atweet,external, he adds the health secretary, who addressed MPs at the same time the prime minister made his announcement, ""offered no evidence for further restrictions...  just as businesses desperately need a good Christmas"". Instead, vaccination was key in the response to the Omicron variant he said. East Devon MP Simon Jupp says Plan B will cost jobs in many sectors, including hospitality. While working from home wonât help social or economic recovery. And former chief whip Mark Harper suggests the ""initial evidence on Omicron doesn't support these measures"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Prof Chris Whitty says vaccines are a useful way to prevent serious infection Introducing more restrictions in England just before Christmas for
the second year running is, of course, depressing. But this is vastly different from last year. Then, large
parts of the country were put into what was effectively lockdown with tier
four. A full national lockdown followed in the new year. This time, with these latest Plan B measures, society is being kept open - just with extra
precautions being taken. As England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, we are in
an immeasurably better position now. That is down to immunity built up by
vaccination and previous infection. This variant can dodge some of those defences - but not
all. A step back, but by no means a return to square one. Dominic HughesHealth correspondent, in Preston Angela Roberts got her booster jab this morning There's been lots going on today but one important thing to remind you of is thatpeople aged 40 and over in England can now book their booster jabfor three months after their second dose. Angela Roberts, who lives in Hutton, just outside Preston,
was one of the first to get a booster at the vaccination hub in the town centre
this morning. âEverybody needs to have it done, itâs important that you
protect yourself,"" she said. Around 700 people will get a jab here today â although there have been days when 1,000
vaccines were delivered. Reflecting on the fact that itâs a year to the day since the
first Covid vaccine jab was given to Margaret Keenan, Angela said lots had
changed. âIt is just amazing, we just need it carrying on and to get
us all protected.â As the government announces new ""vaccine passport"" requirements for night clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of a ""devastating impact"" on the sector. It's also questioned whether the move was an attempt to distract attention from a ""damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party"". From 15 December, NHS Covid passes will become mandatory for indoor unseated venues holding more than 500 people, and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. Two vaccine doses will be sufficient for the pass, but this will be kept under review. A negative lateral flow test will also be acceptable. Read more here. People in England will soon need to show their Covid status to get into nightclubs and many other large venues. What are the new rules? In England, people will need to use theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to: People can also show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test. Businesses have a week to introduce the measures. How do I get a Covid passport? You can get the pass if you're 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any one of the following: Get the full details across the UKhere. Olaf Scholz says goodbye to his predecessor Angela Merkel at the chancellery in Berlin The Covid crisis is the biggest challenge facing the country, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says. Afterformally taking power from Angela Merkelfollowing her historic 16 years as leader, Scholz acknowledged that he had taken control of Europe's largest economy in the middle of an aggressive fourth wave of Covid infections. ""We know that the transition that we are making here now is taking place in the middle of a large, ongoing crisis that calls for continuity and community and I think we will manage that,"" he said in Berlin. Scholz said, however, that it would only be possible to fight the virus if the public got vaccinated and received their booster shots as soon as possible. The soft-spoken 63-year-old also said that restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing needed to be followed. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says Covid is spreading quickly in the country France's fifth wave of Covid infections has not yet peaked and so a fourth vaccine shot might be needed to help keep things under control, officials have warned. ""It's still spreading quickly and will continue to do so in the coming weeks,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Meanwhile, government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said: ""For now, there's a call for one booster shot. Will that be enough? I don't know. Maybe we'll need a fourth shot."" Last week, French health authorities said the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was likely to become the most prevalent variant in the country by early next year. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said France's fifth Covid wave was spreading fast and having a big impact on hospitals, with a patient admitted to intensive care on average every 10 minutes. France recorded more than 59,000 cases on Wednesday Away from events in the UK, France has recorded
its highest daily Covid cases since November 2020. The country reported 59,019 Covid cases on Wednesday with
168 Covid deaths. Europeâs Covid rate has been rising rapidly in recent weeks
and new restrictions have been imposed in a number of nations. Austria, which is back under lockdown, has announced mandatory vaccinations while Germany is also mulling making jabs compulsory. Belgium has tightened rules on face masks and Italy has introduced a ""green pass"" which is required at workplaces, venues and on public transport. Last month The World Health Organization said itwas âvery worriedâ about the spread of Covid-19 in Europe. Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans
Kluge warned that 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent
action is taken. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Armed
with ahastily arranged inquiry and the resignation of his former spokesperson Allegra Stratton, the prime minister could demonstrate at his press conference that that he wasn't
hiding from questions on the Downing Street party of last year. There were
caveats to his ""guidance was followed"" mantra  - such as ""as far as I am
aware"" - and he was pushed to broaden the remit of the cabinet secretary's
inquiry. But
in replying to Laura Kuenssberg's question on trust, he emphasised his trust in
the British people rather than fully addressing whether they could trust him. As
many of the Plan B measures won't be introduced until next week, questions will
inevitably be asked about whether the public health message would have landed
with more impact had the press conference been held on a different day. His
critics - and that includes some Conservatives - say he was indulging in a ""dead cat"" strategy to divert attention from whatever had been going on behind
the black door of Downing Street. But it seemed at this press conference that
the feline was still alive and prowling around the prime minister. Christmas trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abramovitch While some companies, such as delivery firms, thrived under England's working from home rules, others fear more uncertainty from the government's latest Plan B guidance. David Abramovitch, co-founder of Grind, says his chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London were just starting to get back on their financial feet after the previous lockdown. It will be ""painful"" to go into ""reverse gear again"", he tells the BBC. ""Already we've seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since the Omicron variant emerged."" Meanwhile Ruth, a dentist, says she feels like people have learned enough to keep working as they are. ""With the vaccinations and the [personal protective equipment], we have to learn to live with these things. If you lock people down constantly, they're not going to behave themselves."" Allegra Stratton made a tearful statement earlier today after a video of her joking with colleagues emerged The Metropolitan Police will not launch an investigation into the video of No 10 staff joking about holding a Christmas party when London was under Tier 3 restrictions last year. They say the video ""does not provide evidence of a breach"" of health regulations and instead ""restates allegations made in the media"". In a statement, the force says it had received ""a significant amount of correspondence"" over the video, obtained by ITV.

his press conference that: âTo the best of my knowledge, we have followed the
rules throughout.â He had been questioned about why the cabinet secretary had been asked to look into the
Downing Street party on 18 December last year and the Department for Education party, but
not a number of other parties that have been reported to have taken place. At
the time, the governmentâs guidance specifically said that there should not be
Christmas parties. London
was in Tier 3 restrictions on 18 December 2020 and the law said that there should
not be indoor gatherings - unless they were âreasonably necessaryâ for work. You

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Why all these changes announced today? A fresh analysis published by the UK Health Security Agency
suggests the Omicron variant will be responsible for at least 50% of Covid cases within two to
four weeks. The prediction is based on the number of cases judged to be
suspected Omicron from testing data. That shows around 2% of daily cases are being caused by the
new variant. If that is correct it would mean there are about 1,000 Omicron cases every 24 hours. What is more, the cases are thought to be doubling every two
or three days. What is not yet known is whether Omicron will completely
replace Delta, the variant that is currently dominant. if you missed all that, the government has announced new Covid rules for England, in response to concern over the Omicron variant. Here's a sum-up of the latest rules and youcan read more here in our guide. This video can not be played Omicron: Boris Johnson announces Plan B Covid rules for England In that press conference from Downing Street just now, Boris Johnson  unveiled the ""Plan B"" Covid rules for England. This means that people should start working from home where necessary from Monday. Mask wearing is going to become a more common sight again, as indoor public venues such as cinemas and theatres will require masks from Friday. An NHS Covid pass, proving vaccination or a negative test, will be requires for nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather from a week's time. Daily testing will be a requirement for those who come into contact with a positive case of Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

Scots Tory leader: PM must quit if he misled MPs,"This video can not be played Douglas Ross: ""There is absolutely no way you can mislead parliament and think you could get off with that."" Boris Johnson must resign if he misled parliament about a Christmas party at Downing Street, the Scottish Conservative leader has said. Douglas Ross said there had clearly been a party of some sort, which would have been against Covid rules. Theprime minister has apologised for a videoshowing Downing Street staff joking about a party last year. But he said he had been ""repeatedly assured"" that there was no party and that no rules were broken. Mr Ross said he had been ""angry, annoyed and really disappointed"" at the video that emerged on Tuesday night, adding that the affair undermined public trust in the Covid rules. He said he still had confidence in the prime minister to lead the country, but added it would be ""completely unacceptable"" if he was found to have misled parliament on the issue. PM sorry for video after anger about lockdown party What next for Johnson after the No 10 party video? Covid families 'sickened' by No 10 Christmas party Mr Ross added: ""If the prime minister knew about this party last December, knew about this party last week, and was still denying it, then that is the most serious allegation. ""There is absolutely no way you can mislead parliament and think you could get off with that. ""No one should continue in their post if they mislead parliament in that way."" Labour has questioned Mr Johnson's ""moral authority"" to lead the country during the pandemic, while the SNP has called for him to resign. This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson apologise over video of Downing Street staff mocking Christmas party Downing Street has spent the past week denying that a gathering had taken place at Downing Street on 18 December, at a time when London was in tier three of Covid restrictions and people had been told not to hold Christmas parties. A source who attended told the BBC that several dozen people had attended an event which included food, drink and party games, and went on past midnight. And a video obtained by ITV News has now shown the prime minister's then press chief, Allegra Stratton, joking about the party four days after it was said to have been held.Ms Stratton has since resigned. Mr Johnson apologised for the video at the start of his weekly question session in the Commons, saying: ""I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing Number Ten staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures."" Cabinet Secretary Simon Case - the top civil servant at Downing Street - is to investigate whether Covid rules were broken, with Mr Johnson saying there would ""disciplinary action for all those involved"" if they were. Mr Ross said that this review must provide answers quickly, saying ""there are still an awful lot of questions that remain unanswered"". He said Mr Johnson still had his confidence as prime minister, but that ""his government have to respond to the very serious allegations that are being made very quickly"". Allow Twitter content?

Half of Scotland's Omicron cases in under 40s,"Nearly half of all confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in Scotland are in the 20-39 age group,official figures show.,external A total of 389 confirmed or possible cases have now been reported, with 108 cases having been confirmed between 1 November and 8 December. Of those, 48% were aged 20 to 39 - compared with 25% of all cases in that age group. Public Health Scotland (PHS) said it was not aware of any hospitalisations. Positive tests have been reported in nine of Scotland's 14 health boards. PHS said there had been early detection of a large number of cases at events which typically attract younger people. These includeda concert by the pop band Steps at Glasgow's Hydro venueon 22 November which has been linked to six of the cases. Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? Omicron: Will new measures against variant work? How can I tell I have Omicron? The emergence of the new variant has led to fears of widespread community transmission. First MinisterNicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that she expected numbers to go up, and for the variant to ""account for a rising share of overall cases"". She said the emergence of Omicron was a ""significant challenge for all of us"". Early data has suggested that the variant is more transmissible than the currently dominant Delta, Ms Sturgeon added, and ""perhaps significantly so"". Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said ""key questions"" still remained about the new strain. Speakinga year on from the first Covid vaccination in Scotland, he told the BBC: ""We still need to find answers about what does it mean for severity of illness and what does it mean about transmissibility? ""We still don't know about vaccine escape and the effect of the vaccine. What we do know is that it is better to be vaccinated than not.""

Boss says sorry for 'blundered' mass Zoom firing,"This video can not be played Former Better.com employee, Christian Chapman described the Zoom call as ""excruciating"" The boss of a US mortgage company, who fired hundreds of his staff in a Zoom meeting has said he is ""deeply sorry"" for the way the lay-offs were handled. The sackings were necessary said Vishal Garg, but he accepted he had ""blundered the execution"" and ""embarrassed"" them. ""I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected,""he said in a letter on the firm's website,external. Mr Garg was heavily criticised after he sacked 900 staff in an online meeting. ""I am deeply sorry and am committed to learning from this situation and doing more to be the leader that you expect me to be,"" he said. Mr Garg said he had realised ""the way I communicated this news made a difficult situation worse"". The firm, Better.com, a start-up offering mortgages, is based in New York. US boss fires 900 employees over Zoom The big company Christmas party is off this year 'My billion pound company has no HR department' ""If you're on this call you're part of the unlucky group being laid off,"" Mr Garg told staff in the call last week. ""Your employment here is terminated. Effective immediately."" A recording of the call was shared on social media, prompting comments that sacking people this way was ""cold"", ""harsh"" and ""a horrible move"", especially in the run up to Christmas. This video can not be played Vishal Garg fires about 900 of his staff on a single Zoom call. Better.com, which aims to use technology to make the housebuying process ""faster and more efficient"", confirmed earlier this year that it plans to float the company on the stock market. A deal is likely to value the business - which Mr Garg founded in 2015 - at between $6.9bn (Â£5.2bn) and $7.7bn. ""Hi everyone, thank you for joining. I come to you with not great news. The market has changed, as you know, and we have to move with it in order to survive so that hopefully we can continue to thrive and deliver on our mission. ""This isn't news that you're going to want to hear but ultimately it was my decision and I wanted you to hear it from me. It's been a really, really challenging decision to make. This is the second time in my career that I'm doing this and I do not want to do this. The last time I did it I cried. This time I hope to be stronger. But we are laying off about 15% of the company for [a number of] reasons: the market, efficiency and performances and productivity. ""If you're on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated. Effective immediately."" Mr Garg told staff he was grateful for their contribution. ""I believe in you, I believe in Better, and I believe that working together we can make homeownership better together,"" he wrote. ""Organisations do have to make job cuts sometimes, it is a hard reality,"" says Rachel Suff, senior policy adviser on employee relations at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. ""But how they go about it and the humanity they approach it with can have a fundamental impact on how people deal with that shocking news."" Ms Suff points out that the situation facing Better.com's staff in the US would not happen in the UK. Legally, UK employers have to enter a consultation period with workers of at least 30 days, or 45 days if more than 100 people are being made redundant. During that period ""people should be given the right phrasing, eased into it, given warning, prepared for the news and explained the reasons why"", she says. UK employers also have to look for alternative roles for workers. ""An employer really needs to tell people that they've exhausted every possible alternative, it is the last thing they wanted to do - it is about being able to leave with your dignity and respect intact."" Ms Suff adds that while a lot of focus regarding Better.com has been about Mr Garg using Zoom to fire staff, the approach is incredibly important. ""If you notice as well [Mr Garg] talks about the impact on himself. He says: 'I cried the last time'. But who's losing their job here? It was very rich, talking about the impact on himself - what about them?"" US father fired on Zoom describes 'callous' call.

Vaccine passports 'devastating' for nightclubs,"New rules requiring people to have Covid passports to enter nightclubs in England will have a ""devastating impact"", the industry has said. The Night Time Industries Association said it came at the worst possible time, with the pre-Christmas period ""absolutely crucial"" for the sector. The rules affect indoor venues holding more than 500 people and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. People will need an NHS Covid pass or negative lateral flow test to enter. The new rules for nightclubs will come into force on Wednesday 15 December. Covid passes, which have been implemented inScotlandandWales, have caused a 30% and 26% drop-off in trade respectively, NTIA chief executive Michael Kill said. ""Vaccine passports will have a devastating impact on a sector already so bruised by the pandemic,"" Mr Kill said. ""The mixed public health messages this week that have been coming out of the government have arrived at the worst possible time - the pre-Christmas period is absolutely crucial for our sector. And now it is announced damaging vaccine passports are to be implemented. ""Far from 'saving' Christmas, the prime minister has given our sector the horrible present of more pain for businesses desperately trying to recoup losses from earlier in the pandemic."" Who needs a Covid passport and how do I get one? England braces for Plan B Covid rule changes Omicron: What are the new Plan B rules for England? A government report in June found that vaccine passports could have effects including discouraging people from attending venues. It concluded that, at the time, the impact of bringing them in would be out of proportion to the public health benefits. Given that, Mr Kill questioned the timing and rationale of the government move. ""Is this sound evidence-based public policy making, or is this an attempt to move the news agenda on from a damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party?"" Nightclub operator Rekom, which has more than 40 venues across the UK, said it was ""disappointed, but sadly not surprised"" by the government move. Peter Marks, chairman of its UK board, said there was ""no evidence anywhere in the world"" that nightclubs had caused an increase in Covid cases. ""It is not only unjust to single out the late-night sector, but it will have no impact on transmission rates,"" he added. Jeremy Joseph, who owns the London nightclubs G-A-Y and Heaven, said the clubs had been ""really busy"" when they first reopened after previous restrictions, but ""it has dropped in the last couple of weeks since the variant has come out, and you can see there has been more of a nervousness to go out"". He said his clubs had a chance to recover after previous restrictions were lifted, but any money they made was put aside. ""The whole way through this we've been walking on eggshells because we never know what is going to happen,"" Mr Joseph said. ""I feel like I'm constantly in survival mode."" He said the new restrictions ""don't make any sense"". ""I've got three venues, and each is going to have different rules,"" he said. ""It makes no sense. It's as if this government thinks that Covid will go: 'That venue has a capacity of under 500, so I won't go in there'."" ""If I go to G-A-Y bar on Old Compton Street [in London] our capacity is 450 - there are no restrictions, so it's just: Carry on as normal."" Mr Joseph said he wasn't against vaccine passports, and that he was glad people could show lateral flow test results ""so at least that doesn't alienate people, but you can't have one rule for one type of venue, and a different rule for another"".

PM sorry for video after anger about lockdown party,"This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson apologise over video of Downing Street staff mocking Christmas party Boris Johnson has apologised for a video showing Downing Street staff joking about a lockdown Christmas party in No 10, amid mounting public fury. The PM said he shared people's anger and had ordered an inquiry into whether rules had been broken. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was taking people for fools and the PM should just admit what had happened. MPs lined up to criticise Mr Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions, withone Labour MP asking how he slept at night. Replying to Rosena Allin Khan, who also works as a doctor in a London hospital, Mr Johnson said he took ""full responsibility for everything the government has done"". Live: Lockdown party controversy Stratton quits as adviser after party video row Covid bereaved families 'fuming' at No 10 party But in his apology, the PM suggested he had been misled about the Christmas party on 18 December last year. He said he had been ""repeatedly assured that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken"". He apologised ""unreservedly"" for the offence caused by the video clip, claiming that he was ""furious"" about it. Mr Johnson's former press chief Allegra Stratton - who was filmed joking with colleagues about the party in a video leaked to ITV - resigned as a government adviser three hours after the PM's apology. In a tearful statement, she said: ""My remarks seemed to make light of the rules, rules that people were doing everything to obey. ""That was never my intention. I will regret those remarks for the rest of my days and I offer my profound apologies to all of you at home for them."" In response to questioning from Sir Keir, the PM agreed that any evidence uncovered about parties in Downing Street would be handed over to police. This video can not be played Starmer asks Johnson: Do you have moral authority to lead? Sir Keir questioned Mr Johnson's ""moral authority"" to lead the country during the pandemic, contrasting his actions with those of the Queen. ""Her Majesty the Queen sat alone when she marked the passing of the man she'd been married to for 73 years. Leadership, sacrifice - that's what gives leaders the moral authority to lead,"" said the Labour leader. ""Does the prime minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules?"" Mr Johnson claimed the Labour Party and Sir Keir ""have played politics throughout this pandemic"". He accused Sir Keir of trying to ""muddy the waters, to confuse the public and to cause needless confusion about the guidance"". Sir Keir replied: ""That's so desperate and even his own side can see it."" This video can not be played Watch: Video obtained by ITV News shows Downing Street staff joking about a No 10 Christmas party during a mock press conference SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that if the prime minister did not resign, ""he must be removed"". ""People have sacrificed at times to the point of breaking, while the UK government has laughed in their faces. It is clear that this prime minister has lost the support of the public and now even of his own benches,"" he told MPs. Conservative MPs also fear the government's credibility has been damaged, with some warning it could harm Mr Johnson's ability to impose further coronavirus lockdowns. And Tory MP William Wragg accused Mr Johnson of planning to ""initiate Covid Winter Plan B"" later on Wednesday without a statement to MPs, adding ""very few will be convinced by this diversionary tactic"". Mr Johnson replied: ""No decisions will be taken without consulting the Cabinet."" One Conservative Party member called into BBC Radio 5 Live to say she had decided to resign after the PM's apology, accusing him of telling ""barefaced lies"". Melanie, who did not give her full name, said: ""I fully supported him during Covid. ""I was one of the people who didn't get to see my mum last Christmas and that's hard. And then the thought that they were having a party? ""I don't care Boris, step away, you go away and sort it out and let somebody else be a leader. We need a leader."" This video can not be played The SNP's Ian Blackford says the prime minister ""has no dignity"" and must leave office Downing Street has spent the past week denying that a party had taken place at all on 18 December. But that line fell apart when the video emerged showing No 10 staff joking about the party four days after it had taken place. At the time, the government's coronavirus guidance specifically stated that people should not have Christmas parties - and gatherings in London of two or more people indoors were banned unless they were ""reasonably necessary"" for work. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, the top civil servant at Downing Street, is to investigate whether Covid rules were broken at the staff party, with the PM promising disciplinary action against offenders. Several sources have, meanwhile, told the BBC that a Christmas quiz was also organised for Downing Street staff in December 2020. One source said emails were sent out to everyone who worked in No10 inviting them to the quiz and to form teams ahead of time. They added that some people did not seem to realise ""how ridiculous"" it was at the time and that people came into the office that day wearing Christmas jumpers for it. A different source said while some people joined the quiz via Zoom, others were there in person and sat in groups of six. Multiple sources have told the BBC the quiz took place in a room used by No 10 in the Cabinet Office. On Wednesday, Downing Street insisted the quiz was ""virtual."" Andthe Mirror has reported,externalthat in December 2020, then Education Secretary Gavin Williamson held a party for staff. A spokeswoman for the education department said a ""gathering"" was held for those who were already in the office and couldn't work from home. ""Drinks and snacks were brought by those attending and no outside guests or supporting staff were invited or present.

Pupils 'pressured regularly for nude photos',"""Boys ask for nudes or keep spamming your phone,"" one girl told inspectors Pupils are pressured regularly to send nude photos and girls harassed over the length of their skirts, a school inspection report has found. About half of secondary pupils said they had experienced sexual harassment from fellow students. Estyn's study,externalfound many pupils would not tell their teachers, as incidents had become ""normalised"" and teachers often dismissed them as ""trivial"". The Welsh government said it showed an ""uncomfortable truth"" pupils faced. Children told inspectors that harassment happened in the classroom but was more common outside school and online. Inspectors said this meant schools did not realise the extent of the problem. Estyn said there were ""inconsistencies"" when teachers were alerted and, in the worst cases, staff ignored incidents of ""verbal sexual harassment"" between pupils, and often responded with statements like ""boys will be boys"". Twice as many girls said they had faced sexual harassment than boys, while 46% of those who had experienced it decided not to tell anyone else. Welsh review to be held into harassment in schools Children as young as 11 pressured for nudes Inspectors said most older girls reported being regularly pressured by boys to send nude photos. ""Boys ask for nudes or keep spamming your phone,"" one girl told inspectors. Some said it was common to have unknown men, as well as classmates, ""begging"" them to send naked images on social media. Other issues raised by children were concerns about the ""length and fit"" of school skirts. ""If you are wearing a short skirt, boys will use that as a way of consent - you are asking for it,"" one pupil told the review. Some girls felt they had to wear shorts under their skirts ""to stop boys from looking"". Meanwhile, others said they picked deliberately tight skirts because they were more difficult for boys to lift up. About 1,300 secondary school children in Wales took part in the study which found pupils' experiences of sexual harassment increased as they got older. Nearly all Year 13 pupils (95%) reported seeing sexual harassment, with 72% claiming to have seen it happening in school. ""The report is called We Don't Tell Our Teachers - and that is what we've found,"" said report author Delyth Gray. ""There is a sharp polarisation between what pupils tell us is happening and what staff in schools actually know. ""They [the pupils] don't think that these things are important enough to report to their teachers, although they tend to happen every day."" Ms Gray said teachers had told inspectors they wanted to see more training opportunities to help them deal with issues, while children wanted to see teachers being more proactive and aware of the problems. Her review recommended that schools recognise sexual harassment was ""highly prevalent"" among young people and ""provide sufficient, cumulative and beneficial learning opportunities"". Many children highlighted a lack of sex education, with ""older pupils in many schools"" reporting they had ""no sex education at all"". Sally Holland said more time should be devoted to teaching sex education beyond the age of 14 Sending nudes has become normal, say pupils Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a nightd Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said opportunities to learn about sex and relationships were often ""squeezed out"" of the curriculum to make room for formal qualifications as children got older. ""Sometimes it actually doesn't exist after young people are aged about 14, which is the time there should be more time to do it,"" she said. ""Schools need to be given permission within the education system to give time for these important life, health and safety issues."" Ms Holland said thenew curriculum for Wales, which includes mandatory relationships and sexuality education, provided ""good opportunities"" to do things better. The Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said teachers should not be left alone to deal with deeper societal problems. ""Schools will find the criticism levelled at them in Estyn's report both frustrating and unfair as they put huge effort into placing the wellbeing of their students at the very heart of everything they do,"" said Eithne Hughes, director of ASCL Cymru. ""It is totally unreasonable for Estyn to imply this is a problem only schools should have to deal with. ""They are a microcosm of society and the important issues raised in this report can only be dealt with by there being an open and wide-ranging national discussion that involves not only teachers and leaders, but parents, the social media platforms where so much of the abuse takes place, the Welsh government and, most importantly, young people."" An online questionnaire from Estyn, answered by 1,150 pupils, and included in the report's supporting documents, found that 23% boys and 26% girls at secondary school said they had experienced unwanted kissing or sexual touching in a school setting. Director Eithne Hughes said: ""The important issues raised in this report can only be dealt with by there being an open and wide-ranging national discussion that involves not only teachers and leaders, but parents, the social media platforms - where so much of the abuse takes place - the Welsh government and, most importantly, young people."" An online questionnaire from Estyn, answered by 1,150 pupils, and included in the report's supporting documents, found that 23% boys and 26% girls at secondary school said they had experienced unwanted kissing or sexual touching in a school setting. Inspectors also found many LGBTQ+ pupils had ""substantial personal experiences"" of homophobic bullying and harassment. Most LGBTQ+ pupils surveyed by Estyn said they felt ""only a few teachers"" would do anything about it if they heard homophobic slurs being used against them. ""It highlights the uncomfortable truth about the prevalence of peer-on-peer sexual harassment,"" said Jeremy Miles Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the report ""makes for difficult reading"" and he thanked contributors for their ""bravery"". ""It highlights the uncomfortable truth about the prevalence of peer-on-peer sexual harassment in our schools and that children often share their experiences with friends rather than their teachers,"" he said. ""This leads to a lack of awareness of the true scale of sexual harassment in schools. ""It is only through honest conversations that we can work together to tackle these issues."" He said the reported also recognised ""how strong leadership and proactive approaches encourage and empower pupils to trust their teachers, stand up to their peers, and report all forms of sexual harassment"". ""Schools and settings have an important role to play in creating safe and empowering environments in supporting learners to enjoy fulfilling, healthy and safe relationships throughout their lives,"" he added.

'It will be painful to go into reverse gear again',"Clive Watson says office parties are now being cancelled Hospitality firms have warned they face a collapse in demand at their busiest time of year due to the government's new work-from-home guidance. The measures, designed to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, come in from Monday. One trade body called them a ""body blow"" to already-struggling pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues. Pub chain boss Clive Watson said some pubs could ""run out of cash"" without extra help from the government. However, the government is not planning any new economic support measures. Mr Watson said the City Pub Company, which has 44 sites in England and Wales, was just starting to get back on its feet after a rough 18 months. But he said the government was ""turning off the life support machine yet again"" by bringing back home-working. New rules on home working and masks in England What's the new guidance on working from home? How will Plan B affect the economy? ""From about 10 days ago office parties started to get cancelled [because of Omicron]. Going forward after yesterday's announcement that is only going to accelerate,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""What government has got to appreciate is for businesses, particularly in our sector, Christmas is always a key time."" The City Pub Company makes about a third of its annual profits in December, which tides it over in the quiet months of January and February. Hospitality firms fear losing vital passing trade as more people work from home. Businesses from dry cleaners to coffee houses depend on an office crowd, particularly in city centres. By contrast, those that cater to people in their homes, such as takeaways and supermarkets stand to gain from the new guidance. We talked to firms that rely on commuters about how the new home-working guidance will affect them. Passing trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abrahamovitch David Abrahamovitch runs Grind, a chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London, employing 250 staff. He also has a successful online store selling compostable coffee pods for Nespresso machines, and says he can ""fall back"" on that side of the business if things get tough. ""A lot of other hospitality businesses won't have that, so we're lucky,"" he told the BBC. ""But it will still be painful to watch the company go into reverse gear again."" Grind relies on people coming into central London and has also has seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since Omicron emerged, which Mr Abrahamovitch thinks will get worse. He is nervous about how the landlords he rents his shops from will react if things really slow down. ""They have already given a lot [of leeway in the pandemic], and everyone has their limits. They have businesses to run too."" James Greenhalgh says the uncertainty makes it impossible to plan ahead It's a similar story for James Greenhalgh, owner of the Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds city centre, who says about 50% his trade comes from the local office crowd. ""We've had such a hard time in the pandemic and things were just starting to pick up again. It's just so hard. I've genuinely thought about throwing in the towel."" His thinks the government's approach will stifle business growth. He was just about to agree a lease on bigger second shop but has now put that plan on ice. ""The rules seem to change every week, which makes it impossible for businesses to plan ahead,"" he said. ""The government should have been clear with business owners what might happen if a new variant came along. They should have told us about the contingency plans."" A study from the University of Sheffield suggests city centres stand to lose Â£3bn in 2022 due to more people working from home. Dr Jesse Matheson, lead author of the paper, said: ""This decrease will be concentrated in a few very dense centres; for example, the City of London will experience a spending decrease of 31.6%, and central Birmingham will experience a decrease of 8%. ""Some of this spending will be realised in the residential areas where these workers live, but some may be lost altogether."" Rich Bool was already noticing more staff working from home, even before the latest restrictions. He runs a mobile cafÃ©, making up to 30 trips a day to offices and industrial estates. ""It can be so difficult trying to work out from one week to the next what stocks and sandwiches you need,"" he told the BBC. ""There are just so many variables. More uncertainty is never welcome."" He has, however, learned a lot from previous lockdowns and mass home-working. Having a van means his Chippenham-based Cafe2U service can be nimble, going to where the best custom might be. Mr Bool now even visits some customers at their homes. ""We've built up a trusted relationship with some of our customers when we went to their offices. Now we take our food and drink to a few of them at home,"" he said. ""Obviously it's easy to make your own sandwich. But when you're working from home all the time, sometimes it's good to buy something if it's on your doorstep."" New rules on home working and masks for England How will Plan B affect the economy?

What Covid rules do holiday destinations have?,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home.

Omicron: Who needs to self-isolate now?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible.

However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days.

In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people.

What Covid rules do holiday destinations have?Omicron: Who needs to self-isolate now?,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations.

Home-working and more mask rules in England - PM,"Boris Johnson has announced tougher Covid-19 measures in England to control the spread of the Omicron variant Guidance to work from home will return on Monday and face masks will also have to be worn in more public venues Covid passes proving vaccination or a negative test will be required at nightclubs and venues with large crowds The Plan B restrictions are ""proportionate and responsible"", the PM says Health Secretary Sajid Javid meanwhile tells the Commons that Omicron is much more transmissible than the Delta variant Earlier the PM apologised for a video that showed his staff joking about a Christmas party held during lockdown last December and ordered an inquiry The Met Police has said it will not investigate the video because it does not ""provide evidence"" regulations were breached Allegra Stratton, who was Johnson's spokeswoman at the time, has resigned from No 10 over the video Edited by Emma Owen and Claire Heald We're drawing coverage of today's busy coronavirus news to a close. But do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott, Nathan Williams, Sophie Williams, Dulcie Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Joshua Cheetham and Mal Siret. And the page was edited by Emma Owen, Claire Heald and Kevin Ponniah. It's been an eventful and fast-moving day of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main stories: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva At its weekly Covid 19 briefing, today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was some initial evidence that the Omicron variant was more infectious, that vaccines could be somewhat less effective against it, but that its health effects might be less severe. But officials stressed that more research is needed, and warned again that countries must act now to prepare for another pandemic wave. A priority must be vaccinating the unvaccinated, and reliable public health measures such as mask wearing, testing, and social distancing. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told governments waiting to act until hospitals started to fill up would be too late. WHO officials also said booster vaccines should not be a priority - saying all the evidence shows existing vaccines provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalisations, and death. Governments must instead make every effort to reach vaccine hesitant people, and ramp up mass vaccination in largely unvaccinated countries. The new rule for some venues to introduce Covid certification is an ""unfair double
standard"" the live music industry says. Pubs and bars will not have to ask for Covid passports ""whilst
live music venues get hit with certification"", according to industry trade association Live. Covid health certificates will be required for people to enter English unseated indoor venues with more than 500 attendees. Meanwhile, The Theatres Trust said the rise of the Omicron variant and the new measures will ""have a big
impact on the willingness of people to travel and go to theatres over Christmas"". The organisation's director Jon Morgan said: ""This will have a knock-on effect on theatresâ viability at a vital time of year
for the industry and Christmas shows that are just emerging from the
significant loss of revenue in 2020 and early 2021."" Mark Harper and other Tory backbenchers expressed opposition to Plan B Back to the announcement of Plan B restrictions for England - and there is an indication that some backbench Tory MPs will not support the government when it puts them to a vote. The Workington MP Mark Jenkinson says the rules are ""divisive, discriminatory and are unlikely to stop spread"". In atweet,external, he adds the health secretary, who addressed MPs at the same time the prime minister made his announcement, ""offered no evidence for further restrictions...  just as businesses desperately need a good Christmas"". Instead, vaccination was key in the response to the Omicron variant he said. East Devon MP Simon Jupp says Plan B will cost jobs in many sectors, including hospitality. While working from home wonât help social or economic recovery. And former chief whip Mark Harper suggests the ""initial evidence on Omicron doesn't support these measures"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Prof Chris Whitty says vaccines are a useful way to prevent serious infection Introducing more restrictions in England just before Christmas for
the second year running is, of course, depressing. But this is vastly different from last year. Then, large
parts of the country were put into what was effectively lockdown with tier
four. A full national lockdown followed in the new year. This time, with these latest Plan B measures, society is being kept open - just with extra
precautions being taken. As England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, we are in
an immeasurably better position now. That is down to immunity built up by
vaccination and previous infection. This variant can dodge some of those defences - but not
all. A step back, but by no means a return to square one. Dominic HughesHealth correspondent, in Preston Angela Roberts got her booster jab this morning There's been lots going on today but one important thing to remind you of is thatpeople aged 40 and over in England can now book their booster jabfor three months after their second dose. Angela Roberts, who lives in Hutton, just outside Preston,
was one of the first to get a booster at the vaccination hub in the town centre
this morning. âEverybody needs to have it done, itâs important that you
protect yourself,"" she said. Around 700 people will get a jab here today â although there have been days when 1,000
vaccines were delivered. Reflecting on the fact that itâs a year to the day since the
first Covid vaccine jab was given to Margaret Keenan, Angela said lots had
changed. âIt is just amazing, we just need it carrying on and to get
us all protected.â As the government announces new ""vaccine passport"" requirements for night clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of a ""devastating impact"" on the sector. It's also questioned whether the move was an attempt to distract attention from a ""damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party"". From 15 December, NHS Covid passes will become mandatory for indoor unseated venues holding more than 500 people, and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. Two vaccine doses will be sufficient for the pass, but this will be kept under review. A negative lateral flow test will also be acceptable. Read more here. People in England will soon need to show their Covid status to get into nightclubs and many other large venues. What are the new rules? In England, people will need to use theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to: People can also show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test. Businesses have a week to introduce the measures. How do I get a Covid passport? You can get the pass if you're 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any one of the following: Get the full details across the UKhere. Olaf Scholz says goodbye to his predecessor Angela Merkel at the chancellery in Berlin The Covid crisis is the biggest challenge facing the country, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says. Afterformally taking power from Angela Merkelfollowing her historic 16 years as leader, Scholz acknowledged that he had taken control of Europe's largest economy in the middle of an aggressive fourth wave of Covid infections. ""We know that the transition that we are making here now is taking place in the middle of a large, ongoing crisis that calls for continuity and community and I think we will manage that,"" he said in Berlin. Scholz said, however, that it would only be possible to fight the virus if the public got vaccinated and received their booster shots as soon as possible. The soft-spoken 63-year-old also said that restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing needed to be followed. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says Covid is spreading quickly in the country France's fifth wave of Covid infections has not yet peaked and so a fourth vaccine shot might be needed to help keep things under control, officials have warned. ""It's still spreading quickly and will continue to do so in the coming weeks,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Meanwhile, government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said: ""For now, there's a call for one booster shot. Will that be enough? I don't know. Maybe we'll need a fourth shot."" Last week, French health authorities said the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was likely to become the most prevalent variant in the country by early next year. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said France's fifth Covid wave was spreading fast and having a big impact on hospitals, with a patient admitted to intensive care on average every 10 minutes. France recorded more than 59,000 cases on Wednesday Away from events in the UK, France has recorded
its highest daily Covid cases since November 2020. The country reported 59,019 Covid cases on Wednesday with
168 Covid deaths. Europeâs Covid rate has been rising rapidly in recent weeks
and new restrictions have been imposed in a number of nations. Austria, which is back under lockdown, has announced mandatory vaccinations while Germany is also mulling making jabs compulsory. Belgium has tightened rules on face masks and Italy has introduced a ""green pass"" which is required at workplaces, venues and on public transport. Last month The World Health Organization said itwas âvery worriedâ about the spread of Covid-19 in Europe. Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans
Kluge warned that 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent
action is taken. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Armed
with ahastily arranged inquiry and the resignation of his former spokesperson Allegra Stratton, the prime minister could demonstrate at his press conference that that he wasn't
hiding from questions on the Downing Street party of last year. There were
caveats to his ""guidance was followed"" mantra  - such as ""as far as I am
aware"" - and he was pushed to broaden the remit of the cabinet secretary's
inquiry. But
in replying to Laura Kuenssberg's question on trust, he emphasised his trust in
the British people rather than fully addressing whether they could trust him. As
many of the Plan B measures won't be introduced until next week, questions will
inevitably be asked about whether the public health message would have landed
with more impact had the press conference been held on a different day. His
critics - and that includes some Conservatives - say he was indulging in a ""dead cat"" strategy to divert attention from whatever had been going on behind
the black door of Downing Street. But it seemed at this press conference that
the feline was still alive and prowling around the prime minister. Christmas trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abramovitch While some companies, such as delivery firms, thrived under England's working from home rules, others fear more uncertainty from the government's latest Plan B guidance. David Abramovitch, co-founder of Grind, says his chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London were just starting to get back on their financial feet after the previous lockdown. It will be ""painful"" to go into ""reverse gear again"", he tells the BBC. ""Already we've seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since the Omicron variant emerged."" Meanwhile Ruth, a dentist, says she feels like people have learned enough to keep working as they are. ""With the vaccinations and the [personal protective equipment], we have to learn to live with these things. If you lock people down constantly, they're not going to behave themselves."" Allegra Stratton made a tearful statement earlier today after a video of her joking with colleagues emerged The Metropolitan Police will not launch an investigation into the video of No 10 staff joking about holding a Christmas party when London was under Tier 3 restrictions last year. They say the video ""does not provide evidence of a breach"" of health regulations and instead ""restates allegations made in the media"". In a statement, the force says it had received ""a significant amount of correspondence"" over the video, obtained by ITV.

his press conference that: âTo the best of my knowledge, we have followed the

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Why all these changes announced today? A fresh analysis published by the UK Health Security Agency
suggests the Omicron variant will be responsible for at least 50% of Covid cases within two to
four weeks. The prediction is based on the number of cases judged to be
suspected Omicron from testing data. That shows around 2% of daily cases are being caused by the
new variant. If that is correct it would mean there are about 1,000 Omicron cases every 24 hours. What is more, the cases are thought to be doubling every two
or three days. What is not yet known is whether Omicron will completely
replace Delta, the variant that is currently dominant. if you missed all that, the government has announced new Covid rules for England, in response to concern over the Omicron variant. Here's a sum-up of the latest rules and youcan read more here in our guide. This video can not be played Omicron: Boris Johnson announces Plan B Covid rules for England In that press conference from Downing Street just now, Boris Johnson  unveiled the ""Plan B"" Covid rules for England.

But do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott, Nathan Williams, Sophie Williams, Dulcie Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Joshua Cheetham and Mal Siret. And the page was edited by Emma Owen, Claire Heald and Kevin Ponniah. It's been an eventful and fast-moving day of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main stories: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva At its weekly Covid 19 briefing, today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was some initial evidence that the Omicron variant was more infectious, that vaccines could be somewhat less effective against it, but that its health effects might be less severe. But officials stressed that more research is needed, and warned again that countries must act now to prepare for another pandemic wave. A priority must be vaccinating the unvaccinated, and reliable public health measures such as mask wearing, testing, and social distancing. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told governments waiting to act until hospitals started to fill up would be too late. WHO officials also said booster vaccines should not be a priority - saying all the evidence shows existing vaccines provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalisations, and death. Governments must instead make every effort to reach vaccine hesitant people, and ramp up mass vaccination in largely unvaccinated countries. The new rule for some venues to introduce Covid certification is an ""unfair double
standard"" the live music industry says. Pubs and bars will not have to ask for Covid passports ""whilst
live music venues get hit with certification"", according to industry trade association Live. Covid health certificates will be required for people to enter English unseated indoor venues with more than 500 attendees. Meanwhile, The Theatres Trust said the rise of the Omicron variant and the new measures will ""have a big
impact on the willingness of people to travel and go to theatres over Christmas"". The organisation's director Jon Morgan said: ""This will have a knock-on effect on theatresâ viability at a vital time of year
for the industry and Christmas shows that are just emerging from the
significant loss of revenue in 2020 and early 2021."" Mark Harper and other Tory backbenchers expressed opposition to Plan B Back to the announcement of Plan B restrictions for England - and there is an indication that some backbench Tory MPs will not support the government when it puts them to a vote. The Workington MP Mark Jenkinson says the rules are ""divisive, discriminatory and are unlikely to stop spread"". In atweet,external, he adds the health secretary, who addressed MPs at the same time the prime minister made his announcement, ""offered no evidence for further restrictions...  just as businesses desperately need a good Christmas"". Instead, vaccination was key in the response to the Omicron variant he said. East Devon MP Simon Jupp says Plan B will cost jobs in many sectors, including hospitality. While working from home wonât help social or economic recovery. And former chief whip Mark Harper suggests the ""initial evidence on Omicron doesn't support these measures"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Prof Chris Whitty says vaccines are a useful way to prevent serious infection Introducing more restrictions in England just before Christmas for
the second year running is, of course, depressing. But this is vastly different from last year. Then, large
parts of the country were put into what was effectively lockdown with tier
four. A full national lockdown followed in the new year. This time, with these latest Plan B measures, society is being kept open - just with extra
precautions being taken. As England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, we are in
an immeasurably better position now. That is down to immunity built up by
vaccination and previous infection. This variant can dodge some of those defences - but not
all. A step back, but by no means a return to square one. Dominic HughesHealth correspondent, in Preston Angela Roberts got her booster jab this morning There's been lots going on today but one important thing to remind you of is thatpeople aged 40 and over in England can now book their booster jabfor three months after their second dose. Angela Roberts, who lives in Hutton, just outside Preston,
was one of the first to get a booster at the vaccination hub in the town centre
this morning. âEverybody needs to have it done, itâs important that you
protect yourself,"" she said. Around 700 people will get a jab here today â although there have been days when 1,000
vaccines were delivered. Reflecting on the fact that itâs a year to the day since the
first Covid vaccine jab was given to Margaret Keenan, Angela said lots had
changed. âIt is just amazing, we just need it carrying on and to get
us all protected.â As the government announces new ""vaccine passport"" requirements for night clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of a ""devastating impact"" on the sector. It's also questioned whether the move was an attempt to distract attention from a ""damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party"". From 15 December, NHS Covid passes will become mandatory for indoor unseated venues holding more than 500 people, and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. Two vaccine doses will be sufficient for the pass, but this will be kept under review. A negative lateral flow test will also be acceptable. Read more here. People in England will soon need to show their Covid status to get into nightclubs and many other large venues. What are the new rules? In England, people will need to use theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to: People can also show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test. Businesses have a week to introduce the measures. How do I get a Covid passport? You can get the pass if you're 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any one of the following: Get the full details across the UKhere. Olaf Scholz says goodbye to his predecessor Angela Merkel at the chancellery in Berlin The Covid crisis is the biggest challenge facing the country, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says. Afterformally taking power from Angela Merkelfollowing her historic 16 years as leader, Scholz acknowledged that he had taken control of Europe's largest economy in the middle of an aggressive fourth wave of Covid infections. ""We know that the transition that we are making here now is taking place in the middle of a large, ongoing crisis that calls for continuity and community and I think we will manage that,"" he said in Berlin. Scholz said, however, that it would only be possible to fight the virus if the public got vaccinated and received their booster shots as soon as possible. The soft-spoken 63-year-old also said that restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing needed to be followed. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says Covid is spreading quickly in the country France's fifth wave of Covid infections has not yet peaked and so a fourth vaccine shot might be needed to help keep things under control, officials have warned. ""It's still spreading quickly and will continue to do so in the coming weeks,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Meanwhile, government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said: ""For now, there's a call for one booster shot. Will that be enough? I don't know. Maybe we'll need a fourth shot."" Last week, French health authorities said the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was likely to become the most prevalent variant in the country by early next year. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said France's fifth Covid wave was spreading fast and having a big impact on hospitals, with a patient admitted to intensive care on average every 10 minutes. France recorded more than 59,000 cases on Wednesday Away from events in the UK, France has recorded
its highest daily Covid cases since November 2020. The country reported 59,019 Covid cases on Wednesday with
168 Covid deaths. Europeâs Covid rate has been rising rapidly in recent weeks
and new restrictions have been imposed in a number of nations. Austria, which is back under lockdown, has announced mandatory vaccinations while Germany is also mulling making jabs compulsory. Belgium has tightened rules on face masks and Italy has introduced a ""green pass"" which is required at workplaces, venues and on public transport. Last month The World Health Organization said itwas âvery worriedâ about the spread of Covid-19 in Europe. Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans
Kluge warned that 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent
action is taken. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Armed

Hundreds still without power after Storm Barra,"There was snow in the village of Leadhills, South Lanarkshire Power has been restored to all the homes in north and north east Scotland which were left without electricity in the wake of Storm Barra. The power cuts came days after supplies were restored after Storm Arwen caused widespread damage to the network. Utility firm SSEN said engineers had restored power to more than 9,000 customers across the north of Scotland. It confirmed that the last remaining homes were reconnected at about 20:30 on Wednesday evening. The majority of those without supplies after Tuesday's storm were in Aberdeenshire.

"LiveLiveJohnson orders inquiry amid Christmas party furyThe PM pledges to investigate what happened but Labour leader Keir Starmer says he is ""taking the public for fools"".","Boris Johnson has announced tougher Covid-19 measures in England to control the spread of the Omicron variant Guidance to work from home will return on Monday and face masks will also have to be worn in more public venues Covid passes proving vaccination or a negative test will be required at nightclubs and venues with large crowds The Plan B restrictions are ""proportionate and responsible"", the PM says Health Secretary Sajid Javid meanwhile tells the Commons that Omicron is much more transmissible than the Delta variant Earlier the PM apologised for a video that showed his staff joking about a Christmas party held during lockdown last December and ordered an inquiry The Met Police has said it will not investigate the video because it does not ""provide evidence"" regulations were breached Allegra Stratton, who was Johnson's spokeswoman at the time, has resigned from No 10 over the video Edited by Emma Owen and Claire Heald We're drawing coverage of today's busy coronavirus news to a close. But do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott, Nathan Williams, Sophie Williams, Dulcie Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Joshua Cheetham and Mal Siret. And the page was edited by Emma Owen, Claire Heald and Kevin Ponniah. It's been an eventful and fast-moving day of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main stories: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva At its weekly Covid 19 briefing, today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was some initial evidence that the Omicron variant was more infectious, that vaccines could be somewhat less effective against it, but that its health effects might be less severe. But officials stressed that more research is needed, and warned again that countries must act now to prepare for another pandemic wave. A priority must be vaccinating the unvaccinated, and reliable public health measures such as mask wearing, testing, and social distancing. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told governments waiting to act until hospitals started to fill up would be too late. WHO officials also said booster vaccines should not be a priority - saying all the evidence shows existing vaccines provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalisations, and death. Governments must instead make every effort to reach vaccine hesitant people, and ramp up mass vaccination in largely unvaccinated countries. The new rule for some venues to introduce Covid certification is an ""unfair double
standard"" the live music industry says. Pubs and bars will not have to ask for Covid passports ""whilst
live music venues get hit with certification"", according to industry trade association Live. Covid health certificates will be required for people to enter English unseated indoor venues with more than 500 attendees. Meanwhile, The Theatres Trust said the rise of the Omicron variant and the new measures will ""have a big
impact on the willingness of people to travel and go to theatres over Christmas"". The organisation's director Jon Morgan said: ""This will have a knock-on effect on theatresâ viability at a vital time of year
for the industry and Christmas shows that are just emerging from the
significant loss of revenue in 2020 and early 2021."" Mark Harper and other Tory backbenchers expressed opposition to Plan B Back to the announcement of Plan B restrictions for England - and there is an indication that some backbench Tory MPs will not support the government when it puts them to a vote. The Workington MP Mark Jenkinson says the rules are ""divisive, discriminatory and are unlikely to stop spread"". In atweet,external, he adds the health secretary, who addressed MPs at the same time the prime minister made his announcement, ""offered no evidence for further restrictions...  just as businesses desperately need a good Christmas"". Instead, vaccination was key in the response to the Omicron variant he said. East Devon MP Simon Jupp says Plan B will cost jobs in many sectors, including hospitality. While working from home wonât help social or economic recovery. And former chief whip Mark Harper suggests the ""initial evidence on Omicron doesn't support these measures"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Prof Chris Whitty says vaccines are a useful way to prevent serious infection Introducing more restrictions in England just before Christmas for
the second year running is, of course, depressing. But this is vastly different from last year. Then, large
parts of the country were put into what was effectively lockdown with tier
four. A full national lockdown followed in the new year. This time, with these latest Plan B measures, society is being kept open - just with extra
precautions being taken. As England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, we are in
an immeasurably better position now. That is down to immunity built up by
vaccination and previous infection. This variant can dodge some of those defences - but not
all. A step back, but by no means a return to square one. Dominic HughesHealth correspondent, in Preston Angela Roberts got her booster jab this morning There's been lots going on today but one important thing to remind you of is thatpeople aged 40 and over in England can now book their booster jabfor three months after their second dose. Angela Roberts, who lives in Hutton, just outside Preston,
was one of the first to get a booster at the vaccination hub in the town centre
this morning. âEverybody needs to have it done, itâs important that you
protect yourself,"" she said. Around 700 people will get a jab here today â although there have been days when 1,000
vaccines were delivered. Reflecting on the fact that itâs a year to the day since the
first Covid vaccine jab was given to Margaret Keenan, Angela said lots had
changed. âIt is just amazing, we just need it carrying on and to get
us all protected.â As the government announces new ""vaccine passport"" requirements for night clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of a ""devastating impact"" on the sector. It's also questioned whether the move was an attempt to distract attention from a ""damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party"". From 15 December, NHS Covid passes will become mandatory for indoor unseated venues holding more than 500 people, and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. Two vaccine doses will be sufficient for the pass, but this will be kept under review. A negative lateral flow test will also be acceptable. Read more here. People in England will soon need to show their Covid status to get into nightclubs and many other large venues. What are the new rules? In England, people will need to use theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to: People can also show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test. Businesses have a week to introduce the measures. How do I get a Covid passport? You can get the pass if you're 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any one of the following: Get the full details across the UKhere. Olaf Scholz says goodbye to his predecessor Angela Merkel at the chancellery in Berlin The Covid crisis is the biggest challenge facing the country, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says. Afterformally taking power from Angela Merkelfollowing her historic 16 years as leader, Scholz acknowledged that he had taken control of Europe's largest economy in the middle of an aggressive fourth wave of Covid infections. ""We know that the transition that we are making here now is taking place in the middle of a large, ongoing crisis that calls for continuity and community and I think we will manage that,"" he said in Berlin. Scholz said, however, that it would only be possible to fight the virus if the public got vaccinated and received their booster shots as soon as possible. The soft-spoken 63-year-old also said that restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing needed to be followed. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says Covid is spreading quickly in the country France's fifth wave of Covid infections has not yet peaked and so a fourth vaccine shot might be needed to help keep things under control, officials have warned. ""It's still spreading quickly and will continue to do so in the coming weeks,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Meanwhile, government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said: ""For now, there's a call for one booster shot. Will that be enough? I don't know. Maybe we'll need a fourth shot."" Last week, French health authorities said the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was likely to become the most prevalent variant in the country by early next year. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said France's fifth Covid wave was spreading fast and having a big impact on hospitals, with a patient admitted to intensive care on average every 10 minutes. France recorded more than 59,000 cases on Wednesday Away from events in the UK, France has recorded
its highest daily Covid cases since November 2020. The country reported 59,019 Covid cases on Wednesday with
168 Covid deaths. Europeâs Covid rate has been rising rapidly in recent weeks
and new restrictions have been imposed in a number of nations. Austria, which is back under lockdown, has announced mandatory vaccinations while Germany is also mulling making jabs compulsory. Belgium has tightened rules on face masks and Italy has introduced a ""green pass"" which is required at workplaces, venues and on public transport. Last month The World Health Organization said itwas âvery worriedâ about the spread of Covid-19 in Europe. Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans
Kluge warned that 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent
action is taken. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Armed
with ahastily arranged inquiry and the resignation of his former spokesperson Allegra Stratton, the prime minister could demonstrate at his press conference that that he wasn't
hiding from questions on the Downing Street party of last year. There were
caveats to his ""guidance was followed"" mantra  - such as ""as far as I am
aware"" - and he was pushed to broaden the remit of the cabinet secretary's
inquiry. But
in replying to Laura Kuenssberg's question on trust, he emphasised his trust in
the British people rather than fully addressing whether they could trust him. As
many of the Plan B measures won't be introduced until next week, questions will
inevitably be asked about whether the public health message would have landed
with more impact had the press conference been held on a different day. His
critics - and that includes some Conservatives - say he was indulging in a ""dead cat"" strategy to divert attention from whatever had been going on behind
the black door of Downing Street. But it seemed at this press conference that
the feline was still alive and prowling around the prime minister. Christmas trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abramovitch While some companies, such as delivery firms, thrived under England's working from home rules, others fear more uncertainty from the government's latest Plan B guidance. David Abramovitch, co-founder of Grind, says his chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London were just starting to get back on their financial feet after the previous lockdown. It will be ""painful"" to go into ""reverse gear again"", he tells the BBC. ""Already we've seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since the Omicron variant emerged."" Meanwhile Ruth, a dentist, says she feels like people have learned enough to keep working as they are. ""With the vaccinations and the [personal protective equipment], we have to learn to live with these things. If you lock people down constantly, they're not going to behave themselves."" Allegra Stratton made a tearful statement earlier today after a video of her joking with colleagues emerged The Metropolitan Police will not launch an investigation into the video of No 10 staff joking about holding a Christmas party when London was under Tier 3 restrictions last year. They say the video ""does not provide evidence of a breach"" of health regulations and instead ""restates allegations made in the media"". In a statement, the force says it had received ""a significant amount of correspondence"" over the video, obtained by ITV. It adds that any evidence found as part of the Cabinet Office inquiry will be passed to the Met for further consideration. Read our full storyhere. Reality Check The prime minister maintained at
his press conference that: âTo the best of my knowledge, we have followed the
rules throughout.â He had been questioned about why the cabinet secretary had been asked to look into the
Downing Street party on 18 December last year and the Department for Education party, but
not a number of other parties that have been reported to have taken place. At
the time, the governmentâs guidance specifically said that there should not be
Christmas parties. London
was in Tier 3 restrictions on 18 December 2020 and the law said that there should
not be indoor gatherings - unless they were âreasonably necessaryâ for work. You
can read more details about what the Covid rules were at the timehere. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges PM over new restrictions Amid fallout from the row over a Christmas party at Downing Street in 2020, the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg asked Boris Johnson how he could tell people they must now follow new restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Why all these changes announced today? A fresh analysis published by the UK Health Security Agency
suggests the Omicron variant will be responsible for at least 50% of Covid cases within two to
four weeks. The prediction is based on the number of cases judged to be
suspected Omicron from testing data. That shows around 2% of daily cases are being caused by the
new variant. If that is correct it would mean there are about 1,000 Omicron cases every 24 hours. What is more, the cases are thought to be doubling every two
or three days. What is not yet known is whether Omicron will completely
replace Delta, the variant that is currently dominant. if you missed all that, the government has announced new Covid rules for England, in response to concern over the Omicron variant. Here's a sum-up of the latest rules and youcan read more here in our guide. This video can not be played Omicron: Boris Johnson announces Plan B Covid rules for England In that press conference from Downing Street just now, Boris Johnson  unveiled the ""Plan B"" Covid rules for England. This means that people should start working from home where necessary from Monday. Mask wearing is going to become a more common sight again, as indoor public venues such as cinemas and theatres will require masks from Friday. An NHS Covid pass, proving vaccination or a negative test, will be requires for nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather from a week's time. Daily testing will be a requirement for those who come into contact with a positive case of Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

PM sorry for offence amid anger over party videoBoris Johnson orders inquiry into staff lockdown party - but Labour says he is taking people for fools.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson apologise over video of Downing Street staff mocking Christmas party Boris Johnson has apologised for a video showing Downing Street staff joking about a lockdown Christmas party in No 10, amid mounting public fury. The PM said he shared people's anger and had ordered an inquiry into whether rules had been broken. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was taking people for fools and the PM should just admit what had happened. MPs lined up to criticise Mr Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions, withone Labour MP asking how he slept at night. Replying to Rosena Allin Khan, who also works as a doctor in a London hospital, Mr Johnson said he took ""full responsibility for everything the government has done"". Live: Lockdown party controversy Stratton quits as adviser after party video row Covid bereaved families 'fuming' at No 10 party But in his apology, the PM suggested he had been misled about the Christmas party on 18 December last year. He said he had been ""repeatedly assured that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken"". He apologised ""unreservedly"" for the offence caused by the video clip, claiming that he was ""furious"" about it. Mr Johnson's former press chief Allegra Stratton - who was filmed joking with colleagues about the party in a video leaked to ITV - resigned as a government adviser three hours after the PM's apology. In a tearful statement, she said: ""My remarks seemed to make light of the rules, rules that people were doing everything to obey. ""That was never my intention. I will regret those remarks for the rest of my days and I offer my profound apologies to all of you at home for them."" In response to questioning from Sir Keir, the PM agreed that any evidence uncovered about parties in Downing Street would be handed over to police. This video can not be played Starmer asks Johnson: Do you have moral authority to lead? Sir Keir questioned Mr Johnson's ""moral authority"" to lead the country during the pandemic, contrasting his actions with those of the Queen. ""Her Majesty the Queen sat alone when she marked the passing of the man she'd been married to for 73 years. Leadership, sacrifice - that's what gives leaders the moral authority to lead,"" said the Labour leader. ""Does the prime minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules?"" Mr Johnson claimed the Labour Party and Sir Keir ""have played politics throughout this pandemic"".

It is clear that this prime minister has lost the support of the public and now even of his own benches,"" he told MPs. Conservative MPs also fear the government's credibility has been damaged, with some warning it could harm Mr Johnson's ability to impose further coronavirus lockdowns. And Tory MP William Wragg accused Mr Johnson of planning to ""initiate Covid Winter Plan B"" later on Wednesday without a statement to MPs, adding ""very few will be convinced by this diversionary tactic"".

Kuenssberg: What next for the PM?,"This video can not be played Watch: Video obtained by ITV News shows Downing Street staff joking about a No 10 Christmas party during a mock press conference ""Indefensible"", ""catastrophic"" and ""astonishing"". Condemnations, not from Boris Johnson's political opponents, but from his own side - many Conservative MPs are furious afterfootage emerged of Downing Street staffers laughingabout how they'd have to explain the gathering in December last year, if news of it ever emerged. It's hard to imagine a more toe-curling seeming confirmation of what was going on in there, when socialising was banned for everyone else, the virus was taking hold and families across the country were unable to see sick relatives or loved ones in care homes. The footage has already been seen by millions of people, well beyond Westminster's bubble, even joked about by on ITV's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. But what are the likely consequences of this deep embarrassment for No 10? First off and most importantly, many members of the public -most poignantly those who lost relatives to Covid- will feel intensely hacked off. Not just to find out that Downing Street had a party, but that captured on camera staffers laughed about what they had done. A Whitehall source says: ""As an ordinary punter it makes me feel stupid for following the rules."" Boris Johnson has denied any party took place in Downing Street last Christmas Of course it is dynamite too for the opposition parties, who have for months been making the case that the government believes it can act however it chooses. Expect to hear plenty of the charge of ""one rule for us, one rule for them"" in the next few days. On the back ofDowning Street's attempt to change the rules on MPs' behaviourafter former minister Owen Paterson broke them, even some senior Conservatives are making that claim tonight. One says: ""The handling of the Paterson affair showed the PM didn't think the rules applied to his friends. This video demonstrates that view is widely shared in No 10 by very senior political advisers appointed by the PM. ""People who were prevented by the government from seeing loved ones at the end of their life will conclude they were being taken for fools."" Making voters feel like idiots is not exactly a winning strategy. And if the government concludes before too long that the rise in Omicron means he has to ask the public to make significant sacrifices again, after this just how willing will some of the public be to comply? PM: I crashed the car over Paterson case One senior Tory MP and avowed lockdown sceptic Charles Walker says: ""The No 10 party means that any future lockdowns will be advisory, whatever the law says."" Another senior figure reckons the existence of the footage makes this mess more damaging than Dominic Cummings' trip to Barnard Castle. There's another consequence for No 10, too, which is important to its relationship with the Tory Party and the public- the impact that it has on the faith in Downing Street to tell the truth. Every government I've ever covered has used spin. Every government I've covered has sometimes been less than straight with the facts. Yet footage emerged on Tuesday after nearly a week of Downing Street using various different formations to deny the story. As I write late on Tuesday night, No 10 is sticking to its line that there wasn't even a party. But with the leaked footage, and rising internal anger, it's hard to see how that can really last. To put it diplomatically, Boris Johnson has always had anunusual relationship with the truth. His party has tolerated that because of the other electoral assets they believe he has. But ministers and MPs who have been out defending No 10 in the last few days will feel sore that they weren't given the full facts. One minister instructed to hold the line earlier this week told me it was ""like they were in denial"". Another senior Tory MP said privately: ""After this, I can never again take anything Boris says at face value."" It's not yet clear if any MPs or ministers will be willing to go and defend the government on Wednesday. With Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson can't avoid the issue himself. And immediately the fiasco's prompted pressure on the PM to sharpen up the way he does business. Calls for a better operation in No 10 have been getting louder since the Owen Paterson shambles. A long-term aide to Mr Johnson went back into No 10 not long ago to help. But there've been private demands from a former minister to sack chief of staff Dan Rosenfeld, speculation that anyone seen in the video will have to quit, suggestions that the PM will have to make a grovelling apology and send some staff out the door, or try to get ahead of the story and launch some kind of inquiry. The question being asked, even by one of his allies, is about Boris Johnson himself - ""Is he going to be big enough to understand the reason we're getting into difficulties, is because he is trying to run government with chaos, like he has run his life?"" they ask. The former minister points the finger at the prime minister's chosen manner of running No 10, with ""cliques running round"" and wanting to hear from ""people who will tell him he is wonderful, not to tell him that he is not"". Boris Johnson still has many backers, many MPs who believe they owe their seats to him. His presence looms so large over his party, that a different kind of party altogether is not suddenly going to sink him or his team. We've talked on here so many times about this prime minister's ability to ride the political rollercoaster through deep dips. But again he finds himself at the centre of something that many on his own side find impossible to defend. Even with an enormous majority and unrivalled political celebrity, Boris Johnson's Downing Street might be a lonely place to be this Christmas.

Swinney: Scotland could return to past restrictions,"Scotland could return to tougher Covid restrictions including businesses closing if the new variant spreads further Scotland could return to tougher restrictions used in the past if the Omicron variant spreads out of control, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told the BBC the first minister had requested financial assistance from the UK government last week in case businesses had to close. Scientists believe Omicron could spread more easily than Delta. Nicola Sturgeon told parliament on Tuesday that Covid measures would be reviewed on a daily basis. She said while no further measures would be immediately introduced, people should tighten up on existing protections, for example businesses should ""ensure"" staff were working from home if possible. People were also urged to take more lateral flow tests, including on every occasion when they plan to mix with other households. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said he couldn't give a definitive answer on whether socialising would be restricted over Christmas. However, he said there were a ""range of options"" the government was considering such as extending the vaccine passport scheme. He said: ""It could also involve some of the restrictions that people are more familiar with that we've had to use in the past. ""There isn't a new repertoire that we could suddenly bring out, we would have to go back to some of the previous versions but we want to avoid that if we possibly can do."" More schools and firms 'will face Omicron closures' Vaccines should work against Omicron variant, WHO says Take a test every time you leave home, says Swinney There are currently 99 known cases of Omicron in Scotland, accounting for 0.92% of infections reported on Tuesday, and over 400 across the UK. But researchers at the University of East Anglia believe there could have been five to six times as many Omicron cases as the official total shows. The number of cases appears to be doubling every three days or so, prompting concern that the new variant is more transmissible than Delta. It is expected thatmore schools and businesses across Scotland will closebecause of local outbreaks in the lead up to Christmas in order to slow the spread of the variant. Two primary schools, in Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire, have already been forced to close after suspected outbreaks. Meanwhile, Mr Swinney confirmed that a joint letter from Nicola Sturgeon and the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, requested more money to support people if the UK had to toughen up wider restrictions.

'Euros' is most googled term of 2021 in UK,"The Euros, in which England lost the final to Italy, on penalties, dominated search The three top trending terms on Google UK this year were football related, with only one reference to Covid in the top 10. ""Euros"", ""Premier League"" and ""Christian Eriksen"" - the Danish player who had a cardiac arrest on the pitch - were the top three, with ""Covid vaccine"" fourth. Covid had dominated last year's list. Google News Labs head Matt Cooke said the annual list revealed ""insights into the zeitgeist of the nation"".

Never-before-seen photos show Epstein-Maxwell bondFBI agents submit previously unseen photo evidence as third accuser testifies in Maxwell trial.US & Canada,"Jurors saw never-before-seen photos of Ms Maxwell with Jeffrey Epstein Prosecutors in Ghislaine Maxwell's trial have presented previously unseen photos linking the socialite to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The evidence to show their closeness came as a third accuser testified that Ms Maxwell, 59, set up paid ""massages"" for Epstein that turned sexual. Ms Maxwell is accused of grooming underage girls for abuse between 1994 and 2004. She has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and seven other charges. Ms Maxwell - who has British, American and French citizenship - has been in a US jail since her arrest last year. She faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Maxwell 'gave schoolgirl outfit to Epstein victim' Prosecutors have called Ms Maxwell and Epstein, her former boyfriend and business associate, ""partners in crime"", presenting documents on Monday showing that he had wired her more than $30m (Â£23m) over an eight-year period. Prosecutors are trying to link Ms Maxwell to Jeffrey Epstein by showing the jury intimate photos like this one Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Jurors on Tuesday were shown the contents of never-before-seen digital evidence seized by the FBI during a 2019 raid on Epstein's Manhattan home. Among them are photographs of two of Ms Maxwell's accusers in various states of undress, and of parts of Epstein's now-infamous Florida mansion, but the trove also contains several pictures of the duo together, sometimes embracing or being intimate with each other. Of particular note are a framed photo sitting on a table that shows the couple kissing and a sketch of Ms Maxwell mounted on a bathroom wall. A ""help wanted"" flyer for massage therapists in the area is included in the trove of evidence. The court also heard the readout of a document registered under Ms Maxwell's name - and found on a hard drive in Epstein's home - that describes the two as ""rarely apart"". ""Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun together,"" its unidentified author wrote. ""On top of being partners they are also best of friends."" This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' Also on Tuesday, a woman named Carolyn - now in her 30s - alleged she had multiple sexual encounters with Epstein from age 14 to 18. Named in the Maxwell indictment as ""Minor Victim 4"", she was introduced to the wealthy duo by Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), one of Epstein's most vocal accusers. The witness testified that she had dropped out of school after the seventh grade and was in need of money. Upon their first visit to Epstein's Florida home, both girls participated in a massage that ended with Ms Roberts having sex with their host while Carolyn allegedly watched. A photo of Ghislaine Maxwell hangs in the bathroom of Jeffrey Epstein's Florida home She claimed Ms Maxwell paid her $300 and took her number, later saying she had ""a great body for Mr Epstein and his friends"". Carolyn told the court she went back to the home more than a hundred times, sometimes three times a week, until she turned 18. ""Something sexual happened every single time,"" she said. She testified that Ms Maxwell would often welcome her or provide an update on Epstein's whereabouts, adding that - as she could not pronounce her hostess's first name - she simply called her ""Maxwell"". Ms Maxwell would pay her each time, she added, and paid extra on occasions she brought friends with her. The witness said both adults had known she was very young. She recounted an invitation to visit Epstein's private island when she was 14 years old; she said she refused because she had no passport and her mother would not let her go. Carolyn said she had a child by the time she hit 18 and went back to visit Epstein again. ""He asked me if I had any younger friends, and I said no. And that's when I realized I was too old,"" she said. Defence lawyers for Ms Maxwell have said she is being scapegoated for Epstein's crimes. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend?

Swinney: Scotland could return to past restrictionsThe deputy first minister says lockdown measures could be reinstated if the Omicron variant spreads out of control.Scotland,"Scotland could return to tougher Covid restrictions including businesses closing if the new variant spreads further Scotland could return to tougher restrictions used in the past if the Omicron variant spreads out of control, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told the BBC the first minister had requested financial assistance from the UK government last week in case businesses had to close. Scientists believe Omicron could spread more easily than Delta. Nicola Sturgeon told parliament on Tuesday that Covid measures would be reviewed on a daily basis. She said while no further measures would be immediately introduced, people should tighten up on existing protections, for example businesses should ""ensure"" staff were working from home if possible. People were also urged to take more lateral flow tests, including on every occasion when they plan to mix with other households. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said he couldn't give a definitive answer on whether socialising would be restricted over Christmas. However, he said there were a ""range of options"" the government was considering such as extending the vaccine passport scheme. He said: ""It could also involve some of the restrictions that people are more familiar with that we've had to use in the past. ""There isn't a new repertoire that we could suddenly bring out, we would have to go back to some of the previous versions but we want to avoid that if we possibly can do."" More schools and firms 'will face Omicron closures' Vaccines should work against Omicron variant, WHO says Take a test every time you leave home, says Swinney There are currently 99 known cases of Omicron in Scotland, accounting for 0.92% of infections reported on Tuesday, and over 400 across the UK. But researchers at the University of East Anglia believe there could have been five to six times as many Omicron cases as the official total shows. The number of cases appears to be doubling every three days or so, prompting concern that the new variant is more transmissible than Delta. It is expected thatmore schools and businesses across Scotland will closebecause of local outbreaks in the lead up to Christmas in order to slow the spread of the variant. Two primary schools, in Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire, have already been forced to close after suspected outbreaks. Meanwhile, Mr Swinney confirmed that a joint letter from Nicola Sturgeon and the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, requested more money to support people if the UK had to toughen up wider restrictions. He Swinney said: ""We have pressed for there to be further dialogue with the UK government on that very subject so that should there be a requirement for different parts of the UK - or the whole of the UK - to take steps to apply restrictions we have got the ability to provide the support to individuals through what I recognise would be a very difficult period."" While Mr Swinney said he hoped for further discussions on the matter, he suggested UK ministers may be ""distracted"" by the news ofsenior Downing Street staff joking about holding a Christmas partyduring lockdown last year. A video obtained by ITV shows the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton joking at a rehearsal news conference that ""the fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced"". Downing Street continues to insist no party took place. But a sourcepreviously confirmed to the BBCthat a party did take place there on 18 December, with ""several dozen"" people in attendance. This video can not be played Watch: Video obtained by ITV News shows Downing Street staff joking about a No 10 Christmas party during a mock press conference SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Boris Johnson should resign if the party happened, claiming he ""doesn't deserve trust of the public"".

And Conservative MSP Liz Smith told the BBC that it was ""reprehensible"" that anyone would have thought a party was appropriate at that time. According to Mr Swinney, the Conservatives had ""lied"" about the party and the video had dealt a ""very serious blow"" to the government's handling of the developing Covid situation. He said: ""I cannot think of a worse set of images than the behaviour of the UK government in last seven days - that video last night is just one of most appalling things I've seen in my political life.

New UK travel rulesto try to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant came into effect on Tuesday. The changes include include pre-departure tests for people arriving in the UK, while 11 African countrieshave been put on the red list for travel. The travel industry warnedon Monday that the new rules would be a ""hammer blow"" and that livelihoods would be ""devastated"". Covid: Travel changes too late to halt potential new wave - scientist Omicron: What Covid tests do I need if I travel abroad? Tui said it had 4.1 million bookings for its next winter and summer seasons, with 1.4 million bookings since 3 October. However, it said: ""The increased media coverage of rising incident rates and the emergence of new Omicron variant has weakened this positive momentum, particularly for winter."" Winter bookings were returning to pre-pandemic levels before ""recent news coverage"" of the pandemic, Tui said. Over the past week, a quarter of Tui holidays booked for December had been postponed to a later date, it told the BBC. The holiday firm narrowed its loss before tax to â¬71m (Â£60.5m) in the fourth quarter of the year to 30 September, compared with a loss in the same period last year of â¬836m. It didn't say how much it expected to make next year. After such a tumultuous couple of years for the travel industry, businesses are pinning their hopes on a strong 2022 summer season. There's been some optimism in the air. However, the uncertainty around Omicron has prompted fears of a hit to consumer confidence, especially as a result of the re-introduction of temporary rules around international travel - with the UK bringing back the red list and extra Covid testing requirements. So far it's short-term bookings being affected. The real problem will arise if people who might normally make their summer holiday booking after Christmas or in January decide not to. The industry will be crossing its fingers that the bumper summer it needs does still come to pass. Tui chief executive Friedrich Joussen said that uncertainty over travel restrictions was ""annoying"". ""Overnight you get new rules,"" he said. ""You have gone on vacation thinking nothing can happen, then tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people have new rules and that is difficult."" He called on the government to give the travel industry more notice about upcoming rule changes. Mr Joussen added that Tui partially subsidises the costs of PCR tests, which has some financial impact on the business. While Omicron symptoms have so far been mild, there areearly signs it is more transmissible than the Delta variant. Following the new UK border restrictions brought in after the emergence of Omicron, more than one in eight UK tourism firms that cater for foreign visitors have had cancellations or expect to have them in the run-up to Christmas, industry body UKInbound said. It said a survey of its members suggested ""green shoots of recovery"" had been ""put on hold"". Its chief executive Joss Croft said: ""Although thoroughly depressing, these results are not surprising. ""International consumer confidence to travel to the UK has taken another huge hit, and the UK's kneejerk decisions and lack of support for businesses that bear the consequences, means the recovery of this industry has already been derailed."" He added that firms needed ""emergency support"" and that they had ""no wiggle room left"". ""The summer season was all but lost for them, they have depleted their cash reserves and maxed out loans,"" he said. How are travel rules being relaxed?

Kuenssberg: What next for Johnson?,"This video can not be played Watch: Video obtained by ITV News shows Downing Street staff joking about a No 10 Christmas party during a mock press conference ""Indefensible"", ""catastrophic"" and ""astonishing"". Condemnations, not from Boris Johnson's political opponents, but from his own side - many Conservative MPs are furious afterfootage emerged of Downing Street staffers laughingabout how they'd have to explain the gathering in December last year, if news of it ever emerged. It's hard to imagine a more toe-curling seeming confirmation of what was going on in there, when socialising was banned for everyone else, the virus was taking hold and families across the country were unable to see sick relatives or loved ones in care homes. The footage has already been seen by millions of people, well beyond Westminster's bubble, even joked about by on ITV's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. But what are the likely consequences of this deep embarrassment for No 10? First off and most importantly, many members of the public -most poignantly those who lost relatives to Covid- will feel intensely hacked off. Not just to find out that Downing Street had a party, but that captured on camera staffers laughed about what they had done. A Whitehall source says: ""As an ordinary punter it makes me feel stupid for following the rules."" Boris Johnson has denied any party took place in Downing Street last Christmas Of course it is dynamite too for the opposition parties, who have for months been making the case that the government believes it can act however it chooses. Expect to hear plenty of the charge of ""one rule for us, one rule for them"" in the next few days. On the back ofDowning Street's attempt to change the rules on MPs' behaviourafter former minister Owen Paterson broke them, even some senior Conservatives are making that claim tonight. One says: ""The handling of the Paterson affair showed the PM didn't think the rules applied to his friends. This video demonstrates that view is widely shared in No 10 by very senior political advisers appointed by the PM. ""People who were prevented by the government from seeing loved ones at the end of their life will conclude they were being taken for fools."" Making voters feel like idiots is not exactly a winning strategy. And if the government concludes before too long that the rise in Omicron means he has to ask the public to make significant sacrifices again, after this just how willing will some of the public be to comply? PM: I crashed the car over Paterson case One senior Tory MP and avowed lockdown sceptic Charles Walker says: ""The No 10 party means that any future lockdowns will be advisory, whatever the law says."" Another senior figure reckons the existence of the footage makes this mess more damaging than Dominic Cummings' trip to Barnard Castle. There's another consequence for No 10, too, which is important to its relationship with the Tory Party and the public- the impact that it has on the faith in Downing Street to tell the truth. Every government I've ever covered has used spin. Every government I've covered has sometimes been less than straight with the facts. Yet footage emerged on Tuesday after nearly a week of Downing Street using various different formations to deny the story. As I write late on Tuesday night, No 10 is sticking to its line that there wasn't even a party. But with the leaked footage, and rising internal anger, it's hard to see how that can really last. To put it diplomatically, Boris Johnson has always had anunusual relationship with the truth. His party has tolerated that because of the other electoral assets they believe he has. But ministers and MPs who have been out defending No 10 in the last few days will feel sore that they weren't given the full facts. One minister instructed to hold the line earlier this week told me it was ""like they were in denial"". Another senior Tory MP said privately: ""After this, I can never again take anything Boris says at face value."" It's not yet clear if any MPs or ministers will be willing to go and defend the government on Wednesday. With Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson can't avoid the issue himself. And immediately the fiasco's prompted pressure on the PM to sharpen up the way he does business. Calls for a better operation in No 10 have been getting louder since the Owen Paterson shambles. A long-term aide to Mr Johnson went back into No 10 not long ago to help. But there've been private demands from a former minister to sack chief of staff Dan Rosenfeld, speculation that anyone seen in the video will have to quit, suggestions that the PM will have to make a grovelling apology and send some staff out the door, or try to get ahead of the story and launch some kind of inquiry. The question being asked, even by one of his allies, is about Boris Johnson himself - ""Is he going to be big enough to understand the reason we're getting into difficulties, is because he is trying to run government with chaos, like he has run his life?"" they ask. The former minister points the finger at the prime minister's chosen manner of running No 10, with ""cliques running round"" and wanting to hear from ""people who will tell him he is wonderful, not to tell him that he is not"". Boris Johnson still has many backers, many MPs who believe they owe their seats to him. His presence looms so large over his party, that a different kind of party altogether is not suddenly going to sink him or his team. We've talked on here so many times about this prime minister's ability to ride the political rollercoaster through deep dips. But again he finds himself at the centre of something that many on his own side find impossible to defend. Even with an enormous majority and unrivalled political celebrity, Boris Johnson's Downing Street might be a lonely place to be this Christmas.

But do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott, Nathan Williams, Sophie Williams, Dulcie Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Joshua Cheetham and Mal Siret. And the page was edited by Emma Owen, Claire Heald and Kevin Ponniah. It's been an eventful and fast-moving day of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main stories: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva At its weekly Covid 19 briefing, today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was some initial evidence that the Omicron variant was more infectious, that vaccines could be somewhat less effective against it, but that its health effects might be less severe. But officials stressed that more research is needed, and warned again that countries must act now to prepare for another pandemic wave. A priority must be vaccinating the unvaccinated, and reliable public health measures such as mask wearing, testing, and social distancing. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told governments waiting to act until hospitals started to fill up would be too late. WHO officials also said booster vaccines should not be a priority - saying all the evidence shows existing vaccines provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalisations, and death. Governments must instead make every effort to reach vaccine hesitant people, and ramp up mass vaccination in largely unvaccinated countries. The new rule for some venues to introduce Covid certification is an ""unfair double
standard"" the live music industry says. Pubs and bars will not have to ask for Covid passports ""whilst
live music venues get hit with certification"", according to industry trade association Live. Covid health certificates will be required for people to enter English unseated indoor venues with more than 500 attendees. Meanwhile, The Theatres Trust said the rise of the Omicron variant and the new measures will ""have a big
impact on the willingness of people to travel and go to theatres over Christmas"". The organisation's director Jon Morgan said: ""This will have a knock-on effect on theatresâ viability at a vital time of year
for the industry and Christmas shows that are just emerging from the
significant loss of revenue in 2020 and early 2021."" Mark Harper and other Tory backbenchers expressed opposition to Plan B Back to the announcement of Plan B restrictions for England - and there is an indication that some backbench Tory MPs will not support the government when it puts them to a vote. The Workington MP Mark Jenkinson says the rules are ""divisive, discriminatory and are unlikely to stop spread"". In atweet,external, he adds the health secretary, who addressed MPs at the same time the prime minister made his announcement, ""offered no evidence for further restrictions...  just as businesses desperately need a good Christmas"". Instead, vaccination was key in the response to the Omicron variant he said. East Devon MP Simon Jupp says Plan B will cost jobs in many sectors, including hospitality. While working from home wonât help social or economic recovery. And former chief whip Mark Harper suggests the ""initial evidence on Omicron doesn't support these measures"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Prof Chris Whitty says vaccines are a useful way to prevent serious infection Introducing more restrictions in England just before Christmas for
the second year running is, of course, depressing. But this is vastly different from last year. Then, large
parts of the country were put into what was effectively lockdown with tier
four. A full national lockdown followed in the new year. This time, with these latest Plan B measures, society is being kept open - just with extra
precautions being taken. As England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, we are in
an immeasurably better position now. That is down to immunity built up by
vaccination and previous infection. This variant can dodge some of those defences - but not
all. A step back, but by no means a return to square one. Dominic HughesHealth correspondent, in Preston Angela Roberts got her booster jab this morning There's been lots going on today but one important thing to remind you of is thatpeople aged 40 and over in England can now book their booster jabfor three months after their second dose. Angela Roberts, who lives in Hutton, just outside Preston,
was one of the first to get a booster at the vaccination hub in the town centre
this morning. âEverybody needs to have it done, itâs important that you
protect yourself,"" she said. Around 700 people will get a jab here today â although there have been days when 1,000
vaccines were delivered. Reflecting on the fact that itâs a year to the day since the
first Covid vaccine jab was given to Margaret Keenan, Angela said lots had
changed. âIt is just amazing, we just need it carrying on and to get
us all protected.â As the government announces new ""vaccine passport"" requirements for night clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of a ""devastating impact"" on the sector. It's also questioned whether the move was an attempt to distract attention from a ""damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party"". From 15 December, NHS Covid passes will become mandatory for indoor unseated venues holding more than 500 people, and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. Two vaccine doses will be sufficient for the pass, but this will be kept under review. A negative lateral flow test will also be acceptable. Read more here. People in England will soon need to show their Covid status to get into nightclubs and many other large venues. What are the new rules? In England, people will need to use theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to: People can also show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test. Businesses have a week to introduce the measures. How do I get a Covid passport? You can get the pass if you're 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any one of the following: Get the full details across the UKhere. Olaf Scholz says goodbye to his predecessor Angela Merkel at the chancellery in Berlin The Covid crisis is the biggest challenge facing the country, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says. Afterformally taking power from Angela Merkelfollowing her historic 16 years as leader, Scholz acknowledged that he had taken control of Europe's largest economy in the middle of an aggressive fourth wave of Covid infections. ""We know that the transition that we are making here now is taking place in the middle of a large, ongoing crisis that calls for continuity and community and I think we will manage that,"" he said in Berlin. Scholz said, however, that it would only be possible to fight the virus if the public got vaccinated and received their booster shots as soon as possible. The soft-spoken 63-year-old also said that restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing needed to be followed. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says Covid is spreading quickly in the country France's fifth wave of Covid infections has not yet peaked and so a fourth vaccine shot might be needed to help keep things under control, officials have warned. ""It's still spreading quickly and will continue to do so in the coming weeks,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Meanwhile, government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said: ""For now, there's a call for one booster shot. Will that be enough? I don't know. Maybe we'll need a fourth shot."" Last week, French health authorities said the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was likely to become the most prevalent variant in the country by early next year. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said France's fifth Covid wave was spreading fast and having a big impact on hospitals, with a patient admitted to intensive care on average every 10 minutes. France recorded more than 59,000 cases on Wednesday Away from events in the UK, France has recorded
its highest daily Covid cases since November 2020. The country reported 59,019 Covid cases on Wednesday with
168 Covid deaths. Europeâs Covid rate has been rising rapidly in recent weeks
and new restrictions have been imposed in a number of nations. Austria, which is back under lockdown, has announced mandatory vaccinations while Germany is also mulling making jabs compulsory. Belgium has tightened rules on face masks and Italy has introduced a ""green pass"" which is required at workplaces, venues and on public transport. Last month The World Health Organization said itwas âvery worriedâ about the spread of Covid-19 in Europe. Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans
Kluge warned that 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent
action is taken. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Armed
with ahastily arranged inquiry and the resignation of his former spokesperson Allegra Stratton, the prime minister could demonstrate at his press conference that that he wasn't
hiding from questions on the Downing Street party of last year. There were
caveats to his ""guidance was followed"" mantra  - such as ""as far as I am
aware"" - and he was pushed to broaden the remit of the cabinet secretary's
inquiry. But
in replying to Laura Kuenssberg's question on trust, he emphasised his trust in
the British people rather than fully addressing whether they could trust him. As
many of the Plan B measures won't be introduced until next week, questions will
inevitably be asked about whether the public health message would have landed
with more impact had the press conference been held on a different day. His
critics - and that includes some Conservatives - say he was indulging in a ""dead cat"" strategy to divert attention from whatever had been going on behind
the black door of Downing Street. But it seemed at this press conference that
the feline was still alive and prowling around the prime minister. Christmas trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abramovitch While some companies, such as delivery firms, thrived under England's working from home rules, others fear more uncertainty from the government's latest Plan B guidance. David Abramovitch, co-founder of Grind, says his chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London were just starting to get back on their financial feet after the previous lockdown. It will be ""painful"" to go into ""reverse gear again"", he tells the BBC. ""Already we've seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since the Omicron variant emerged."" Meanwhile Ruth, a dentist, says she feels like people have learned enough to keep working as they are. ""With the vaccinations and the [personal protective equipment], we have to learn to live with these things. If you lock people down constantly, they're not going to behave themselves."" Allegra Stratton made a tearful statement earlier today after a video of her joking with colleagues emerged The Metropolitan Police will not launch an investigation into the video of No 10 staff joking about holding a Christmas party when London was under Tier 3 restrictions last year. They say the video ""does not provide evidence of a breach"" of health regulations and instead ""restates allegations made in the media"". In a statement, the force says it had received ""a significant amount of correspondence"" over the video, obtained by ITV. It adds that any evidence found as part of the Cabinet Office inquiry will be passed to the Met for further consideration. Read our full storyhere. Reality Check The prime minister maintained at
his press conference that: âTo the best of my knowledge, we have followed the
rules throughout.â He had been questioned about why the cabinet secretary had been asked to look into the
Downing Street party on 18 December last year and the Department for Education party, but
not a number of other parties that have been reported to have taken place. At
the time, the governmentâs guidance specifically said that there should not be
Christmas parties. London
was in Tier 3 restrictions on 18 December 2020 and the law said that there should
not be indoor gatherings - unless they were âreasonably necessaryâ for work. You
can read more details about what the Covid rules were at the timehere. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges PM over new restrictions Amid fallout from the row over a Christmas party at Downing Street in 2020, the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg asked Boris Johnson how he could tell people they must now follow new restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Why all these changes announced today? A fresh analysis published by the UK Health Security Agency
suggests the Omicron variant will be responsible for at least 50% of Covid cases within two to
four weeks. The prediction is based on the number of cases judged to be
suspected Omicron from testing data. That shows around 2% of daily cases are being caused by the
new variant. If that is correct it would mean there are about 1,000 Omicron cases every 24 hours. What is more, the cases are thought to be doubling every two
or three days. What is not yet known is whether Omicron will completely
replace Delta, the variant that is currently dominant. if you missed all that, the government has announced new Covid rules for England, in response to concern over the Omicron variant. Here's a sum-up of the latest rules and youcan read more here in our guide. This video can not be played Omicron: Boris Johnson announces Plan B Covid rules for England In that press conference from Downing Street just now, Boris Johnson  unveiled the ""Plan B"" Covid rules for England. This means that people should start working from home where necessary from Monday. Mask wearing is going to become a more common sight again, as indoor public venues such as cinemas and theatres will require masks from Friday. An NHS Covid pass, proving vaccination or a negative test, will be requires for nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather from a week's time. Daily testing will be a requirement for those who come into contact with a positive case of Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Tui says Omicron is hitting holiday bookingsWinter bookings especially are slowing down as Omicron variant spreads, holiday giant says.Business","The pace of holiday bookings is slowing down after the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, holiday giant Tui has said. Reports of higher infection rates are also putting a dampener on bookings, especially for this winter, Tui said. Despite this, it expects bookings for next summer to be close to pre-pandemic levels. New UK travel rulesto try to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant came into effect on Tuesday. The changes include include pre-departure tests for people arriving in the UK, while 11 African countrieshave been put on the red list for travel. The travel industry warnedon Monday that the new rules would be a ""hammer blow"" and that livelihoods would be ""devastated"". Covid: Travel changes too late to halt potential new wave - scientist Omicron: What Covid tests do I need if I travel abroad? Tui said it had 4.1 million bookings for its next winter and summer seasons, with 1.4 million bookings since 3 October. However, it said: ""The increased media coverage of rising incident rates and the emergence of new Omicron variant has weakened this positive momentum, particularly for winter."" Winter bookings were returning to pre-pandemic levels before ""recent news coverage"" of the pandemic, Tui said. Over the past week, a quarter of Tui holidays booked for December had been postponed to a later date, it told the BBC. The holiday firm narrowed its loss before tax to â¬71m (Â£60.5m) in the fourth quarter of the year to 30 September, compared with a loss in the same period last year of â¬836m. It didn't say how much it expected to make next year. After such a tumultuous couple of years for the travel industry, businesses are pinning their hopes on a strong 2022 summer season. There's been some optimism in the air. However, the uncertainty around Omicron has prompted fears of a hit to consumer confidence, especially as a result of the re-introduction of temporary rules around international travel - with the UK bringing back the red list and extra Covid testing requirements. So far it's short-term bookings being affected. The real problem will arise if people who might normally make their summer holiday booking after Christmas or in January decide not to. The industry will be crossing its fingers that the bumper summer it needs does still come to pass. Tui chief executive Friedrich Joussen said that uncertainty over travel restrictions was ""annoying"". ""Overnight you get new rules,"" he said. ""You have gone on vacation thinking nothing can happen, then tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people have new rules and that is difficult."" He called on the government to give the travel industry more notice about upcoming rule changes. Mr Joussen added that Tui partially subsidises the costs of PCR tests, which has some financial impact on the business. While Omicron symptoms have so far been mild, there areearly signs it is more transmissible than the Delta variant. Following the new UK border restrictions brought in after the emergence of Omicron, more than one in eight UK tourism firms that cater for foreign visitors have had cancellations or expect to have them in the run-up to Christmas, industry body UKInbound said. It said a survey of its members suggested ""green shoots of recovery"" had been ""put on hold"". Its chief executive Joss Croft said: ""Although thoroughly depressing, these results are not surprising. ""International consumer confidence to travel to the UK has taken another huge hit, and the UK's kneejerk decisions and lack of support for businesses that bear the consequences, means the recovery of this industry has already been derailed."" He added that firms needed ""emergency support"" and that they had ""no wiggle room left"". ""The summer season was all but lost for them, they have depleted their cash reserves and maxed out loans,"" he said. How are travel rules being relaxed?

LiveLiveNo 10 faces questions over Christmas party video3 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson has announced tougher Covid-19 measures in England to control the spread of the Omicron variant Guidance to work from home will return on Monday and face masks will also have to be worn in more public venues Covid passes proving vaccination or a negative test will be required at nightclubs and venues with large crowds The Plan B restrictions are ""proportionate and responsible"", the PM says Health Secretary Sajid Javid meanwhile tells the Commons that Omicron is much more transmissible than the Delta variant Earlier the PM apologised for a video that showed his staff joking about a Christmas party held during lockdown last December and ordered an inquiry The Met Police has said it will not investigate the video because it does not ""provide evidence"" regulations were breached Allegra Stratton, who was Johnson's spokeswoman at the time, has resigned from No 10 over the video Edited by Emma Owen and Claire Heald We're drawing coverage of today's busy coronavirus news to a close. But do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott, Nathan Williams, Sophie Williams, Dulcie Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Joshua Cheetham and Mal Siret. And the page was edited by Emma Owen, Claire Heald and Kevin Ponniah. It's been an eventful and fast-moving day of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main stories: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva At its weekly Covid 19 briefing, today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was some initial evidence that the Omicron variant was more infectious, that vaccines could be somewhat less effective against it, but that its health effects might be less severe. But officials stressed that more research is needed, and warned again that countries must act now to prepare for another pandemic wave. A priority must be vaccinating the unvaccinated, and reliable public health measures such as mask wearing, testing, and social distancing. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told governments waiting to act until hospitals started to fill up would be too late. WHO officials also said booster vaccines should not be a priority - saying all the evidence shows existing vaccines provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalisations, and death. Governments must instead make every effort to reach vaccine hesitant people, and ramp up mass vaccination in largely unvaccinated countries. The new rule for some venues to introduce Covid certification is an ""unfair double
standard"" the live music industry says. Pubs and bars will not have to ask for Covid passports ""whilst
live music venues get hit with certification"", according to industry trade association Live. Covid health certificates will be required for people to enter English unseated indoor venues with more than 500 attendees. Meanwhile, The Theatres Trust said the rise of the Omicron variant and the new measures will ""have a big
impact on the willingness of people to travel and go to theatres over Christmas"". The organisation's director Jon Morgan said: ""This will have a knock-on effect on theatresâ viability at a vital time of year
for the industry and Christmas shows that are just emerging from the
significant loss of revenue in 2020 and early 2021."" Mark Harper and other Tory backbenchers expressed opposition to Plan B Back to the announcement of Plan B restrictions for England - and there is an indication that some backbench Tory MPs will not support the government when it puts them to a vote. The Workington MP Mark Jenkinson says the rules are ""divisive, discriminatory and are unlikely to stop spread"". In atweet,external, he adds the health secretary, who addressed MPs at the same time the prime minister made his announcement, ""offered no evidence for further restrictions...  just as businesses desperately need a good Christmas"". Instead, vaccination was key in the response to the Omicron variant he said. East Devon MP Simon Jupp says Plan B will cost jobs in many sectors, including hospitality. While working from home wonât help social or economic recovery. And former chief whip Mark Harper suggests the ""initial evidence on Omicron doesn't support these measures"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Prof Chris Whitty says vaccines are a useful way to prevent serious infection Introducing more restrictions in England just before Christmas for
the second year running is, of course, depressing. But this is vastly different from last year. Then, large
parts of the country were put into what was effectively lockdown with tier
four. A full national lockdown followed in the new year. This time, with these latest Plan B measures, society is being kept open - just with extra
precautions being taken. As England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, we are in
an immeasurably better position now. That is down to immunity built up by
vaccination and previous infection. This variant can dodge some of those defences - but not
all. A step back, but by no means a return to square one. Dominic HughesHealth correspondent, in Preston Angela Roberts got her booster jab this morning There's been lots going on today but one important thing to remind you of is thatpeople aged 40 and over in England can now book their booster jabfor three months after their second dose. Angela Roberts, who lives in Hutton, just outside Preston,
was one of the first to get a booster at the vaccination hub in the town centre
this morning. âEverybody needs to have it done, itâs important that you
protect yourself,"" she said. Around 700 people will get a jab here today â although there have been days when 1,000
vaccines were delivered. Reflecting on the fact that itâs a year to the day since the
first Covid vaccine jab was given to Margaret Keenan, Angela said lots had
changed. âIt is just amazing, we just need it carrying on and to get
us all protected.â As the government announces new ""vaccine passport"" requirements for night clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of a ""devastating impact"" on the sector. It's also questioned whether the move was an attempt to distract attention from a ""damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party"". From 15 December, NHS Covid passes will become mandatory for indoor unseated venues holding more than 500 people, and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. Two vaccine doses will be sufficient for the pass, but this will be kept under review. A negative lateral flow test will also be acceptable. Read more here. People in England will soon need to show their Covid status to get into nightclubs and many other large venues. What are the new rules? In England, people will need to use theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to: People can also show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test. Businesses have a week to introduce the measures. How do I get a Covid passport? You can get the pass if you're 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any one of the following: Get the full details across the UKhere. Olaf Scholz says goodbye to his predecessor Angela Merkel at the chancellery in Berlin The Covid crisis is the biggest challenge facing the country, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says. Afterformally taking power from Angela Merkelfollowing her historic 16 years as leader, Scholz acknowledged that he had taken control of Europe's largest economy in the middle of an aggressive fourth wave of Covid infections. ""We know that the transition that we are making here now is taking place in the middle of a large, ongoing crisis that calls for continuity and community and I think we will manage that,"" he said in Berlin. Scholz said, however, that it would only be possible to fight the virus if the public got vaccinated and received their booster shots as soon as possible. The soft-spoken 63-year-old also said that restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing needed to be followed. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says Covid is spreading quickly in the country France's fifth wave of Covid infections has not yet peaked and so a fourth vaccine shot might be needed to help keep things under control, officials have warned. ""It's still spreading quickly and will continue to do so in the coming weeks,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Meanwhile, government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said: ""For now, there's a call for one booster shot. Will that be enough? I don't know. Maybe we'll need a fourth shot."" Last week, French health authorities said the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was likely to become the most prevalent variant in the country by early next year. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said France's fifth Covid wave was spreading fast and having a big impact on hospitals, with a patient admitted to intensive care on average every 10 minutes. France recorded more than 59,000 cases on Wednesday Away from events in the UK, France has recorded
its highest daily Covid cases since November 2020. The country reported 59,019 Covid cases on Wednesday with
168 Covid deaths. Europeâs Covid rate has been rising rapidly in recent weeks
and new restrictions have been imposed in a number of nations. Austria, which is back under lockdown, has announced mandatory vaccinations while Germany is also mulling making jabs compulsory. Belgium has tightened rules on face masks and Italy has introduced a ""green pass"" which is required at workplaces, venues and on public transport. Last month The World Health Organization said itwas âvery worriedâ about the spread of Covid-19 in Europe. Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans
Kluge warned that 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent
action is taken. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Armed
with ahastily arranged inquiry and the resignation of his former spokesperson Allegra Stratton, the prime minister could demonstrate at his press conference that that he wasn't
hiding from questions on the Downing Street party of last year. There were
caveats to his ""guidance was followed"" mantra  - such as ""as far as I am
aware"" - and he was pushed to broaden the remit of the cabinet secretary's
inquiry. But
in replying to Laura Kuenssberg's question on trust, he emphasised his trust in
the British people rather than fully addressing whether they could trust him. As
many of the Plan B measures won't be introduced until next week, questions will
inevitably be asked about whether the public health message would have landed
with more impact had the press conference been held on a different day. His
critics - and that includes some Conservatives - say he was indulging in a ""dead cat"" strategy to divert attention from whatever had been going on behind
the black door of Downing Street. But it seemed at this press conference that
the feline was still alive and prowling around the prime minister. Christmas trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abramovitch While some companies, such as delivery firms, thrived under England's working from home rules, others fear more uncertainty from the government's latest Plan B guidance. David Abramovitch, co-founder of Grind, says his chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London were just starting to get back on their financial feet after the previous lockdown. It will be ""painful"" to go into ""reverse gear again"", he tells the BBC. ""Already we've seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since the Omicron variant emerged."" Meanwhile Ruth, a dentist, says she feels like people have learned enough to keep working as they are. ""With the vaccinations and the [personal protective equipment], we have to learn to live with these things. If you lock people down constantly, they're not going to behave themselves."" Allegra Stratton made a tearful statement earlier today after a video of her joking with colleagues emerged The Metropolitan Police will not launch an investigation into the video of No 10 staff joking about holding a Christmas party when London was under Tier 3 restrictions last year. They say the video ""does not provide evidence of a breach"" of health regulations and instead ""restates allegations made in the media"". In a statement, the force says it had received ""a significant amount of correspondence"" over the video, obtained by ITV. It adds that any evidence found as part of the Cabinet Office inquiry will be passed to the Met for further consideration. Read our full storyhere. Reality Check The prime minister maintained at
his press conference that: âTo the best of my knowledge, we have followed the
rules throughout.â He had been questioned about why the cabinet secretary had been asked to look into the
Downing Street party on 18 December last year and the Department for Education party, but
not a number of other parties that have been reported to have taken place. At
the time, the governmentâs guidance specifically said that there should not be
Christmas parties. London
was in Tier 3 restrictions on 18 December 2020 and the law said that there should
not be indoor gatherings - unless they were âreasonably necessaryâ for work. You
can read more details about what the Covid rules were at the timehere. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges PM over new restrictions Amid fallout from the row over a Christmas party at Downing Street in 2020, the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg asked Boris Johnson how he could tell people they must now follow new restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Why all these changes announced today? A fresh analysis published by the UK Health Security Agency
suggests the Omicron variant will be responsible for at least 50% of Covid cases within two to
four weeks. The prediction is based on the number of cases judged to be
suspected Omicron from testing data. That shows around 2% of daily cases are being caused by the
new variant. If that is correct it would mean there are about 1,000 Omicron cases every 24 hours. What is more, the cases are thought to be doubling every two
or three days. What is not yet known is whether Omicron will completely
replace Delta, the variant that is currently dominant. if you missed all that, the government has announced new Covid rules for England, in response to concern over the Omicron variant. Here's a sum-up of the latest rules and youcan read more here in our guide. This video can not be played Omicron: Boris Johnson announces Plan B Covid rules for England In that press conference from Downing Street just now, Boris Johnson  unveiled the ""Plan B"" Covid rules for England. This means that people should start working from home where necessary from Monday. Mask wearing is going to become a more common sight again, as indoor public venues such as cinemas and theatres will require masks from Friday. An NHS Covid pass, proving vaccination or a negative test, will be requires for nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather from a week's time. Daily testing will be a requirement for those who come into contact with a positive case of Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

Scholz to take over from Merkel as German leader,"Olaf Scholz said goodbye to his predecessor at the chancellery, thanking her for her commitment to the role Olaf Scholz has been been sworn in as Germany's new chancellor, formally taking power after Angela Merkel's historic 16 years as leader. He promised he would do all he could to work towards a new start for Germany. As she left the chancellery in Berlin, ending a 31-year political career, Mrs Merkel told her former vice-chancellor to approach the task ""with joy"". His centre-left Social Democrats will govern alongside the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats. Mr Scholz, a soft-spoken 63-year-old, steered the Social Democrats to election victory in late September, positioning himself as the continuity candidate because he played a key role in the Merkel government as vice-chancellor. The German parliament, the Bundestag, backed him as chancellor by 395 votes to 303, and he was then formally appointed as the ninth federal chancellor by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. After the vote in parliament, he was asked by Bundestag President BÃ¤rbel Bas whether he accepted the appointment and said ""yes"".  He later took the oath of office but - unlike his predecessor - left out the religious reference ""so help me God"". Since the election, Mr Scholz's party has worked with the Greens and the Free Democrats on a coalition deal, which was finally signed on Tuesday. All 16 ministers took the oath of office on Wednesday, becomingGermany's first cabinet,externalto include as many women as men. Mr Scholz's cabinet includes seven Social Democrats, five Greens and four Free Democrats The new government has ambitious plans to fight climate change by phasing out coal early and focusing on renewable energy, but their initial priority will be tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Health authorities have recorded another 69,601 cases in the past 24 hours and a further 527 deaths - the highest number since last winter. Ready for power: Team Scholz promises a new Germany What Olaf Scholz means for the world economy Olaf Scholz takes on top job as German chancellor ""I said 'yes',"" tweeted Olaf Scholz drily, moments after the Bundestag elected him chancellor. This is the moment the career politician has long been waiting for. After 16 years of Angela Merkel, it's a case of out with the old and in with the new-ish. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Scholz is already a known and trusted face in Berlin and Brussels. He marketed himself to voters as sort of Merkel Mark Two, despite hailing from a different political party. But it's not all about continuity, and friends and trade partners of this rich and powerful nation will be watching closely. Mr Scholz's coalition government is a never-before-seen marriage of convenience. What unites them, they claim, is a determination to modernise Germany, while preserving the country's treasured stability. Immediate challenges for them are: Covid - Germany is in the midst of a pernicious fourth wave and considering mandatory vaccination The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine Angela Merkel was accused of putting trade before politics. Team Scholz is expected to be somewhat tougher on Moscow and Beijing despite the potential economic hit to German business. Relations with Washington may improve as a result, though, and that is a declared priority of Olaf Scholz's fledgling coalition. Read more from Katya Adler here. Mr Scholz's first foreign trip as chancellor will be to Paris and Brussels on Friday. He and Greens joint leader Annalena Baerbock, who becomes foreign minister, will have to respond to fears surrounding Russia's military build-up near the border with Ukraine. Although Russia has denied plans to invade its neighbour, Angela Merkel agreed with US President Joe Biden and the leaders of the UK, France and Italy late on Tuesday that they would adopt a joint strategy to respond by imposing ""significant and severe harm on the Russian economy"". One obvious economic measure would be to threaten Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, which has been completed but is still awaiting approval from the German energy regulator. US officials say they have reached an understanding with Germany that the pipeline would be shut down, which would be a significant intervention. In a message of congratulations to Mr Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he looked forward to constructive dialogue, and hoped that Germany continued to recognise ""there's no alternative to dialogue"". Leaving the chancellery on Wednesday afternoon, Mrs Merkel was applauded by staff as she told her successor to take over and work for the good of Germany. In turn, he spoke of the crises that had brought them together and of the ""deeply trusting collaboration"" they had developed. First elected in December 1990, Angela Merkel was immediately given a ministerial job by then Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But she then helped oust him and became Christian Democrat leader in 2000, before becoming chancellor herself in November 2005. She will still have an office close to the Bundestag, in a flat that was once used by Margot Honecker, once dubbed the most powerful woman in communist East Germany.

Covid PCR testing market labelled ârip-off jungleâ,"PCR tests for travel are a ""rip-off jungle"", former chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, Lord Tyrie has told the BBC. The government website has recently advertised tests for travellers at prices that have been difficult to obtain. Lord Tyrie said for the tests to have been ""mismanaged"" once by the government was a ""misfortune"". Overpriced tests and poor service he said were ""still widespread"". For the problem to resurface after the summer, he added, was the down to the government's ""carelessness"". The government said it monitors issues raised by the public and takes rapid action if appropriate. This action has included the removal of companies from the list advertised, a government spokesperson told the BBC. ""We've been clear that it is unacceptable for any private testing company to take advantage of holidaymakers,"" a government spokesperson said. Covid test rules throw travel plans into disarray What tests do I need if I travel abroad? Travel changes too late to stop Omicron - scientist Concerns regarding the price of tests have been raised again after the government announced people arriving in the UK would need to take a PCR test before the end of their second day - on top of a pre-flight test. During the summer, the Health Secretary was forced to launch an investigation with the CMA to look into the operation of firms who were advertising tests. Thousands of consumers complained that they never received results for tests they ordered and paid for, which were listed on gov.uk. Lord Tyrie, a former MP and Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee said ""it appears that some of the worst practices: misleading online advertisements; overpricing; unacceptably poor service among them, are still widespread."" The Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, which works with the government to ensure the UK testing industry has high ethical and professional standards, said the government had failed to ""enforce accuracy"" on its providers list. Christmas is typically a busy time for the travel industry, with friends and families crossing borders to reunite for celebrations. Vaccinations will make travel easier for those who chose to travel, but the new Omicron variant means testing is necessary again. Lord Tyrie, who criticised the government and the CMA in August for their management of the market, warned then that the government must take advantage of the gap between the summer and the busy winter travel period ""to sort this out once and for all"". ""It was a scandal waiting to happen and it is now happening and it needs very urgent action if we're to have to have a reasonable chance of protecting thousands of consumers,"" he added. ""To allow this to continue over the peak Christmas period would be scandalous. Other countries seem to have done better - we've got to try harder"". As the government has reintroduced the need for more testing associated with travel, the Department of Health and Social Care has approached many private providers to see if they could increase their testing capacity to meet increasing demand. One provider told the BBC that the government contacted them to ask: ""Can we do day 2 and day 8 testing as there is a capacity issue?"" This provider refused because of the difficulty of the market place, and the stress and pressure that goes with it. The government is understood to be closely monitoring the performance of providers with a two-strike process. Those deemed to have failed on standards would be removed from the GOV.UK list. Private providers may be reinstated to the list once they have undertaken corrective action and provided the Department with evidence to show this. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We've been clear that it is unacceptable for any private testing company to take advantage of holidaymakers. ""The government has taken action to drive down the cost of tests for international travel, with the average price of a Day 2 test now under Â£45 with many available for Â£20"".

"Pupils 'pressured regularly for nude photos'One girl told school inspectors that ""boys ask for nudes or keep spamming your phone"".Wales","""Boys ask for nudes or keep spamming your phone,"" one girl told inspectors Pupils are pressured regularly to send nude photos and girls harassed over the length of their skirts, a school inspection report has found. About half of secondary pupils said they had experienced sexual harassment from fellow students. Estyn's study,externalfound many pupils would not tell their teachers, as incidents had become ""normalised"" and teachers often dismissed them as ""trivial"". The Welsh government said it showed an ""uncomfortable truth"" pupils faced. Children told inspectors that harassment happened in the classroom but was more common outside school and online. Inspectors said this meant schools did not realise the extent of the problem. Estyn said there were ""inconsistencies"" when teachers were alerted and, in the worst cases, staff ignored incidents of ""verbal sexual harassment"" between pupils, and often responded with statements like ""boys will be boys"". Twice as many girls said they had faced sexual harassment than boys, while 46% of those who had experienced it decided not to tell anyone else. Welsh review to be held into harassment in schools Children as young as 11 pressured for nudes Inspectors said most older girls reported being regularly pressured by boys to send nude photos. ""Boys ask for nudes or keep spamming your phone,"" one girl told inspectors. Some said it was common to have unknown men, as well as classmates, ""begging"" them to send naked images on social media. Other issues raised by children were concerns about the ""length and fit"" of school skirts. ""If you are wearing a short skirt, boys will use that as a way of consent - you are asking for it,"" one pupil told the review. Some girls felt they had to wear shorts under their skirts ""to stop boys from looking"". Meanwhile, others said they picked deliberately tight skirts because they were more difficult for boys to lift up. About 1,300 secondary school children in Wales took part in the study which found pupils' experiences of sexual harassment increased as they got older. Nearly all Year 13 pupils (95%) reported seeing sexual harassment, with 72% claiming to have seen it happening in school. ""The report is called We Don't Tell Our Teachers - and that is what we've found,"" said report author Delyth Gray. ""There is a sharp polarisation between what pupils tell us is happening and what staff in schools actually know. ""They [the pupils] don't think that these things are important enough to report to their teachers, although they tend to happen every day."" Ms Gray said teachers had told inspectors they wanted to see more training opportunities to help them deal with issues, while children wanted to see teachers being more proactive and aware of the problems. Her review recommended that schools recognise sexual harassment was ""highly prevalent"" among young people and ""provide sufficient, cumulative and beneficial learning opportunities"". Many children highlighted a lack of sex education, with ""older pupils in many schools"" reporting they had ""no sex education at all"". Sally Holland said more time should be devoted to teaching sex education beyond the age of 14 Sending nudes has become normal, say pupils Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a nightd Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said opportunities to learn about sex and relationships were often ""squeezed out"" of the curriculum to make room for formal qualifications as children got older. ""Sometimes it actually doesn't exist after young people are aged about 14, which is the time there should be more time to do it,"" she said. ""Schools need to be given permission within the education system to give time for these important life, health and safety issues."" Ms Holland said thenew curriculum for Wales, which includes mandatory relationships and sexuality education, provided ""good opportunities"" to do things better. The Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said teachers should not be left alone to deal with deeper societal problems. ""Schools will find the criticism levelled at them in Estyn's report both frustrating and unfair as they put huge effort into placing the wellbeing of their students at the very heart of everything they do,"" said Eithne Hughes, director of ASCL Cymru. ""It is totally unreasonable for Estyn to imply this is a problem only schools should have to deal with. ""They are a microcosm of society and the important issues raised in this report can only be dealt with by there being an open and wide-ranging national discussion that involves not only teachers and leaders, but parents, the social media platforms where so much of the abuse takes place, the Welsh government and, most importantly, young people."" An online questionnaire from Estyn, answered by 1,150 pupils, and included in the report's supporting documents, found that 23% boys and 26% girls at secondary school said they had experienced unwanted kissing or sexual touching in a school setting.

""It highlights the uncomfortable truth about the prevalence of peer-on-peer sexual harassment in our schools and that children often share their experiences with friends rather than their teachers,"" he said. ""This leads to a lack of awareness of the true scale of sexual harassment in schools. ""It is only through honest conversations that we can work together to tackle these issues.""

Hundreds without power after Storm Barra,"There was snow in the village of Leadhills, South Lanarkshire Power has been restored to all the homes in north and north east Scotland which were left without electricity in the wake of Storm Barra. The power cuts came days after supplies were restored after Storm Arwen caused widespread damage to the network. Utility firm SSEN said engineers had restored power to more than 9,000 customers across the north of Scotland. It confirmed that the last remaining homes were reconnected at about 20:30 on Wednesday evening. The majority of those without supplies after Tuesday's storm were in Aberdeenshire. Braemar Mountain Rescue Team had a ""challenging"" overnight rescue Some rail services were affected, with cancellations affecting a few routes in the west of Scotland and speed restrictions in force on others. CalMac also said certain timetables had been adjusted after some ferry services were cancelled. Braemar Mountain Rescue Team said it had a""very challenging"" rescueof a man stranded at Fords of Avon in the Cairngorms. Some primary schools in Aberdeenshire decided to remain closed on Wednesday due to lack of power and heating, including Bracoden, Rhynie and Strathdon. Allow Twitter content?

But do join us again tomorrow. Updates were brought to you by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott, Nathan Williams, Sophie Williams, Dulcie Lee, Alex Kleiderman, Joshua Cheetham and Mal Siret. And the page was edited by Emma Owen, Claire Heald and Kevin Ponniah. It's been an eventful and fast-moving day of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a round-up of the main stories: Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva At its weekly Covid 19 briefing, today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was some initial evidence that the Omicron variant was more infectious, that vaccines could be somewhat less effective against it, but that its health effects might be less severe. But officials stressed that more research is needed, and warned again that countries must act now to prepare for another pandemic wave. A priority must be vaccinating the unvaccinated, and reliable public health measures such as mask wearing, testing, and social distancing. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told governments waiting to act until hospitals started to fill up would be too late. WHO officials also said booster vaccines should not be a priority - saying all the evidence shows existing vaccines provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalisations, and death. Governments must instead make every effort to reach vaccine hesitant people, and ramp up mass vaccination in largely unvaccinated countries. The new rule for some venues to introduce Covid certification is an ""unfair double
standard"" the live music industry says. Pubs and bars will not have to ask for Covid passports ""whilst
live music venues get hit with certification"", according to industry trade association Live. Covid health certificates will be required for people to enter English unseated indoor venues with more than 500 attendees. Meanwhile, The Theatres Trust said the rise of the Omicron variant and the new measures will ""have a big
impact on the willingness of people to travel and go to theatres over Christmas"". The organisation's director Jon Morgan said: ""This will have a knock-on effect on theatresâ viability at a vital time of year
for the industry and Christmas shows that are just emerging from the
significant loss of revenue in 2020 and early 2021."" Mark Harper and other Tory backbenchers expressed opposition to Plan B Back to the announcement of Plan B restrictions for England - and there is an indication that some backbench Tory MPs will not support the government when it puts them to a vote. The Workington MP Mark Jenkinson says the rules are ""divisive, discriminatory and are unlikely to stop spread"". In atweet,external, he adds the health secretary, who addressed MPs at the same time the prime minister made his announcement, ""offered no evidence for further restrictions...  just as businesses desperately need a good Christmas"". Instead, vaccination was key in the response to the Omicron variant he said. East Devon MP Simon Jupp says Plan B will cost jobs in many sectors, including hospitality. While working from home wonât help social or economic recovery. And former chief whip Mark Harper suggests the ""initial evidence on Omicron doesn't support these measures"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Prof Chris Whitty says vaccines are a useful way to prevent serious infection Introducing more restrictions in England just before Christmas for
the second year running is, of course, depressing. But this is vastly different from last year. Then, large
parts of the country were put into what was effectively lockdown with tier
four. A full national lockdown followed in the new year. This time, with these latest Plan B measures, society is being kept open - just with extra
precautions being taken. As England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, we are in
an immeasurably better position now. That is down to immunity built up by
vaccination and previous infection. This variant can dodge some of those defences - but not
all. A step back, but by no means a return to square one. Dominic HughesHealth correspondent, in Preston Angela Roberts got her booster jab this morning There's been lots going on today but one important thing to remind you of is thatpeople aged 40 and over in England can now book their booster jabfor three months after their second dose. Angela Roberts, who lives in Hutton, just outside Preston,
was one of the first to get a booster at the vaccination hub in the town centre
this morning. âEverybody needs to have it done, itâs important that you
protect yourself,"" she said. Around 700 people will get a jab here today â although there have been days when 1,000
vaccines were delivered. Reflecting on the fact that itâs a year to the day since the
first Covid vaccine jab was given to Margaret Keenan, Angela said lots had
changed. âIt is just amazing, we just need it carrying on and to get
us all protected.â As the government announces new ""vaccine passport"" requirements for night clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of a ""devastating impact"" on the sector. It's also questioned whether the move was an attempt to distract attention from a ""damaging story about the Downing Street Christmas party"". From 15 December, NHS Covid passes will become mandatory for indoor unseated venues holding more than 500 people, and outdoor venues with a capacity of more than 4,000. Two vaccine doses will be sufficient for the pass, but this will be kept under review. A negative lateral flow test will also be acceptable. Read more here. People in England will soon need to show their Covid status to get into nightclubs and many other large venues. What are the new rules? In England, people will need to use theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to: People can also show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test. Businesses have a week to introduce the measures. How do I get a Covid passport? You can get the pass if you're 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any one of the following: Get the full details across the UKhere. Olaf Scholz says goodbye to his predecessor Angela Merkel at the chancellery in Berlin The Covid crisis is the biggest challenge facing the country, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says. Afterformally taking power from Angela Merkelfollowing her historic 16 years as leader, Scholz acknowledged that he had taken control of Europe's largest economy in the middle of an aggressive fourth wave of Covid infections. ""We know that the transition that we are making here now is taking place in the middle of a large, ongoing crisis that calls for continuity and community and I think we will manage that,"" he said in Berlin. Scholz said, however, that it would only be possible to fight the virus if the public got vaccinated and received their booster shots as soon as possible. The soft-spoken 63-year-old also said that restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing needed to be followed. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says Covid is spreading quickly in the country France's fifth wave of Covid infections has not yet peaked and so a fourth vaccine shot might be needed to help keep things under control, officials have warned. ""It's still spreading quickly and will continue to do so in the coming weeks,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Meanwhile, government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy said: ""For now, there's a call for one booster shot. Will that be enough? I don't know. Maybe we'll need a fourth shot."" Last week, French health authorities said the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was likely to become the most prevalent variant in the country by early next year. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said France's fifth Covid wave was spreading fast and having a big impact on hospitals, with a patient admitted to intensive care on average every 10 minutes. France recorded more than 59,000 cases on Wednesday Away from events in the UK, France has recorded
its highest daily Covid cases since November 2020. The country reported 59,019 Covid cases on Wednesday with
168 Covid deaths. Europeâs Covid rate has been rising rapidly in recent weeks
and new restrictions have been imposed in a number of nations. Austria, which is back under lockdown, has announced mandatory vaccinations while Germany is also mulling making jabs compulsory. Belgium has tightened rules on face masks and Italy has introduced a ""green pass"" which is required at workplaces, venues and on public transport. Last month The World Health Organization said itwas âvery worriedâ about the spread of Covid-19 in Europe. Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans
Kluge warned that 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent
action is taken. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Armed
with ahastily arranged inquiry and the resignation of his former spokesperson Allegra Stratton, the prime minister could demonstrate at his press conference that that he wasn't
hiding from questions on the Downing Street party of last year. There were
caveats to his ""guidance was followed"" mantra  - such as ""as far as I am
aware"" - and he was pushed to broaden the remit of the cabinet secretary's
inquiry. But
in replying to Laura Kuenssberg's question on trust, he emphasised his trust in
the British people rather than fully addressing whether they could trust him. As
many of the Plan B measures won't be introduced until next week, questions will
inevitably be asked about whether the public health message would have landed
with more impact had the press conference been held on a different day. His
critics - and that includes some Conservatives - say he was indulging in a ""dead cat"" strategy to divert attention from whatever had been going on behind
the black door of Downing Street. But it seemed at this press conference that
the feline was still alive and prowling around the prime minister. Christmas trade is incredibly important, says restaurant owner David Abramovitch While some companies, such as delivery firms, thrived under England's working from home rules, others fear more uncertainty from the government's latest Plan B guidance. David Abramovitch, co-founder of Grind, says his chain of nine cafÃ© restaurants in London were just starting to get back on their financial feet after the previous lockdown. It will be ""painful"" to go into ""reverse gear again"", he tells the BBC. ""Already we've seen a big drop-off in Christmas party bookings since the Omicron variant emerged."" Meanwhile Ruth, a dentist, says she feels like people have learned enough to keep working as they are. ""With the vaccinations and the [personal protective equipment], we have to learn to live with these things. If you lock people down constantly, they're not going to behave themselves."" Allegra Stratton made a tearful statement earlier today after a video of her joking with colleagues emerged The Metropolitan Police will not launch an investigation into the video of No 10 staff joking about holding a Christmas party when London was under Tier 3 restrictions last year. They say the video ""does not provide evidence of a breach"" of health regulations and instead ""restates allegations made in the media"". In a statement, the force says it had received ""a significant amount of correspondence"" over the video, obtained by ITV. It adds that any evidence found as part of the Cabinet Office inquiry will be passed to the Met for further consideration. Read our full storyhere. Reality Check The prime minister maintained at
his press conference that: âTo the best of my knowledge, we have followed the
rules throughout.â He had been questioned about why the cabinet secretary had been asked to look into the
Downing Street party on 18 December last year and the Department for Education party, but
not a number of other parties that have been reported to have taken place. At
the time, the governmentâs guidance specifically said that there should not be
Christmas parties. London
was in Tier 3 restrictions on 18 December 2020 and the law said that there should
not be indoor gatherings - unless they were âreasonably necessaryâ for work. You
can read more details about what the Covid rules were at the timehere. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges PM over new restrictions Amid fallout from the row over a Christmas party at Downing Street in 2020, the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg asked Boris Johnson how he could tell people they must now follow new restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Why all these changes announced today? A fresh analysis published by the UK Health Security Agency
suggests the Omicron variant will be responsible for at least 50% of Covid cases within two to
four weeks. The prediction is based on the number of cases judged to be
suspected Omicron from testing data. That shows around 2% of daily cases are being caused by the
new variant. If that is correct it would mean there are about 1,000 Omicron cases every 24 hours. What is more, the cases are thought to be doubling every two
or three days. What is not yet known is whether Omicron will completely
replace Delta, the variant that is currently dominant. if you missed all that, the government has announced new Covid rules for England, in response to concern over the Omicron variant. Here's a sum-up of the latest rules and youcan read more here in our guide. This video can not be played Omicron: Boris Johnson announces Plan B Covid rules for England In that press conference from Downing Street just now, Boris Johnson  unveiled the ""Plan B"" Covid rules for England. This means that people should start working from home where necessary from Monday. Mask wearing is going to become a more common sight again, as indoor public venues such as cinemas and theatres will require masks from Friday. An NHS Covid pass, proving vaccination or a negative test, will be requires for nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather from a week's time. Daily testing will be a requirement for those who come into contact with a positive case of Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

What next for Johnson after the No 10 party video?Footage of No 10 staff joking about a lockdown party has left even the PM's supporters stunned.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Watch: Video obtained by ITV News shows Downing Street staff joking about a No 10 Christmas party during a mock press conference ""Indefensible"", ""catastrophic"" and ""astonishing"". Condemnations, not from Boris Johnson's political opponents, but from his own side - many Conservative MPs are furious afterfootage emerged of Downing Street staffers laughingabout how they'd have to explain the gathering in December last year, if news of it ever emerged. It's hard to imagine a more toe-curling seeming confirmation of what was going on in there, when socialising was banned for everyone else, the virus was taking hold and families across the country were unable to see sick relatives or loved ones in care homes. The footage has already been seen by millions of people, well beyond Westminster's bubble, even joked about by on ITV's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. But what are the likely consequences of this deep embarrassment for No 10? First off and most importantly, many members of the public -most poignantly those who lost relatives to Covid- will feel intensely hacked off. Not just to find out that Downing Street had a party, but that captured on camera staffers laughed about what they had done. A Whitehall source says: ""As an ordinary punter it makes me feel stupid for following the rules."" Boris Johnson has denied any party took place in Downing Street last Christmas Of course it is dynamite too for the opposition parties, who have for months been making the case that the government believes it can act however it chooses. Expect to hear plenty of the charge of ""one rule for us, one rule for them"" in the next few days. On the back ofDowning Street's attempt to change the rules on MPs' behaviourafter former minister Owen Paterson broke them, even some senior Conservatives are making that claim tonight. One says: ""The handling of the Paterson affair showed the PM didn't think the rules applied to his friends. This video demonstrates that view is widely shared in No 10 by very senior political advisers appointed by the PM. ""People who were prevented by the government from seeing loved ones at the end of their life will conclude they were being taken for fools."" Making voters feel like idiots is not exactly a winning strategy. And if the government concludes before too long that the rise in Omicron means he has to ask the public to make significant sacrifices again, after this just how willing will some of the public be to comply? PM: I crashed the car over Paterson case One senior Tory MP and avowed lockdown sceptic Charles Walker says: ""The No 10 party means that any future lockdowns will be advisory, whatever the law says."" Another senior figure reckons the existence of the footage makes this mess more damaging than Dominic Cummings' trip to Barnard Castle. There's another consequence for No 10, too, which is important to its relationship with the Tory Party and the public- the impact that it has on the faith in Downing Street to tell the truth. Every government I've ever covered has used spin. Every government I've covered has sometimes been less than straight with the facts. Yet footage emerged on Tuesday after nearly a week of Downing Street using various different formations to deny the story. As I write late on Tuesday night, No 10 is sticking to its line that there wasn't even a party. But with the leaked footage, and rising internal anger, it's hard to see how that can really last. To put it diplomatically, Boris Johnson has always had anunusual relationship with the truth. His party has tolerated that because of the other electoral assets they believe he has. But ministers and MPs who have been out defending No 10 in the last few days will feel sore that they weren't given the full facts. One minister instructed to hold the line earlier this week told me it was ""like they were in denial"". Another senior Tory MP said privately: ""After this, I can never again take anything Boris says at face value."" It's not yet clear if any MPs or ministers will be willing to go and defend the government on Wednesday. With Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson can't avoid the issue himself. And immediately the fiasco's prompted pressure on the PM to sharpen up the way he does business. Calls for a better operation in No 10 have been getting louder since the Owen Paterson shambles. A long-term aide to Mr Johnson went back into No 10 not long ago to help. But there've been private demands from a former minister to sack chief of staff Dan Rosenfeld, speculation that anyone seen in the video will have to quit, suggestions that the PM will have to make a grovelling apology and send some staff out the door, or try to get ahead of the story and launch some kind of inquiry. The question being asked, even by one of his allies, is about Boris Johnson himself - ""Is he going to be big enough to understand the reason we're getting into difficulties, is because he is trying to run government with chaos, like he has run his life?"" they ask. The former minister points the finger at the prime minister's chosen manner of running No 10, with ""cliques running round"" and wanting to hear from ""people who will tell him he is wonderful, not to tell him that he is not"". Boris Johnson still has many backers, many MPs who believe they owe their seats to him. His presence looms so large over his party, that a different kind of party altogether is not suddenly going to sink him or his team. We've talked on here so many times about this prime minister's ability to ride the political rollercoaster through deep dips. But again he finds himself at the centre of something that many on his own side find impossible to defend. Even with an enormous majority and unrivalled political celebrity, Boris Johnson's Downing Street might be a lonely place to be this Christmas.

But there've been private demands from a former minister to sack chief of staff Dan Rosenfeld, speculation that anyone seen in the video will have to quit, suggestions that the PM will have to make a grovelling apology and send some staff out the door, or try to get ahead of the story and launch some kind of inquiry. The question being asked, even by one of his allies, is about Boris Johnson himself - ""Is he going to be big enough to understand the reason we're getting into difficulties, is because he is trying to run government with chaos, like he has run his life?"" they ask. The former minister points the finger at the prime minister's chosen manner of running No 10, with ""cliques running round"" and wanting to hear from ""people who will tell him he is wonderful, not to tell him that he is not"". Boris Johnson still has many backers, many MPs who believe they owe their seats to him. His presence looms so large over his party, that a different kind of party altogether is not suddenly going to sink him or his team. We've talked on here so many times about this prime minister's ability to ride the political rollercoaster through deep dips. But again he finds himself at the centre of something that many on his own side find impossible to defend. Even with an enormous majority and unrivalled political celebrity, Boris Johnson's Downing Street might be a lonely place to be this Christmas.

"US vows robust response amid Ukraine invasion fearIn a call with President Biden, Russia's Vladimir Putin seeks guarantees against eastward Nato expansion.Europe","Putin joined the meeting by video link from Sochi The US says it is preparing ""strong economic and other measures"" over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin spoke. In a video call, President Biden voiced worries over Russian troop build-ups near the border with Ukraine and called for a de-escalation of tensions. Russia says it will not attack. President Putin accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to Russia. More than 90,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. The movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. ANALYSIS:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? After Tuesday's call, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration was preparing specific robust responses in the weeks ahead if they were required. The measures included economic sanctions and other actions such as additional troop deployments to Nato allies in the region and defence equipment for Ukraine. Mr Sullivan refused to be drawn on what the economic measures might be. But he said Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is not yet in operation, provided ""leverage"" for the US and its allies. ""If Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,"" he told journalists. Earlier reports said US officials had reached agreement with Germany to shut down the pipeline in the event of an invasion. Mr Biden was accompanied by top officials for the call Other possible measures include restrictions on Russia's banks converting roubles into foreign currencies, or even disconnecting Russia from the Swift global financial payment system, reports say. ""Things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now,"" Mr Sullivan added, referring to Western responses to Russia's annexation of Crimea. He also said there was ""a lot of give and take"" in the call and ""no finger-wagging"" but that President Biden was ""crystal clear where the United States stands on all of these issues"". Video footage of the opening moments showed friendly greetings between the US and Russian leaders, before the talks continued behind closed doors. The call was held on a secure video link set up under previous administrations but never used before. President Putin spoke from his residence in the southern resort of Sochi and President Biden from the White House. By Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter Russia's military option could take a variety of forms from a large incursion, to a significant invasion of the eastern part of Ukraine. One aim would be to bring the main fighting elements of the Ukrainian army to battle and to inflict such a defeat upon them that the Kyiv government has to rethink its position. Invading territory amidst a hostile population has significant risks. Ukraine's armed forces have had some Western weaponry and training and are much improved since 2015. However, Russian forces have also improved over recent years. The firepower Russia is building up is impressive. For all the talk about Ukrainian sovereignty Nato cannot and will not come to Ukraine's aid. And additional weapons supplies might simply contribute to Russia's justification for war. Moscow's calculation of the costs of conflict may also be influenced by previous military deployments. While the West currently sees military engagements through the prism of the strategic defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia may take a very different view. Its operations in Georgia, its seizure of Crimea, its combat in eastern Ukraine - not to mention its involvement in Syria - may all be seen by President Putin as relative victories. Of all the military contingencies, Michael Kofman, of the US Centre for Naval Analyses, still thinks that if it happens it will be big. ""I think Russia is in the best position since 2014 economically, politically, and militarily to execute such an operation, which is not to say it will happen, but simply to suggest that there are the fewest constraints relative to other periods when it has conducted offensive operations."" Read the full analysis Meanwhile, a Kremlin statement said President Putin had stressed that Russia should not be held responsible for tensions because Nato was making ""dangerous attempts to take over Ukrainian territory and increasing its military potential"" on Russia's borders. ""Therefore Russia is seriously interested in getting reliable guarantees fixed in law to rule out the eastward expansion of Nato and the location in countries neighbouring Russia of offensive weapons systems,""the statement added (in Russian).,external The White House said President Biden did not make any guarantees to limit Nato expansion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that, while the talks brought ""no sensations"", he was grateful for President Biden's ""unwavering support"". Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the Reuters news agency that talks between Mr Biden and Mr Putin had enabled ""deterrence and de-escalation"". But he said the focus is to put together a deterrence package to ward off any further escalation from Russia. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether President Putin has made a decision. Presidents Biden and Putin last met in person in Switzerland in June, but made little progress other than to agree to send their ambassadors back and begin a dialogue on nuclear arms control. In a conference call on Monday night, the White House said the leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy had formed a joint strategy ""to impose significant and severe harm on the Russian economy"" should Russia launch an invasion. President Biden spoke to the four European leaders again after his talks with President Putin. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line A large part of the recent Russian military build-up is in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine and then annexed in 2014. Troops are also gathering near Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which are under the control of Russian-backed separatists. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in seven years of conflict since Russian-backed forces seized large areas of Ukraine's east.

Government apologises to Grenfell victimsThe government admits a series of failings in the years leading up to the Grenfell Tower disaster.,"Some 72 people died in the west London tower block fire The government has admitted a series of failings in the years leading up to the Grenfell Tower disaster and apologised to victims of the fire. Its barrister told the Grenfell Tower public inquiry it was ""deeply sorry for its past failures"" in overseeing building safety. Jason Beer QC said local inspectors were responsible for the safety of individual buildings but the government ""deeply regrets past failures"". Some 72 people died in the 2017 fire. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities barrister said: ""It apologises to the bereaved, residents and survivors of the fire for such failures."" ""This can of course neither change what happened nor compensate them for the immeasurable loss and grief suffered. ""The department believes that it must examine its own conduct and candidly accept mistakes, errors and omissions when the inquiry identifies them,"" he added. Cladding failed fire tests 13 years before Grenfell Why is cladding unsafe and what is it costing residents? Escape plans needed to avoid next Grenfell - union On Monday, a lawyer representing victims of the June 2017 disaster,described it asone of the ""major scandals of our time"". The government has proposed a Building Safety Bill with measures to introduce a new building safety regulator. It was created to examine the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the fire at Grenfell Tower on the night of 14 June 2017. The investigation has been separated into two phases:Phase 1 focused on the factual narrative of the events, and concluded on 12 December 2018.,external Phase 2 is examining the causes of these events, including how Grenfell Tower came to be in a condition which allowed the fire to spread in the way identified by Phase 1. This effectively reverses past conservative policy to deregulate the construction of buildings. A key role of the regulator is to ensure the safety of buildings taller than 18m (59ft). It will also regulate construction products and carry out ""surveillance"" on the market to ensure standards are met. The government banned the use of combustible materials after the tower block fire in west London. A Â£5bn building safety fund has been set up in an attempt to ensure residents aren't left financially destitute due to the costs of removing flammable cladding and other dangerous materials.
