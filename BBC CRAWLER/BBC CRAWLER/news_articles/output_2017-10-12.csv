Dover sole 'jumps' down angler's throat,"The six-inch (14cm) Dover sole (not pictured) wriggled out of the man's hand and jumped into his mouth An angler had to be resuscitated after accidentally swallowing a fish he had just caught. The man was kissing the Dover sole in celebration of his catch when the six-inch (14cm) fish wriggled out of his hand and jumped into his mouth, a friend said. The 28-year-old stopped breathing and suffered a cardiac arrest at the scene on Boscombe Pier, Bournemouth. Paramedics managed to remove the fish with forceps in an ambulance. The man had been fishing at Boscombe Pier, Bournemouth Ambulance worker Matt Harrison said: ""It was clear that we needed to get the fish out or this patient was not going to survive the short journey to Royal Bournemouth Hospital. ""I was acutely aware that I only had one attempt at getting this right as if I lost grip or a piece broke off and it slid further out of sight then there was nothing more that we could have done to retrieve the obstruction."" Mr Harrison said the fish's barbs and gills became stuck but he eventually succeeded in extracting it in one piece. He said it was the ""most bizarre"" call-out he had ever attended. Members of Boscombe Pier Sea Anglers performed CPR on their friend before the arrival of emergency crews at about 23:00 BST on 5 October. Ian Cowie from the group said: ""He was kissing the fish when it jumped down his throat. It's a tradition to kiss your first catch."" Paramedics managed to restart the unnamed man's heart at the pier after working on him for three minutes. Mr Harrison said: ""We're all so glad the patient has no lasting effects from his cardiac arrest, which could so easily have had such a tragic and devastating outcome.""

Student fell off cliff 'posing for photo',"Signs warning about the instability of the cliffs are in place approaching the area A student fell to her death while posing for a photograph on cliffs at Seven Sisters, an inquest heard. Hyewon Kim, 23, came to the UK to study English and on 22 June took a trip to Cuckmere Haven, East Sussex, alone. She asked a stranger to take her picture, but as she jumped in the air for the shot she lost her footing and fell 200ft (60m). The court heard Ms Kim, from South Korea, suffered catastrophic injuries in the fall. Eastbourne senior coroner Alan Craze recorded a conclusion of misadventure. Speaking after the inquest, Mark Webb from East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""This was an incredibly sad incident leading to the unnecessary loss of a very young life. ""What we would say is to urge people to stay well away from cliff edges. ""The day before this incident we had a very severe rock fall in the same sort of area, so it's clear some of these cliff edges can be very unstable."" Several large sections of the cliffs have crumbled into the sea in recent months Signs warning about the instability of the cliffs are in place approaching the area. An option formore signs in foreign languages was consideredby Seaford Town Council in July 2017 but was rejected. Craig Williams, from the town council, said it was a unanimous decision from representatives of East Sussex County Council, Lewes District Council, the coastguard and South Downs National Park Authority. ""We've decided to keep the signs as they are; we felt more would just confuse matters. Instead we've tackled this at source. ""We've been approaching coach companies and tour operators who run trips to the area and take people up on the cliffs to discuss having plans in place to warn people.""

Do they have to all be as bad as him to make it count?"" US actress Jane Fonda told the BBC's Hardtalk programme that his alleged victims did not come forth sooner ""because he's powerful, because they're scared"".

Wenger wrongly celebrates Weah victory,"Wenger coached George Weah in the 1990s when he was in charge of French club Monaco Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger has seemingly been duped by false reports that former football star George Weah had won Liberia's presidential election, even though the final results have not yet been announced. Mr Wenger said: ""I would like to congratulate one of my former players, who became president of Liberia."" He coached Mr Weah at French club Monaco in the 1990s. Mr Weah was among 20 presidential candidates in Tuesday's election. The former Fifa World Footballer of the Year failed in his two previous attempts but is one of the front-runners to replace President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. However, most analysts expect it to go to a second round, as a candidate needs more than 50% of the votes for outright victory. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Is ex-warlord pulling Liberia's election strings from UK prison? Find out more about Liberia False reports of Mr Weah's victory about have been circulating on social media but it is not clear why Wenger thought he had won. ""It is not often that you have a former player who becomes a president of a country,"" Wenger said. ""Well done George and I would say just for him to keep his enthusiasm and his desire to learn and to win,"" he added. Official results have still not been announced even though the head of the National Elections Commission (NEC), Jerome Kokoya, had told the BBC that he expected the first results to be announced by 23:00 GMT on election night. One of Liberia's leading political parties, the Liberty Party, has called for a halt in announcing results, citing alleged irregularities. Stanley Kwenda, BBC Africa At Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's press conference, I asked him whether he was surprised that his former player, Kolo Toure, had made the transition to assistant coach for Scottish side Celtic and the Ivory Coast national team. In his response Mr Wenger chose to first congratulate another of his former players, George Weah on ""becoming the new president of Liberia"". For a moment I thought he had received a call from Weah confirming the result of Tuesday's presidential election. I knew the official results were not yet out but I thought Wenger may have better intelligence than me. His eyes were glinting, and he spoke with much excitement and a genuine congratulatory feel. Wenger and Weah share a very special relationship and I would not be surprised if the Arsenal manager goes to Liberia for Weah's inauguration - if he wins.

New questions on Vegas massacre chronology,"A hotel worker has said he alerted staff to report a gunman had opened fire before the suspect shot dead 58 people at a Las Vegas music festival. Stephen Schuck said he was responding to a jammed fire door on the 32nd floor when he heard gunfire and spotted a colleague who had been shot. He called dispatchers and told them to call police as the gunman sprayed bullets down the hallway, he said. His account has intensified questions about why the gunman was not stopped. Las Vegas: What we still don't know ""As soon as I started to go to a door to my left the rounds started coming down the hallway,"" Mr Schuck said on Wednesday. ""I could feel them pass right behind my head."" This video can not be played Police officers who entered the Las Vegas gunman's hotel room describe what they saw. Mr Schuck said he encountered hotel security guard Jesus Campos, who had been shot in the leg by gunman Stephen Paddock. Mr Campos told the maintenance man to take cover. ""It was kind of relentless so I called over the radio what was going on,"" said Mr Schuck. ""As soon as the shooting stopped we made our way down the hallway and took cover again and then the shooting started again."" Soon afterwards, Paddock, 64, sprayed bullets upon a nearby crowd at the Route 91 country music festival, perched above in his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. Paddock apparently took his own life after the attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, leaving 58 dead and 500 wounded. According to CBS News,external, gunfire could be heard as Mr Schuck told a dispatcher on his radio: ""Call the police, someone's firing a gun up here. Someone's firing a rifle on the 32nd floor down the hallway."" The BBC has asked the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department for comment. Mr Schuck's account adds more questions about why police were unaware of the shooting on the 32nd floor before Paddock opened fire on concert-goers below. Police initially said Mr Campos, the injured security guard, interrupted the gunman as he was firing upon the crowd from his hotel suite. What was Stephen Paddock's motive? But on Monday police revised the timeline to clarify that Mr Campos was actually shot in the leg and wounded six minutes before Paddock began shooting at the music festival. However the 3,200-room Mandalay Bay hotel disputed the police chronology, telling the BBC that the official police timeline is based on an erroneous initial report compiled by hotel staff. ""We are now confident that the time stated in this report is not accurate,"" a spokesperson for the hotel said in a statement. ""We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio."" ""Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio,"" the statement continued, adding that the police and armed hotel security guards ""immediately responded to the 32nd floor"". Police said Paddock, who had placed security cameras outside his room, shot Mr Campos through the door of his suite, firing 200 rounds into the hallway. 21:40(04:40GMT)Route 91 Harvest festival begins its closing act 21:59Paddock shoots security guard Jesus Campos outside his 32nd floor room.

Hospital 'failing' intersex children,"Great Ormond Street Hospital is not meeting care standards for intersex children, a BBC investigation says. It found that some patients who had been born with sexual development disorders, and their families, had no access to psychological care. And not all cases were properly discussed before the patient had life changing, irreversible surgery. Health regulator CQC is making inquiries. The hospital said it was committed to working with seriously ill children. Intersex, also known as disorders of sexual development (DSD), is when sex characteristics - including genitals, reproductive organs and chromosome patterns - do not fit into the typical notions of female or male bodies. The BBC has learned that at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH): There is currently no face-to-face psychological support for children and their families who have been referred in the last six months despite surgery continuing. The BBC understands tens of families are waiting for therapy. For several years not all children and their families have had access to face-to-face support, before having surgery Not all cases were discussed at full the multidisciplinary team meetings at GOSH Information about this surgery is complex but information given to parents is not in a written form that they can take away, to ensure proper comprehension prior to giving informed consent for surgery. The BBC has been told that this raises doubts as to whether parents have given truly informed consent on behalf of their child before irreversible surgery. Over the last decade, standards and guidelines say DSD cases should be discussed by specialist teams of experts, to ensure the best possible outcome. They also say that it is crucial that families and children should be seen by a psychologist. Prof Ieuan Hughes, emeritus professor of paediatrics at the University of Cambridge and an expert in hormone disorders told the BBC that DSD was a ""very complicated area of medicine"". He said it was vital families got support from a psychologist prior to making decisions about surgery, so parents were fully aware of the life long-implications on children. When asked by the BBC if surgery should continue in hospitals not meeting the national standards, Prof Hughes said: ""It seems reasonable to me to just take a pause, get the problem sorted and get back on track as soon as possible."" On Joe's first birthday, his mother put him to bed and the next day brought him up as Joella When Joe Holliday was born in 1988 it was not clear if he was a boy or a girl. During development in the womb his genitals did not fully form and he was born with a large hole in his abdomen. The 29-year-old says specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital told his mother he would be better being a girl, because it was easier surgically and he would not handle being a man without male genitalia. On Joe's first birthday, his mother put him to bed and the next day brought him up as Joella. As advised by the medical team, she changed all his clothes from blue to pink overnight. Joe was brought up as Joella He featured in a BBC documentary in 1998, when he was 10 years old, which followed his family's legal fight to get him recognised as a girl on his birth certificate. But from 10 years old onward, Joella suffered with depression and anxiety. He self-harmed and attempted suicide. ""I had years of feeling like I was in a black hole and not knowing why,"" he told the BBC. In his 20s, by chance, he saw his medical notes and read that blood tests had shown his chromosomes to be XY - genetically male. He also learned his testes had been removed when he was eighteen months old, despite being perfectly healthy, he said. ""I felt I feel like I lost such a large part of my life - 15 years of my life that I spent depressed and almost a recluse at one point,"" he said. At the time, the decision over raising Joe as a Joella, was considered to be best practice, but now most children now born with this condition are raised as male. He said that although the advice was different when he had his surgery 30 years ago, it was ""not acceptable"" that patients were not being supported now. Doctors 'played God' with my body At 12 I grew a beard and had a period Babies born on the sliding sex scale Experts have told the BBC that Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation trust is seen as the leading hospital for care for these children and regional centres refer in for specialist opinions of the multi-disciplinary team. In a statement the hospital said that patients diagnosed at GOSH were discussed and treatment decisions were taken through these multi-disciplinary teams. A specialist psychologist is due to start at the hospital ""in the coming weeks"", the trust said, but it would not comment on whether the post had been filled. The trust declined to comment on the other concerns the BBC uncovered, on whether children referred from other hospitals for specialist opinion benefitted from input from their specialist team at GOSH prior to surgery and on whether it was meeting national standards. There are many congenital variations of disorders of sex development Some traits are visible at birth, others not until puberty and some variations in chromosomes may not be physically apparent at all Worldwide, between 0.05% and 1.7% of people have intersex traits, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human rights NHS Choices: Disorders of sex development,external An NHS England spokesperson said: ""Disorders of sexual development (DSD) are rare and complex, but it is right that children and their families should be appropriately involved in decisions about their care.""

Israel to join US in quitting Unesco,"A 2016 Unesco resolution criticised Israel's activities at holy places in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank Israel has said it will join the US in pulling out of the UN's cultural organisation Unesco, after US officials cited ""anti-Israel bias"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US decision as ""brave and moral"", a statement said. The agency is known for designating world heritage sites such as Syria's Palmyra and the US Grand Canyon. Unesco head Irina Bokova earlier called the US withdrawal a matter of ""profound regret"". The US withdrawal will become effective at the end of December 2018 - until then, the US will remain a full member. The US will establish an observer mission at the Paris-based organisation to replace its representation, the state departmentsaid,external. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahutweeted,externalhe had instructed his foreign ministry to ""prepare Israel's withdrawal... in parallel with the United States"". By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Unesco is an easy target for US President Donald Trump - it is a multilateral body with educational and developmental goals like promoting sex education, literacy and equality for women. The US withdrawal will be seen by many as a manifestation of Mr Trump's ""America First"" approach and his across-the-board hostility to multilateral organisations; the irony being that Unesco is part of the international architecture that the US helped to establish in the wake of World War Two. But it is the organisation's perceived anti-Israel bias that is the fundamental issue here. It has condemned Israel in the past for its activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and earlier this year it designated the old city of Hebron a Palestinian World Heritage Site - a step Israel insisted denied centuries of Jewish history there, not least the Tomb of the Patriarchs that dates back to biblical times. The decision follows a string of Unesco decisions that have drawn criticism from the US and Israel. In 2011 the US cut its funding to the agency in protest at its decision togrant full membershipto the Palestinians. And last year, Israel suspended co-operation with Unesco after the agency adopted a controversial resolution whichmade no referenceto Jewish ties to a key holy site in Jerusalem. The resolution also criticised Israel's activities at holy places in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. Then earlier this year, Mr Netanyahu condemned Unesco for declaring the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank a Palestinian World Heritage site. He accused Unesco of ignoring Judaism's ancient connection to the city, which includes the crypt where its matriarchs and patriarchs are buried. Unesco's troubled timeline The Great Mosque of Djenne in Mali, among more than 1,000 sites on the World Heritage list November 1945:Unesco founded by 37 countries in the immediate aftermath of World War Two, its purpose ""to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among nations through education, science and culture"". 1974:Congress suspends US contribution after Unesco criticises Israel and recognises the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) - but later rejoins. 1984:Under President Ronald Reagan, US withdraws from Unesco, saying the agency is politically left-wing and financially irresponsible. 1985:UK withdraws, rejoining under change of government in 1997. 2003:US rejoins under George W Bush. 2011:US withdraws funding in protest at Palestinian membership of UN; arrears begin to accumulate. 2017:US announces it will withdraw entirely; Israel says it will follow suit. Yes. As well as accusing Unesco of bias, the US state department said it was also concerned about mounting financial arrears at the agency and said it should be reformed. But that's mainly due to the US decision to cut more than $80m (Â£60m) worth of funding to the agency amid the furore over Palestinian membership six years ago - slashing its budget by 22%. Reports say the US withdrawal is also motivated by a desire to stop accruing arrears to the agency itself. Despite suspending funding the US continues to be charged, and now owes more than $500m. Mr Trump hascriticisedwhat he sees as a disproportionate contribution by the US to UN institutions. The US funds 22% of the UN's regular budget and 28% of UN peacekeeping. Unesco chief Ms Bokova said the withdrawal represented a loss to the ""UN family"" and to multilateralism in general. But she admitted that ""politicisation"" had ""taken its toll"" on the organisation in recent years. Ms Bokovatold the New York Times,externalthat she had informed members of Congress repeatedly that immediate payment of US arrears to Unesco was not an issue, and that American re-engagement in the organisation was the priority. But she questioned the timing of the announcement, coming as Unesco chooses a new leader. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he ""deeply regretted"" the US decision but that the UN would continue to ""interact with the United States very productively on a range of issues through a range of organisations"". The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) applauded, saying that for years, the agency had ""betrayed its original laudatory mission... and chosen instead to unfairly target the Middle East's lone democracy, Israel"". Russia said it regretted the decision, but agreed Unesco was too politicised. President Vladimir Putin's aide for culture Vladimir Tolstoy reportedly called the news ""flabbergasting"".

"Brexit 'deadlock', and Weinstein claims","Philip Hammond's role as chancellor is challenged by some of the papers The Daily Telegraph says the prime minister has been forced to put her Brexit plans on hold because of what it calls a ""potentially disastrous,external"" Tory rebellion. According to the paper, the government has delayed parliamentary scrutiny of the EU Withdrawal Bill because it faces defeat on more than a dozen hostile amendments. The Guardian says Theresa May's government is ""struggling to respond"" to the""deluge"" of amendments,externalwhich now amount to about 300. The paper says the growing scale of the discontent in Parliament just underlines the challenge facing Mrs May over Brexit. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports that Whitehall is planning tohire 2,000 extra staff,externalto deal with Brexit in a sign, it says, of how its resources are increasingly being diverted towards the challenges of leaving the EU. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Times focuses on theintervention of the former Conservative Chancellor,external, Lord Lawson, who has called on the current incumbent, Philip Hammond, to be sacked. He says Mr Hammond's unwillingness to prepare properly for the eventuality of no deal being struck at the end of the Brexit talks is close to sabotage and should lead to his dismissal. Nigel Lawson's demand is also the lead for the Daily Mail which carries the simple headline: ""sack 'saboteur' Hammond,external"". The Sun claims an exclusive with its report that the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinsteinpropositioned the singer and TV presenter,externalMyleene Klass with what it calls a ""sex contract"". The paper says she declined the offer which was apparently made over lunch in 2010. According to the LA Times, Hollywood is already starting to, in its phrase, ""kick the tires,external"" of the Weinstein Company. It says studios, production companies, distributors and other investors have been calling bankers to assess whether to bid for pieces of the company if the firm is unable to stay afloat amid the scandal. A number of papers carry a photograph of a Western family who have been rescued after being held by militants in Pakistan for nearly five years. The Times reports that Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Josh Boyle and their three children, hadsurvived death threats during their captivity,external. Josh Boyle told the Ontario Star that he and his family had been in the boot of their kidnappers' car when the rescue operation took place and five of their captors were shot dead by Pakistani security forces. The Daily Mail is among a number of papers to tell the extraordinarystory of a Dorset fisherman,external. The unnamed 28-year-old had just caught a small Dover Sole which he was holding up near his face when the fish slipped out of his hands and down his throat, blocking his airways and provoking a heart attack. His friends gave him CPR until help arrived, the fish was extracted and his pulse returned to normal. A paramedic who treated him at the scene said: ""I have never attended a more bizarre incident and I don't think I ever will."" And the Daily Telegraph recounts the distressing ordeal of Keith Boleat - a veteran of the Jersey Petanque Association. Mr Boleat and his playing partners were on their way to an international competition in Denmark when the suitcase carrying his three steel boules was confiscated by airport authorities because they suspected they were bombs.

40-year mortgages: 'I have no regrets',"Many young first-time buyers areopting for up to 40-year mortgagesrather than traditional 25-year terms. Some people explain why and talk about their experience of the property market. James Lowrey-English, 26, bought a house with his wife Jessica in Bracknell in 2015. ""When we were offered the 40-year term we were overjoyed and elated to be offered anything at all."" It had been ""heartbreaking"" to think they might not be able to secure a mortgage, he explains. ""We now have two children and are happy with where we live. I have no regrets about taking out the mortgage. ""Our total outgoings are Â£1,200 a month, which is manageable."" He adds: ""It's just about getting onto the ladder, we just needed to cross the line and actually secure a mortgage."" Charlie Crompton, 26, bought her first house in Burnley last year with her boyfriend Craig. They chose a 35-year mortgage term. Charlie says she is happy with her ""manageable"" monthly payments of Â£480. ""It means we can afford to do nice things. We are flying to Portugal next week, which we wouldn't have been able to afford if the payments were higher. ""I also really like feeling stable. We have a house rabbit that is a bit destructive, and I was always worried she would chew things in our rented place. Now we own a house she has free run."" Her brother has a 25-year mortgage ""and couldn't believe that we'd taken a 35 year one"" ""I had no idea that 35 years was considered long-term,"" she says. ""I don't want to have a mortgage in 35 years; the sooner you're mortgage free, the sooner you can retire."" Conor Doherty, 26, is just about to complete on a one-bedroom flat in central Glasgow, with a 30-year mortgage term. Conor and Robyn are both first-time buyers with monthly mortgage payments of Â£550. Conor says he resented renting, and a longer-term mortgage was a useful way to get a foot on the housing ladder. ""I would have happily taken a 40 or 50-year mortgage to get out of the rented sector."" ""I hated just throwing money away on rent. You have to do anything you can to get on the housing ladder."" ""Obviously, I am slightly nervous about taking on so much debt but young people are used to being in huge debt because of the cost of being a student."" Casper Holm, 29, went for a 35-year term mortgage when he bought a three-bedroom house in Cardiff in 2016, with his fiancÃ© Cara. He says he wanted the mortgage term to be ""as long as possible"". ""The rationale was we would have the flexibility of lower monthly payments, and the option to overpay."" ""The reality is it is hard to make yourself overpay, and we haven't."" ""I understand that we will end up paying more, but I don't mind paying to have the flexibility of affordable repayments. It's worth it."" ""We pay around Â£850 a month, and I see it as a good investment. It's not like we've racked up debt on credit cards."" Young spend 'a quarter of pay' on housing Where can I afford to live?

Why did Vikings have 'Allah' on clothes?,"One of the excavated fragments made from fine silk and silver thread discovered at the two Swedish sites, Birka and Gamla Uppsala Researchers in Sweden have found Arabic characters woven into burial costumes from Viking boat graves. The discovery raises new questions about the influence of Islam in Scandinavia, writes journalist Tharik Hussain. They were kept in storage for more than 100 years, dismissed as typical examples of Viking Age funeral clothes. But a new investigation into the garments - found in 9th and 10th Century graves -  has thrown up groundbreaking insights into contact between the Viking and Muslim worlds. Patterns woven with silk and silver thread have been found to spell the words ""Allah"" and ""Ali"". The breakthrough was made by textile archaeologist Annika Larsson of Uppsala University while re-examining the remnants of burial costumes from male and female boat and chamber graves originally excavated in Birka and Gamla Uppsala in Sweden in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. She became interested in the forgotten fragments after realising the material had come from central Asia, Persia and China. Larsson says the tiny geometric designs - no more than 1.5cm (0.6in) high - resembled nothing she had come across in Scandinavia before. ""I couldn't quite make sense of them and then I remembered where I had seen similar designs - in Spain, on Moorish textiles."" Larsson then realised she was not looking at Viking patterns at all but ancient Arabic Kufic script. There were two words that kept recurring. One of them she identified with the help of an Iranian colleague. It was the name ""Ali"" - the fourth caliph of Islam. But the word next to Ali was more difficult to decipher. Were the Vikings really so bloodthirsty? Nursery to teach 'Viking language' New evidence of Viking life in America? To unlock the puzzle, she enlarged the letters and examined them from all angles, including from behind. ""I suddenly saw that the word 'Allah' [God] had been written in mirrored lettering,"" she says. Enlarging the patterns and looking at the reflection in a mirror revealed the word 'Allah' (God) in Arabic Larsson has so far found the names on at least 10 of the nearly 100 pieces she is working through, and they always appear together. The new find now raises fascinating questions about the grave's occupants. ""The possibility that some of those in the graves were Muslim cannot be completely ruled out,"" she says. ""We know from other Viking tomb excavations that DNA analysis has shown some of the people buried in them originated from places like Persia, where Islam was very dominant. ""However, it is more likely these findings show that Viking age burial customs were influenced by Islamic ideas such as eternal life in paradise after death."" A museum display gives a sense of what the Viking woman's boat grave in Gamla Uppsala may have looked like - similar to the tombs the fragments were found in Her team is now working with the university's department for immunology, genetics and pathology to establish the geographic origins of the bodies dressed in the funeral clothes. Contact between the Viking and Muslim worlds has long been established by historic accounts and the discovery of Islamiccoins across the northern hemisphere.,external Two years ago, researchers re-examined a silver ring from a female tomb at Birka and found the phrase ""for Allah"" inscribed on the stone. Again the text was Kufic, developed in the Iraqi town of Kufah in the 7th Century - one of the first Arabic scripts used to write down the Koran. What makes Larsson's discovery so interesting is that it is the first time historic items mentioning Ali have ever been unearthed in Scandinavia. A Viking ring with a Kufic inscription saying ""for Allah"" was found inside a 9th Century woman's grave in Birka two years ago ""The name Ali is repeated again and again beside Allah,"" she says. ""I know Ali is highly revered by the largest Muslim minority group, the Shia, and have wondered if there is a connection."" Ali was the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, having married his daughter Fatima. He also became the fourth leader of the Muslim community after Muhammad died. Although both Sunnis and Shia revere Ali as an important companion of Muhammad, he has elevated status amongst the Shia, who see him as the Prophet's spiritual heir. ""The use of Ali does suggest a Shia connection,"" says Amir De Martino, programme leader of Islamic studies at the Islamic College in London. ""But without the phrase 'waly Allah' accompanying the name - meaning 'friend of Allah' - this would not be from mainstream Shia culture and might just have been copied wrongly from something that was,"" adds De Martino, who is also the chief editor of Islam Today, a British Shia magazine. ""The pattern suggests Ali is being equated with Allah, and therefore there is a slim possibility it has some connection to very early, extreme, mystical fringe movements who believed in this ""But more likely it is a wrongly copied pattern."" Inscriptions on the ceiling of an Alevi mausoleum in Bulgaria feature - on the right - the names Allah, Muhammad and Ali written in legible, simple Arabic while on the left there is a blue mystic pattern with the three names interlocked The names Allah and Ali are often represented in enigmatic patterns inside the tombs and books of mystical Shia sects such as the Alevis and Bektashis to this day, but always they are accompanied by the name Muhammad. These can sometimes include mirrored script. But unlike Larsson's find, these examples usually include both the name depicted the correct way around and the reflection. For Larsson though, her discovery offers much promise for the future. ""Now that I am looking at Viking patterns differently, I am convinced I will find more Islamic inscriptions in the remaining fragments from these excavations, and other Viking era textiles. ""Who knows? Maybe they appear in non-textile artefacts too."" Tharik Hussain is a London-based freelance journalist, travel writer and broadcaster who specialises in Muslim heritage.

Brexit talks doomed? Not so fast...,"""Deadlock!"". ""L'impasse"". ""Quelle Horreur"". You can hear the cries from across the Channel, and the cages of the City rattling in fear, as Michel Barnier's language took a dramatic turn at this morning's press conference, painting the Brexit talks as at a brick wall. True, not even Brexit's biggest cheerleader could claim the discussions in Brussels have been going well. And there are visible frustrations on both sides. But before claiming this morning's drama means the whole thing is doomed there are a few things worth remembering. At the very start of this whole process, the hope was that in October, the EU would agree to move on to the next phase of the talks, to talk about our future relationship. But for months it has been clear that the chances of that were essentially zero. It is not, therefore, a surprise to hear Mr Barnier saying right now, he doesn't feel able to press the button on phase 2, however much he enjoyed the drama of saying so today. Second, behind the scenes, although it has been slow, there has been some progress in the talks but officials in some areas have reached the end of the line until their political masters give them permission to move on. Deadlock over UK's Brexit bill - Barnier Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? May: We'll spend what's needed on Brexit Forgive what comes next as nerdy detail, but it hopefully helps make this clear. For example, the UK side is unwilling to move on to talking in more detail about the money, until the EU side is willing to talk about transition (the idea is, until we know what we might get in future, whether access to certain agencies, or EU programmes, how can we assess what we might be prepared to pay). Mr Barnier is understood to have asked the EU 27 last Friday if he can start exploring transition for that reason, but Germany is resisting. So in this area, it is a possible, and would be a positive outcome for the UK, if at next week's political summit, Barnier asks the 27 for formal permission to talk transition. It would not be as big a step as moving on to phase 2, but it is the next political decision that could ease the deadlock in this area. And there was a clue from Mr Barnier in his remarks this morning that this is what he will continue to pursue. And third, if you had been writing the script of these negotiations before they even began, there's no question that at some point in the plot, there would have been a declaration of digging in, a cry that it's all impossible, it is almost the end of the road, all is lost! Then, at the last moment in a late night summit, emerges the one side of A4 in the clammy hand of an official. On it, not many details, but a few lines that sketch out agreement, show some progress. Finally, the heroic politicians have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat! (Leaving officials in a quiet way to work out the boring details for the next ten years) That is not to say for a second that all is well or indeed to minimise the real and possibly very serious consequences of the talks genuinely breaking down. And whether it is all pantomime or real politics, the remarks will of course stir the pot in Westminster too, likely adding to the drum beat among some Brexiteers that a swifter exit with no deal is better than this drawn out agony - and Remainers' deep anxiety and uncertainty for business about whether a deal can really be done. But both on the UK side and the EU side, to translate this morning's remarks into certain Armageddon for the deal would be to misunderstand.

British jihadist Jones 'killed by drone',"British IS recruiter Sally-Anne Jones was reportedly killed in a US drone strike in Syria, in June. Jones, from Chatham in Kent, joined so-called Islamic State after converting to Islam and travelling to Syria in 2013. Her death was first reported byThe Sun,external. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said Jones had been a useful propaganda agent for IS on social media and her death would be ""significant"". Whitehall officials have declined to comment publicly. However, they have not denied the story, and US sources are confident she was killed in an unmanned drone strike in June, our correspondent added. The 48-year-old was reportedly killed close to the border between Syria and Iraq by a US Air Force strike. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""aware of the reports"" around Jones's death, but was ""not in a position to comment further"". Her official spokesman said the coalition ""follows clear and lawful rules of engagement."" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also refused to comment about Jones directly, but said if someone chose to fight for IS they have made themselves a ""legitimate target"" and ""run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile."" Corbyn: UK jihadist should have had trial The secret lives of IS fighters IS's ruined capital city Who are Britainâs jihadists? Jones - who had no previous military training - had been married to the jihadist Junaid Hussain, who waskilled in 2015 in a drone strike. Previously a punk musician, she had been used to recruit western girls to the group and posted threatening messages to Christians in the UK. Jones, who was born in Greenwich, London, also encouraged individuals to carry out attacks in Britain, offering guidance on how to construct home-made bombs. She used her Twitter account to provide practical advice on how to travel to Syria and shared pictures of herself posing with weapons. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The death of Sally-Anne Jones, if confirmed, will make little or no tactical difference to the military fortunes of so-called Islamic State on the battlefield. Despite posing online variously with a Kalashnikov and a pistol, and reportedly ""leading a battalion of jihadist women"", her value to the group was iconic rather than military. But in this role she was definitely judged to be dangerous. Along with her late husband, Junaid Hussain, she maintained a stream of hostile online propaganda aimed at the West. This included luring western female recruits to the self-declared IS caliphate, encouraging attacks in the West and threatening to kill non-Muslims. She is believed to have been involved in planning previous attacks in the West, including a plot to assassinate the Queen and Prince Philip in 2015. There appears to have been no reaction to Jones's reported death from Arabic-speaking online supporters of IS, according to BBC Monitoring, which observes media worldwide. But it said this was typical in such cases. IS never publicly acknowledged Jones - also known as Umm Hussein al-Britaniyah - as a member. Women occasionally feature in IS's official propaganda and only as authors of articles in its monthly publications, BBC Monitoring added. Junaid Hussain was killed in a drone strike in 2015 Jones's husband was a computer hacker for IS and was regarded as a ""high value target"" before his death. In 2015 the then Prime Minister David Cameron said Junaid Hussain had been planning ""barbaric attacks against the West"", including terror plots targeting ""high profile public commemorations"". News of Jones's death has not previously been made public amid fears that her 12-year-old son, Jojo, may also have been killed in the June strike, according to The Sun. BBC correspondent Richard Lister said it was assumed the boy had been killed. Maj Gen Chip Chapman, former MoD head of counter terror, said under UN Charters the boy would be too young to be classed as a soldier and would not have been targeted, ""even if he got up to really bad things"". ""We don't know for sure whether he was with her or not,"" he added. When asked whether Jojo had been killed, the prime minister declined to comment. The image of Sally-Anne Jones (left) was far from the real deal By Ciaran McCauley, BBC News Northern Ireland It's the image that turned Sally-Anne Jones, the British recruiter for the so-called Islamic State, into the ""nun with the gun"". The only problem? It isn't real - and its origins link back to the debut novel of Northern Ireland writer Colin Bateman in 1995. The original image, featuring a nun posing with a gun and a dog, was used on the front cover of his first book Divorcing Jack. The edited version, which is in black and white and has Jones' face superimposed on to the nun's body, is believed to have originated on her Twitter account. Read more about its origins here. Azadeh Moaveni, a journalist and author of the book Lipstick Jihad, told the BBC that Jones had been one of the most ""iconic"" recruiters for IS because she helped the group to project the idea it could ""get into the very reaches of British society"". The BBC's Frank Gardner said although it was ""very likely"" Jones has been killed, it was difficult to be certain because that would require sending a special forces team to gather DNA. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said if Jones's death was confirmed, it would be ""significant"", but he said he would prefer to have seen her in court. ""I think people who have committed crimes ought to be put on trial,"" he said. ""That wayâ¦ when you interrogate somebody, you get more information about the background to it."" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We do not comment on matters of national security.""

Deadlock over UK's Brexit bill - Barnier,"This video can not be played Michel Barnier: 'We've reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing' The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says there has not been enough progress to move to the next stage of Brexit talks as the UK wants. He said there was ""new momentum"" in the process but there was still ""deadlock"" over how much the UK pays when it leaves, which he called ""disturbing"". Brexit Secretary David Davis said he still hoped for the go-ahead for trade talks when EU leaders meet next week. The pair were speaking after the fifth round of Brexit talks in Brussels. Brexit: All you need to know A guide to key issues in EU-UK talks Mr Barnier said: ""I am not able in the current circumstances to propose next week to the European Council that we should start discussions on the future relationship."" The UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis urged EU leaders at the summit, on 19 and 20 October, to give Mr Barnier a mandate to start trade talks and to ""build on the spirit of co-operation we now have"". He said there had been progress on the area of citizens' rights that had moved the two sides ""even closer to a deal"". The EU chief negotiator told reporters at the joint press conference he hoped for ""decisive progress"" by the time of the December summit of the European Council. He said Theresa May's announcement that Britain would honour financial commitments entered into as an EU member was ""important"". But he said there had been no negotiations on the issue this week because the UK was not ready to spell out what it would pay. ""On this question we have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it's disturbing also for taxpayers."" Not even Brexit's biggest cheerleader could claim the discussions in Brussels have been going well. And there are visible frustrations on both sides. But before claiming this morning's drama means the whole thing is doomed there are a few things worth remembering. At the very start of this whole process, the hope was that in October, the EU would agree to move on to the next phase of the talks, to talk about our future relationship. But for months it has been clear that the chances of that were essentially zero. It is not, therefore, a surprise to hear Mr Barnier saying right now, he doesn't feel able to press the button on phase 2, however much he enjoyed the drama of saying so today. Second, behind the scenes, although it has been slow, there has been some progress in the talks but officials in some areas have reached the end of the line until their political masters give them permission to move on. Read Laura's full blog The so-called divorce bill covers things like the pensions of former EU staff in the UK, the cost of relocating EU agencies based in the UK and outstanding commitments to EU programmes. The UK has said it will meet its legal requirements and there has been speculation the bill could be anywhere between Â£50bn and Â£100bn, spread over a number of years. BBC Europe Correspondent Kevin Connolly said the UK sees its total financial commitment ""as its best negotiating card to be played somewhere near the end of the talks - the EU wants that card to be shown now at a point which is still relatively early in a two-year game"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Time to put 'tiger in tank' on Brexit talks The UK has also offered to keep paying into the EU budget during a proposed two-year transition period. The EU had two other issues on which it would not make any ""concessions"", said Mr Barnier - citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border. On the status of the border, Mr Barnier said negotiations had ""advanced"" during this week's discussions. But he said there was ""more work to do in order to build a full picture of the challenges to North-South co-operation resulting from the UK - and therefore Northern Ireland - leaving the EU legal framework"". What would ""no deal"" look like? Donald Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks Asked about speculation that the UK could exit the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal, Mr Barnier said the EU was ready for ""any eventualities"" but added: ""No deal will be a very bad deal."" Mr Davis said: ""It's not what we seek, we want to see a good deal, but we are planning for everything."" Both men said progress had been made on citizens' rights, with Mr Davis saying there would be an agreement ""soon"" to ensure EU nationals in the UK would be able to enforce their rights through the UK courts. He said EU citizens would still have to register with the UK authorities but the process would be streamlined to make it as simple and cheap as possible. According to Mr Davis, the remaining sticking points include: The right to bring in future family members The right to ""export a range of benefits"" To ""continue to enjoy the recognition of professional qualifications"" To vote in local elections To ""leave for a prolonged period and yet continue to enjoy a right to remain or permanent right of residence on return"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I think it's quite shocking. We're now 15 months on since the referendum and the government seems to have reached deadlock at every stage."" He said ""falling out"" of the EU without a trade deal would threaten ""a lot of jobs all across Britain"". This video can not be played Starmer: ""We need to grasp the urgency."" Labour is calling for ""emergency"" talks between Mr Davis and the EU early next week, to try to break the deadlock ahead of the EU summit. Earlier this week, European Council President Donald Tusk suggested that the green light to begin talks about a post-Brexit trade deal would not come until December at the earliest. Meanwhile, draft conclusions for next week's summit of EU leaders - which could yet change - call for internal work to begin on possible transitional arrangements and trade talks with the UK. That would mean they could move ahead with negotiations on a future relationship, if ""sufficient progress has been achieved"" in talks. But the draft conclusions seen by the BBC, if adopted, suggest EU leaders are not yet ready to begin talks with the UK about a post-Brexit transition deal. Last month Prime Minister Theresa May used a speech in Florence to set out proposals for a two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, in a bid to ease the deadlock.

Murder victim 'lay dead for two years',"A police vehicle was stationed outside the flat complex on Thursday morning The body of a woman who is believed to have been murdered may have lain undiscovered for more than two years, police have said. Marie Conlon, 68, was discovered dead in bed in a flat at Larkspur Rise in west Belfast last Friday. A 23-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday and remains in custody. Detectives have established that the last known sighting of Ms Conlon was in January 2015. ""It is our belief, supported by the medical evidence, that her death may have occurred at around this time,"" said Ch Insp Alan Dickson. ""We have launched a murder investigation and a 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a number of offences including murder. ""He was detained in the west Belfast area yesterday and remains in custody."" Police forced their way into the flat and found the woman's body in a bed Ch Insp Dickson said authorities were alerted on Friday after concerns were raised about Ms Conlon's welfare. ""Officers forced entry to her Larkspur Rise home and discovered her deceased in bed,"" he said. ""It was apparent that she had lain undiscovered for some time."" Results from a post-mortem examination suggest the death may have been suspicious, said Ch Insp Dickson, adding that further tests were due to take place. Marie Conlon's family issued a statement on Thursday night, it said: ""We are shocked and heartbroken to learn about the loss of our beloved sister. ""The tragic circumstances of her death make it all the more difficult to comprehend and accept. ""Marie was very much loved by her family and will be mourned greatly. She was a very independent person. ""Numerous attempts had been made to contact her in person, and by other means, over the course of the past two years but at no point were suspicions raised that she had been deceased. ""It is only with hindsight that the unimaginable now seems possible,"" the statement added. Sinn FÃ©in councillor SÃ©anna Walsh said: ""One of the tragedies, I suppose, of modern living is that in areas like this you don't have the same sense of connectedness that you would have had if she had have lived in a house further into the estate."" ""This type of accommodation is very transitory, there's people coming and going all the time. I just find it tragic, the whole episode."" Sinn FÃ©in councillor Seanna Walsh said the incident was tragic SDLP councillor Brian Heading said it was concerning that someone could have lain undiscovered for so long. ""This is something that people need to think about, that if you don't see your neighbour knock on the door,"" he said. ""We don't know all the circumstances yet, but by keeping in communication with someone there could have been a different outcome in this case.""

Should we all impose a one-gift rule at Christmas?,"Hollywood stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are implementing a ""one-gift"" rule this Christmas for their two young children so they don't grow up spoiled. The rule comes after their daughter, now three, was showered with presents last year. ""We didn't give her anything - it was the grandparents. The kid no longer appreciates the one gift,"" Mila toldEntertainment Tonight.,external So now the children's grandparents have been asked to pick one gift only or make a charity donation. The celebrity couple are not alone in grappling with the very first world problem of too many gifts at Christmas. The Mumsnet website is awash with discussions on how to persuade grandparents to rein in their spending. One mum describes her own mother giving her two bin bags full of Christmas presents for her daughters, one of whom was a babbling six-month-old baby. It's an emotional thing, says Naz Brown, who has four granddaughters, aged four, three, one and seven months. ""I love to spoil them. This year at least two of the grandchildren are with us so I'm taking over my mother-in-law's house and making it very festive. ""I will make a point of getting Christmas stockings for everyone, even the grown-ups."" Naz plans to hit the shops soon, with her eyes on clothes, toys and books and a flexible budget of up to Â£70 for each grandchild. Things weren't the same when she was a young mother. Her boys got a couple of Fisher Price toys and some Lego. ""There are many more expensive toys on the market now,"" she says. ""It's very difficult for parents not to spend a lot of money."" Her two eldest granddaughters already have iPads. ""If you are getting them at two or three, where do you go from there?"" she asks. When we are given a lot, we expect to receive a lot, says clinical psychologist Linda Blair. Even if it's only at Christmas and on birthdays, it will impact on children's attitudes. She says that by focusing on the children's presents, the emphasis moves away from sharing and giving - which research shows bring longer-lasting good feelings. And quite practically, she says, the little ones can't enjoy everything they get. Clive Whichelow, author of Grandparenting for Beginners, disagrees. ""Grandparents are like grown-up kids themselves. They are more on a level with the grandchildren than the parents. ""The grandparents are in collusion with the kids. Parents are there as moral arbiters. ""Parents need to take a step back and let grandparents spoil them - that's part of their job,"" he says. Have in mind The Prophet, says Linda Blair. In his 1923 classic, the philosopher Kahlil Gibran tells us: ""You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give."" Linda, mother of three and stepmum to three more, advises doing Secret Santa with a price cap. That way you are thinking about what you are giving and you are more equal with everyone else, she says. Or, if you want to give a gift, give your time. Take them out, go for a pizza, a film, listen to them, she advises. Those are gifts that have so much more value than anything you can buy in the store, she adds. Naz says she will be giving her sons her time - babysitting for her granddaughters to give them a night off. But for her granddaughters, she will splurge. ""I can feel less guilty now about buying nice dresses for the eldest as I know they'll be handed down,"" she says. She's also building up a Beatrix Potter book collection for one of her granddaughters and can't wait to give them her childhood favourite, the Magic Faraway Tree, when they're a little older. We've had the four-gift rule - something they want, something they need, something to wear and something to read, and now the one-gift rule, says writer Clive Whichelow. But has anyone told Santa Claus about all this? he asks. Naz says no rules have been imposed on her yet. She does ask her sons what the girls would like, and buys from a list of little things. ""Then we'll buy them a bigger present too,"" she explains. Will the four gift rule take off? When is regifting Christmas presents ok? But for parents with small flats and indulgent grandparents, Mumsnetters, in typical no-nonsense fashion, have some short-term solutions. Donate them to the Salvation Army's toy appeal, Women's Aid or a local children's hospital unit - or hide them in a cupboard and bring them out through the year. The harsher among them advocate selling them online or regifting them. For a longer-term fix, psychologist Linda recommends having a chat. Do it face-to-face in a public place, she warns, as you're less likely to lose your temper or become emotional. ""Tell them: I want to raise my children with the values I have. ""You gave me those values because you didn't have so much. I want you to help me pass those values onto my children."" Mum's Christmas present mountain grows Will the four gift rule take off? Forget summer, it's time to prepare for Christmas When is regifting Christmas presents ok?

'I had a cardiac arrest at my sister's wedding',"This video can not be played Carly (right) walking down the aisle just moments before her collapse About 10,000 people die each year because bystanders do not know how to do CPR if they see someone in cardiac arrest, the British Heart Foundation says. One woman says she owes her life to people who acted quickly when she collapsed. The photos capture Carly Williams smiling as she walks up the flower-lined aisle as maid of honour at her sister's wedding. But moments later she collapsed without warning and had a cardiac arrest in front of her family, friends and two young sons. Her heart had gone into a dangerously irregular rhythm and stopped beating. Carly, 34, has no memory of her collapse but says she felt totally normal in the lead-up to the ceremony at a central London hotel in July. ""Apparently I said I was dizzy and I thought I might faint. I actually collapsed as soon as I sat down with my head in the other bridesmaid's lap,"" she tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""People realised there was something wrong as I didn't stand for the bride and I started breathing in an irregular way."" Jodie, centre, pictured with Carly to her left and the rest of her bridal party. There were calls for a first aider and ambulance. One of the guests was a childminder who realised Carly's heart had stopped and started performing CPR, helped by her two cousins who had completed a first aid course two weeks earlier. ""The hotel had a defibrillator but the staff had no idea how to use it.  My cousins learned how to use it on the course. They shocked me and it worked - I had a pulse but still wasn't conscious,"" she says. Meanwhile, her sister Jodie - who had been planning her Â£70,000 wedding for a year - had been taken out of the room along with the other guests. ""It was so surreal, like a nightmare,"" she says on looking back and seeing her sister undergo CPR. Carly, pictured holding her daughter Matilda, says she felt totally normal before the ceremony. A cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating.  It causes someone to fall unconscious and stop breathing - unless treated with CPR, it is fatal A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing chest pain and heart damage Fewer than one in 10 people survive a cardiac arrest if they are not in hospital Every minute without CPR or defibrillation reduces someone's survival chances by 10% Just over one in four bystanders do CPR if they see someone in cardiac arrest Source: British Heart Foundation Jodie believes it was lucky that she had chosen the hotel for the venue, just minutes away from St Thomas', a specialist heart hospital. She describes it as ""the best decision I have ever made"". ""I had been feeling very guilty worrying that this was Carly worrying about the wedding that had brought this on. My dad told me my wedding had saved her life,"" she says. Another decision was also crucial. Carly had wanted to return to their hotel room to collect the corsages, but her dad said to leave them. ""It was lucky I didn't go, as my heart might have stopped when I was alone in the room,"" she says. Carly was taken to hospital where she was put in an induced coma. Jodie said all she wanted to do was get out of her gown and see her - so they called off the wedding, sending the 115 guests home. ""I expected it to be the best day of my life but it was the worst. I felt like I was about to fall off the edge of the world."" Carly emerged from the coma within 24 hours. A few days later she asked if the wedding had gone ahead and felt ""really bad"" when Jodie explained what had happened. Carly has been fitted with a defibrillator called an S-ICD in case her heart fails again. ""We were so excited about the wedding - but she didn't mind at all. The chances of this happening in a room with three first aid-trained people and a defibrillator are so slim that actually I was lucky that it did,"" she says. Carly has had a device fitted called an S-ICD, a defibrillator that she describes as ""insurance"" in case it happens again. ""My heart is now doing its normal thing - but they don't know why it happened,"" she says. The sisters are campaigning with the British Heart Foundation for more people to learn how to do CPR and use defibrillators as part of its Restart a Heart campaign - which will see 150,000 people learn CPR on 16 October. And Jodie says she still wants to get married, once Carly is well enough. ""I still feel traumatised and get upset by it,"" she says. ""My big worry on the day was the kids not walking down the aisle on their own. It's hard to believe that worried me now - health is all that matters,"" she says.

Harvey Weinstein: Did everyone really know?,"This video can not be played ""It was an open secret"" a producer tells the BBC When actor Seth MacFarlane announced the Oscar nominations for best supporting actress in 2013, he cracked a now infamous joke: ""Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein."" At the time, it was a rare public reference to what has since become a very public scandal. And it is a telling sign that Weinstein's alleged behaviour was - as it's been repeatedly described in the past week - Hollywood's ""open secret"". But how many people knew what was going on, and why wasn't it reported sooner? MacFarlane has explained,externalthat he made the quip after his Ted co-star Jessica Barth told him about Weinstein's attempted advances two years earlier. The actress told The New Yorker,externalthe mogul tried to persuade her to give him a naked massage in bed. She walked out. Actress Lea Seydoux,writing in The Guardian,externalabout how Weinstein ""suddenly jumped on me"" in his hotel room, also recalled how she had seen him ""hitting on"" other young women and trying to convince them to sleep with him at parties. Lea Seydoux: ""It's unbelievable that he's been able to act like this for decades"" ""Everyone could see what he was doing,"" she wrote. ""That's the most disgusting thing. Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. ""It's unbelievable that he's been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career. That's only possible because he has a huge amount of power."" Weinstein has denied any non-consensual sexual contact with any women. But allegations of improper behaviour were common knowledge among some who worked for him, according to the New York Times. Whenthe paper broke the story,external, it reported that dozens of his former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, ""said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him"". ""It wasn't a secret to the inner circle,"" Kathy DeClesis, a former assistant to Weinstein's brother and business partner Bob, told the paper. One of the common themes of the accounts that have emerged is that Weinstein employees would set up meetings with young women and often accompany them to hotel rooms before disappearing and leaving the women and the producer alone. Harvey Weinstein on the red carpet in 2012 The New York Times related how a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for him. She said she couldn't comment because she had signed a non-disclosure agreement. Many people have suggested such employees could have gone public. But Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and his domineering persona -  aside from any sexual harassment - was legendary. In a memo quoted by the paper, another former employee, Lauren O'Connor, described the experiences of women at the company, including herself. She wrote: ""The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10."" What about those in Hollywood and New York beyond Weinstein's own companies? Stories of his sexual advances spread among actors, agents and others in the film industry. Alison Owen didn't know her own sister-in-law had been preyed upon Many celebrities who have commented in recent days have said they didn't know what was going on, even if they knew he had a sleazy reputation. Oscar-nominated actress Annette Bening told BBC Radio 4's Front Row she knew he was ""boorish"" - but wasn't aware of what went on behind closed doors. British producer Alison Owen, who has worked on films like Saving Mr Banks and Suffragette, told BBC News his behaviour was ""an open secret"". ""Everyone had heard the stories about Harvey,"" she said. ""If you were in the film industry, there was no way you could not have heard those stories about Harvey. ""I never heard a story from the horse's mouth. But there were always stories about, 'Oh an actress told me', or 'Someone working at Harvey's company told me', or 'Did you hear about that intern who worked for Harvey?' ""So they were always second-hand but they were many and multifarious."" Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories Oscars academy to hold talks on Weinstein Matt Damon denies 'killing' 2004 story Such was the level of chatter that Owen said she wouldn't let young women meet Weinstein alone. Those who were preyed upon had nowhere to turn, she says. ""If you had been an actress and Harvey had groped your breasts while you were supposed to be auditioning for him, what are you going to do? ""You're not going to go to the police. They're not going to take that seriously. You're not going to call a journalist because at that point Harvey had the whole media world in his pocket and no-one was going to go up against Harvey Weinstein. ""There was only a downside to reporting it... Harvey's going to destroy your career."" Weinstein with his estranged wife Georgina Chapman in 2015 Owen's sister-in-law Laura Madden worked for Weinstein - but never told Owen about his overtures towards her. The producer only found out about them when she read the New York Times. ""Such is the strength of shame, I think,"" Owen told BBC Radio 4's PM. ""That's another reason people don't come out."" The revelations have surfaced now, Owen believes, because ""the prevailing culture has changed"". ""The winds have shifted to the opposite direction [and] people have now been prepared to go on record."" But shouldn't the media have reported the allegations before? A string of journalists have said in recent days that they tried. But the difficulties of persuading his accusers to go on the record, coupled with the force of Weinstein's legal threats, meant none were able to publish. Sharon Waxman, a former New York Times reporter who went on to set up film site The Wrap, told BBC Newsnight how she chased the story in 2004 and tracked down a woman who had reached a settlement with Weinstein. ""I did manage to meet with the woman who had taken a payoff in London, but she literally wouldn't say anything,"" Waxman said. ""She actually just met with me and didn't speak. A very frustrating conversation. She was terrified that she was violating her non-disclosure."" If they wanted to publish, media outlets had to ensure their stories were watertight in case Weinstein sued. ""Any negative story that was going to be printed about him, he would go full-on aggressive,"" Waxman recalled. ""Any card he could play, any tool he could use to get that story not to appear in printâ¦ I was told that he had visited the newsroom personally to speak to my superiors. I don't know what he said.

Can the world's longest river be saved?," The rot starts at the source. For as long as the Nile has flowed, Ethiopia’s rains have made up the great bulk – over 80% – of its waters. Fat droplets pour down from July to September, not stopping until the roads have been churned into impassable bogs. Small inland seas emerge almost overnight, slicing the Amhara Plateau into a maze of soggy islets.Gushing out of a forest just south of Lake Tana, the Blue Nile greedily soaks up this bounty, quickly swelling from a stream to a torrent. Though slightly longer, the White Nile, which originates in East Africa's Lake Victoria and merges with the Ethiopian branch at Khartoum, carries a fraction of the volume. But these rains are not falling as they used to. And that is potentially catastrophic for the entire basin. The Meher, the long summer wet season, is arriving late, and the shorter rains earlier in the year sometimes not at all. “It’s so inconsistent now. Sometimes stronger, sometimes lighter, but always different,” said Lakemariam Yohannes Worku, a lecturer and climate researcher at Arba Minch University. When it does rain, the storms are often fiercer, washing over a billion tons of Ethiopian sediment into the Nile each year, which clogs dams and deprives farmers of much-needed soil nutrients. Population growth has fuelled this phenomenon, as expanding families fell trees to free up more space and provide construction materials. Monster floods have also become much more common. As crops wither and food prices soar, many rural communities, who have historically relied on steady rains rather than rivers to irrigate their land, have been pitched even deeper into desperate poverty. Some villagers have given up on agriculture altogether, trying their luck instead in Bahir Dar, the regional hub  – or nine hours' bus drive away in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s booming capital. Most have simply struggled on, subsisting on reduced rations while hoping against hope that the rains will normalize. Church attendance has increased, a priest told me. For a small minority, however, enough is enough. Even in poor, out-of-the-way hamlets with no TVs or electricity, many have heard of the possibility of seeking their fortunes in Europe. After dropping out of school to help his family work their battered farm and selling his prized bicycle to buy new seeds, Getish Adamu, a rake thin 17-year-old from Dangla, near the Blue Nile’s source, is among those considering chancing the perilous desert paths to the Mediterranean. Getish Adamu is considering his future ""Myself, I am undecided. I would like to stay with my family,” he said. “But if these rains go on like this, I will not be able to stay.” If the Nile rains continue to ebb and flow, nor will many others. The further the Nile goes, the more sordid its problems become. Thirty miles after leaving Lake Tana, the river plunges over the majestic Blue Nile falls, and then enters a long web of deep cliff-lined gorges. Gathering strength with each arriving tributary, it cascades down 1,500 metres from the highlands to the semi-arid plains below. It is the most beautiful, most isolated and, perhaps, the most troubled portion of the entire basin. That is because Ethiopia’s sparsely-populated wild west is mired in squabbles both local and international. From the controversial construction of Africa’s largest dam in the rugged hinterland just shy of the Sudanese border, to Addis Ababa’s alleged displacement of tens of thousands of villagers in order to lease their prime Nile-side land to foreign agribusinesses, an uneasy pall hangs over the entire area. Just reporting there means navigating a complicated minefield of checkpoints, informants, and terrified interviewees. “You have to understand there are things we cannot talk about,” said Samuel, a restaurant chef in Injibera, blanching noticeably when asked about nearby land grabs. “These are the questions that get you into trouble.” He was not exaggerating. Days later, security forces raided my hotel room, taking only my reporting pads (and some of my Snickers stash). On another occasion, I was turned back at a police roadstop near Chagni while trying to reach some of the largest chunks of confiscated farmland. Of all these hot-button issues, it is the dam – the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) – that has really stoked the region’s hopes and fears. GERD under construction in 2015(Getty Images) At a little over a mile long and with a generating capacity of roughly 7GW, the Nile megastructure is seen by many Ethiopians as a tangible illustration of their country’s emergence after the humiliation of the famines in the 1980s and 90s. Roadside billboards superimposed with politicians’ faces tout its potential to bring electricity to millions; schoolchildren sing about it. “This is our destiny,” some of them chant. Across western Ethiopia, many residents excitedly await their new neighbour. But to downstream Egypt, which is mostly desert, receives little rain, and consequently relies on the river for more than 95% of its water, the possibility that GERD might cut the Nile’s flow is perceived as an existential crisis. A 1959 treaty apportioned all Nile waters to Egypt and Sudan, though Ethiopia and the other upstream riverine states dispute its legitimacy, saying it was drawn up in the colonial era when most African countries had little say in their own affairs. There have been threats of war from Cairo, and fierce sabre-rattling on both sides. If there is ever a regional conflagration over water, this stunning, almost impossibly green stretch of the river will likely be at the heart of it. “It all looks so peaceful, no?” a naval officer called Moses told me over beers at a shoreline Bahir Dar bar. “But we are all aware that we are on the frontline. This is where the water is, the dam, the best land.” Despite losing access to the sea when Eritrea broke away in 1991, Ethiopia has maintained a naval facility on Lake Tana. “We might need it in the future,” Moses added, cryptically. Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet And then there is the human impact. For Nile travellers, Khartoum has always marked both a necessary and symbolic port of call. Perched at the point where the Blue and White Niles meet, it is only here that the river finally takes on its broad, sleepy, familiar form. After more than a thousand miles of separation, it is only at this juncture that one can readily identify each branch’s distinctive features. The Blue Nile, swollen and coloured brown by the Ethiopian rains, roars into the confluence, pushing back for miles its insipid and slightly yellow counterpart. At other times of the year (during the dry season), the two run alongside one another in what some poetic locals refer to as the “longest kiss in history”. But the reality no longer matches the romance. Because it is also here, in its first meeting with a major metropolis, that the Nile’s water quality begins to falter. Pummelled with sewage almost from the moment it enters the city, it is in Khartoum that the river receives a rude taster of what soaring population growth will mean for its health. Egypt’s numbers have more than quadrupled since 1960; Ethiopia is adding roughly 2.5 million new people a year. The basin’s total population is on track to double to 500 million by 2050. As governments struggle to service their new citizens’ needs, the Nile is soaking up more and more of the shortfall. “We’ve always treated the river badly, we’ve always assumed it was big enough,” said Youssef Abugroun, an engineer and part-time fisherman, whose regular evening sessions now net him around 10% of his catch a decade ago. “But maybe we’re just too many for that now.” For the most part, Khartoum’s problems mirror those of other booming Nile cities. The municipal wastewater network has barely grown even as the Sudanese capital’s boundaries have massively expanded over the past few decades. With inadequate rubbish disposal facilities, factories and businesses have taken matters into their own hands, dumping everything from toxic run-off from nearby munitions plants, to unwanted exotic animal parts from the downtown ivory market, into the muddy, chemical-tainted shallows. But in Sudan, a fierce crackdown on civil society has compounded the crisis. In 2014, the state jailed the leaders of a consumer protection group after they pushed it too hard. Fearful of suffering a similar fate, the country’s environmentalists have had to temper their pursuit of the worst polluters. “We do advocacy, sometimes we go to court against government actions,” said Mutasim Bashir Nimir of the Sudanese Environment Conservation Society (SECS),when we met at his organisation’s modest office in south Khartoum. “But we need to balance. We try to survive.” All this before the desert has its say. Meandering further north, through the Sahara, the Nile settles into a lazy, somnolent rhythm. It drifts past the Pyramids of Meroe, which stand battered by sandstorms and almost unvisited by tourists, and then on to the Merowe dam. Soon after the fourth cataract, it reaches Karima, supposedly the hottest town on the river. Working in conditions that are almost calculated to kill any crop, farmers here have learnt to cope with whatever man or nature throws at them. When the mercury tops 45 C, as it often does by noon, they cultivate their fruit and vegetable plots, most of which survive under thick tree canopies that residents have planted up for this purpose. When the wobbly power supply cuts out, which frequently happens – especially since the turbines of the Roseires and Sennar dams became stuffed up with Ethiopia’s Nile sediment - they turn to diesel generators to fuel their water pumps. For every problem, they’ve always found a solution. Until now. Investment in new technology is helping combat the desert advance That is because the desert is eating into the narrow – sometimes only 150 metre-wide – farmable strip along the Nile at an unprecedented pace. The sands are advancing day and night, and the traditional preventative measures, like planting deep-rooted mesquite trees or stringing up fences of yellowing palm leaves around fields, are no longer helping. Trapped between the devilish dunes and the big blue river, farms are being swallowed whole. “If they brought the map of the area to the minister of the environment, he wouldn’t recognize anything,” said Osman Abdul Moati, only half-joking, as he showed off the billowing sandbanks that threaten to engulf his wheat fields in the shadow of the holy Jebel Barkal mountain, on Karima’s edge. “The productive land is vanishing.” Osman Abdul Moati A lot of this appears to be due to climate change, and it is happening up and down the Nile valley. The desert has marched 120km into the scrubland to the south of Khartoum over the past 30 years, the UN Environment Programme says. Temperatures, too, are hitting outrageous new highs, increasing evaporation from the river. But in northern Sudan, the situation has reached breaking point in large part because many young farmers, whose labour is needed to keep the desert at bay, have been lured away by the promise of easy riches at nearby gold mines. In their stead, some landowners have taken on migrants from Ethiopia, Eritrea and the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur, all looking to earn a little additional cash as they make their way north, but others have simply ditched tools and relocated to the cities. This is deeply problematic for a poor country that already shells out money it can ill-afford on wheat imports. As with Ethiopia’s long-suffering hill farmers, those who have battled on are questioning if it is still worth it. “In the past, summer was summer, and winter was winter, but now everything’s mixed up,” said Awad Hawran, who grows mangoes, sugar cane, dates, and watermelons on a one-and-a-half acre plot aside the Nile. “It’s hard to continue farming when even the desert and weather are against you.” So what happens now? Might the Nile’s sorry state one day lead to war? By the time the river reaches Cairo, it is utterly filthy. The banks are laced with rubbish, and the water is gloopy and often gleaming with toxins. Already, farmers are complaining of water shortages in the northern Delta, as the Nile’s increasingly meagre flow struggles to filter through clogged-up irrigation canals. To officials staring out from Cairo’s riverside ministries, it is a grim, in-your-face illustration of their country’s precarious water future. “The Nile is everything to us - what we drink, what we eat,” said Ali Menoufi, from the Ministry of Water Resources. “It would be a disaster if anything happened to it.” The rhetoric and tenor of Nile basin relations over the past few years have reflected the high stakes. A politician in a previous Egyptian administration called for a strike on Ethiopia’s prized dam in 2013, while state-owned media in Addis Ababa has not been shy about ratcheting up tensions in response. As GERD has neared completion, authorities in Cairo have bolstered their strategic capabilities, acquiring two French Mistral long range-strike warships in a move that analysts believe is at least partly calculated to send a message to their southern rival. “All options are on the table,” said Ahmed Abu Zeid, the foreign ministry spokesman and a former Nile talks negotiator, when asked whether military action remains an option. History suggests that the Nile basin states are unlikely to come to blows over the river any time soon. Transboundary water disputes have a strong record of peaceful resolution, and there are indications that Egypt is reconciling itself to the dam’s inevitability. However, Ethiopia’s intense secretiveness over GERD’s ramifications remains a stumbling block, as do the negotiations over how long it will take to fill the dam’s enormous reservoir. And the war of words continues to play out in some unsavoury ways. Ethiopian Oromo refugees in Egypt report increased harassment whenever GERD hits the news. Some Ethiopian monasteries, including Lake Tana’s island churches, which have traditionally enjoyed close ties with their Coptic Orthodox brethren, have broken off relations, sending Egyptian monks home. At a time when Sudan is leasing millions of acres of arable Nile-side land to Gulf Arab agribusinesses – at least 2.5 million to the UAE, there are myriad potential banana skins on the road ahead. “If you think about it. We’re growing and the river’s not,” said Gebremichael Mengistu, an Ethiopian university student I met in Bahir Dar, ably summing up the source of the tension. “It was always going to come to this.” But there is still enough river for a fittingly bleak end. For the fishermen who ply their trade around Rosetta, where the western branch seeps into the Mediterranean, the Nile’s shabby state has proven particularly disastrous. Much of their river catch has died off, and what they do hook looks so unpalatable that they usually won’t eat it. The Nile’s final stretch is so poisonous that even out on the open sea, around the river mouth, few species can survive, fishermen say. “We worshipped the river, but now we want nothing to do with it,” said Khamees Khalla, untangling his nets steps from the fort where the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, was found. “We all have the same tactic - get as far away from the river as possible.” Battered by challenging fishing conditions – and by increased competition as many beleaguered coastal farmers try their hand at sea – some trawlermen have turned to crime.Twice, Mohammed, a Rosetta-based fisherman, has ferried migrants and refugees part of the way to Europe, and twice he has almost been caught. But with the river no longer the cash cow it once was and people from other struggling parts of the Nile basin willing to pay much more than he earns fishing for safe passage, he insists he is not deterred. “I would prefer to make my living from the Nile, like my father, like my father’s father, but that’s just not possible any more,” he said.

"Happy bot-day, Mr President","Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured on holiday in Siberia in August When President Vladimir Putin turned 65 on 7 October, he was not short of online well-wishers. But how many were real? A hashtag which translates as ""Happy Birthday President,external"" began trending in early that day in Russia. One of the most popular tweets using this tag is: The hashtag translates as ""Happy Birthday President"", and the caption on the photo of the bear says ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), High five! Happy B-day!"" While the tweet was shared more than 800 times, none of those sharing it appear to be Russian speakers. They also seemed to lack the personality of an individual, were often advertising services, and with account information containing frequent typos. ""We are a professional photo servic in Vicoria an on Vancouver Island"" (sic) said one. Another described themselves as a ""Maria Arts Mrketing Guru"" (also sic). Several also contained sexually explicit content. The @vitischeg profile also raises suspicions. The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time. The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov. While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad. This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets,RT,externalandSputnik,external. The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots How pro-Russian trolls tried to destroy me Tops off for #PutinShirtlessChallenge Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared thepresidential well-wishing hashtag,externalalso raised suspicions. This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character. Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots. The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year. Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!"" Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative. ""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending. ""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands. ""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat. ""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

Reality Check: Are there more GPs?,"The majority of most people's contact with the NHS is with GPs Addressing a room full of doctors, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt reminded the audience of his promise in 2015 that there would be5,000 more general practitioners,externalworking in the NHS in England by 2020. We're halfway to Mr Hunt's deadline - so how is the government doing at meeting this target? In 2015, there were about 34,500 GPs working in the NHS in England. The government wants there to be about 39,500 by 2020. But thelatest figures published by the NHS,externalshow that there are actually about 350 fewer GPs now than there were in 2015, when the target was announced. These numbers include registrars - trainee GPs who are qualified doctors but have not yet completed their specialist training. After two foundation years, medical school graduates pick a specialism. It then takes another three years to become a fully fledged GP. So far, then, it doesn't look like they're on track. How do you get more GPs into the NHS? You can: train new ones hire from overseas make sure those already working as GPs don't leave The NHS is trying all three. And the last of these appears to be proving a particular problem. Mr Hunt told the Royal College of GPs' annual conference that the NHS was doing ""pretty well"" at getting more medical graduates into general practice. Health Education England, the part of the NHS responsible for making sure enough people with the right skills are trained and recruited into the health service, said it would make sure a minimum of3,250 trainees per year,externalwere recruited to GP training programmes by 2016. The number is up 9% since 2015 but is still slightly behind the target. TheNational Audit Office,external, which scrutinises public spending , said in January that 3,019 places had been filled, or 93% of the target. So, the number of medical graduates being recruited into the GP specialism is going up. But it's not yet having an impact on the overall numbers because more doctors are retiring or leaving the profession. Between 2005 and 2014, the proportion of GPs aged 55 to 64 leaving the profession doubled, according to health think tank the King's Fund. The NHS has launched a range of initiatives to encourage GPs to stay in the profession, for example offering more flexibility, training and financial support, but it's too soon to know how well they are working. In July, the NHS also announced it would recruit more GPs from overseas by 2020-21 to meet its staffing targets. It's too soon to say how effective this recruitment drive has been. And on Thursday the Health Secretary announced newly qualified GPs would receive a one-off payment of Â£20,000 if they started their careers in parts of the country that struggled to attract family doctors. Efforts are clearly being made, but progress has been slow. The King's Fund says that ""the actions taken to deliver 5,000 more GPs by 2020 will need to be significantly more successful in the next few years for this pledge to be met"".

Branson's Virgin invests in Hyperloop One,"Hyperloop One claims its pod-based system is more ""sustainable"" than current transport options The Virgin investment group has taken an undisclosed stake in Hyperloop One, one of several companies trying to create a pod-based transport system. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Virgin's founder, Sir Richard Branson, is joining the Los Angeles-based firm's board as part of the deal, and it is rebranding itself as Virgin Hyperloop One. One expert suggested the tie-up would help raise the company's profile. ""This is unproven technology and there's a long way to go before it ever finds itself in use in the real world,"" commented Prof David Bailey from Aston Business School. ""But this deal will certainly help in terms of marketing and potentially attract further investors to come into the operation."" Sir Richard is joining Hyperloop One's board Hyperloop One recently tested a prototype pod in the Nevada desert, which reached a speed of 310km/h (192mph) within a 500m (1,600ft) low air-pressured tube. Its eventual goal is to reach 1,046km/h (650mph). The system uses magnetic levitation and electric propulsion to cause pods to glide, and is pitched as a more eco-friendly mode of transportation than many of today's alternatives. The firm says it is working on several projects to bring the technology to the Middle East, Europe, India, Canada and the US. This video can not be played WATCH: Hyperloop One tested a passenger-sized pod in August In a press release,external, Virgin suggested the system could eventually cut journey times from Edinburgh to London to 50 minutes. Hyperloop's inventor, Elon Musk,has previously signalledhis intention to build a separate Hyperloop system via his tunnel-digging Boring Company. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, TransPod Hyperloop and Dinclix GroundWorks are among other companies to have announced rival projects. ""The combination of our proven technology and Virgin's expertise in transportation, operations, safety and passenger experience will accelerate the commercialisation phase of our company's development,"" said Hyperloop One's co-founder Josh Giegelin a written statement,external. Virgin already has investments in rail companies, cruise liners, airlines and a nascent space tourism operation. However, Prof Bailey questioned its potential. ""I remain sceptical about using Hyperloop technology in places where there are high land values or dense population,"" he explained.

Police launch Weinstein investigations,"US and UK police have launched investigations into sexual assault allegations against the film producer Harvey Weinstein. The New York Police Department is looking into an allegation dating from 2004 and is reviewing whether there are any additional complaints. London's Met Police has received an allegation of sexual assault in the London area in the 1980s. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. US actress Rose McGowan took to Twitter on Thursday to allege that she was raped by Weinstein. In a series of tweets addressed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, McGowan alleged she had told Amazon Studios she had been assaulted by Weinstein. Allow Twitter content?

US quits Unesco over 'anti-Israel bias',"A 2016 Unesco resolution criticised Israel's activities at holy places in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank Israel has said it will join the US in pulling out of the UN's cultural organisation Unesco, after US officials cited ""anti-Israel bias"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US decision as ""brave and moral"", a statement said. The agency is known for designating world heritage sites such as Syria's Palmyra and the US Grand Canyon. Unesco head Irina Bokova earlier called the US withdrawal a matter of ""profound regret"". The US withdrawal will become effective at the end of December 2018 - until then, the US will remain a full member. The US will establish an observer mission at the Paris-based organisation to replace its representation, the state departmentsaid,external. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahutweeted,externalhe had instructed his foreign ministry to ""prepare Israel's withdrawal... in parallel with the United States"". By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Unesco is an easy target for US President Donald Trump - it is a multilateral body with educational and developmental goals like promoting sex education, literacy and equality for women. The US withdrawal will be seen by many as a manifestation of Mr Trump's ""America First"" approach and his across-the-board hostility to multilateral organisations; the irony being that Unesco is part of the international architecture that the US helped to establish in the wake of World War Two. But it is the organisation's perceived anti-Israel bias that is the fundamental issue here. It has condemned Israel in the past for its activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and earlier this year it designated the old city of Hebron a Palestinian World Heritage Site - a step Israel insisted denied centuries of Jewish history there, not least the Tomb of the Patriarchs that dates back to biblical times. The decision follows a string of Unesco decisions that have drawn criticism from the US and Israel. In 2011 the US cut its funding to the agency in protest at its decision togrant full membershipto the Palestinians. And last year, Israel suspended co-operation with Unesco after the agency adopted a controversial resolution whichmade no referenceto Jewish ties to a key holy site in Jerusalem. The resolution also criticised Israel's activities at holy places in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. Then earlier this year, Mr Netanyahu condemned Unesco for declaring the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank a Palestinian World Heritage site. He accused Unesco of ignoring Judaism's ancient connection to the city, which includes the crypt where its matriarchs and patriarchs are buried. Unesco's troubled timeline The Great Mosque of Djenne in Mali, among more than 1,000 sites on the World Heritage list November 1945:Unesco founded by 37 countries in the immediate aftermath of World War Two, its purpose ""to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among nations through education, science and culture"". 1974:Congress suspends US contribution after Unesco criticises Israel and recognises the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) - but later rejoins. 1984:Under President Ronald Reagan, US withdraws from Unesco, saying the agency is politically left-wing and financially irresponsible. 1985:UK withdraws, rejoining under change of government in 1997. 2003:US rejoins under George W Bush. 2011:US withdraws funding in protest at Palestinian membership of UN; arrears begin to accumulate. 2017:US announces it will withdraw entirely; Israel says it will follow suit. Yes. As well as accusing Unesco of bias, the US state department said it was also concerned about mounting financial arrears at the agency and said it should be reformed. But that's mainly due to the US decision to cut more than $80m (Â£60m) worth of funding to the agency amid the furore over Palestinian membership six years ago - slashing its budget by 22%. Reports say the US withdrawal is also motivated by a desire to stop accruing arrears to the agency itself. Despite suspending funding the US continues to be charged, and now owes more than $500m. Mr Trump hascriticisedwhat he sees as a disproportionate contribution by the US to UN institutions. The US funds 22% of the UN's regular budget and 28% of UN peacekeeping. Unesco chief Ms Bokova said the withdrawal represented a loss to the ""UN family"" and to multilateralism in general. But she admitted that ""politicisation"" had ""taken its toll"" on the organisation in recent years. Ms Bokovatold the New York Times,externalthat she had informed members of Congress repeatedly that immediate payment of US arrears to Unesco was not an issue, and that American re-engagement in the organisation was the priority. But she questioned the timing of the announcement, coming as Unesco chooses a new leader. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he ""deeply regretted"" the US decision but that the UN would continue to ""interact with the United States very productively on a range of issues through a range of organisations"". The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) applauded, saying that for years, the agency had ""betrayed its original laudatory mission... and chosen instead to unfairly target the Middle East's lone democracy, Israel"". Russia said it regretted the decision, but agreed Unesco was too politicised. President Vladimir Putin's aide for culture Vladimir Tolstoy reportedly called the news ""flabbergasting"".

Taliban hostages freed after five years,"This video can not be played File video of Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlan Colema while in captivity Pakistani soldiers have freed a North American family of five who were being held hostage by the Afghan Taliban. Canadian Joshua Boyle and his US wife Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. They had three children while in captivity. They were rescued after a US tip-off during an operation near the Afghan border, the Pakistani army said. US President Donald Trump said it was a ""positive moment"" for US-Pakistan ties. ""Ms Coleman gave birth to the couple's three children while they were in captivity,"" Mr Trump said in a White House statement. ""Today, they are free."" He added: ""The Pakistani government's co-operation is a sign that it is honouring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region."" Who are the Taliban? Videos of the couple were released by their captors, the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network, during their captivity. The insurgent group has been demanding the release of three of its prisoners in Afghanistan. The latest video, released last December, showed the couple with two young boys. In it, Ms Coleman - who was pregnant when she and Mr Boyle were abducted - begged for an end to what she called their ""Kafkaesque nightmare"". This video can not be played ""It was amazing"" - Boyle's parents relive the moment they heard of his release The Pakistani army said US intelligence agencies had been tracking the family in Afghanistan, and reported that on 11 October they had moved across the border into the Kurram tribal district of Pakistan. In a statement it said: ""The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan's continued commitment towards fighting this menace through co-operation between two forces against a common enemy."" In a video statement released to the Toronto Star newspaper, Linda Boyle said she and her husband Patrick had spoken to their son Joshua by telephone after his release. ""That's the first time in five years we got to hear his voice,"" she said. ""It was amazing."" The couple offered thanks to the Pakistani soldiers who had ""risked their lives"" to rescue the family. They said Joshua had said his children were looking forward to meeting their grandparents, and that he hoped to see them within days. This video can not be played ""A lot of countries are starting to respect the US again"" However, Reuters news agency quotes anonymous US officials as saying that the US military had been ready to fly the family out of Pakistan - but Mr Boyle had refused to board the aircraft. Mr Boyle was once married to a woman who espoused radical Islamist views and is the sister of aformer Guantanamo Bay inmate, Omar Khadr. CNN suggested he might fear prosecution by the US authorities. Asked about this, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said: ""Joshua Boyle is not the subject of an investigation. Our focus is very much on the safety and the security of this family."" Ms Freeland also said Canada did not pay any ransom for their release. Earlier, she had said her government was ""greatly relieved"" the family had been released and was safe, and thanked the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Joshua, Caitlan, their children and the Boyle and Coleman families have endured a horrible ordeal over the past five years. We stand ready to support them as they begin their healing journey,"" she added. By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent Relations between Washington and Islamabad have been fraught for years. The US believes that Pakistan allows groups such as the Haqqani network to shelter within its borders, and that Pakistan's intelligence services have close links to the Taliban and other hostile groups inside Afghanistan. In August, President Trump said: ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately."" For its part, Pakistan accuses the US of failing to understand the sacrifices it has made in terms of lives through terrorist attacks on its soil. Nevertheless, both sides need one another and so some kind of transactional relationship remains important. Mr Trump went out of his way to thank Pakistan for its role in the rescue of the family, drawing a direct connection between his approach and the happy outcome. But Washington will want to see further evidence over time that Pakistan is willing to continue co-operating before anything like real trust can exist between the two countries.

Harvey Weinstein 'hopes for second chance',"US and UK police have launched investigations into sexual assault allegations against the film producer Harvey Weinstein. The New York Police Department is looking into an allegation dating from 2004 and is reviewing whether there are any additional complaints. London's Met Police has received an allegation of sexual assault in the London area in the 1980s. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. US actress Rose McGowan took to Twitter on Thursday to allege that she was raped by Weinstein. In a series of tweets addressed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, McGowan alleged she had told Amazon Studios she had been assaulted by Weinstein. Allow Twitter content?

Royal Mail wins strike injunction,"Royal Mail has won an injunction in London's High Court preventing next week's 48-hour strike. The postal firm's workers had been set to walk out from 19 October in protest over pensions, wages and jobs. But the company said the strike would be ""unlawful"" if the Communication Workers Union (CWU) did not follow dispute resolution procedures. A strike ballot of the CWU's 110,000 members had produced an 89.1% vote in favour on a 73.7% turnout. It would have been the first national strike since Royal Mail was privatised four years ago. The CWU said it was ""extremely disappointed"" at the ruling and described it as ""a desperate delaying tactic from a board who are increasingly out of touch with the views of its workforce"". Royal Mail said in a statement: ""We will now make contact with the CWU as a matter of urgency to begin the process of external mediation. The firm said it expected the process to take until Christmas and added: ""We are very committed to working closely with the CWU in order to reach agreement as a matter of priority."" Mr Justice Supperstone, who granted the injunction, said: ""I consider the strike call to be unlawful and the defendant is obliged to withdraw its strike call until the external mediation process has been exhausted."" The CWU has said that Royal Mail's move to reform workers' pensions means that its members will lose up to a third of their retirement entitlements. The company said pension scheme members would indeed build up smaller benefits in future, but that was because the plan in its current form was unaffordable. Earlier this year, the Royal Mail announced that it would close its current defined benefit scheme in March 2018. Although the pension fund is in surplus, Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013, claims that its current annual contribution of Â£400m a year would swell to Â£1.26bn. The company also said it was one of the few firms offering to replace one defined-benefit scheme with another. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""The company are deluded if they believe their courtroom politics will resolve this dispute. Instead, the company's actions will have the complete opposite effect. ""Postal workers' attitude towards the company will harden and it makes us more determined than ever to defend our members' pensions, jobs, service and achieve our objectives.""

Why is it so difficult to count dead people?,"Tens of thousands have died in drug-related violence in Mexico Think of the horror of people dying violently, and the war in Syria, or a mass shooting may spring to mind. Events likethe massacre in Las Vegashighlight the sometimes surprising reality that there are many more people suffering violent deaths in countries ""at peace"" than there are in war zones. Every violent death is a tragedy, but getting the numbers right matters. Reports of deaths in a war zone, a city suffering drug-related violence, or a country plagued by shootings, can drive how the world responds - from media coverage, to business investment, policy decisions and spending by governments and charities. The trouble is that coming up with accurate figures is extremely hard. Just one consequence is that although murders very probably kill far more people than wars, it is usually combat deaths that tend to get the most attention. Since theoutbreak of war in Syria, the country has been devastated, global powers have been drawn in and huge numbers of people have died. By February 2016, after almost five years of fighting, the death toll from battle and other causes hadreached 470,000, according to the Syrian Center for Policy Research,external. Two months later theUN special envoy came up with a lower figure of 400,000,external- far higher than the 250,000 the organisation had estimated eighteen months earlier, after which it stopped counting because it didn't trust the numbers it was getting. Another estimate came in March 2017, from the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, considered one of the most credible sources because of its use of on-the-ground reports. It suggested thatthe toll was closer to 320,000- still horrific, but 150,000 fewer deaths than the upper estimates. Those given the sad task of trying to count war deaths are forced to rely upon a variety of flawed methods. In Yemen, for example, the United Nations used reports from hospitals to estimate10,000 war deathsby January 2017. However, many hospitals have closed and much of the fighting has taken place in rural areas that didn't have any to start with. Many of the dead are simply taken home by their families and buried. That could mean that 10,000 is a serious underestimate. Deaths in Colombia may have been undercounted because news reports are in Spanish On the other hand, since rural areas are sparsely populated, the UN figure may not be so far off after all. Elsewhere, some of the most meticulous researchers insist on being able to name a perpetrator before they count a death and use only English language newspapers, to ensure consistency. This makes details of confirmed deaths robust, and international comparisons simple. But deaths in messy conflicts where perpetrators are hard to pinpoint, or those which don't get media attention - a problem in rural areas, or under authoritarian regimes that control the media - can be missed. There can also be a problem where much of the reporting is not in English. In Colombia, for example, where most coverage is in Spanish, researchers at the Conflict Analysis Resource Center in Bogota estimated that international experts had captured fewer than half the deaths in most years of its guerrilla conflict. Meanwhile, in all wars, many people die from disease, hunger, and other ""indirect causes"". Should these count as war deaths? The World Health Organization found that by August 2017,2,000 Yemenis had died of cholera. A cholera epidemic in Yemen has affected hundreds of thousands of people If war hadn't destroyed hospitals and kept doctors from being paid, some of these deaths might have been prevented. Yet Yemen is a poor country, and even without a war, communicable diseases claim lives. Researchers at the Small Arms Survey, a think tank in Geneva, suggest thatindirect deaths kill three to fifteen times as many people,externalas fighting during conflict - depending largely on levels of development, and whether civilian infrastructure is targeted. In Ukraine, for example, the UN estimates that10,000 people were killed in battleby the end of 2016 - on a par with Yemen. But in Ukraine, roads and hospitals still function and a cholera outbreak is unlikely to be very deadly. Finally, like war deaths, indirect deaths can be manipulated in an attempt to gain an advantage, as researchers suggest happened whenSaddam Hussein tricked Unicef inspectors,externalinto reporting high child mortality in a bid to get sanctions lifted in the early 1990s. Thus, indirect deaths aren't usually included in war statistics. By tending to focus on war, the media misses an even more crucial reality: homicides probably kill three to four times more people each year than conflicts. Between 2007 and 2012, homicides killed an average of377,000 people a year,external, while about 70,000 died annually in conflict. Experts at the Geneva Declaration, one of the few think tanks that counts violence across both warfare and crime, estimate thateight out of 10 such deaths,externaloccur outside conflict zones. That may seem counterintuitive, but the number of wars worldwide is relatively low and homicides occur in every country. The numbers can be jaw-dropping. Homicide rates in large countries like Brazil can exceed deaths in war zones For instance, in 2015 the Brazilian Forum for Public Security reportedmore than 58,000 homicides,external- a year in which the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights counted just over55,000 deaths in the Syrian wa,externalr. Astounding numbers of homicides arefound in many other countries,external, with about 34,000 reported in India, 22,000 in Mexico and 17,000 in Nigeria in 2012, the last year comparable UN data is available. Andthe murder of 58 people in a mass shooting in Las Vegashas again highlighted the problem of violence in the United States. In fact, violent death rates in the US arecurrently at lows last seen in the 1960s,external, but have been ticking upward over the last three years. And even at all-time lows, the US remains an anomaly among similar developed democracies, with a murder rate four to five times as high as Western Europe. Even with Syria and Afghanistan causing war deaths to rise to nearly 100,000 a year today, they remain a fraction of overall homicide numbers. However, the use of overall numbers rather than a figure which takes into account the size of a country's population can sometimes make a country appear more dangerous than it is. After Brazil, which has about 10 times Syria's population, India has the second largest number of murders most years. But with a population of well over a billion people, its homicide rate is remarkably low: just 3.5 per 100,000, or about half the world's average,according to the United Nations Office on Drug Control,external. And the Igarape Institute, which begins with UNODC's numbers but then cross-checks these with local police, morgues, and think tanks for greater accuracy, puts India's rate at 2.8 per 100,000 - lower than Latvia's. Unsurprisingly, homicide statistics are as bad as war data. Most countries count homicides in two places - police stations and morgues. Researchers tend to trust morgue statistics more because police can be under pressure to keep homicide numbers low, whereas morticians tend to be more removed from political influence. The number of homicides in New Orleans was reported as being twice as high as in Afghanistan Yet some bodies never make it to morgues, since a murder without a corpse can't be prosecuted. In Colombia, criminals use chop-houses to destroy bodies, while the Sicilian mafia used to dissolve bodies in vats of acid for similar reasons. Homicide numbers can sometimes be inflated due to poor record-keeping, but more often, countries have an incentive to downplay numbers. And only about half of all countries in the world report any homicide statistics at all. The United Nations does its best to mathematically model data for the rest, but in places like sub-Saharan Africa, where very few countries report, there is little to go on and a likelihood that available numbers underestimate the effects of war and rapidly growing populations. Given these problems, any statistic on violent deaths should be treated with caution. But thinking across the boundaries of war and crime can be illuminating, even if numbers are used as rough estimates. The results can be very surprising. In 2011, for instance,New Orleans' homicide rate of 57.6 per 100,000,externalwas on par with the rates of homicides and conflict deaths in Afghanistan that year. Elsewhere, Mexico has struggled with drug-related violence,the number of homicides steadily increasing,externaland - between 2007 and 2014 - reaching 164,000, according to the Mexican government. That puts it on a par with many wars and exceeds the number of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan during the same period, according to UN andIraq Body Count figures,external. No-one would say that New Orleans or Mexico were at war. But, as with other places experiencing large numbers of violent deaths, the word ""peace"" doesn't seem entirely appropriate either.

Taliban hostages 'freed after five years',"This video can not be played File video of Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlan Colema while in captivity Pakistani soldiers have freed a North American family of five who were being held hostage by the Afghan Taliban. Canadian Joshua Boyle and his US wife Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. They had three children while in captivity. They were rescued after a US tip-off during an operation near the Afghan border, the Pakistani army said. US President Donald Trump said it was a ""positive moment"" for US-Pakistan ties. ""Ms Coleman gave birth to the couple's three children while they were in captivity,"" Mr Trump said in a White House statement. ""Today, they are free."" He added: ""The Pakistani government's co-operation is a sign that it is honouring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region."" Who are the Taliban? Videos of the couple were released by their captors, the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network, during their captivity. The insurgent group has been demanding the release of three of its prisoners in Afghanistan. The latest video, released last December, showed the couple with two young boys. In it, Ms Coleman - who was pregnant when she and Mr Boyle were abducted - begged for an end to what she called their ""Kafkaesque nightmare"". This video can not be played ""It was amazing"" - Boyle's parents relive the moment they heard of his release The Pakistani army said US intelligence agencies had been tracking the family in Afghanistan, and reported that on 11 October they had moved across the border into the Kurram tribal district of Pakistan. In a statement it said: ""The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan's continued commitment towards fighting this menace through co-operation between two forces against a common enemy."" In a video statement released to the Toronto Star newspaper, Linda Boyle said she and her husband Patrick had spoken to their son Joshua by telephone after his release. ""That's the first time in five years we got to hear his voice,"" she said. ""It was amazing."" The couple offered thanks to the Pakistani soldiers who had ""risked their lives"" to rescue the family. They said Joshua had said his children were looking forward to meeting their grandparents, and that he hoped to see them within days. This video can not be played ""A lot of countries are starting to respect the US again"" However, Reuters news agency quotes anonymous US officials as saying that the US military had been ready to fly the family out of Pakistan - but Mr Boyle had refused to board the aircraft. Mr Boyle was once married to a woman who espoused radical Islamist views and is the sister of aformer Guantanamo Bay inmate, Omar Khadr. CNN suggested he might fear prosecution by the US authorities. Asked about this, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said: ""Joshua Boyle is not the subject of an investigation. Our focus is very much on the safety and the security of this family."" Ms Freeland also said Canada did not pay any ransom for their release. Earlier, she had said her government was ""greatly relieved"" the family had been released and was safe, and thanked the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Joshua, Caitlan, their children and the Boyle and Coleman families have endured a horrible ordeal over the past five years. We stand ready to support them as they begin their healing journey,"" she added. By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent Relations between Washington and Islamabad have been fraught for years. The US believes that Pakistan allows groups such as the Haqqani network to shelter within its borders, and that Pakistan's intelligence services have close links to the Taliban and other hostile groups inside Afghanistan. In August, President Trump said: ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately."" For its part, Pakistan accuses the US of failing to understand the sacrifices it has made in terms of lives through terrorist attacks on its soil. Nevertheless, both sides need one another and so some kind of transactional relationship remains important. Mr Trump went out of his way to thank Pakistan for its role in the rescue of the family, drawing a direct connection between his approach and the happy outcome. But Washington will want to see further evidence over time that Pakistan is willing to continue co-operating before anything like real trust can exist between the two countries.

Young face growing mortgage debt burden,"Young first-time buyers are increasing their overall mortgage debt in order to tackle short-term financial pressures. The average mortgage term is lengthening from the traditional 25 years, according to figures from broker L&C Mortgages. Its figures show the proportion of new buyers taking out 31 to 35-year mortgages has doubled in 10 years. That means lower monthly repayments, but a bigger overall bill owing to the extra interest incurred. The extra total cost can be tens of thousands of pounds.

Viewaffordability data by UK region Viewaffordability data by local authority area The national average is This calculator assumes you need a deposit of at least 5% of the value of the property to get a mortgage. The average deposit
                                                    for UK first-time buyers is. The national average is Your monthly payments are what you can afford to pay each month. Think about your monthly income and take off bills, council

                                        The prices are based on the local market. If there are 100 properties of the right size in an area and they are placed in price order with the cheapest first, the âlow-endâ of the market will be the 25th property, ""mid-priced"" is the 50th and ""high-endâ will be the 75th. Where can I afford to live? The average term for a mortgage taken by a first-time buyer has risen slowly but steadily to more than 27 years, according to the L&C figures drawn from its customer data. More detailed data shows that in 2007, there were 59% of first-time buyers who had mortgage terms of 21 to 25 years. That proportion dropped to 39% this year. In contrast, mortgage terms of 31 to 35 years have been chosen by 22% of first-time buyers this year, compared with 11% in 2007. Are longer mortgages the answer to high property prices? The total cost of a Â£150,000 mortgage with an interest rate of 2.5% would be more than Â£23,000 higher by choosing a 35-year mortgage term rather than a 25-year term. The gain for the borrower would be monthly repayments of Â£536, rather than Â£673. David Hollingworth, of L&C Mortgages, said that interest-only mortgages were far less of an option for first-time buyers than a decade ago, and many needed to find a large deposit. The income squeeze also meant that many ""needed some slack in the monthly budget"", so were choosing the longer-term mortgages. Lenders have been offering longer mortgage terms, of up to 40 years, to reflect longer working lives and life expectancy. He suggested that borrowers regularly reviewed their deals. ""Ideally, if you keep the term shorter, it will save you money in the long run,"" he said. First-time buyers in some parts of the country have seen prices rising very slowly since the financial crisis, assisting affordability, despite stricter checks by lenders. The latest survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed that more of its members expected house price falls than those expecting rises in the next three months. Price falls have been most marked in London and South East England in September, they said, with falls also recorded in East Anglia and North East England. On a national level, demand from new buyers and sales also fell in September, the survey suggested. 40-year mortgages: 'I have no regrets' Where can I afford to live?

Weinstein: The list of women accusing him,"Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow are among dozens of women who have come forward with allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. He is currently facing five charges relating to two women in New York. He has previously admitted his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". His spokesperson has said ""any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied"" and there were ""never any acts of retaliation"" against women who turned him down. Clockwise from top left: Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette and Lea Seydoux Here are some of those who have made allegations against him. The actress has accused Weinstein of raping her by performing oral sex in a hotel at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, when she was 23 and had just appeared in Scream. She later reached a $100,000 settlement with him - andsays he offered her$1m for a further non-disclosure deal to stay silent. She declined and has been one of his most vocal accusers. The Emmy-nominated former Sopranos actresshas allegedthat Weinstein forced himself into her apartment in New York in 1992 and raped her. ""I was so ashamed of what happened,"" Sciorratold the New Yorker,external. ""And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?"" The actress says Weinstein asked her to go to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, but appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower. She refused, and says he got revenge by seeking to damage her career.Director Peter Jackson has come forward to say he removed her from a casting list ""as a direct result"" of what he now thinks was ""false information"" provided by Weinstein. In May 2018 Juddsued Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advancesbut a Los Angeles court later dismissed her sexual harassment suit. Her defamation claim may still proceed, the judge said. Mira Sorvino was photographed at a Weinstein Company party in January 2017 The Mighty Aphrodite star says he harassed her in a hotel room in 1995. ""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" she said. Like with Ashley Judd,Peter Jackson said Weinstein warned him off casting her. Hayek said Weinstein threatened to kill her The Frida actress saysshe turned down repeated sexual advances from Weinstein while making the 2002 film Frida. And she says his persuasion tactics included threats. Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't."" The Italian actress and director Asia Argento says she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage in a hotel room on the French Riviera, but he then raped her. Weinstein ""terrified me, and he was so big"", she said. ""It wouldn't stop. It was a nightmare."" Lucia Evans - nee Stoller - encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress. She says she was forced to perform oral sex by the producer after going to his office for what she thought was a casting meeting. ""The type of control he exerted, it was very real,"" she told The New Yorker. ""Even just his presence was intimidating."" The Boardwalk Empire starhas accused Weinsteinof raping her twice in New York in 2010. The first time was after he offered her a ride home, and the second was when he turned up uninvited at her apartment. ""I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, 'I don't want to do this',"" she said. Gwyneth Paltrow with Harvey Weinstein in 2002 Paltrow says Weinstein asked her to give him a massage in his hotel suite after casting her in the leading role of 1996's Emma when she was 22. She refused. ""He screamed at me for a long time. It was brutal,"" she said. She told then boyfriend Brad Pitt - who threatened to kill the producer if he did anything like that to Paltrow again. Former production worker Mimi Haleyi alleges that she was raped by Weinstein when he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 in his New York apartment. ""I told him 'no, no, no'. But he insisted,"" Ms Haleyi told a press conference in New York. The actress also alleges she was raped by Weinstein when he performed oral sex on her without her consent. She says he lured her to a hotel room in 2010 under the guise of helping her procure future TV and film roles. ""I didn't know how to say no to someone like him at the time, which I regret,"" she said. The Norwegian actress accuses Weinstein of raping herin a London hotel after the 2008 Bafta Awards ceremony. She also alleges that he then asked her to engage in a threesome with him and another woman when back in Los Angeles following the Baftas. British actress Lysette Anthony says he carried out a ""pathetic, revolting"" attack at her London home in the late 1980s, which left her ""disgusted and embarrassed"". Lysette Anthony toldThe Sunday Times,externalshe had reported an attack by Weinstein to the Metropolitan Police in London. In anInstagram post,external, Delevingne writes how uncomfortable she felt during an encounter with Weinstein in a hotel room and describes what allegedly happened when she told him she wanted to leave. ""He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room,"" she says. The French actress has written about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink. ""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,""she wrote in The Guardian,external. ""I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him."" Angelina Jolie with Gillian Anderson at the premiere of Playing by Heart in 1998 Jolie says she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room in 1998. ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,"" she said. The Pulp Fiction actress saysWeinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" at the producer's hotel room in London during the 1990s. ""He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" Thurman said. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" Harvey Weinstein and Heather Graham at a film party in 1999 The Boogie Nights actress toldVariety,externalshe was once propositioned by Weinstein in the early 2000s when she met him to discuss being cast in one of his movies. She alleges he implied she had to sleep with him to get a film role, telling her that his wife would have been fine with it. This video can not be played Model Zoe Brock tells Radio 4's Today that she was one of Harvey Weinstein's victims The model and actress says he asked for a massage in the south of France in 1997. She said: ""I didn't know what to do and I felt that letting him maybe touch me a little bit might placate him enough to get me out of there somehow."" Before long, she ""bolted"" into the bathroom. He banged on the door with his fists before eventually retreating, putting on a dressing gown and starting to cry. Louisette Geiss holding a press conference on Tuesday The actress and producer says she was attacked by Weinstein when he invited her to his office in a hotel for a meeting about a script she had written at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. He insisted on listening to her pitch in his hot tub, then asked her to watch him masturbate, she says - and told her he could green-light her script if she did so. She left. The Splash actress saysshe repeatedly turned down Weinstein's advances during promotion for Kill Bill and its sequel. He tried, she says, to get into her hotel room on multiple occasions, once getting a key and ""burst[ing] in like a raging bull."" He asked to grope her breasts and then asked her to expose herself to him, she alleges. She suffered physical repercussions as her flights were cancelled and she was left stranded after she turned him down on one occasion, she adds. The actress says she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result. She told the New York Times,externalin the early 1990s she was directed to his hotel room, where he was in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage. When she refused she says he grabbed her hand and pulled it toward his crotch. ModelAmbra Battilana Gutierrezhas said she was groped by Weinstein and later went to New York police in 2015, saying the producer assaulted her. She then met Weinstein wearing a hidden microphone. But prosecutors took no action. Other stars to have detailed how he made advances in his home or hotel rooms includeBrit Marling,external,Lupita Nyong'O,external,Lena Headey,externalandKate Beckinsale,external. Other women who have come forward since then with their stories include French actressesFlorence Darel,external,Judith Godreche,externalandEmma de Caunes,external. British modelKadian Noble, US actressesJessica Barth,external,Katherine Kendall,externaland aspiring actressesDawn Denning,external, who is now a costume designer,Tomi-Ann Roberts,external, who is now a psychology professor, have also gone on the record. TV anchorLauren Sivan,externalalleges Weinstein cornered her in an empty basement area of a New York restaurant in 2007 and masturbated in front of her. And other workers at the Weinstein film companytold the New Yorker,externalabout their experiences, includingEmily Nestor, who was a temporary front desk assistant who said she had had to refuse his advances ""at least a dozen times"". ActressClaire Forlanihas said ""nothing happened"" between her and Weinstein - but only because she ""escaped five times"". In an interview with Canadian TV, actressLauren Hollysaid the producer approached her naked and requested a massage, at which point she ""pushed him and ran"". Zelda Perkins, a British former assistant of Harvey Weinstein,says she resignedafter a colleague accused him of trying to rape her. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement on 10 October in response to the allegations of sexual harassment and assault. ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein,"" she said. ""Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.

Stamp duty plan for energy efficient homes,"Stamp duty in England may be changed to encourage people to make their homes more energy efficient. Energy minister Claire Perry told the BBC householders would face ""carrots and sticks"" to prompt them into saving on heating bills and carbon emissions. It may form part of a plan by ministers to get about a million homes a year renovated during the next two decades. The government will fail to meet its climate change laws unless it can cut emissions from household heating. The proposals are part of the government's long-delayed Clean Growth Plan, being published on Thursday, which defines how it aims to reduce carbon emissions across the whole economy. As part of the the Climate Change Act, the government needs to cut CO2 emissions by 57% from 1990 levels by 2050. A recent report called for radical policiesto incentivise homeowners - such as fining people who sell cold, draughty homes, or introducing a variable stamp duty to reward those who have insulated their homes and punish those who have not. The point of sale of a house is seen as the best time to undertake improvements that many people find costly and disruptive. Ms Perry told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was ""interested"" in the idea of lowering stamp duty on properties that have been made energy efficient. She described the idea as potentially ""one of the incentives"" to encourage homeowners into implementing energy-saving measures on their houses. She added: ""It's more likely that a home where insulation has been put in would attract a higher value, because the running cost of that home over the lifetime of ownership would be lower."" The application of stamp duty is devolved around the UK, so this would only apply to energy efficient homes in England. Homes now account for 13% of the UK's emissions, and this rises to 22% once electricity use is taken into account. Ed Matthew, from the climate change think tank E3G, has welcomed the plan but says there needs to be a clear strategy. He told BBC News: ""The government is trying to triple the rate at which homes are being insulated. This policy is really ambitious but it needs money - and the Treasury has to stump up."" The UK has led the developed world by boosting its economy 60% whilst cutting carbon emissions 42% since 1990. But most of the carbon saving has come through cutting down on burning coal for power. Advisors warn that the government's future policies will lead them to miss carbon targets by a long distance. They say emissions from transport and housing have recently been going up. Ms Perry said the plan would cover all parts of the economy, including cars and industrial emissions. But energy campaigners fear the plan will not contain the measures necessary to meet the government's own laws on cutting carbon. Jonathan Church, a spokesman for the environmental lawyers ClientEarth, said the strategy didn't go far enough. He said: ""We need a firm commitment to say how the UK will decarbonise. Ministers do seem to be trying to make up lost ground with their new strategy, but they have not done enough.""

Pakistan 'frees' Taliban hostage family,"This video can not be played File video of Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlan Colema while in captivity Pakistani soldiers have freed a North American family of five who were being held hostage by the Afghan Taliban. Canadian Joshua Boyle and his US wife Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. They had three children while in captivity. They were rescued after a US tip-off during an operation near the Afghan border, the Pakistani army said. US President Donald Trump said it was a ""positive moment"" for US-Pakistan ties. ""Ms Coleman gave birth to the couple's three children while they were in captivity,"" Mr Trump said in a White House statement. ""Today, they are free."" He added: ""The Pakistani government's co-operation is a sign that it is honouring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region."" Who are the Taliban? Videos of the couple were released by their captors, the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network, during their captivity. The insurgent group has been demanding the release of three of its prisoners in Afghanistan. The latest video, released last December, showed the couple with two young boys. In it, Ms Coleman - who was pregnant when she and Mr Boyle were abducted - begged for an end to what she called their ""Kafkaesque nightmare"". This video can not be played ""It was amazing"" - Boyle's parents relive the moment they heard of his release The Pakistani army said US intelligence agencies had been tracking the family in Afghanistan, and reported that on 11 October they had moved across the border into the Kurram tribal district of Pakistan. In a statement it said: ""The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan's continued commitment towards fighting this menace through co-operation between two forces against a common enemy."" In a video statement released to the Toronto Star newspaper, Linda Boyle said she and her husband Patrick had spoken to their son Joshua by telephone after his release. ""That's the first time in five years we got to hear his voice,"" she said. ""It was amazing."" The couple offered thanks to the Pakistani soldiers who had ""risked their lives"" to rescue the family. They said Joshua had said his children were looking forward to meeting their grandparents, and that he hoped to see them within days. This video can not be played ""A lot of countries are starting to respect the US again"" However, Reuters news agency quotes anonymous US officials as saying that the US military had been ready to fly the family out of Pakistan - but Mr Boyle had refused to board the aircraft. Mr Boyle was once married to a woman who espoused radical Islamist views and is the sister of aformer Guantanamo Bay inmate, Omar Khadr. CNN suggested he might fear prosecution by the US authorities. Asked about this, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said: ""Joshua Boyle is not the subject of an investigation. Our focus is very much on the safety and the security of this family."" Ms Freeland also said Canada did not pay any ransom for their release. Earlier, she had said her government was ""greatly relieved"" the family had been released and was safe, and thanked the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Joshua, Caitlan, their children and the Boyle and Coleman families have endured a horrible ordeal over the past five years. We stand ready to support them as they begin their healing journey,"" she added. By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent Relations between Washington and Islamabad have been fraught for years. The US believes that Pakistan allows groups such as the Haqqani network to shelter within its borders, and that Pakistan's intelligence services have close links to the Taliban and other hostile groups inside Afghanistan. In August, President Trump said: ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately."" For its part, Pakistan accuses the US of failing to understand the sacrifices it has made in terms of lives through terrorist attacks on its soil. Nevertheless, both sides need one another and so some kind of transactional relationship remains important. Mr Trump went out of his way to thank Pakistan for its role in the rescue of the family, drawing a direct connection between his approach and the happy outcome. But Washington will want to see further evidence over time that Pakistan is willing to continue co-operating before anything like real trust can exist between the two countries.

Delevingne joins Weinstein accusers,"Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow are among dozens of women who have come forward with allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. He is currently facing five charges relating to two women in New York. He has previously admitted his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". His spokesperson has said ""any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied"" and there were ""never any acts of retaliation"" against women who turned him down. Clockwise from top left: Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette and Lea Seydoux Here are some of those who have made allegations against him. The actress has accused Weinstein of raping her by performing oral sex in a hotel at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, when she was 23 and had just appeared in Scream. She later reached a $100,000 settlement with him - andsays he offered her$1m for a further non-disclosure deal to stay silent. She declined and has been one of his most vocal accusers. The Emmy-nominated former Sopranos actresshas allegedthat Weinstein forced himself into her apartment in New York in 1992 and raped her. ""I was so ashamed of what happened,"" Sciorratold the New Yorker,external. ""And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?"" The actress says Weinstein asked her to go to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, but appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower. She refused, and says he got revenge by seeking to damage her career.Director Peter Jackson has come forward to say he removed her from a casting list ""as a direct result"" of what he now thinks was ""false information"" provided by Weinstein. In May 2018 Juddsued Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advancesbut a Los Angeles court later dismissed her sexual harassment suit. Her defamation claim may still proceed, the judge said. Mira Sorvino was photographed at a Weinstein Company party in January 2017 The Mighty Aphrodite star says he harassed her in a hotel room in 1995. ""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" she said. Like with Ashley Judd,Peter Jackson said Weinstein warned him off casting her. Hayek said Weinstein threatened to kill her The Frida actress saysshe turned down repeated sexual advances from Weinstein while making the 2002 film Frida. And she says his persuasion tactics included threats. Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't."" The Italian actress and director Asia Argento says she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage in a hotel room on the French Riviera, but he then raped her. Weinstein ""terrified me, and he was so big"", she said. ""It wouldn't stop. It was a nightmare."" Lucia Evans - nee Stoller - encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress. She says she was forced to perform oral sex by the producer after going to his office for what she thought was a casting meeting. ""The type of control he exerted, it was very real,"" she told The New Yorker. ""Even just his presence was intimidating."" The Boardwalk Empire starhas accused Weinsteinof raping her twice in New York in 2010. The first time was after he offered her a ride home, and the second was when he turned up uninvited at her apartment. ""I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, 'I don't want to do this',"" she said. Gwyneth Paltrow with Harvey Weinstein in 2002 Paltrow says Weinstein asked her to give him a massage in his hotel suite after casting her in the leading role of 1996's Emma when she was 22. She refused. ""He screamed at me for a long time. It was brutal,"" she said. She told then boyfriend Brad Pitt - who threatened to kill the producer if he did anything like that to Paltrow again. Former production worker Mimi Haleyi alleges that she was raped by Weinstein when he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 in his New York apartment. ""I told him 'no, no, no'. But he insisted,"" Ms Haleyi told a press conference in New York. The actress also alleges she was raped by Weinstein when he performed oral sex on her without her consent. She says he lured her to a hotel room in 2010 under the guise of helping her procure future TV and film roles. ""I didn't know how to say no to someone like him at the time, which I regret,"" she said. The Norwegian actress accuses Weinstein of raping herin a London hotel after the 2008 Bafta Awards ceremony. She also alleges that he then asked her to engage in a threesome with him and another woman when back in Los Angeles following the Baftas. British actress Lysette Anthony says he carried out a ""pathetic, revolting"" attack at her London home in the late 1980s, which left her ""disgusted and embarrassed"". Lysette Anthony toldThe Sunday Times,externalshe had reported an attack by Weinstein to the Metropolitan Police in London. In anInstagram post,external, Delevingne writes how uncomfortable she felt during an encounter with Weinstein in a hotel room and describes what allegedly happened when she told him she wanted to leave. ""He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room,"" she says. The French actress has written about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink. ""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,""she wrote in The Guardian,external. ""I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him."" Angelina Jolie with Gillian Anderson at the premiere of Playing by Heart in 1998 Jolie says she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room in 1998. ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,"" she said. The Pulp Fiction actress saysWeinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" at the producer's hotel room in London during the 1990s. ""He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" Thurman said. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" Harvey Weinstein and Heather Graham at a film party in 1999 The Boogie Nights actress toldVariety,externalshe was once propositioned by Weinstein in the early 2000s when she met him to discuss being cast in one of his movies. She alleges he implied she had to sleep with him to get a film role, telling her that his wife would have been fine with it. This video can not be played Model Zoe Brock tells Radio 4's Today that she was one of Harvey Weinstein's victims The model and actress says he asked for a massage in the south of France in 1997. She said: ""I didn't know what to do and I felt that letting him maybe touch me a little bit might placate him enough to get me out of there somehow."" Before long, she ""bolted"" into the bathroom. He banged on the door with his fists before eventually retreating, putting on a dressing gown and starting to cry. Louisette Geiss holding a press conference on Tuesday The actress and producer says she was attacked by Weinstein when he invited her to his office in a hotel for a meeting about a script she had written at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. He insisted on listening to her pitch in his hot tub, then asked her to watch him masturbate, she says - and told her he could green-light her script if she did so. She left. The Splash actress saysshe repeatedly turned down Weinstein's advances during promotion for Kill Bill and its sequel. He tried, she says, to get into her hotel room on multiple occasions, once getting a key and ""burst[ing] in like a raging bull."" He asked to grope her breasts and then asked her to expose herself to him, she alleges. She suffered physical repercussions as her flights were cancelled and she was left stranded after she turned him down on one occasion, she adds. The actress says she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result. She told the New York Times,externalin the early 1990s she was directed to his hotel room, where he was in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage. When she refused she says he grabbed her hand and pulled it toward his crotch. ModelAmbra Battilana Gutierrezhas said she was groped by Weinstein and later went to New York police in 2015, saying the producer assaulted her. She then met Weinstein wearing a hidden microphone. But prosecutors took no action. Other stars to have detailed how he made advances in his home or hotel rooms includeBrit Marling,external,Lupita Nyong'O,external,Lena Headey,externalandKate Beckinsale,external.

Asteroid flyby to test warning systems,"Scientists say the asteroid, shown in this illustration, will safely pass by the Earth An asteroid the size of a house is passing close to Earth. The space rock will hurtle past our planet at a distance of about 42,000km (26,000 miles), bringing it within the Moon's orbit and just above the altitude of communication satellites. Nasa scientists say there is no risk of an impact, but the flyby does provide them with the opportunity to test their asteroid-warning systems. A global network of telescopes will be closely monitoring the object. Paul Chodas, manager of Nasa's Centre for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told BBC News: ""We are going to use this asteroid to practise the system that would observe an asteroid, characterise it and compute how close it is going to come, in case some day we have one that is on the way inbound and might hit."" 'No threat' The asteroid, called 2012 TC4, was first spotted five years ago. It is estimated to be between 15m and 30m (50-100ft) in size, which is relatively small. However, even space rocks on this scale are dangerous if they strike. When a 20m-wide asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk in central Russia in 2013, it hit the atmosphere with energy estimated to be equivalent to 500,000 tonnes of TNT, causing a shockwave that damaged buildings and injured more than a thousand people. Nasa scientists who have spent the last two months tracking this new rocky visitor say their calculations show that it will safely clear the Earth and poses no threat. Instead, they will use this close approach to rehearse for future potential strikes. More than a dozen observatories, universities and labs around the world will be watching 2012 TC4 as it flies past. This will help them to refine how asteroids are tracked and provide a chance to test international communication systems. Dr Chodas said that while the risk of an asteroid hit was small, it was prudent to plan ahead. ""Nasa search programmes are getting better and better at finding asteroids,"" he explained. ""It's been a priority to find the large asteroids first. So far the Nasa surveys have found 95% of the asteroids that are one kilometre and larger - these are the ones that could cause a global catastrophe. ""Now we are working our way down to the smaller ones - 130m in size and larger - and we are around 30% on that. ""This little one - we are not trying to find all of the ones of this size. It is just a convenient asteroid coming by that we can practise our tracking techniques on."" He added that if an asteroid was discovered to be heading for the Earth, scientists were looking at different techniques to avert a disaster. ""If we had enough warning time - five or 10 years - then we could do something about it, especially if it's on the small side. ""We could go up and move it, change its velocity years ahead, and that would be enough to move it away from a collision course."" Asteroid TC4's closest approach to Earth on Thursday will be over Antarctica at 05:42 GMT (06:42 BST; 01:42 EDT).

Why did bots wish Putin a happy birthday?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured on holiday in Siberia in August When President Vladimir Putin turned 65 on 7 October, he was not short of online well-wishers. But how many were real? A hashtag which translates as ""Happy Birthday President,external"" began trending in early that day in Russia. One of the most popular tweets using this tag is: The hashtag translates as ""Happy Birthday President"", and the caption on the photo of the bear says ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), High five! Happy B-day!"" While the tweet was shared more than 800 times, none of those sharing it appear to be Russian speakers. They also seemed to lack the personality of an individual, were often advertising services, and with account information containing frequent typos. ""We are a professional photo servic in Vicoria an on Vancouver Island"" (sic) said one. Another described themselves as a ""Maria Arts Mrketing Guru"" (also sic). Several also contained sexually explicit content. The @vitischeg profile also raises suspicions. The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time. The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov. While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad. This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets,RT,externalandSputnik,external. The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots How pro-Russian trolls tried to destroy me Tops off for #PutinShirtlessChallenge Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared thepresidential well-wishing hashtag,externalalso raised suspicions. This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character. Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots. The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year. Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!"" Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative. ""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending. ""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands. ""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat. ""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

Art out of the 'Bedlam' psychiatric hospital,"For centuries Bethlem Hospital was known for the origin of the word ""bedlam"", meaning a scene of general uproar and confusion. But now it is renowned for the artwork created by its patients. Set within 270 acres of ground with bluebell woods and an orchard, The Bethlem Royal Hospital, in the London Borough of Bromley, provides specialist services for people with mental health difficulties. As part of their therapy, patients are offered the chance to work in the hospital's art studios, and in 1997 The Bethlem Gallery was established. Now, 20 years on, some patients are professional artists and with so much talent coming out of the hospital there is a three-year waiting list for a solo exhibition. To celebrate the anniversary, 15 artists are exhibiting their work in the It's How Well You Bounce show which explores coping with adversity against society's expectations that people should just ""bounce back"". Artist Grayson Perry is the patron of The Bethlem Gallery, and has contributed a piece of work - Map of an Englishman - to the exhibition. The ""psychogeographic"" piece explores his mind with two areas of the map which resemble the two halves of the brain. Instead of locations, there are behaviours and psychological states such as areas called Narcolepsy and ClichÃ©. Perry says: ""Art is the greatest asset to mental health I have. It has this amazing ability to go under the radar and it goes down little pathways which are un-trodden and yet it's still a very legitimate way of thinking and feeling and getting on with your life."" Xavier White survived a traumatic head injury in 1985. ""Art has been a mental and physical motivator. It has enabled me to meditate on and realise my passions, interests and concepts around head injury and cheating death."" He says ""brain trauma effects the nuts and bolts"" of consciousness and art ""makes a bridge between people who find themselves on the outside"". White's cityscape, Cohedia asks the viewer to imagine what kind of world we would create if we were given a blank canvas. He has worked as an artist in residence at London South Bank University and also produces creative workshops for student mental health nurses. Bethlem Royal Hospital was founded in 1247 as a place to serve knights setting off to the Holy Land. By 1403 it was used to house ""the insane"", but it was not until 1634 that a regular physician was employed. The site was rebuilt in 1676. With its Corinthian columns and formal gardens it was compared to the Palace of Versailles and regarded as the most opulent asylum in the world. But inside, the faÃ§ade was so heavy the building cracked, and when it rained, the walls ran with water. It was torn down in 1815 and a new building was built. In 1930, the hospital relocated to a former country estate in Beckenham, Bromley, and in 1948 became a psychiatric teaching hospital under the new National Health Service. Richard Dadd: The art of a 'criminal lunatic' murderer For three days a week, Scott painted by the light of a single electric light-bulb and for the rest of the time by candlelight due to her financial circumstances in the 1970s. Unemployed (1972) reflects the challenges her family faced and the struggles of the working class - small living spaces, unemployment and the lack of child support. ""This painting was set in my one room with just space for my cooker on the Holloway Road,"" she says. ""The gloomy light was from a single light bulb and my hope for room to work and breathe only lay in dreams of success as an artist."" She describes the piece as autobiographical. The father-figure is her partner at the time who died from a second heart attack. He had refused to take medication after the first. ""It was a terrifying death I found impossible to deal with,"" she says. Atkin has Dermatillomania more commonly known as Compulsive Skin Picking. She also has chronic anxiety and was signed off from work for 10 months due to a depressive episode. Her work involves creating lots of marks over-and-over-again. ""I use art to work through my condition that explores the body-focused repetitive behaviour of this particular mental illness...which might be too hard to explain in words,"" she says. ""I certainly feel that art is now my most important tool for my wellbeing, but this is a daily reprieve for me, not a cure."" She describes Bethlem Gallery as a ""true beacon of hope"" for the artists and their recovery. Liz has exhibited in Australia, America and Japan and is known for her #CompulsiveCharcoal drawings which she creates while riding on public transport and gives to passengers. Sue Morgan was diagnosed with schizophrenia more than 20 years ago and uses art to express the hallucinations she experiences. ""I had lost my house, my partner and my job, but I still kept on putting marks to paper,"" she says. ""Moving out of a successful career into the mental health sector as a patient was devastating and the staff at the Bethlem Gallery encouraged me to create a new identity. ""It was slow and not without darkness. But I can truly say that without the support I would not have been able to complete a degree in drawing and to go on to feel that I still had something to contribute to the planet.""

Happy bot-day Mr President?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured on holiday in Siberia in August When President Vladimir Putin turned 65 on 7 October, he was not short of online well-wishers. But how many were real? A hashtag which translates as ""Happy Birthday President,external"" began trending in early that day in Russia. One of the most popular tweets using this tag is: The hashtag translates as ""Happy Birthday President"", and the caption on the photo of the bear says ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), High five! Happy B-day!"" While the tweet was shared more than 800 times, none of those sharing it appear to be Russian speakers. They also seemed to lack the personality of an individual, were often advertising services, and with account information containing frequent typos. ""We are a professional photo servic in Vicoria an on Vancouver Island"" (sic) said one. Another described themselves as a ""Maria Arts Mrketing Guru"" (also sic). Several also contained sexually explicit content. The @vitischeg profile also raises suspicions. The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time. The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov. While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad. This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets,RT,externalandSputnik,external. The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots How pro-Russian trolls tried to destroy me Tops off for #PutinShirtlessChallenge Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared thepresidential well-wishing hashtag,externalalso raised suspicions. This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character. Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots. The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year. Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!"" Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative. ""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending. ""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands. ""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat. ""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

What will Trump do about the Iran nuclear deal?,"All the indications are that President Trump will refuse to recertify the present Iran nuclear deal some time before the due date of 15 October. This would light a fuse that could potentially explode the agreement. It raises questions about how Iran will respond. And it creates huge diplomatic difficulties between the US and many of its key European allies who wholeheartedly back the deal. The agreement, negotiated with Iran by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council together with Germany and the European Union, was reached in July 2015. Its aim was to ensure that Iran's nuclear programme was entirely peaceful. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), began to be implemented in January 2016. In return for the progressive lifting of a range of economic sanctions, Iran halted some of its activities and reduced others within strict limits, all open to verification by international inspectors. Trump might 'abandon Iran nuclear deal' Tehran expects US to ditch nuclear agreement, says FM Trump's nuclear problem with Iran requires a plan B Why has Trump been so harsh on Iran? There are four crucial things to remember about the deal. It was not perfect. Forcing Iran to halt its nuclear activities altogether was not feasible. Many of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOAcontain ""sunset clauses"", which run out after a number of years. What happens then is a valid question, but it was felt by all the parties that constraining Iran's nuclear programme for the immediate future was a deal worth taking. It is easy to forget that there was a real concern at the time the deal was being negotiated that without an agreement there could be a military conflict. Donald Trump spoke at rallies criticising the Iran nuclear deal, during the presidential campaign Israel was pressing for military action. Many of Iran's Arab enemies in the Gulf quietly backed such a step and there were questions as to whether the US itself might have to use force to prevent Iran developing the capability to manufacture and deliver a nuclear weapon. Sound familiar? It is much like the position that the US is in today with North Korea. The JCPOA was intended to manage Iran's nuclear activities, avoiding a recourse to war. The JCPOA was about Iran's nuclear programme and nothing else. Iran does many things that the US, and its European and Middle Eastern allies, believe are damaging to security in the region. That is an important but a different matter, one that I will come back to in a moment. The JCPOA was and is a nuclear deal, pure and simple. And that brings me to perhaps the most fundamental point of all. Everyone - and that includes the UN's nuclear watchdog and all of the signatories (including senior figures in the Trump administration) - believes that Iran is abiding by the agreement to the letter. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal Enter the US Congress. It wanted to have some oversight over the application of the JCPOA and brought in legislation, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), which requires the US president to certify every 90 days not just that Iran is complying with the deal, but that the continued suspension of nuclear-related US economic sanctions remains vital to the national security interests of the United States. So far - despite criticising the Iran nuclear deal at every opportunity - President Trump has grudgingly recertified the JCPOA under this legislation. But now he looks set to change his mind. Assuming he does now refuse to recertify the deal, insisting that it is no longer in US interests to do so, what then? What does it mean? And what happens next? The crucial point to grasp is that the Iran deal (JCPOA) and the US legislation (INARA) are two totally different things. By decertifying the Iran deal, Mr Trump would not be withdrawing from it. He would certainly be making a fundamental point about his view of its utility. He would be opening up a path under which Congress could effectively cease US compliance with the deal. But in practical terms, this is a multinational agreement that is being adhered to and thus it would remain active with or without a certification from Mr Trump. Of course, having decertified the deal, the president could simply reimpose some or all of the economic sanctions that have been waived under the JCPOA, and this would certainly mean that the US was no longer complying with its terms of the deal. But the more likely scenario would be that - under the US INARA legislation - the whole issue would go to Capitol Hill for the US Congress to decide. Opinion there is divided. There is clearly no warmth felt towards Tehran, but at this stage it is not clear what Congress might do. The Iran nuclear deal was announced in Vienna, Austria, in July 2015 Would it reimpose some or all sanctions - thus pulling the US out of the deal - or decide to bide its time? There are indications that some of those on Capitol Hill most critical of the deal at the time are now reluctant to tear it up. Now we come to another crucial aspect of this whole business: the ostensible reason why Mr Trump may decertify the agreement in the first place. Iran is seen by the West and its allies as a major problem in the region. Paradoxically, the US itself helped to facilitate Iran's rise as a regional player through its destruction of the Saddam Hussein government in Iraq. Iran has an important say with the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad. It - along with its proxy militias - is a major player in Syria. And it has a hand in the conflict in Yemen, though there is debate about the scale of its activities there. Add in worries about its missile programmes and its alleged support for terrorism, and there are good reasons for concern about its growing regional influence. The JCPOA agreement has not changed Iran's wider behaviour. Under the deal, Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300kg (0.3 tonnes) for 15 years The activities of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and its missile-research effort have continued. The JCPOA was never intended to tackle these wider issues. But in some basic sense, Mr Trump looks set to contend that Iran is not living up to the ""spirit"" of the deal - it's not playing nice - and that is why he will choose to decertify it. The Trump administration wants to get tough with Tehran. The president is likely to set his decertification of the JCPOA as part of a wider set of policies intended to punish Iran, as he would see it, for its bad behaviour. This video can not be played Trump and Rouhani trade insults in UN podium duel All sorts of new sanctions could be on the table. Remember, there is still a whole battery of sanctions in place both from the US and the EU for a variety of other things - separate from the nuclear programme - such as terrorism or human rights violations. One suggestion is that the Trump administration might decide to brand the whole of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity. This body - part security force, part military, part ideological vanguard - also controls a significant part of the Iranian economy. More sanctions here could cause problems not just for Iran, but between the US and those of its allies who want to open up trade with Tehran. So if, as expected, Mr Trump does decertify the Iran nuclear deal, it is not necessarily the end of the agreement. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the US would damage its own reputation if it violates the nuclear deal America's allies are lining up to encourage both the White House and Congress to stick with the deal. Theresa May urges Donald Trump to keep Iran nuclear deal Even if Congress chooses not to reapply sanctions for now, the next problem becomes the scope and impact of the Trump administration's wider policy towards Tehran. Iran for now is likely to do nothing. It will see decertification as an internal legal US matter, and is likely to continue to adhere to the agreement. Indeed, it may well relish the widening split between Washington and its key European allies. But the way Tehran responds to any other US steps may well decide the fate of the nuclear deal. Remember, this is a US administration dominated by military figures, many of whom have been up against Iranian-backed forces in the field. US defence chief Mattis suggests backing Iran nuclear deal They may back the nuclear deal, but also want to see Tehran held to account for its actions. Insulating the JCPOA from team Trump's wider Iran policy is not going to be easy, and over time, it may well influence thinking towards the utility of the agreement in Iran itself.

Barnier: Not enough progress in Brexit talks,"This video can not be played Michel Barnier: 'We've reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing' The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says there has not been enough progress to move to the next stage of Brexit talks as the UK wants. He said there was ""new momentum"" in the process but there was still ""deadlock"" over how much the UK pays when it leaves, which he called ""disturbing"". Brexit Secretary David Davis said he still hoped for the go-ahead for trade talks when EU leaders meet next week. The pair were speaking after the fifth round of Brexit talks in Brussels. Brexit: All you need to know A guide to key issues in EU-UK talks Mr Barnier said: ""I am not able in the current circumstances to propose next week to the European Council that we should start discussions on the future relationship."" The UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis urged EU leaders at the summit, on 19 and 20 October, to give Mr Barnier a mandate to start trade talks and to ""build on the spirit of co-operation we now have"". He said there had been progress on the area of citizens' rights that had moved the two sides ""even closer to a deal"". The EU chief negotiator told reporters at the joint press conference he hoped for ""decisive progress"" by the time of the December summit of the European Council. He said Theresa May's announcement that Britain would honour financial commitments entered into as an EU member was ""important"". But he said there had been no negotiations on the issue this week because the UK was not ready to spell out what it would pay. ""On this question we have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it's disturbing also for taxpayers."" Not even Brexit's biggest cheerleader could claim the discussions in Brussels have been going well. And there are visible frustrations on both sides. But before claiming this morning's drama means the whole thing is doomed there are a few things worth remembering. At the very start of this whole process, the hope was that in October, the EU would agree to move on to the next phase of the talks, to talk about our future relationship. But for months it has been clear that the chances of that were essentially zero. It is not, therefore, a surprise to hear Mr Barnier saying right now, he doesn't feel able to press the button on phase 2, however much he enjoyed the drama of saying so today. Second, behind the scenes, although it has been slow, there has been some progress in the talks but officials in some areas have reached the end of the line until their political masters give them permission to move on. Read Laura's full blog The so-called divorce bill covers things like the pensions of former EU staff in the UK, the cost of relocating EU agencies based in the UK and outstanding commitments to EU programmes. The UK has said it will meet its legal requirements and there has been speculation the bill could be anywhere between Â£50bn and Â£100bn, spread over a number of years. BBC Europe Correspondent Kevin Connolly said the UK sees its total financial commitment ""as its best negotiating card to be played somewhere near the end of the talks - the EU wants that card to be shown now at a point which is still relatively early in a two-year game"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Time to put 'tiger in tank' on Brexit talks The UK has also offered to keep paying into the EU budget during a proposed two-year transition period. The EU had two other issues on which it would not make any ""concessions"", said Mr Barnier - citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border. On the status of the border, Mr Barnier said negotiations had ""advanced"" during this week's discussions. But he said there was ""more work to do in order to build a full picture of the challenges to North-South co-operation resulting from the UK - and therefore Northern Ireland - leaving the EU legal framework"". What would ""no deal"" look like? Donald Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks Asked about speculation that the UK could exit the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal, Mr Barnier said the EU was ready for ""any eventualities"" but added: ""No deal will be a very bad deal."" Mr Davis said: ""It's not what we seek, we want to see a good deal, but we are planning for everything."" Both men said progress had been made on citizens' rights, with Mr Davis saying there would be an agreement ""soon"" to ensure EU nationals in the UK would be able to enforce their rights through the UK courts. He said EU citizens would still have to register with the UK authorities but the process would be streamlined to make it as simple and cheap as possible. According to Mr Davis, the remaining sticking points include: The right to bring in future family members The right to ""export a range of benefits"" To ""continue to enjoy the recognition of professional qualifications"" To vote in local elections To ""leave for a prolonged period and yet continue to enjoy a right to remain or permanent right of residence on return"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I think it's quite shocking. We're now 15 months on since the referendum and the government seems to have reached deadlock at every stage."" He said ""falling out"" of the EU without a trade deal would threaten ""a lot of jobs all across Britain"". This video can not be played Starmer: ""We need to grasp the urgency."" Labour is calling for ""emergency"" talks between Mr Davis and the EU early next week, to try to break the deadlock ahead of the EU summit. Earlier this week, European Council President Donald Tusk suggested that the green light to begin talks about a post-Brexit trade deal would not come until December at the earliest. Meanwhile, draft conclusions for next week's summit of EU leaders - which could yet change - call for internal work to begin on possible transitional arrangements and trade talks with the UK. That would mean they could move ahead with negotiations on a future relationship, if ""sufficient progress has been achieved"" in talks. But the draft conclusions seen by the BBC, if adopted, suggest EU leaders are not yet ready to begin talks with the UK about a post-Brexit transition deal. Last month Prime Minister Theresa May used a speech in Florence to set out proposals for a two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, in a bid to ease the deadlock.

No great step forward on Brexit - Barnier,"This video can not be played Michel Barnier: 'We've reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing' The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says there has not been enough progress to move to the next stage of Brexit talks as the UK wants. He said there was ""new momentum"" in the process but there was still ""deadlock"" over how much the UK pays when it leaves, which he called ""disturbing"". Brexit Secretary David Davis said he still hoped for the go-ahead for trade talks when EU leaders meet next week. The pair were speaking after the fifth round of Brexit talks in Brussels. Brexit: All you need to know A guide to key issues in EU-UK talks Mr Barnier said: ""I am not able in the current circumstances to propose next week to the European Council that we should start discussions on the future relationship."" The UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis urged EU leaders at the summit, on 19 and 20 October, to give Mr Barnier a mandate to start trade talks and to ""build on the spirit of co-operation we now have"". He said there had been progress on the area of citizens' rights that had moved the two sides ""even closer to a deal"". The EU chief negotiator told reporters at the joint press conference he hoped for ""decisive progress"" by the time of the December summit of the European Council. He said Theresa May's announcement that Britain would honour financial commitments entered into as an EU member was ""important"". But he said there had been no negotiations on the issue this week because the UK was not ready to spell out what it would pay. ""On this question we have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it's disturbing also for taxpayers."" Not even Brexit's biggest cheerleader could claim the discussions in Brussels have been going well. And there are visible frustrations on both sides. But before claiming this morning's drama means the whole thing is doomed there are a few things worth remembering. At the very start of this whole process, the hope was that in October, the EU would agree to move on to the next phase of the talks, to talk about our future relationship. But for months it has been clear that the chances of that were essentially zero. It is not, therefore, a surprise to hear Mr Barnier saying right now, he doesn't feel able to press the button on phase 2, however much he enjoyed the drama of saying so today. Second, behind the scenes, although it has been slow, there has been some progress in the talks but officials in some areas have reached the end of the line until their political masters give them permission to move on.

BBC Europe Correspondent Kevin Connolly said the UK sees its total financial commitment ""as its best negotiating card to be played somewhere near the end of the talks - the EU wants that card to be shown now at a point which is still relatively early in a two-year game"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Time to put 'tiger in tank' on Brexit talks The UK has also offered to keep paying into the EU budget during a proposed two-year transition period. The EU had two other issues on which it would not make any ""concessions"", said Mr Barnier - citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border. On the status of the border, Mr Barnier said negotiations had ""advanced"" during this week's discussions.

What would ""no deal"" look like? Donald Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks Asked about speculation that the UK could exit the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal, Mr Barnier said the EU was ready for ""any eventualities"" but added: ""No deal will be a very bad deal."" Mr Davis said: ""It's not what we seek, we want to see a good deal, but we are planning for everything."" Both men said progress had been made on citizens' rights, with Mr Davis saying there would be an agreement ""soon"" to ensure EU nationals in the UK would be able to enforce their rights through the UK courts. He said EU citizens would still have to register with the UK authorities but the process would be streamlined to make it as simple and cheap as possible. According to Mr Davis, the remaining sticking points include: The right to bring in future family members The right to ""export a range of benefits"" To ""continue to enjoy the recognition of professional qualifications"" To vote in local elections To ""leave for a prolonged period and yet continue to enjoy a right to remain or permanent right of residence on return"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I think it's quite shocking. We're now 15 months on since the referendum and the government seems to have reached deadlock at every stage."" He said ""falling out"" of the EU without a trade deal would threaten ""a lot of jobs all across Britain"". This video can not be played Starmer: ""We need to grasp the urgency."" Labour is calling for ""emergency"" talks between Mr Davis and the EU early next week, to try to break the deadlock ahead of the EU summit. Earlier this week, European Council President Donald Tusk suggested that the green light to begin talks about a post-Brexit trade deal would not come until December at the earliest. Meanwhile, draft conclusions for next week's summit of EU leaders - which could yet change - call for internal work to begin on possible transitional arrangements and trade talks with the UK. That would mean they could move ahead with negotiations on a future relationship, if ""sufficient progress has been achieved"" in talks. But the draft conclusions seen by the BBC, if adopted, suggest EU leaders are not yet ready to begin talks with the UK about a post-Brexit transition deal. Last month Prime Minister Theresa May used a speech in Florence to set out proposals for a two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, in a bid to ease the deadlock.

Art out of 'Bedlam',"For centuries Bethlem Hospital was known for the origin of the word ""bedlam"", meaning a scene of general uproar and confusion. But now it is renowned for the artwork created by its patients. Set within 270 acres of ground with bluebell woods and an orchard, The Bethlem Royal Hospital, in the London Borough of Bromley, provides specialist services for people with mental health difficulties. As part of their therapy, patients are offered the chance to work in the hospital's art studios, and in 1997 The Bethlem Gallery was established. Now, 20 years on, some patients are professional artists and with so much talent coming out of the hospital there is a three-year waiting list for a solo exhibition. To celebrate the anniversary, 15 artists are exhibiting their work in the It's How Well You Bounce show which explores coping with adversity against society's expectations that people should just ""bounce back"". Artist Grayson Perry is the patron of The Bethlem Gallery, and has contributed a piece of work - Map of an Englishman - to the exhibition. The ""psychogeographic"" piece explores his mind with two areas of the map which resemble the two halves of the brain. Instead of locations, there are behaviours and psychological states such as areas called Narcolepsy and ClichÃ©. Perry says: ""Art is the greatest asset to mental health I have. It has this amazing ability to go under the radar and it goes down little pathways which are un-trodden and yet it's still a very legitimate way of thinking and feeling and getting on with your life."" Xavier White survived a traumatic head injury in 1985. ""Art has been a mental and physical motivator. It has enabled me to meditate on and realise my passions, interests and concepts around head injury and cheating death."" He says ""brain trauma effects the nuts and bolts"" of consciousness and art ""makes a bridge between people who find themselves on the outside"". White's cityscape, Cohedia asks the viewer to imagine what kind of world we would create if we were given a blank canvas. He has worked as an artist in residence at London South Bank University and also produces creative workshops for student mental health nurses. Bethlem Royal Hospital was founded in 1247 as a place to serve knights setting off to the Holy Land. By 1403 it was used to house ""the insane"", but it was not until 1634 that a regular physician was employed. The site was rebuilt in 1676. With its Corinthian columns and formal gardens it was compared to the Palace of Versailles and regarded as the most opulent asylum in the world. But inside, the faÃ§ade was so heavy the building cracked, and when it rained, the walls ran with water. It was torn down in 1815 and a new building was built. In 1930, the hospital relocated to a former country estate in Beckenham, Bromley, and in 1948 became a psychiatric teaching hospital under the new National Health Service. Richard Dadd: The art of a 'criminal lunatic' murderer For three days a week, Scott painted by the light of a single electric light-bulb and for the rest of the time by candlelight due to her financial circumstances in the 1970s. Unemployed (1972) reflects the challenges her family faced and the struggles of the working class - small living spaces, unemployment and the lack of child support. ""This painting was set in my one room with just space for my cooker on the Holloway Road,"" she says. ""The gloomy light was from a single light bulb and my hope for room to work and breathe only lay in dreams of success as an artist."" She describes the piece as autobiographical. The father-figure is her partner at the time who died from a second heart attack. He had refused to take medication after the first. ""It was a terrifying death I found impossible to deal with,"" she says. Atkin has Dermatillomania more commonly known as Compulsive Skin Picking. She also has chronic anxiety and was signed off from work for 10 months due to a depressive episode. Her work involves creating lots of marks over-and-over-again. ""I use art to work through my condition that explores the body-focused repetitive behaviour of this particular mental illness...which might be too hard to explain in words,"" she says. ""I certainly feel that art is now my most important tool for my wellbeing, but this is a daily reprieve for me, not a cure."" She describes Bethlem Gallery as a ""true beacon of hope"" for the artists and their recovery. Liz has exhibited in Australia, America and Japan and is known for her #CompulsiveCharcoal drawings which she creates while riding on public transport and gives to passengers. Sue Morgan was diagnosed with schizophrenia more than 20 years ago and uses art to express the hallucinations she experiences. ""I had lost my house, my partner and my job, but I still kept on putting marks to paper,"" she says. ""Moving out of a successful career into the mental health sector as a patient was devastating and the staff at the Bethlem Gallery encouraged me to create a new identity. ""It was slow and not without darkness. But I can truly say that without the support I would not have been able to complete a degree in drawing and to go on to feel that I still had something to contribute to the planet."" It's How Well You Bounce runs until 28 October and is open to the public. For more Disability News, follow onTwitter,externalandFacebook,external, and subscribe to the weekly podcast.

British IS recruiter Jones 'killed by drone',"British IS recruiter Sally-Anne Jones was reportedly killed in a US drone strike in Syria, in June. Jones, from Chatham in Kent, joined so-called Islamic State after converting to Islam and travelling to Syria in 2013. Her death was first reported byThe Sun,external. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said Jones had been a useful propaganda agent for IS on social media and her death would be ""significant"". Whitehall officials have declined to comment publicly. However, they have not denied the story, and US sources are confident she was killed in an unmanned drone strike in June, our correspondent added. The 48-year-old was reportedly killed close to the border between Syria and Iraq by a US Air Force strike. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""aware of the reports"" around Jones's death, but was ""not in a position to comment further"". Her official spokesman said the coalition ""follows clear and lawful rules of engagement."" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also refused to comment about Jones directly, but said if someone chose to fight for IS they have made themselves a ""legitimate target"" and ""run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile."" Corbyn: UK jihadist should have had trial The secret lives of IS fighters IS's ruined capital city Who are Britainâs jihadists? Jones - who had no previous military training - had been married to the jihadist Junaid Hussain, who waskilled in 2015 in a drone strike. Previously a punk musician, she had been used to recruit western girls to the group and posted threatening messages to Christians in the UK. Jones, who was born in Greenwich, London, also encouraged individuals to carry out attacks in Britain, offering guidance on how to construct home-made bombs. She used her Twitter account to provide practical advice on how to travel to Syria and shared pictures of herself posing with weapons. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The death of Sally-Anne Jones, if confirmed, will make little or no tactical difference to the military fortunes of so-called Islamic State on the battlefield. Despite posing online variously with a Kalashnikov and a pistol, and reportedly ""leading a battalion of jihadist women"", her value to the group was iconic rather than military. But in this role she was definitely judged to be dangerous. Along with her late husband, Junaid Hussain, she maintained a stream of hostile online propaganda aimed at the West. This included luring western female recruits to the self-declared IS caliphate, encouraging attacks in the West and threatening to kill non-Muslims. She is believed to have been involved in planning previous attacks in the West, including a plot to assassinate the Queen and Prince Philip in 2015. There appears to have been no reaction to Jones's reported death from Arabic-speaking online supporters of IS, according to BBC Monitoring, which observes media worldwide. But it said this was typical in such cases. IS never publicly acknowledged Jones - also known as Umm Hussein al-Britaniyah - as a member. Women occasionally feature in IS's official propaganda and only as authors of articles in its monthly publications, BBC Monitoring added. Junaid Hussain was killed in a drone strike in 2015 Jones's husband was a computer hacker for IS and was regarded as a ""high value target"" before his death. In 2015 the then Prime Minister David Cameron said Junaid Hussain had been planning ""barbaric attacks against the West"", including terror plots targeting ""high profile public commemorations"". News of Jones's death has not previously been made public amid fears that her 12-year-old son, Jojo, may also have been killed in the June strike, according to The Sun. BBC correspondent Richard Lister said it was assumed the boy had been killed. Maj Gen Chip Chapman, former MoD head of counter terror, said under UN Charters the boy would be too young to be classed as a soldier and would not have been targeted, ""even if he got up to really bad things"". ""We don't know for sure whether he was with her or not,"" he added. When asked whether Jojo had been killed, the prime minister declined to comment. The image of Sally-Anne Jones (left) was far from the real deal By Ciaran McCauley, BBC News Northern Ireland It's the image that turned Sally-Anne Jones, the British recruiter for the so-called Islamic State, into the ""nun with the gun"". The only problem? It isn't real - and its origins link back to the debut novel of Northern Ireland writer Colin Bateman in 1995. The original image, featuring a nun posing with a gun and a dog, was used on the front cover of his first book Divorcing Jack. The edited version, which is in black and white and has Jones' face superimposed on to the nun's body, is believed to have originated on her Twitter account. Read more about its origins here. Azadeh Moaveni, a journalist and author of the book Lipstick Jihad, told the BBC that Jones had been one of the most ""iconic"" recruiters for IS because she helped the group to project the idea it could ""get into the very reaches of British society"". The BBC's Frank Gardner said although it was ""very likely"" Jones has been killed, it was difficult to be certain because that would require sending a special forces team to gather DNA. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said if Jones's death was confirmed, it would be ""significant"", but he said he would prefer to have seen her in court. ""I think people who have committed crimes ought to be put on trial,"" he said. ""That wayâ¦ when you interrogate somebody, you get more information about the background to it."" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We do not comment on matters of national security."" Other high-profile British jihadists killed in air strikes include Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John, who appeared in beheading videos for IS.

The companies making bicycles from wood,"Connor Wood makes its bike frames from white ash or black walnut The forerunner of the bicycle - the laufmaschine or running machine - bears only a passing resemblance to the pedal-bikes we know today. Invented in 1817, it had no chain and was powered by the rider pushing his feet along the ground in a walking or running motion. Even more unusually, its frame was made from wood. Jump forward to 2017, and a crop of bike makers is turning back the clock - at least in terms of using wood as a core material. These firms make their bicycles in part, and occasionally wholly, from woods such as ash, oak and walnut. They are driven by a love of craft and design, the desire to use natural materials, and a passion for cycling itself. Chris Connor decided to combine his long held passions for woodwork and cycling And they have attracted a small but growing base of enthusiastic customers, willing to pay high prices for their lovingly crafted creations. ""People like having something unique, something different,"" says Chris Connor, the founder of Connor Wood Bicycles. ""They also appreciate the craftsmanship. Not a lot of things are built by hand these days."" The company was born in 2012, after the 48-year-old American decided to combine his long held passions for woodwork and cycling. All his bikes all have wooden frames; the other parts, such as the gears and wheels, are made from steel, carbon or rubber. Prices range from $3,500 (Â£2,600) to $11,000. Sales have gradually been increasing, but it hasn't been easy, says Mr Connor. That's because of a perception among some cyclists that wooden bikes may break or be unsafe. Woodster Bikes makes its frames from beech and bog oak In fact, Mr Connor says wood is very durable, which is why it's used to make tool handles, skis, boats, even light aircraft. It also absorbs vibrations well, making cycling on bumpy roads smoother, less tiring and quieter. ""And of course, these bikes look great,"" says Mr Connor, who makes his frames made from ""strong but flexible"" white ash or ""eye candy"" black walnut. A recently published book called ""The Wooden Bicycle: Around the World"" features 111 companies that make bikes from wood or bamboo. Only one, Splinterbike in the UK, sells 100% wooden models with its bikes featuring wooden gears, chains and wheels. Woodster Bikes cost from 2,500 euros to 17,000 euros However, most limit their use of wood to the frame, and occasionally parts such as the handlebars and forks. Other parts will be made from materials typically associated with bikes, such as aluminium. It is the unique design of wooden bikes, and their bespoke craftsmanship, that underpins their appeal, says Gregor Cuzak. The Slovenian co-founded Woodster Bikes after meeting woodworker Iztok Mohoric, who had recently designed a bike with a wooden frame. ""I wasn't interested at first, but after I saw it and took a ride, I was immediately convinced,"" Mr Cuzak says. ""People were watching me as if I was driving a wild sports car."" Piet Brandjes, right, co-founder of Bough Bikes with his son Bob Like other firms in the space, Woodster is targeting customers who appreciate the finer things in life. Its bike frames are made of woods such as beech and bog oak, and prices range from 2,500 euros (Â£2,190) up to 17,000 euros. In addition, every customer gets a book with a story about how their individual bike was made. ""We even plant a new tree at the same location where we cut one for your bike,"" Mr Cuzak adds. Piet Brandjes, 63, who co-founded Dutch firm Bough Bikes, agrees that wooden bikes ""attract attention"". For that reason, firms in the Netherlands such as Novotel and Rabobank have bought Bough Bikes for their guests and employees to use. More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Ever fancied owning the Joker's costume from Batman? The firms that donate as many goods as they sell How do you like your wine - with a cork or screw-cap? Are changeable heels the end to women's sore feet? The bikes are also used in a shared bike scheme at Schiphol Airport business park, in Amsterdam, so workers can give them a spin. Mr Brandjes says all his models have French oak frames, handlebars and front forks. However, customers don't need to worry about them getting wet in the rain. ""The bikes in the shared scheme have been outside for three years and they still look good,"" he says. ""As long as wet wood dries again, it's fine. You just need to polish it once a season."" Bough Bikes Everyone I spoke to reported feeling frustrated by assumptions that wooden bikes were less safe and sturdy than other bikes. Mr Connor tells me that by using the right woods and construction techniques, his bikes are perfectly durable. ""A strong seasoned wood, laminated to itself in strips with reversing grain directions, bonded with aerospace adhesives is incredibly tough. ""Add in interspersed layers of carbon fibre and Kevlar, like in my bikes, and the strength far exceeds the requirements for making a reasonably lightweight performance bicycle frame."" As for how they function, Mr Brandjes points out that all of his bikes have been tested by TUV Rheinland, a renowned German organisation that certifies products. French oak However, other obstacles may hinder firms in the space. For one thing, wooden bikes tend to be heavier than many road bikes. The various models of the three companies I spoke to weigh between 9.9kg and 25kg. ""You can't make them as light as carbon bikes,"" says Mr Connor, ""but I don't think a pound or two more or less matters."" The people who buy them are not competitive riders, he adds. Another issue is that wooden bikes tend to cost a lot, which may be preventing higher volumes of sales. American firm Renovo, whose bikes start at $3,995, is probably the number one producer of wooden bikes worldwide. And yet it told the BBC it had only sold 1,000 models since it was founded in 2007. ""If someone manages to create a wooden bike for under 1,000 euros (Â£914), sales might rise,"" Mr Cuzak says. He has only sold 10 bikes since he started in 2015, meaning that he and his partner still have to work on the company in their spare time. However, Mr Connor runs his business full time, having sold around 65 pieces to date. And Bough Bikes has shifted about 600 bikes since it was founded in 2012. Summing up what many in the wooden bike industry believe, Mr Cuzak says, ""this is not a regular business, but a slow business"". However, he adds: ""We've planted the seed and are now waiting for the tree to grow. I believe it will, eventually."" Fighting for craft beer in Thailand.

The bots behind Vladimir Putin's birthday wishes,"Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured on holiday in Siberia in August When President Vladimir Putin turned 65 on 7 October, he was not short of online well-wishers. But how many were real? A hashtag which translates as ""Happy Birthday President,external"" began trending in early that day in Russia. One of the most popular tweets using this tag is: The hashtag translates as ""Happy Birthday President"", and the caption on the photo of the bear says ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), High five! Happy B-day!"" While the tweet was shared more than 800 times, none of those sharing it appear to be Russian speakers. They also seemed to lack the personality of an individual, were often advertising services, and with account information containing frequent typos. ""We are a professional photo servic in Vicoria an on Vancouver Island"" (sic) said one. Another described themselves as a ""Maria Arts Mrketing Guru"" (also sic). Several also contained sexually explicit content. The @vitischeg profile also raises suspicions. The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time. The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov. While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad. This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets,RT,externalandSputnik,external. The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots How pro-Russian trolls tried to destroy me Tops off for #PutinShirtlessChallenge Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared thepresidential well-wishing hashtag,externalalso raised suspicions. This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character. Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots. The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year. Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!"" Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative. ""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending. ""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands. ""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat. ""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

Cheating death and drawing identity,"For centuries Bethlem Hospital was known for the origin of the word ""bedlam"", meaning a scene of general uproar and confusion. But now it is renowned for the artwork created by its patients. Set within 270 acres of ground with bluebell woods and an orchard, The Bethlem Royal Hospital, in the London Borough of Bromley, provides specialist services for people with mental health difficulties. As part of their therapy, patients are offered the chance to work in the hospital's art studios, and in 1997 The Bethlem Gallery was established. Now, 20 years on, some patients are professional artists and with so much talent coming out of the hospital there is a three-year waiting list for a solo exhibition. To celebrate the anniversary, 15 artists are exhibiting their work in the It's How Well You Bounce show which explores coping with adversity against society's expectations that people should just ""bounce back"". Artist Grayson Perry is the patron of The Bethlem Gallery, and has contributed a piece of work - Map of an Englishman - to the exhibition. The ""psychogeographic"" piece explores his mind with two areas of the map which resemble the two halves of the brain. Instead of locations, there are behaviours and psychological states such as areas called Narcolepsy and ClichÃ©. Perry says: ""Art is the greatest asset to mental health I have. It has this amazing ability to go under the radar and it goes down little pathways which are un-trodden and yet it's still a very legitimate way of thinking and feeling and getting on with your life."" Xavier White survived a traumatic head injury in 1985. ""Art has been a mental and physical motivator. It has enabled me to meditate on and realise my passions, interests and concepts around head injury and cheating death."" He says ""brain trauma effects the nuts and bolts"" of consciousness and art ""makes a bridge between people who find themselves on the outside"". White's cityscape, Cohedia asks the viewer to imagine what kind of world we would create if we were given a blank canvas. He has worked as an artist in residence at London South Bank University and also produces creative workshops for student mental health nurses. Bethlem Royal Hospital was founded in 1247 as a place to serve knights setting off to the Holy Land. By 1403 it was used to house ""the insane"", but it was not until 1634 that a regular physician was employed. The site was rebuilt in 1676. With its Corinthian columns and formal gardens it was compared to the Palace of Versailles and regarded as the most opulent asylum in the world. But inside, the faÃ§ade was so heavy the building cracked, and when it rained, the walls ran with water. It was torn down in 1815 and a new building was built. In 1930, the hospital relocated to a former country estate in Beckenham, Bromley, and in 1948 became a psychiatric teaching hospital under the new National Health Service. Richard Dadd: The art of a 'criminal lunatic' murderer For three days a week, Scott painted by the light of a single electric light-bulb and for the rest of the time by candlelight due to her financial circumstances in the 1970s. Unemployed (1972) reflects the challenges her family faced and the struggles of the working class - small living spaces, unemployment and the lack of child support. ""This painting was set in my one room with just space for my cooker on the Holloway Road,"" she says. ""The gloomy light was from a single light bulb and my hope for room to work and breathe only lay in dreams of success as an artist."" She describes the piece as autobiographical. The father-figure is her partner at the time who died from a second heart attack. He had refused to take medication after the first. ""It was a terrifying death I found impossible to deal with,"" she says. Atkin has Dermatillomania more commonly known as Compulsive Skin Picking. She also has chronic anxiety and was signed off from work for 10 months due to a depressive episode. Her work involves creating lots of marks over-and-over-again. ""I use art to work through my condition that explores the body-focused repetitive behaviour of this particular mental illness...which might be too hard to explain in words,"" she says. ""I certainly feel that art is now my most important tool for my wellbeing, but this is a daily reprieve for me, not a cure."" She describes Bethlem Gallery as a ""true beacon of hope"" for the artists and their recovery. Liz has exhibited in Australia, America and Japan and is known for her #CompulsiveCharcoal drawings which she creates while riding on public transport and gives to passengers. Sue Morgan was diagnosed with schizophrenia more than 20 years ago and uses art to express the hallucinations she experiences. ""I had lost my house, my partner and my job, but I still kept on putting marks to paper,"" she says. ""Moving out of a successful career into the mental health sector as a patient was devastating and the staff at the Bethlem Gallery encouraged me to create a new identity. ""It was slow and not without darkness. But I can truly say that without the support I would not have been able to complete a degree in drawing and to go on to feel that I still had something to contribute to the planet.""

British IS recruiter Jones 'killed' by drone,"British IS recruiter Sally-Anne Jones was reportedly killed in a US drone strike in Syria, in June. Jones, from Chatham in Kent, joined so-called Islamic State after converting to Islam and travelling to Syria in 2013. Her death was first reported byThe Sun,external. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said Jones had been a useful propaganda agent for IS on social media and her death would be ""significant"". Whitehall officials have declined to comment publicly. However, they have not denied the story, and US sources are confident she was killed in an unmanned drone strike in June, our correspondent added. The 48-year-old was reportedly killed close to the border between Syria and Iraq by a US Air Force strike. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""aware of the reports"" around Jones's death, but was ""not in a position to comment further"". Her official spokesman said the coalition ""follows clear and lawful rules of engagement."" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also refused to comment about Jones directly, but said if someone chose to fight for IS they have made themselves a ""legitimate target"" and ""run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile."" Corbyn: UK jihadist should have had trial The secret lives of IS fighters IS's ruined capital city Who are Britainâs jihadists? Jones - who had no previous military training - had been married to the jihadist Junaid Hussain, who waskilled in 2015 in a drone strike. Previously a punk musician, she had been used to recruit western girls to the group and posted threatening messages to Christians in the UK. Jones, who was born in Greenwich, London, also encouraged individuals to carry out attacks in Britain, offering guidance on how to construct home-made bombs. She used her Twitter account to provide practical advice on how to travel to Syria and shared pictures of herself posing with weapons. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The death of Sally-Anne Jones, if confirmed, will make little or no tactical difference to the military fortunes of so-called Islamic State on the battlefield. Despite posing online variously with a Kalashnikov and a pistol, and reportedly ""leading a battalion of jihadist women"", her value to the group was iconic rather than military. But in this role she was definitely judged to be dangerous. Along with her late husband, Junaid Hussain, she maintained a stream of hostile online propaganda aimed at the West. This included luring western female recruits to the self-declared IS caliphate, encouraging attacks in the West and threatening to kill non-Muslims. She is believed to have been involved in planning previous attacks in the West, including a plot to assassinate the Queen and Prince Philip in 2015. There appears to have been no reaction to Jones's reported death from Arabic-speaking online supporters of IS, according to BBC Monitoring, which observes media worldwide. But it said this was typical in such cases. IS never publicly acknowledged Jones - also known as Umm Hussein al-Britaniyah - as a member. Women occasionally feature in IS's official propaganda and only as authors of articles in its monthly publications, BBC Monitoring added. Junaid Hussain was killed in a drone strike in 2015 Jones's husband was a computer hacker for IS and was regarded as a ""high value target"" before his death. In 2015 the then Prime Minister David Cameron said Junaid Hussain had been planning ""barbaric attacks against the West"", including terror plots targeting ""high profile public commemorations"". News of Jones's death has not previously been made public amid fears that her 12-year-old son, Jojo, may also have been killed in the June strike, according to The Sun. BBC correspondent Richard Lister said it was assumed the boy had been killed. Maj Gen Chip Chapman, former MoD head of counter terror, said under UN Charters the boy would be too young to be classed as a soldier and would not have been targeted, ""even if he got up to really bad things"". ""We don't know for sure whether he was with her or not,"" he added. When asked whether Jojo had been killed, the prime minister declined to comment. The image of Sally-Anne Jones (left) was far from the real deal By Ciaran McCauley, BBC News Northern Ireland It's the image that turned Sally-Anne Jones, the British recruiter for the so-called Islamic State, into the ""nun with the gun"". The only problem? It isn't real - and its origins link back to the debut novel of Northern Ireland writer Colin Bateman in 1995. The original image, featuring a nun posing with a gun and a dog, was used on the front cover of his first book Divorcing Jack. The edited version, which is in black and white and has Jones' face superimposed on to the nun's body, is believed to have originated on her Twitter account. Read more about its origins here. Azadeh Moaveni, a journalist and author of the book Lipstick Jihad, told the BBC that Jones had been one of the most ""iconic"" recruiters for IS because she helped the group to project the idea it could ""get into the very reaches of British society"".

Australia defence data in 'extensive' hack,"The theft included details about Australia's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, authorities said Sensitive information about Australia's defence programmes has been stolen in an ""extensive"" cyber hack. About 30GB of data was compromised in the hack on a government contractor, including details about new fighter planes and navy vessels. The data was commercially sensitive but not classified, the government said. It did not know if a state was involved. Australian cyber security officials dubbed the mystery hacker ""Alf"", after a character on TV soap Home and Away. The breach began in July last year, but the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) was not alerted until November. The hacker's identity is not known. ""It could be one of a number of different actors,"" Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday. ""It could be a state actor, [or] a non-state actor. It could be someone who was working for another company."" Mr Pyne said he had been assured the theft was not a risk to national security. The hack was described as ""extensive and extreme"" by ASD incident response manager Mitchell Clarke. It included information about Australia's new A$17bn (Â£10bn; $13bn) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, C130 transport plane and P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, as well as ""a few"" naval vessels, he said. Mr Clarke told a Sydney security conference that the hacker had exploited a weakness in software being used by the government contractor. The software had not been updated for 12 months. The aerospace engineering firm was also using default passwords, he said. N Korea 'hacks US-S Korea war plan' Cyber-threat 'as serious as terrorism' Many cyber-attacks 'a significant threat' ASD officials began repairing the system in December. A report byZDNet,externalsaid officials referred to the months before ASD intervention as ""Alf's mystery happy fun time"". ""For those visitors overseas to Australia, Alf is Alf Stewart from an horrific Australia soap opera called Home and Away. It's just a thing we do,"" Mr Clarke told his audience, according toBuzzFeed,external. The government distanced itself from the Adelaide-based firm, saying it had most likely been employed by another contractor. ""I don't think you can try and sheet blame for a small enterprise having lax cyber security back to the federal government. That is a stretch,"" Mr Pyne said. ""Fortunately, the data that was taken was commercial data, not military data, but it is still very serious and we will get to the bottom of it."" However, he said ""we don't necessarily let the public know"" about the identities of hackers, because such investigations often involve confidential information. The incident was a ""salutary reminder"" about cyber security, he added. Last year, Australia announced asurge in defence spending, a move that reflects concern over military expansion in the region. Military spending would grow by A$29.9bn over 10 years, including plans to buy 72 Joint Strike Fighters, the 2016 Defence White Paper outlined.

Child door finger injuries 'can be lifelong',"Children can seriously injure their fingers in doors Children and toddlers whose fingers are crushed by closing doors can end up with lifelong problems, plastic surgeons are warning. The British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (Bapras) said the injuries in some cases could lead to amputation and long-term pain. They said parents should fit safety catches on all suitable doors at home. About 30,000 children trap their fingers in doors each year and more than 1,500 of them need surgery. The figures are from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. It says more than two million children under 15 have accidents in and around the home every year and require emergency medical care. According to Bapras, self-shutting fire safety doors, car doors and hinges are the top three causes of finger and hand injuries in children. It recommends putting small C-shaped devices made of foam or rubber over doors to prevent them slamming - but these are not suitable for fire doors because they prevent the door from closing. Hinge protectors can also be fitted on most doors. Bapras spokeswoman Anna De Leo, a plastic surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, London, said finger injuries were not a joke. ""The injuries are so serious that the patient would need to undergo a clinic appointment, an X-ray, day surgery, a follow-up nurse appointment and possibly physiotherapy."" And she said the effects could be long-term. ""It's easy to underestimate how important your hands are to doing everyday tasks. ""Injuries to fingers and hands mean tying your shoelaces, typing, holding a mobile phone or eating become a lot more challenging. ""And this is nothing compared to the impact of a finger amputation."" Ms De Leo said people in that situation could also experience elbow pain, migraines and even depression. ""Fingertip injury alone can result in 20% loss of hand strength and can prevent people from pursuing their chosen career,"" she added. In the late 1960s when Jane was about three years old, her older brother was asked to lay the table. ""When he tried to extend the gate leg table, the tip of my right hand ring finger was severed,"" she says. ""Mom picked up the tip and I went to the hospital. ""Apparently I had nine stitches but it didn't reattach so now I no longer have a tip on that finger."" Colin was a toddler when he pulled himself up using the door frame while my friend tried to close the door. ""The door wouldn't close (because my thumb was in the way) so my friend kept on pushing the door. ""It took my Mum a while to work out where I was making all the noise from,"" he says. The doctors wanted to amputate the top half of his thumb but his parents persuaded them not to. Now he has a misshapen but fully-functional tenth digit. ""People only notice it's misshapen if I point it out, which I very rarely do."" Falls from height and burns and scalding result in the most severe injuries Most accidents tend to happen in the kitchen and on the stairs Children under four years old are most prone to accidents Boys are more likely to hurt themselves than girls Poisoning, choking, suffocating, glass-related incidents and strangulation are also common Call to improve toddlers' home safety Schools 'wrapping pupils in cotton wool' The British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents - RoSPA At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Â£20,000 'golden hello' for rural GPs","Newly-qualified GPs are to be offered a one-off payment of Â£20,000 if they start their careers in areas that struggle to attract family doctors. The Â£4m scheme, to be announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, aims to boost the numbers of doctors in rural and coastal areas of England. Mr Hunt said it will help ""reduce the pressure"" on practices in those areas. The Royal College of GPs backed the plan, saying there was a ""serious shortage"" of family doctors. The one-off payment will be offered to 200 GPs from 2018. As of September 2016, there were 41,985 GPs in England. Mr Hunt told the BBC: ""What we're looking to do is to reduce the pressure on those GP practices which are doing a very, very valiant job but can't look after patients as well as they want to, because they're finding it hard to recruit."" The health secretary is due to speak at the Royal College of GPs' annual conference in Liverpool, where he will offer something for those already in the profession too, by announcing plans for flexible working for older doctors - to encourage them to put off retirement. He will also confirm plans for an overseas recruitment office which will aim to attract GPs from countries outside Europe to work in England. ""By introducing targeted support for vulnerable areas and tackling head-on critical issues such as higher indemnity fees and the recruitment and retention of more doctors, we can strengthen and secure general practice for the future,"" he will say. GP practices close in record numbers NHS launches Â£100m drive to recruit foreign GPs The Royal College of GPs said the package must be delivered in full and welcomed the commitment to incentivise working in remote and rural areas. NHS England hasalready pledged an extra Â£2.4bna year for general practice in England - part of which will fund plans for 5,000 extra GPs by 2020. But Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said the government was not on course to reach that target. ""General practice is facing unprecedented pressure from rising workload, stagnating budgets and a workforce crisis,"" he said. ""'Golden hellos' are not a new idea and unlikely to solve the overall workforce crisis given we are failing badly to train enough GPs to meet current demands."" In 2016, the BBC learned that there were some practices in Englandoffering a bonus of up to Â£10,000to attract new doctors. But The Nuffield Trust think tank said recruitment was ""only half the battle"". ""The NHS is struggling to hang on to qualified GPs, with surveys showing 56% plan to retire or leave practice early. Many trainees also drop out when they finish,"" said senior policy fellow Rebecca Rosen.

'I had heart attack at my sister's wedding',"This video can not be played Carly (right) walking down the aisle just moments before her collapse About 10,000 people die each year because bystanders do not know how to do CPR if they see someone in cardiac arrest, the British Heart Foundation says. One woman says she owes her life to people who acted quickly when she collapsed. The photos capture Carly Williams smiling as she walks up the flower-lined aisle as maid of honour at her sister's wedding. But moments later she collapsed without warning and had a cardiac arrest in front of her family, friends and two young sons. Her heart had gone into a dangerously irregular rhythm and stopped beating. Carly, 34, has no memory of her collapse but says she felt totally normal in the lead-up to the ceremony at a central London hotel in July. ""Apparently I said I was dizzy and I thought I might faint. I actually collapsed as soon as I sat down with my head in the other bridesmaid's lap,"" she tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""People realised there was something wrong as I didn't stand for the bride and I started breathing in an irregular way."" Jodie, centre, pictured with Carly to her left and the rest of her bridal party. There were calls for a first aider and ambulance. One of the guests was a childminder who realised Carly's heart had stopped and started performing CPR, helped by her two cousins who had completed a first aid course two weeks earlier. ""The hotel had a defibrillator but the staff had no idea how to use it.  My cousins learned how to use it on the course. They shocked me and it worked - I had a pulse but still wasn't conscious,"" she says. Meanwhile, her sister Jodie - who had been planning her Â£70,000 wedding for a year - had been taken out of the room along with the other guests. ""It was so surreal, like a nightmare,"" she says on looking back and seeing her sister undergo CPR. Carly, pictured holding her daughter Matilda, says she felt totally normal before the ceremony. A cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating.  It causes someone to fall unconscious and stop breathing - unless treated with CPR, it is fatal A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing chest pain and heart damage Fewer than one in 10 people survive a cardiac arrest if they are not in hospital Every minute without CPR or defibrillation reduces someone's survival chances by 10% Just over one in four bystanders do CPR if they see someone in cardiac arrest Source: British Heart Foundation Jodie believes it was lucky that she had chosen the hotel for the venue, just minutes away from St Thomas', a specialist heart hospital. She describes it as ""the best decision I have ever made"". ""I had been feeling very guilty worrying that this was Carly worrying about the wedding that had brought this on. My dad told me my wedding had saved her life,"" she says. Another decision was also crucial. Carly had wanted to return to their hotel room to collect the corsages, but her dad said to leave them. ""It was lucky I didn't go, as my heart might have stopped when I was alone in the room,"" she says. Carly was taken to hospital where she was put in an induced coma. Jodie said all she wanted to do was get out of her gown and see her - so they called off the wedding, sending the 115 guests home. ""I expected it to be the best day of my life but it was the worst. I felt like I was about to fall off the edge of the world."" Carly emerged from the coma within 24 hours. A few days later she asked if the wedding had gone ahead and felt ""really bad"" when Jodie explained what had happened. Carly has been fitted with a defibrillator called an S-ICD in case her heart fails again. ""We were so excited about the wedding - but she didn't mind at all. The chances of this happening in a room with three first aid-trained people and a defibrillator are so slim that actually I was lucky that it did,"" she says. Carly has had a device fitted called an S-ICD, a defibrillator that she describes as ""insurance"" in case it happens again. ""My heart is now doing its normal thing - but they don't know why it happened,"" she says. The sisters are campaigning with the British Heart Foundation for more people to learn how to do CPR and use defibrillators as part of its Restart a Heart campaign - which will see 150,000 people learn CPR on 16 October. And Jodie says she still wants to get married, once Carly is well enough. ""I still feel traumatised and get upset by it,"" she says. ""My big worry on the day was the kids not walking down the aisle on their own. It's hard to believe that worried me now - health is all that matters,"" she says.

Why did online bots wish Putin a happy birthday?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured on holiday in Siberia in August When President Vladimir Putin turned 65 on 7 October, he was not short of online well-wishers. But how many were real? A hashtag which translates as ""Happy Birthday President,external"" began trending in early that day in Russia. One of the most popular tweets using this tag is: The hashtag translates as ""Happy Birthday President"", and the caption on the photo of the bear says ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), High five! Happy B-day!"" While the tweet was shared more than 800 times, none of those sharing it appear to be Russian speakers. They also seemed to lack the personality of an individual, were often advertising services, and with account information containing frequent typos. ""We are a professional photo servic in Vicoria an on Vancouver Island"" (sic) said one. Another described themselves as a ""Maria Arts Mrketing Guru"" (also sic). Several also contained sexually explicit content. The @vitischeg profile also raises suspicions. The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time. The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov. While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad. This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets,RT,externalandSputnik,external. The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots How pro-Russian trolls tried to destroy me Tops off for #PutinShirtlessChallenge Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared thepresidential well-wishing hashtag,externalalso raised suspicions. This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character. Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots. The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year. Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!"" Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative. ""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending. ""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands. ""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat. ""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time. The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov. While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad. This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets,RT,externalandSputnik,external. The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots How pro-Russian trolls tried to destroy me Tops off for #PutinShirtlessChallenge Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared thepresidential well-wishing hashtag,externalalso raised suspicions. This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character. Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots. The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year. Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!"" Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative. ""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending. ""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands. ""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat. ""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

Ninety children taken into care every day,"Ninety children are being taken into care every day in England and Wales and it's claimed social workers are ""firefighting"" the most serious cases late into the night. Prof Ray Jones, who works in social services improvement, says staff fear children slip through the net as they try to keep up with rising pressures. Latest government figures show 32,810 children were taken into care in 2017. Ministers said extra money was being targeted towards improving services. The total number of children in care is a record 72,670 - up 3% on 2016. Council bosses, who are responsible for child protection services, say it's the biggest rise in seven years. The Local Government Association, which is taking part in a conference on care services in Bournemouth, says it comes as children's services face a Â£2bn a year funding gap by 2020. Prof Jones said: ""What I am hearing from social workers is that they are having to spend most of the time 'firefighting' with the most serious concerns that get presented to them. ""They are spending a lot of time, including late into the night and at weekends, preparing for court proceedings. ""They are also having to close down work very quickly where the child is not an immediate concern. ""The consequence of that is the considerable stress they feel over concerns that they may be missing something."" He added: ""Secondly, something that social workers are telling me is that they are closing down cases very quickly or even turning them away. ""And they are not able to work through potential cases where children are unhappy and distressed, because they are having to concentrate on cases where there is an immediate danger."" But the figures continue a longer trend of rising numbers of children facing severe need in terms of child protection. Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board, said: ""Children's services are at a tipping point with growing demand for support combining with ongoing council funding pressures to become unsustainable. ""Last year saw the biggest rise in the number of children in care for seven years. ""With 90 children coming into care every day, our calls for urgent funding to support these children and invest in children and their families are becoming increasingly urgent."" Robert Goodwill, Minister for Children and Families, said councils would receive more than Â£200bn for local services, including children's social care, up to 2020. ""This is part of a historic four-year settlement, which means councils can plan ahead with certainty. ""All children deserve the best possible support. And while some councils are doing excellent work, we want to help ensure more local authorities provide good and outstanding services.""

Ten charged for fraternity hazing death,"Maxwell Gruver died from excessive alcohol consumption, a coroner ruled Louisiana police have announced arrest warrants for 10 people accused of a role in forcing a university student to drink himself to death last month. All the suspects are affiliated with the social club that police say 18-year-old Maxwell Gruver was attempting to join when he died. One Louisiana State University student is charged with negligent homicide and nine others are charged with hazing. Police believe Gruver died after a fraternity ritual called ""Bible study"". According to a police affidavit, on the night of 13 September, Gruver had been forced to drink during a Phi Delta Theta initiation each time he incorrectly answered questions about the university's all-male club. Gruver died of ""acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration"", according to a post-mortem examination by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner. The Georgia-native had a blood alcohol level that was over six times the legal limit for driving. Manslaughter charges dropped in fraternity hazing case ""Today's arrests underscore that the ramifications of hazing can be devastating,"" said university president F King Alexander on Wednesday. ""Maxwell Gruver's family will mourn his loss for the rest of their lives, and several other students are now facing serious consequences - all due to a series of poor decisions,"" he continued. One suspect, Matthew Naquin, is charged with negligent homicide, which could carry a five-year prison sentence. The others face charges of hazing, which carry a 10-30 day jail sentence: Matthew Alexander Naquin, 19, of Texas Elliott Eaton, 20, of Louisiana Patrick Forde, 20, Massachusetts Sean Paul Gott, 21, of Louisiana Zachary Hall, 21, of North Carolina Hudson Kirkpatrick, 19, of Louisiana Sean Pennison, 21, of Louisiana Nicholas Taulli, 19, of Texas Ryan Isto, 18, of Canada Zachary Castillo All 10 suspects are affiliated with the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, but two are not currently enrolled at the school. The charges now go to a grand jury, which will determine if there is enough evidence to warrant a criminal trial. In September, a judge in Pennsylvania dismissed all the serious charges that had been filed against Pennsylvania State University fraternity membersafter a student there died during an initiation event.

Diplomats owe Â£105m in congestion charges,"The US embassy owes the most in congestion charges Foreign diplomats owe more than Â£105m in congestion charges in London, the foreign secretary has said. The US embassy owes the highest amount - Â£11.5m - in congestion zone fees, which were incurred between the charge's introduction in 2003 and December 2016. In 2016, 4,311 parking fines had been issued to embassies, totalling at least Â£430,126, the Foreign Office said. After payments and some amounts that were waived, Â£327,962 remains unpaid. In a written ministerial statement,external, Boris Johnson said the Foreign Office had held meetings with ""a number of missions"" about the outstanding debts. There has been a longstanding dispute over the US embassy's bill because the Americans treat the congestion charge as a tax, so diplomats need not pay it. Mr Johnson said the issue of unpaid fines was raised in introductory meeting with all new ambassadors and high commissioners and officials also pressed the matter. He said: ""In April this year, Protocol Directorate wrote to diplomatic missions and international organisations concerned giving them the opportunity to either pay their outstanding debts, or appeal against specific fines if they considered that they had been issued incorrectly."" US - Â£ 11,544,455 Japan - Â£ 7,629,370 Nigeria - Â£ 6,481,620 Russia - Â£ 5,603,320 India - Â£ 4,991,125 It was also revealed that, in 2016, 12 ""serious and significant offences"" had allegedly been committed by people entitled to diplomatic immunity. These were defined as crimes that could carry at least a 12-month prison sentence. Eight of the 12 offences were driving related, including drinking and driving and driving without insurance. Three offences - actual bodily harm, possession of a class-B drug with intent to supply, and possession of an offensive weapon - were allegedly committed by a Libyan diplomat. An offence of sexual assault had been recorded against someone employed by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, the ministerial statement said. The government said most of the 22,500 people entitled to diplomatic immunity in the UK abided by the law. ""The number of alleged serious crimes committed by members of the diplomatic community in the UK is proportionately low,"" Mr Johnson said.
