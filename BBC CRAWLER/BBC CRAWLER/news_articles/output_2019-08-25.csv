Trump: UK is losing the 'anchor round its ankle',"This video can not be played The G7 leaders and some of their spouses posed for a ""family photo"" after a day of talks President Trump has promised a ""very big trade deal"" with the UK, saying its departure from the EU will be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". Mr Trump was speaking after a breakfast meeting with Mr Johnson at the G7 summit in Biarritz in France. But Mr Johnson said the US must open up its markets if a post-Brexit trade deal is to be agreed. ""I don't think we sell a single joint of British lamb in the United States, we don't sell any beef,"" the PM said. Mr Johnson's breakfast meeting came before a day of discussions with other world leaders at the summit. The PM also met European Council President Donald Tusk, a day after the two men clashedover who would be held responsible for a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Speaking to reporters after the working breakfast, Mr Trump said a deal with the UK would happen ""quickly"". ""We're going to do a very big trade deal, bigger than we've ever had with the UK,"" he said. ""And now at some point they won't have the obstacle, they won't have the anchor around their ankle, because that's what they have."" Mr Johnson told Mr Trump: ""Talking of the anchor, Donald, what we want is for our ships to take freight, say, from New York to Boston, which for the moment they're not able to do."" In a later interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson said agreeing any trade deals with the US within a year ""would be tight"". ""My own experience of the way Americans work, the size and complexity of the deal we want to do probably means we won't be able to do within a year. When asked if it could take five years, he replied: ""No, we'll do it faster than that. ""We need to do it fast, but to get the whole thing done from soup to nuts within a year is going to be a big ask."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with leaders at the annual G7 summit on Sunday Before his talks with the US President, Mr Johnson spoke about ""massive opportunities for the UK to prise open the American market"". As a member of the European Union, the UK cannot make its own trade deals with other countries - and the EU does not have a free trade deal with the US. The UK has already agreed 13 ""continuity"" deals with 38 countries that will apply post-Brexit. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Trump adviser 'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accord What trade deals has the UK done so far? Offering an example of an American trade restriction, Mr Johnson said: ""Melton Mowbray pork pies, which are sold in Thailand and in Iceland, are currently unable to enter the US market because of, I don't know, some sort of food and drug administration restriction."" He continued: ""UK bell peppers cannot get into the US market at all. ""Wine shipments are heavily restricted. If you want to export wine made in England to the US you have to go through a US distributor. ""There is a tax on British micro-breweries in the US that doesn't apply to US micro-breweries in the UK."" The government added that tariffs on some UK goods in the US can reach up to 28% for fashion, 15% for machinery and 35% for food and drink. Donald and Melania Trump arrived in France for the G7 summit on Saturday David Henig, the UK director of the European Centre For International Political Economy, said the US ""would be loathe"" to get rid of the barriers intended to protect US producers. He added: ""The US is quite protectionist - the US have never done a trade deal the likes of which Mr Johnson is describing. ""The question is whether the US is prepared to give the UK something and what we would have to give them in return. ""It is less clear what Trump wants in terms of trade altogether."" In June, Mr Trump made comments that theNHS ""was on the table"" in US-UK trade deal- but laterrowed back on his remarks. At the G7 summit Mr Johnson was asked if he had made it clear the NHS was not on the table. He replied: ""Not only have I made clear of that, the president has made that very, very clear. There is complete unanimity on that point."" Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other. Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling. Last month,President Trump saidtalks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK were already under way. He said a bilateral post-Brexit deal could lead to a ""three to four, five times"" increase in current trade - but provided no details about how that would be achieved. However, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said a UK-US trade dealwould not get through Congressif Brexit undermined the Good Friday Agreement. Ms Pelosi said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to endanger the 1998 Irish peace deal, which the US helped facilitate. What is the Good Friday Agreement?

ScotRail under fire after major weekend disruption,"Louise Kerr said she ""couldn't breathe"" on the train she travelled on from Edinburgh ScotRail has come under fire from angry passengers amid major disruption to services to and from Edinburgh on Saturday night. People travelling from Waverley and Haymarket complained that services were cancelled and trains were ""dangerously overcrowded"". Transport Scotland said the problems were ""unacceptable"" and that the ScotRail Alliance was carrying out an immediate investigation. ScotRail has apologised. The rail firm said it did all that it could to meet demand on an extremely busy evening. It was the last weekend of the Edinburgh festivals and Murrayfield hosted an international rugby match. Rail services improve after remedial notice ScotRail unveils improvement plan Thousands of trains axed due to lack of staff Scores of passengers have taken to Twitter to criticise the ScotRail, claiming they failed to plan for the busy weekend. BBC Scotland has also received many messages from people caught up in the chaotic scenes at stations and on board trains. Transport union TSSA called on Michael Matheson, Scotland's transport secretary, to launch an inquiry into the issue. A Transport Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Ministers are taking this matter very seriously and are quite clear that last night's incidents are unacceptable. ""The ScotRail Alliance is already carrying out an immediate investigation into what occurred to provide answers as soon as possible."" Allow Twitter content?

Passenger Gill Craig said a number of trains to Glasgow Queen Street from Edinburgh Waverley were cancelled before she was finally able to board. ""Levels of overcrowding on the platforms and on the trains were dangerously high,"" she said. ""Surely ScotRail could have anticipated that the last Saturday of the Festival/Fringe and a rugby international would have required extra trains? ""How could two trains between Edinburgh and Glasgow, which should have been at least seven coaches long, be cancelled at such short notice? ""The public need answers. We need to be confident that this dangerous situation will not happen again."" Gillian Broderick said her two children were crushed against the train door when they arrived a Haymarket and people tried to get onboard. ""They could see there was no room but would not be deterred,"" she said. ""Verbal abuse, physical abuse, bags pushed into my children's faces. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from people who showed no concern for the safety of others including children and babies. ""Station staff couldn't do anything. Police were nowhere to be seen."" She said she eventually pushed the emergency button as she did not her children in such a ""powder keg"" environment. They got a taxi home. ""I will definitely rethink taking my family on the train in the future,"" she added. Lesley Eadie took this photograph on delayed late night service from Edinburgh Waverley to Glasgow Queen Street Lesley Eadie told the BBC Scotland website that passengers were ""packed like sardines"" on her train from Edinburgh Waverley to Glasgow Queen Street. At one point she saw passengers pass a baby along the carriage, from the child's father to his mother. ""The family had sat down and the dad took the child - who was maybe 18 months or two years old - to the toilet,"" she said. ""When they got out the train was so packed, he couldn't get back to his seat. ""The passengers were just passing this baby back to his mother."" Trying to get to Glasgow from Edinburgh at 21:30, I realised I'd never get space on a train at Haymarket, so I took a train back down the line to Waverley. The station was heaving with Fringe and Festival-goers, boozed up youths after a warm day's lager consumption, and many Murrayfield stragglers. Rail staff refused to give platform allocations for fear, one told me, of too many people crowding platforms. There was tension, and that sense of risk when crowd behaviour feels unpredictable. As Fife trains were cancelled, I heard people heading for the taxis. When I finally got a train, there was a stramash between people trying to get onto the next carriage. That brought an admirably quick rail staff and police response. I was pressed against the door with another 19 people standing in the door area. This was the slow train through Caldercruix and Coatbridge Sunnyside, stopping 19 times before Glasgow. At least we got some fresh air at each stop. And then a very long taxi queue, so it was the night bus for me. I arrived home two hours later than planned. Another passenger, Jill Davis, told BBC Scotland she was concerned for safety on the train home to Glasgow. ""It was really dangerously, dangerously overcrowded,"" she said. ""There were children standing, I had my bike with me. It was just awful - really, really terrible."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Harry Fisher said staff were shouting at passengers to move further along the carriages of his train to Aberdeen - despite the fact there was nowhere to go. ""They didn't care, just shouted louder,"" he said. ""They were incredibly aggressive and had actually lost the plot. I had to stand until Dundee. I'm 64, a chap next to me was 74. We were both fit enough to stand, but still..."" The experience has led to questions about the maximum number of passengers train operators are allowed to carry in carriages. ScotRail told BBC Scotland: ""While there's no legal limit on the number of passengers that can travel in a carriage, we wouldn't let services operate unless it was safe to do so."" One passenger found an unconventional place to rest his head on board a crowded train At the height of the disruption ScotRail was encouraging people travelling from Edinburgh city centre to consider making alternative arrangements. A spokesman for the firm said: ""We're sorry to our customers who experienced disruption and busy services yesterday. ""We do all that we can to meet demand.

"A Brexit deal is now 'touch and go', says Johnson","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In the last few days there's been a sort of dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals"" Boris Johnson has said the chances of a Brexit deal are ""touch and go"" - having previously said the odds of a no-deal Brexit were ""a million to one"". In a BBC interview at the G7 summit in France, he said it ""all depends on our EU friends and partners"". When pressed on the chances, he said: ""I think it's going to be touch and go. But the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal."" Donald Tusk told the PM the EU is open to alternatives to the backstop. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the European Council president and Mr Johnson held talks on Sunday, which were in a ""genuinely positive atmosphere"". But she said Mr Tusk repeated the EU's position that any alternatives to the Irish backstop would have to be ""realistic"" and ""immediately operational"". An EU official added the meeting had ""mainly restated known positions"" and Brussels had been hoping for ""new elements to unblock the situation"". Mr Johnson and Mr Tusk discussed the possibility of meeting again in New York The two menclashed on Saturdayover who would be ""Mr No Deal"" - the person to blame in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has previously said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"", but that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". Asked if people would still be able to get their medicine if there was a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told the BBC: ""That is certainly a guarantee that we can make."" But he added: ""I do not want at this stage to say there won't be unforeseen difficulties."" Trump: UK is losing 'anchor round its ankle' Tusk and Johnson clash over who is 'Mr No Deal' Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Speaking at the G7 summit on Sunday, he reiterated his desire to scrap the backstop from the current withdrawal agreement, saying it could keep the UK ""locked in"" EU rules, if a trade deal is not agreed after Brexit. He said: ""I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK."" Mr Johnson said he was an ""optimist"" and thought the EU would understand there is an ""opportunity to do a deal"". The PM also said if there is no deal, the UK would keep a ""very substantial"" part of the Â£39bn Theresa May had agreed to pay the EU in her withdrawal agreement. The G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Johnson and other world leaders have gathered for the G7 summit in Biarritz, France Mrs May struck a withdrawal agreement with the EU - the so-called ""divorce deal"" - but British MPs rejected the deal three times. Mr Johnson wants to remove the Irish backstop from the deal but the EU has consistently ruled this out, saying it will not renegotiate the agreement. If implemented, the backstop - a last resort should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit - would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. This week German ChancellorAngela Merkel suggested there could be an alternativeto the backstop but the onus was on the UK to find it. But the next day French President Emmanuel Macron said the backstop was""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Also on Sunday, the PM met President Donald Trump to discuss a trade deal between the UK and the US. Mr Johnson said the US's aim to strike a deal within a year was ""going to be tight"", adding: ""These [Americans] are tough guys."" Meanwhile, former chancellor Philip Hammond has written to the PM about theleaked Operation Yellowhammer documents on preparations for a no-deal Brexit. He said it was now apparent the document was dated August 2019, and therefore could not have been leaked by a minister from Mrs May's government.

Guy Fawkes and Oliver Cromwell 'heads' stolenA model of Sir Thomas More was also taken from London Bridge Experience.,"This video can not be played CCTV shows the man pulling the heads down using a rope before walking away with them Model heads of Guy Fawkes, Oliver Cromwell and Sir Thomas More have been stolen from the front of a London tourist attraction. They were taken from the entrance of the London Bridge Experience on Saturday morning. A man was captured on CCTV using a rope to tug the figures down before walking away with Fawkes's head under his arm. The attraction is offering Â£400 for help to find the models, saying: ""We just want our heads back."" The three heads were installed on spikes above the entrance to the London Bridge Experience The custom-made heads were part of a recently-installed entrance at the attraction, which tells the ""dark history of London Bridge"". The real heads of Fawkes, Sir Thomas and Cromwell were all thought to have previously been put on display on the bridge. In the CCTV footage, the man can be seen kicking Fawkes's head off a spike and walking away with it in his hands and the other two in a bag. The thief used a rope to tug the figures down James Kislingbury, director of the London Bridge Experience, said the thief had caused significant damage to the entrance. ""We just want our heads back,"" he said. The Met Police said it believed the theft took place between 22:00 BST on Friday and 08:00 BST on Saturday. No arrests have been made.

What is the UK doing to get ready for no deal?,"The government has released an assessment of the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on the UK, after MPs demanded that it be made public. The document, marked as ""Official Sensitive"" and dated 2 August 2019,outlines a series of ""reasonable worst-case planning assumptions"". It was drawn up as part of ""Operation Yellowhammer"" - the name for the government's contingency plan to prepare for leaving the European Union (EU) without a deal. The government says it is spending an extra Â£2.1bn on no-deal planning and is updating these planning assumptions. So, what does the document say and what is being done - as far as we know - to prepare for no-deal? What Yellowhammer document says: Between 50-85% of UK lorries travelling to the EU may not be ready for French customs Lack of readiness and limited space in French ports could cut HGV traffic by 40-60% and lead to disruption lasting three months This would lead to significant queues in Kent. In a worst-case scenario, it could take lorries up to two-and-a-half days before being able to cross into France What's being done: To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day. To prevent nearby roads from clogging up, the government has a traffic management plan codenamed Operation Brock. If the plan is activated, up to 2,000 lorries will be held in a queue leading to the port. Other traffic will be kept flowing around the queued-up lorries, in what is known as a contraflow system. A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile  M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. But there is a still a lot of confusion, according to Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association. ""The report shows there's still significant detail to be clarified if Britain is to keep trading efficiently,"" she says. ""Businesses can only prepare for, and implement, new processes once, and still need confirmation of what they are to adopt in the way of new practices."" What Yellowhammer document says: Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease Key ingredients may be in shorter supply There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK, but may be reduced availability and choice Prices may increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" What's being done: The government has said that it will continue to recognise EU standards for food being imported into the UK, to minimise disruption. The British Retail Consortium has said,externalretailers are doing all they can to prepare for no-deal, but will not be able to prevent all negative effects. It stresses that many fresh fruits and vegetables will be out of season in the UK and that there will be a shortage of warehouse space ahead of Christmas. ""No deal Brexit would be extremely disruptive to the supply chains that we operate, particularly the fresh food supply chains,"" Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC News. ""There will inevitably be disruption simply because we've never done this before,"" he added, although he also said that previous delays to the Brexit date mean ""there's probably more understanding of what could go wrong and therefore more contingency planning"". Another factor is what tariffs (the taxes on imports) will be charged on food coming into the UK. The governmentpublished a ""tariff schedule"",externalin March, which removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit That means some food from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper, but some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive. What Yellowhammer document says: Supply chains for medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at the Channel ports While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because they have a short shelf life It will not be practical to stockpile products to cover expected delays of up to six months An increase in inflation would ""significantly impact"" adult social care providers and may lead to some failing, with smaller providers impacted within two-three months. What's being done: At the end of June, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) started putting out contracts for freight, warehouse space and fridges. These will be used to stockpile medicines and fly in those which cannot be stored, like radioisotopes for cancer treatment. Of the Â£2.1bn pledged for no-deal preparations, Â£434m has been set aside for this. That includes a Â£25m contract for planes to bring in emergency medical supplies within 24 hours. Ahead of the UK's original departure date of 29 March - then extended to 12 April - the DHSC said thousands of medicines had been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU. Suppliers stockpiled an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual ""buffer"" stock. This exercise is being repeated to ensure the department is ""as prepared for leaving the EU without a deal in October as it was on 29 March and 12 April"". Specific ferry routes were made available for suppliers to book onto 11 weeks before the no-deal deadline in March. Six weeks before the 31 October deadline, the government had only just opened the bidding process to freight firms competing to transport medicines. So the pharmaceutical industry doesn't currently know which ports and ferry routes will be made available. Steve Bates, an industry official working with government on no-deal planning, said the time frame to make sure everything was in place for the October deadline was ""significantly compressed"". He said the difference for drug suppliers between three months and potentially three weeks to put plans into action was ""material"". On social care, the government website advises providers to draw up contingency plans and support EU staff who may be working for them. Plans are in place to ensure there are enough essential medicines like insulin What Yellowhammer document says: There will be no immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies However, there are likely to be significant price rises if the UK splits from the EU single energy market, which could happen months or years after Brexit This could lead to some energy companies leaving the market Public water supplies are likely to remain largely unaffected What's being done: In the event of no-deal, the UK has said it will not impose tariffs on electricity and gas coming into the country. However, if the value of the pound falls in response to a no-deal Brexit, it will become more expensive to import energy from abroad. The government intends to remain part of the single energy market, in order for the UK's energy laws to continue to work after Brexit and that supplies are not disrupted. Water is unlikely to be affected, although there is still a low risk in the event of a chemical supply problem. The Yellowhammer report says water companies are well-prepared and have significant stockpiles of critical chemicals. What Yellowhammer document says: The government's planned short-term solution for the border is likely to be unsustainable because of the ""economic, legal and biosecurity risks"" it presents Trade between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be ""severely disrupted"" Some businesses will stop trading, some will move and some will experience higher costs that they may pass on to customers Agriculture will be hardest hit, leading to job losses, protests and direct action with road blockages Growth of the ""illegitimate economy"" around the border ""where criminal and dissident groups already operate"" What's being done: The UK government has said it is committed not to have any physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On 13 Marchit published its contingency plan,externalto avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would not bring in new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland, in the event of no-deal. But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer-term solutions. Government has no plans for Irish border controls To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself, but it has not specified exactly where they will take place. It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market. The Irish government says it is securing additional space, and has recruited more customs and agriculture staff to allow for a ""significant increase in checks and procedures"".

Guy Fawkes and Oliver Cromwell 'heads' stolen,"This video can not be played CCTV shows the man pulling the heads down using a rope before walking away with them Model heads of Guy Fawkes, Oliver Cromwell and Sir Thomas More have been stolen from the front of a London tourist attraction. They were taken from the entrance of the London Bridge Experience on Saturday morning. A man was captured on CCTV using a rope to tug the figures down before walking away with Fawkes's head under his arm. The attraction is offering Â£400 for help to find the models, saying: ""We just want our heads back."" The three heads were installed on spikes above the entrance to the London Bridge Experience The custom-made heads were part of a recently-installed entrance at the attraction, which tells the ""dark history of London Bridge"". The real heads of Fawkes, Sir Thomas and Cromwell were all thought to have previously been put on display on the bridge. In the CCTV footage, the man can be seen kicking Fawkes's head off a spike and walking away with it in his hands and the other two in a bag. The thief used a rope to tug the figures down James Kislingbury, director of the London Bridge Experience, said the thief had caused significant damage to the entrance. ""We just want our heads back,"" he said. The Met Police said it believed the theft took place between 22:00 BST on Friday and 08:00 BST on Saturday. No arrests have been made.

3D scanners could end airport liquid restrictions,"Several US airports have already installed 3D scanning equipment All major UK airports must introduce 3D baggage screening equipment before the end of 2022, the government says. Ministers say the technology will boost security, speed up pre-boarding checks, and could end the restrictions on travelling with liquids and laptops. The equipment, similar to CT scanners used in hospitals, is already being installed at London's Heathrow Airport. It provides a clearer picture of a bag's contents, which staff can zoom in to and rotate for inspection. Could your face be your passport? Could space-age scanner cut airport queues? Currently, passengers taking liquid in their cabin baggage are restricted to containers holding no more than 100ml, which must be shown to security staff in a single, transparent, resealable plastic bag of about 20cm (8in) x 20cm. The limits have been in place since November 2006. Their introduction ended a ban on liquids in the cabin imposed three months earlier, when British police said they had foiled a plot to blow up as many as 10 planes using explosives hidden in drinks bottles. Announcing the new plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the scanners would cut down on ""hassle"" for travellers and improve security. ""By making journeys through UK airports easier than ever, this new equipment will help boost the vital role our airports play in securing the UK's position as a global hub for trade, tourism and investment,"" he added. Heathrow has revealed it is spending Â£50m in order to roll out the technology over the next few years. It is the first UK airport to install the equipment, which it has been trialling since 2017. The airport's chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would make travel ""less disruptive"", adding that the scanners were able to see what liquid was contained in luggage. The scanners are set to be rolled out to other UK airports over the next few years. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new equipment means ""no more pulling out your socks and your underwear, and having to separate your liquids and and take your laptops out"". He added that aviation companies would be paying for the changes, rather than the taxpayer. The technology is already being used by US airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson and Chicago's O'Hare.

"No-deal Brexit is now 'touch and go', says Johnson","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In the last few days there's been a sort of dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals"" Boris Johnson has said the chances of a Brexit deal are ""touch and go"" - having previously said the odds of a no-deal Brexit were ""a million to one"". In a BBC interview at the G7 summit in France, he said it ""all depends on our EU friends and partners"". When pressed on the chances, he said: ""I think it's going to be touch and go. But the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal."" Donald Tusk told the PM the EU is open to alternatives to the backstop. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the European Council president and Mr Johnson held talks on Sunday, which were in a ""genuinely positive atmosphere"". But she said Mr Tusk repeated the EU's position that any alternatives to the Irish backstop would have to be ""realistic"" and ""immediately operational"". An EU official added the meeting had ""mainly restated known positions"" and Brussels had been hoping for ""new elements to unblock the situation"". Mr Johnson and Mr Tusk discussed the possibility of meeting again in New York The two menclashed on Saturdayover who would be ""Mr No Deal"" - the person to blame in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has previously said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"", but that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". Asked if people would still be able to get their medicine if there was a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told the BBC: ""That is certainly a guarantee that we can make."" But he added: ""I do not want at this stage to say there won't be unforeseen difficulties."" Trump: UK is losing 'anchor round its ankle' Tusk and Johnson clash over who is 'Mr No Deal' Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Speaking at the G7 summit on Sunday, he reiterated his desire to scrap the backstop from the current withdrawal agreement, saying it could keep the UK ""locked in"" EU rules, if a trade deal is not agreed after Brexit. He said: ""I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK."" Mr Johnson said he was an ""optimist"" and thought the EU would understand there is an ""opportunity to do a deal"". The PM also said if there is no deal, the UK would keep a ""very substantial"" part of the Â£39bn Theresa May had agreed to pay the EU in her withdrawal agreement. The G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Johnson and other world leaders have gathered for the G7 summit in Biarritz, France Mrs May struck a withdrawal agreement with the EU - the so-called ""divorce deal"" - but British MPs rejected the deal three times. Mr Johnson wants to remove the Irish backstop from the deal but the EU has consistently ruled this out, saying it will not renegotiate the agreement. If implemented, the backstop - a last resort should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit - would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. This week German ChancellorAngela Merkel suggested there could be an alternativeto the backstop but the onus was on the UK to find it. But the next day French President Emmanuel Macron said the backstop was""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Also on Sunday, the PM met President Donald Trump to discuss a trade deal between the UK and the US. Mr Johnson said the US's aim to strike a deal within a year was ""going to be tight"", adding: ""These [Americans] are tough guys."" Meanwhile, former chancellor Philip Hammond has written to the PM about theleaked Operation Yellowhammer documents on preparations for a no-deal Brexit. He said it was now apparent the document was dated August 2019, and therefore could not have been leaked by a minister from Mrs May's government.

Tusk - Johnson clash over 'Mr No Deal',"This video can not be played Donald Tusk at the G7: I hope Boris Johnson will not want to go down in history as Mr No Deal European Council President Donald Tusk and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have clashed over who would be to blame in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Tusk said Mr Johnson risked being remembered as ""Mr No Deal"" - but the PM responded by saying it was Mr Tusk who would become ""Mr No-Deal Brexit"". The pair are due to meet for talks at the G7 summit in France on Sunday. Mr Tusk added the EU was ""willing to listen"" to the PM's ideas for Brexit - as long as they are ""realistic"". But speaking at his press conference in Biarritz, Mr Tusk said he would ""not co-operate on [a] no-deal"". Since becoming PM, Mr Johnson hassaid the UK will leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has repeatedly stated he would prefer to leave the EU with a deal, but insists the backstop - the insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - must be removed from the withdrawal agreement. ""I've made it absolutely clear I don't want no deal and that we've got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty and if Mr Tusk doesn't want to go down as Mr No-Deal Brexit I hope that point will be borne in mind too,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Tusk had used the same moniker when talking about Mr Johnson. ""I still hope Prime Minister Johnson will not like to go down in history as Mr No Deal,"" he said. ""The EU has always been open to co-operation. One thing I will not co-operate on is a no deal. ""We are willing to listen to ideas that are operational, realistic and acceptable to all EU member states."" Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When Boris Johnson met President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel this week, he got a relatively positive response. Both leaders indicated they were willing to listen to any ideas the prime minister may have to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But Mr Johnson's meeting with Donald Tusk at the G7 summit on Sunday may now prove more problematic. The spat between both men - both of them warning they could go down in history as Mr No Deal - shows that both sides are engaged in a blame game. Neither side wishes to be seen as the intransigent partner in a negotiation that leads to no deal. Mr Macron and Ms Merkel were implicit in this, while Mr Tusk was explicit, prompting an equally blunt response from Mr Johnson. It is, of course, still possible that some political space may be carved out to allow for a compromise at the last minute. But all the signs still point towards a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. The G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Johnson wants to renegotiate the Irish backstop - a key Brexit sticking point - but the EU has consistently ruled this out. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Johnson said: ""We've made it very clear we won't be instituting any kind of checks or controls at the Northern Irish border. We don't think such controls are necessary. ""There are a large range of alternative arrangements - these we will be discussing in the coming weeks."" Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? What is the G7 and what does it do? Trump-Johnson relationship 'will be sensational' If implemented, the backstop - a last resort should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit - would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. At a news conference on Wednesday with Mr Johnson,German Chancellor Merkel suggestedan alternative to the backstop might be achievable, adding that the onus was on the UK. Boris Johnson met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Presidential Palace this week But the next day French President Macronsaid the backstop was ""indispensable""to preserving political stability and the single market. After visiting his counterparts in Paris and Berlin this week, Mr Johnson said there was ""new mood music"", butreaching a new dealwould not be ""a cinch"". He has insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, whether or not a new deal is reached. Mr Johnson will also meet with US President Donald Trump, who arrived in France around Saturday lunchtime. Asked if he would be telling Mr Trump not to escalatethe US-China trade war,Mr Johnson said: ""You bet."" He added one of his priorities for the summit was ""the state of global trade"".

Trump: UK is losing the 'anchor round its ankle'Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump talk Brexit over breakfast during the G7 summit in France.UK Politics,"This video can not be played The G7 leaders and some of their spouses posed for a ""family photo"" after a day of talks President Trump has promised a ""very big trade deal"" with the UK, saying its departure from the EU will be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". Mr Trump was speaking after a breakfast meeting with Mr Johnson at the G7 summit in Biarritz in France. But Mr Johnson said the US must open up its markets if a post-Brexit trade deal is to be agreed. ""I don't think we sell a single joint of British lamb in the United States, we don't sell any beef,"" the PM said. Mr Johnson's breakfast meeting came before a day of discussions with other world leaders at the summit. The PM also met European Council President Donald Tusk, a day after the two men clashedover who would be held responsible for a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Speaking to reporters after the working breakfast, Mr Trump said a deal with the UK would happen ""quickly"". ""We're going to do a very big trade deal, bigger than we've ever had with the UK,"" he said. ""And now at some point they won't have the obstacle, they won't have the anchor around their ankle, because that's what they have."" Mr Johnson told Mr Trump: ""Talking of the anchor, Donald, what we want is for our ships to take freight, say, from New York to Boston, which for the moment they're not able to do."" In a later interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson said agreeing any trade deals with the US within a year ""would be tight"". ""My own experience of the way Americans work, the size and complexity of the deal we want to do probably means we won't be able to do within a year. When asked if it could take five years, he replied: ""No, we'll do it faster than that. ""We need to do it fast, but to get the whole thing done from soup to nuts within a year is going to be a big ask."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with leaders at the annual G7 summit on Sunday Before his talks with the US President, Mr Johnson spoke about ""massive opportunities for the UK to prise open the American market"". As a member of the European Union, the UK cannot make its own trade deals with other countries - and the EU does not have a free trade deal with the US. The UK has already agreed 13 ""continuity"" deals with 38 countries that will apply post-Brexit. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Trump adviser 'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accord What trade deals has the UK done so far? Offering an example of an American trade restriction, Mr Johnson said: ""Melton Mowbray pork pies, which are sold in Thailand and in Iceland, are currently unable to enter the US market because of, I don't know, some sort of food and drug administration restriction."" He continued: ""UK bell peppers cannot get into the US market at all. ""Wine shipments are heavily restricted. If you want to export wine made in England to the US you have to go through a US distributor. ""There is a tax on British micro-breweries in the US that doesn't apply to US micro-breweries in the UK."" The government added that tariffs on some UK goods in the US can reach up to 28% for fashion, 15% for machinery and 35% for food and drink. Donald and Melania Trump arrived in France for the G7 summit on Saturday David Henig, the UK director of the European Centre For International Political Economy, said the US ""would be loathe"" to get rid of the barriers intended to protect US producers. He added: ""The US is quite protectionist - the US have never done a trade deal the likes of which Mr Johnson is describing. ""The question is whether the US is prepared to give the UK something and what we would have to give them in return. ""It is less clear what Trump wants in terms of trade altogether."" In June, Mr Trump made comments that theNHS ""was on the table"" in US-UK trade deal- but laterrowed back on his remarks. At the G7 summit Mr Johnson was asked if he had made it clear the NHS was not on the table. He replied: ""Not only have I made clear of that, the president has made that very, very clear. There is complete unanimity on that point."" Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other. Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling. Last month,President Trump saidtalks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK were already under way. He said a bilateral post-Brexit deal could lead to a ""three to four, five times"" increase in current trade - but provided no details about how that would be achieved. However, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said a UK-US trade dealwould not get through Congressif Brexit undermined the Good Friday Agreement. Ms Pelosi said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to endanger the 1998 Irish peace deal, which the US helped facilitate. What is the Good Friday Agreement?

"My partner took his own life when I was pregnantNaomi Foster Aiton is taking part in a ""walk and talk"" event with other people affected by suicide.","Naomi Foster Aiton said her partner's death was ""the worst thing that you can ever imagine"" Naomi Foster Aiton was three months pregnant with her first child when her partner, Paul, took his own life. ""It was the worst thing you can ever imagine"", she said. His death last August was one of anincreasing number of suicides recorded in Scotland. Official statistics show that 784 killed themselves in 2018 - 15% more than in the previous year. Now Ms Aiton is taking part in a ""walk and talk"" event supporting people affected by suicide. Sunday's Let's Walk and Talk About Suicide, in Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire, has been organised by the charity FAMS (Families and Friends Affected by Murder and Suicide). It is designed to make help available for anyone affected by suicide. Naomi Foster Aiton lost her partner Paul Gerard Aiton Naomi Foster Aiton said her partner's death aged 23 had ""devastated"" his family and friends. She told BBC Scotland: ""It's supposed to be the happiest time of your life - for yourself, and your partner as well - when you're expecting a child together. ""But it was just hell at the time really - it was the worst thing that you can ever imagine."" ""At the time, I felt like I had nothing left to live for. But obviously my daughter has pulled me through,"" she added. ""I hope that anyone that's going through the same will realise that... you just need to reach out."" Paul's death last August came as ""a complete shock"". ""There was no signs, nothing - sometimes there is no signs and that's the worrying thing."" She said she thought for some people it might be easier to talk to a stranger than to speak to their own friends and family. Ms Foster Aiton urged people who are struggling to speak up, contact a charity like FAMS and remember that ""there's nothing that's not fixable"". ""You're angry, upset, lonely and you don't know the reason why - and because there's no-one to blame, you sometimes blame yourself."" Living life after Paul's death has been difficult. She said: ""There's no one to blame with suicide as well. When someone's murdered or there's an accident then there's someone to blame, but with suicide there's not and that's sometimes hard for people to take. ""You need to learn to live without the answers, and that's the hardest part - accepting what's happened... and learning to live without the answers, that's difficult.

"ScotRail under fire after major weekend disruptionAngry passengers say trains leaving Edinburgh were ""dangerously overcrowded"" on Saturday night.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","Louise Kerr said she ""couldn't breathe"" on the train she travelled on from Edinburgh ScotRail has come under fire from angry passengers amid major disruption to services to and from Edinburgh on Saturday night. People travelling from Waverley and Haymarket complained that services were cancelled and trains were ""dangerously overcrowded"". Transport Scotland said the problems were ""unacceptable"" and that the ScotRail Alliance was carrying out an immediate investigation. ScotRail has apologised. The rail firm said it did all that it could to meet demand on an extremely busy evening. It was the last weekend of the Edinburgh festivals and Murrayfield hosted an international rugby match. Rail services improve after remedial notice ScotRail unveils improvement plan Thousands of trains axed due to lack of staff Scores of passengers have taken to Twitter to criticise the ScotRail, claiming they failed to plan for the busy weekend. BBC Scotland has also received many messages from people caught up in the chaotic scenes at stations and on board trains. Transport union TSSA called on Michael Matheson, Scotland's transport secretary, to launch an inquiry into the issue. A Transport Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Ministers are taking this matter very seriously and are quite clear that last night's incidents are unacceptable. ""The ScotRail Alliance is already carrying out an immediate investigation into what occurred to provide answers as soon as possible."" Allow Twitter content?

Passenger Gill Craig said a number of trains to Glasgow Queen Street from Edinburgh Waverley were cancelled before she was finally able to board. ""Levels of overcrowding on the platforms and on the trains were dangerously high,"" she said. ""Surely ScotRail could have anticipated that the last Saturday of the Festival/Fringe and a rugby international would have required extra trains? ""How could two trains between Edinburgh and Glasgow, which should have been at least seven coaches long, be cancelled at such short notice? ""The public need answers. We need to be confident that this dangerous situation will not happen again."" Gillian Broderick said her two children were crushed against the train door when they arrived a Haymarket and people tried to get onboard. ""They could see there was no room but would not be deterred,"" she said. ""Verbal abuse, physical abuse, bags pushed into my children's faces. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from people who showed no concern for the safety of others including children and babies. ""Station staff couldn't do anything. Police were nowhere to be seen."" She said she eventually pushed the emergency button as she did not her children in such a ""powder keg"" environment. They got a taxi home. ""I will definitely rethink taking my family on the train in the future,"" she added. Lesley Eadie took this photograph on delayed late night service from Edinburgh Waverley to Glasgow Queen Street Lesley Eadie told the BBC Scotland website that passengers were ""packed like sardines"" on her train from Edinburgh Waverley to Glasgow Queen Street. At one point she saw passengers pass a baby along the carriage, from the child's father to his mother. ""The family had sat down and the dad took the child - who was maybe 18 months or two years old - to the toilet,"" she said. ""When they got out the train was so packed, he couldn't get back to his seat. ""The passengers were just passing this baby back to his mother."" Trying to get to Glasgow from Edinburgh at 21:30, I realised I'd never get space on a train at Haymarket, so I took a train back down the line to Waverley. The station was heaving with Fringe and Festival-goers, boozed up youths after a warm day's lager consumption, and many Murrayfield stragglers. Rail staff refused to give platform allocations for fear, one told me, of too many people crowding platforms. There was tension, and that sense of risk when crowd behaviour feels unpredictable. As Fife trains were cancelled, I heard people heading for the taxis. When I finally got a train, there was a stramash between people trying to get onto the next carriage. That brought an admirably quick rail staff and police response. I was pressed against the door with another 19 people standing in the door area. This was the slow train through Caldercruix and Coatbridge Sunnyside, stopping 19 times before Glasgow. At least we got some fresh air at each stop. And then a very long taxi queue, so it was the night bus for me. I arrived home two hours later than planned. Another passenger, Jill Davis, told BBC Scotland she was concerned for safety on the train home to Glasgow. ""It was really dangerously, dangerously overcrowded,"" she said. ""There were children standing, I had my bike with me. It was just awful - really, really terrible."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Harry Fisher said staff were shouting at passengers to move further along the carriages of his train to Aberdeen - despite the fact there was nowhere to go. ""They didn't care, just shouted louder,"" he said. ""They were incredibly aggressive and had actually lost the plot. I had to stand until Dundee. I'm 64, a chap next to me was 74. We were both fit enough to stand, but still..."" The experience has led to questions about the maximum number of passengers train operators are allowed to carry in carriages. ScotRail told BBC Scotland: ""While there's no legal limit on the number of passengers that can travel in a carriage, we wouldn't let services operate unless it was safe to do so."" One passenger found an unconventional place to rest his head on board a crowded train At the height of the disruption ScotRail was encouraging people travelling from Edinburgh city centre to consider making alternative arrangements. A spokesman for the firm said: ""We're sorry to our customers who experienced disruption and busy services yesterday. ""We do all that we can to meet demand.

My partner took his own life when I was pregnant,"Naomi Foster Aiton said her partner's death was ""the worst thing that you can ever imagine"" Naomi Foster Aiton was three months pregnant with her first child when her partner, Paul, took his own life. ""It was the worst thing you can ever imagine"", she said. His death last August was one of anincreasing number of suicides recorded in Scotland. Official statistics show that 784 killed themselves in 2018 - 15% more than in the previous year. Now Ms Aiton is taking part in a ""walk and talk"" event supporting people affected by suicide. Sunday's Let's Walk and Talk About Suicide, in Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire, has been organised by the charity FAMS (Families and Friends Affected by Murder and Suicide). It is designed to make help available for anyone affected by suicide. Naomi Foster Aiton lost her partner Paul Gerard Aiton Naomi Foster Aiton said her partner's death aged 23 had ""devastated"" his family and friends. She told BBC Scotland: ""It's supposed to be the happiest time of your life - for yourself, and your partner as well - when you're expecting a child together. ""But it was just hell at the time really - it was the worst thing that you can ever imagine."" ""At the time, I felt like I had nothing left to live for. But obviously my daughter has pulled me through,"" she added. ""I hope that anyone that's going through the same will realise that... you just need to reach out."" Paul's death last August came as ""a complete shock"". ""There was no signs, nothing - sometimes there is no signs and that's the worrying thing."" She said she thought for some people it might be easier to talk to a stranger than to speak to their own friends and family. Ms Foster Aiton urged people who are struggling to speak up, contact a charity like FAMS and remember that ""there's nothing that's not fixable"". ""You're angry, upset, lonely and you don't know the reason why - and because there's no-one to blame, you sometimes blame yourself."" Living life after Paul's death has been difficult. She said: ""There's no one to blame with suicide as well. When someone's murdered or there's an accident then there's someone to blame, but with suicide there's not and that's sometimes hard for people to take. ""You need to learn to live without the answers, and that's the hardest part - accepting what's happened... and learning to live without the answers, that's difficult. ""The only person that can tell you [the answers] is not here anymore.""

Fines for Brazil environment crimes plummetThe government is accused of ignoring illegal deforestation and burning in the Amazon.,"This video can not be played Worldwide protests over Brazilian government inaction on Amazon fires The huge number of fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has coincided with a sharp drop in fines for environmental violations, BBC analysis has found. Official data from Brazil's environment agency shows fines from January to 23 August dropped almost a third compared with the same period last year. At the same time, the number of fires burning in Brazil has increased by 84% - the highest number since 2010. It is not known how many of these fires have been set deliberately, but critics have accused President Jair Bolsonaro's administration of ""green lighting"" the destruction of the rainforest through a culture of impunity. Mr Bolsonaro has sent in the military to help put out the fires after coming under pressure from the international community, saying he wanted to ""help protect"" the Amazon. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" and is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. Analysis by BBC Brasil shows the number of fines handed out by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) for environmental violations has dropped significantly since Mr Bolsonaro took office on 1 January. This year saw the lowest number of fines handed out by the agency in a decade (in the period between January and August) Between 1 January and 23 August 2019, the total number of fines handed out was6,895 Ibama handed out9,771fines during the same period in 2018: a drop of29.4% The total number of fines relating to ""flora"" - which includes deforestation and burning - dropped from4,138to2,535over the same period And in the nine states that make up the Brazilian Amazon, the drop in fines relating to flora dropped from2,817to1,627 Neither Ibama nor the ministry of the environment answered the BBC's queries about the figures. MariangÃ©lica de Almeida, a professor of environmental law who has defended clients over unfair fines, suggested to BBC Brasil that the figures for previous years could have reflected a culture of over-fining, in order to meet goals. However, others have pointed the finger directly at Mr Bolsonaro, who has scorned environmental activists and declared his support for clearing areas of the Amazon for agriculture and mining. Elisabeth Uema, who retired from Ibama last year, said it was clear even before Mr Bolsonaro was elected that he did not like Ibama. During his campaign, he pledged to limit fines for damaging the rainforest and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? The message was further underlined in April when Mr Bolsonaro ordered an investigation into officials who burned tractors and trucks belonging to loggers who were allegedly involved in illegal activities in the Jamari National Forest. This was a long-held policy seen as a deterrent against illegal loggers. The agency's work, she said, had also been hampered by the fact that just eight of its 27 offices across the country now had a permanent head. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land ""The usual inspections, which had been planned since 2018, are happening. But little beyond that,"" Ms Uema, now the executive secretary of Ascema Nacional, the body representing Ibama employees, told BBC Brasil. Critics of the Bolsonaro administration insist the drop in fines does not mean fewer crimes against the environment are being committed. Analysis by Luis Barrucho, BBC Brasil The decline in the number of environmental fines at a time when Brazil has seen a spike in deforestation does not seem a coincidence to many. During last year's presidential race, Mr Bolsonaro vowed to open up the Amazon for commercial activity. When he was sworn in, he stayed true to his word. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Many of his critics say that Mr Bolsonaro operates a double standard when it comes to addressing environmental crimes, most of which remain unpunished. After all, the president promised a tough stance on criminal activity. Now, in face of national and international pressure, Mr Bolsonaro appears to have changed his tone and finally adopted measures to battle the fires. But he still hasn't acknowledged the link between the fires and the increase in deforestation in Brazil this year. And in a televised address on Friday he reinforced his plans to bring ""economic dynamism"" to the Amazon. The question now is whether Mr Bolsonaro's recent moves in fighting the fires will be accompanied by a consistent change in his environmental policies. Environmental activists have drawn links between Mr Bolsonaro's attitudes towards the environment and the recent surge in the number of fires in the Amazon rainforest. Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) has shownan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. Mr Bolsonaro initially brushed it off, arguing that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. The president has also previously questioneddata from Brazil's National Space Research Institute which showed an 88% increase in deforestationin June compared with the same month a year ago. Amazon: Lungs of the planet But Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. Whether there will now be a spike in fines remains to be seen. On Friday,Mr Bolsonaro confirmed that he had authorised the armed forces to help fight the fires. ""I've learned as a military man to love the Amazon forest and I want to help protect it,"" he said. The decree itself was fairly vague in its wording, but specified that the military would be deployed to nature reserves, indigenous lands and border areas in the region. Brazil's defence minister said a helicopter and two airplanes had already been deployed to the Amazon to help identify fire outbreaks and to carry equipment and military personnel. This video can not be played One campaigner called the forest fires a ""vicious cycle"" The announcement came after the international community began to exert pressure on Mr Bolsonaro. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called the fires an international crisis. France and Ireland have also said they will not ratify a large trade deal with South American nations and Finland's finance minister has called on the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports. Both Ms Merkel and Mr Macron said the issue must be discussed at this weekend's G7 summit in Biarritz, France. Additional reporting by BBC Brasil's AndrÃ© Shalders This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year.

At the same time, the number of fires burning in Brazil has increased by 84% - the highest number since 2010. It is not known how many of these fires have been set deliberately, but critics have accused President Jair Bolsonaro's administration of ""green lighting"" the destruction of the rainforest through a culture of impunity. Mr Bolsonaro has sent in the military to help put out the fires after coming under pressure from the international community, saying he wanted to ""help protect"" the Amazon. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" and is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. Analysis by BBC Brasil shows the number of fines handed out by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) for environmental violations has dropped significantly since Mr Bolsonaro took office on 1 January. This year saw the lowest number of fines handed out by the agency in a decade (in the period between January and August) Between 1 January and 23 August 2019, the total number of fines handed out was6,895 Ibama handed out9,771fines during the same period in 2018: a drop of29.4% The total number of fines relating to ""flora"" - which includes deforestation and burning - dropped from4,138to2,535over the same period And in the nine states that make up the Brazilian Amazon, the drop in fines relating to flora dropped from2,817to1,627 Neither Ibama nor the ministry of the environment answered the BBC's queries about the figures. MariangÃ©lica de Almeida, a professor of environmental law who has defended clients over unfair fines, suggested to BBC Brasil that the figures for previous years could have reflected a culture of over-fining, in order to meet goals. However, others have pointed the finger directly at Mr Bolsonaro, who has scorned environmental activists and declared his support for clearing areas of the Amazon for agriculture and mining. Elisabeth Uema, who retired from Ibama last year, said it was clear even before Mr Bolsonaro was elected that he did not like Ibama. During his campaign, he pledged to limit fines for damaging the rainforest and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? The message was further underlined in April when Mr Bolsonaro ordered an investigation into officials who burned tractors and trucks belonging to loggers who were allegedly involved in illegal activities in the Jamari National Forest. This was a long-held policy seen as a deterrent against illegal loggers. The agency's work, she said, had also been hampered by the fact that just eight of its 27 offices across the country now had a permanent head.

But little beyond that,"" Ms Uema, now the executive secretary of Ascema Nacional, the body representing Ibama employees, told BBC Brasil. Critics of the Bolsonaro administration insist the drop in fines does not mean fewer crimes against the environment are being committed. Analysis by Luis Barrucho, BBC Brasil The decline in the number of environmental fines at a time when Brazil has seen a spike in deforestation does not seem a coincidence to many. During last year's presidential race, Mr Bolsonaro vowed to open up the Amazon for commercial activity. When he was sworn in, he stayed true to his word. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Many of his critics say that Mr Bolsonaro operates a double standard when it comes to addressing environmental crimes, most of which remain unpunished. After all, the president promised a tough stance on criminal activity. Now, in face of national and international pressure, Mr Bolsonaro appears to have changed his tone and finally adopted measures to battle the fires. But he still hasn't acknowledged the link between the fires and the increase in deforestation in Brazil this year. And in a televised address on Friday he reinforced his plans to bring ""economic dynamism"" to the Amazon. The question now is whether Mr Bolsonaro's recent moves in fighting the fires will be accompanied by a consistent change in his environmental policies. Environmental activists have drawn links between Mr Bolsonaro's attitudes towards the environment and the recent surge in the number of fires in the Amazon rainforest. Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) has shownan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. Mr Bolsonaro initially brushed it off, arguing that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. The president has also previously questioneddata from Brazil's National Space Research Institute which showed an 88% increase in deforestationin June compared with the same month a year ago. Amazon: Lungs of the planet But Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. Whether there will now be a spike in fines remains to be seen. On Friday,Mr Bolsonaro confirmed that he had authorised the armed forces to help fight the fires. ""I've learned as a military man to love the Amazon forest and I want to help protect it,"" he said. The decree itself was fairly vague in its wording, but specified that the military would be deployed to nature reserves, indigenous lands and border areas in the region. Brazil's defence minister said a helicopter and two airplanes had already been deployed to the Amazon to help identify fire outbreaks and to carry equipment and military personnel. This video can not be played One campaigner called the forest fires a ""vicious cycle"" The announcement came after the international community began to exert pressure on Mr Bolsonaro. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called the fires an international crisis. France and Ireland have also said they will not ratify a large trade deal with South American nations and Finland's finance minister has called on the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports. Both Ms Merkel and Mr Macron said the issue must be discussed at this weekend's G7 summit in Biarritz, France. Additional reporting by BBC Brasil's AndrÃ© Shalders This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010. Amazon fires: How bad have they got?

Scottish suicide rate up 15% in a year,"Naomi Foster Aiton said her partner's death was ""the worst thing that you can ever imagine"" Naomi Foster Aiton was three months pregnant with her first child when her partner, Paul, took his own life. ""It was the worst thing you can ever imagine"", she said. His death last August was one of anincreasing number of suicides recorded in Scotland. Official statistics show that 784 killed themselves in 2018 - 15% more than in the previous year. Now Ms Aiton is taking part in a ""walk and talk"" event supporting people affected by suicide. Sunday's Let's Walk and Talk About Suicide, in Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire, has been organised by the charity FAMS (Families and Friends Affected by Murder and Suicide). It is designed to make help available for anyone affected by suicide. Naomi Foster Aiton lost her partner Paul Gerard Aiton Naomi Foster Aiton said her partner's death aged 23 had ""devastated"" his family and friends. She told BBC Scotland: ""It's supposed to be the happiest time of your life - for yourself, and your partner as well - when you're expecting a child together. ""But it was just hell at the time really - it was the worst thing that you can ever imagine."" ""At the time, I felt like I had nothing left to live for. But obviously my daughter has pulled me through,"" she added. ""I hope that anyone that's going through the same will realise that... you just need to reach out."" Paul's death last August came as ""a complete shock"". ""There was no signs, nothing - sometimes there is no signs and that's the worrying thing."" She said she thought for some people it might be easier to talk to a stranger than to speak to their own friends and family. Ms Foster Aiton urged people who are struggling to speak up, contact a charity like FAMS and remember that ""there's nothing that's not fixable"". ""You're angry, upset, lonely and you don't know the reason why - and because there's no-one to blame, you sometimes blame yourself."" Living life after Paul's death has been difficult. She said: ""There's no one to blame with suicide as well. When someone's murdered or there's an accident then there's someone to blame, but with suicide there's not and that's sometimes hard for people to take. ""You need to learn to live without the answers, and that's the hardest part - accepting what's happened... and learning to live without the answers, that's difficult. ""The only person that can tell you [the answers] is not here anymore."" Natalie Frew lost her partner eight weeks ago Another woman who will be participating in Sunday's event said families were being torn apart by the ""horrible epidemic"" of suicide. Natalie Frew lost her partner, Graham Fraser, eight weeks ago. She described him as ""my best friend and my baby's daddy"" and seemed ""the happiest guy in the room"". She said: ""It will be eight weeks on Sunday since we lost him so it's really, really fresh for us and really hard at the moment."" Graham was the ""happiest guy in the room"", she said. ""He was the most amazing father, he doted on that baby. She's literally asked for him every morning and every night and he's not here any more."" Talking to people who have been through a similar experience to herself has been a great help, she added. ""We can't have anybody else going through the horrific scenes that we've been through. ""We need to to do something and stand together and put an end to this."" Ann Marie Cocozza, from FAMS, said: ""There's so many triggers being a teenager or young adult in the 21st century. ""Who do they turn to? Who do they ask? How do they know where to go? So this event lets them see, feel and touch where to go.""
