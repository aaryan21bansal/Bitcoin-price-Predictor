Imran Mostafa Kamel is accused of possessing a firearm in relation to an incident at Fountain House, Park Lane, which happened soon after the killing. Tudor Simionov, 33, was providing security for a party at a flat there. Mr Kamel, 26, of The Grove, Ealing, appeared earlier at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He has been charged with possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear or danger, and possession of a firearm when prohibited for life. Tudor Simionov was photographed working as a security guard hours before he was killed The Met Police said the charges related to an incident at Fountain House at about 05:35 GMT in which no firearm was discharged.

Navy sent to Channel to deter migrants,"HMS Mersey was seen leaving Portsmouth harbour on Thursday afternoon A Royal Navy patrol ship has been sent to the English Channel to deter migrant crossings, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said HMS Mersey would ""help prevent migrants from making the dangerous journey"". The UK Border Force and French authorities are already patrolling the water - now, following a Home Office request, the navy has been sent in. About 240 people have reached the UK in small boats since November. Mr Williamson said HMS Mersey had been diverted from ""routine operations"" to the Strait of Dover. HMS Mersey is normally used to carry out fishing patrolsin UK waters and the Atlantic,external, ensuring boats and trawlers stick to internationally-agreed quotas. Border Force currently has two coastal patrol vessels in the Channel, as well as two cutters, HMC Vigilant and HMC Searcher, which can rescue several boatloads of people at once. The navy's involvement was requested by Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who said it would be an interim measure until two more Border Force cutters, HMC Protector and Seeker, areredeployed from the Mediterranean to UK waters,external. Mr Javid said: ""My focus continues to be on protecting the UK border and preventing loss of life in the Channel. For these reasons, the government has decided to deploy a navy vessel, HMS Mersey, to support our existing efforts."" The home secretary sparked controversy on Wednesday by questioningwhether those making the risky crossing in small boats were ""genuine"" refugees. Mr Javid also defended his decision to escalate the UK's response, saying that the number of attempted crossings had increased rapidly since October. At least 239 people are known to have reached the UK in small boats since November, including12 who were found off the Kent coast last week. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map On Tuesday, French police said they stopped 14 migrants attempting to cross the Channel from Boulogne - the latest in a growing number of people intercepted by the French authorities in the past month. The UK government has agreed a joint action plan with France, which includes the return of HMC Protector and Seeker from patrols between Europe and northern Africa.

'My mum killed my dad but I want her freed',"Sally Challen and Richard Challen during their 31-year marriage Sally Challen was jailed for the murder of her husband in 2011 but her solicitors believe a new law, recognising psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, could be a defence in an appeal hearing next month. Her son David explains why he's backing the appeal and hopes to see his mother freed. Sally's last words to David were supposed to be heartfelt but undramatic. ""You know I love you, don't you?"" she said, fixing his gaze through an open car door, as she dropped him off at work. A day earlier, she had killed her long-time husband, and father of David, in a frenzied hammer attack. But as he headed to his job, David knew nothing of Richard Challen's gruesome death. After that drop-off, she had planned to swiftly end her own life - jumping from the top floor of a nearby car park. When she realised the car park was closed, she pressed on regardless, driving to Beachy Head in East Sussex. There she planned to jump to her death off the chalky precipice. From the clifftop, Sally called her cousin to admit the killing. She repeated the admission to a suicide team and a chaplain, who had been called to help her. It took them two hours to talk her down from the edge. She was charged with her husband's murder, convicted and jailed for life. However, eight years on, lawyers acting for Sally Challen are hoping to make legal history, and David is working to help them. They hope to use a law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse, to secure her release. David Challen says his mother suffered years of abuse at the hands of his father Just as physical violence in a relationship has been recognised as a mitigating factor in a killing, her lawyers say her history of psychological abuse by Richard provides a defence of provocation. The circumstances around the killing itself give a taste of the sort of coercive control Richard exerted over his wife. In the wealthy suburban village of Claygate, Surrey, one wet Saturday morning in August 2010, Sally visited the house she had, until recently, shared with Richard, her husband of 31 years. He lived there alone since she had walked out on the relationship the previous November, after discovering he had been visiting prostitutes. David and his elder brother James, who prefers to avoid media attention, say their father inflicted years of psychological abuse on their mother. Having left Richard, the sons were adamant their mother should stay away from him. However, unknown to them, she had secretly begun seeing Richard again, hoping to patch up their marriage. What actually happened in the family home that morning was far removed from reconciliation. Richard Challen was, outwardly, a loving family man On this particular morning, she drove the short distance from her new home. In the car with her was a handbag and, stashed inside it, a hammer. Richard had wanted her to approve a post-nuptial agreement that would cut her rights to the Â£1m family home and impose stringent conditions, such as not interrupting him and not talking to other people when they were together in restaurants. There was no food in the house and Richard was hungry, so he asked her to go out and buy something for his lunch. As she headed back from the shops, Sally suspected Richard had had an ulterior motive for getting her out of the house. So, on her return she picked up his phone, rang the last number he had dialled and found it answered by a woman. In the family kitchen, Sally fried bacon and eggs on the hob. Richard sat with his back to her at the table. She served him, and, as he ate, she pulled the hammer from her bag and hit Richard 20 times over the head. She then wrapped his body in curtains and blankets, left a note saying: ""I love you, Sally,"" and left. She bought herself some cigarettes, drank some wine and composed a suicide note. But she decided to delay killing herself until she had seen David who, at 23, still lived with her. The next day, David remembers, his mother dropped him at work and, as he stepped out of the car, she made her heartfelt pledge of love. Later that day, David was summoned by his manager. ""Then came round the corner, my cousin, followed by a police officer, uniformed, and rushed to me, grabbed me on both shoulders and said, 'your father's dead'."" 'Seek help', murder victim's family say Majority of controlling cases dropped New domestic abuse offences planned Charged with her husband's murder, 10 months later Sally stood in the dock of Guildford Crown Court. Her hair was a mess and her fingers stained yellow from smoking. David remembers the proceedings being hard to watch. ""Anyone standing up who had anything worth saying was not saying enough, or not feeling as if they had enough time, or not being asked the right questions. She was being painted as vengeful and jealous."" Here was a woman who counted her husband's Viagra and monitored his phone calls, the prosecution said. In court, Sally hardly spoke. But there was video evidence in which she admitted to the killing and testimony from the Beachy Head suicide prevention team. They recounted her confessing: ""I killed him with a hammer. I hit him lots of times... If I can't have him, no-one can."" Convicted of murder and jailed for life, all hope appeared to have expired for Sally. Then, in 2015,a law came into force that recognised psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse.,external In March 2018, Sally Challen won leave to appeal against her conviction. Her solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, of the feminist campaigning organisation Justice for Women, says the new law should be accepted as ""new evidence"" in the case. ""We're arguing, for the first time, that the framework for understanding domestic abuse that's set out in coercive and controlling behaviour which became law in 2015, provides a way of understanding Sally's actions which would support a defence of provocation."" She believes this is the first time coercive control has been used as a defence in a murder appeal: ""Our argument is that if this evidence is allowed as fresh evidence it renders the murder conviction unsafe therefore that murder conviction should be quashed."" She says that the appeal court could reduce the conviction to manslaughter or order a retrial. The fact that the family want to see her freed - and none of Richard's friends or relatives has come forward to say otherwise - is significant, she believes. But she fears the fact Sally brought the hammer with her ""with a conditional intent to use it"", suggests some premeditation. This could mean the murder conviction will stand, says Ms Wistrich. Both grown-up sons back the legal challenge, with David clear that his father's treatment of his mother is a textbook example of coercive control. ""It was tick, tick, tick - everything: financial abuse, psychological manipulation, controlling her freedom of movement, just controlling every facet of her mind... It was almost like she was a robot and he punched in the commands of what she had to do."" Sally and Richard on their wedding day in 1979 Richard's psychological hold over Sally began early, David believes. Sally Jenney was 15 when she met Richard, five years her senior, in 1971. They were married in 1979. Sally had nothing but wide-eyed love for Richard, David says, but his father felt otherwise. ""Seeing women, cheating on her, brothels."" And when she challenged him, David remembers his father questioned her sanity: ""'Sally, you are mad'. It was a mantra."" There were petty rules. In restaurants she was not allowed to speak to other people. ""He didn't like her having any independence in terms of friends, it was only friends together. It was total control."" If she displeased him, Richard would restrict her car use to work travel only, and all household spending came out of her earnings. Neighbours have said he treated her as if she belonged to him. And Sally was subjected to constant criticism. ""My father would refer to my mother as 'saddlebags', 'thunder thighs', really critiques of her weight... and that was something me and my brother witnessed and heard all the time. Not just in our own company but with other friends as well... It was just not right."" At the original trial, it was suggested Sally attacked Richard in a rage, after realising he had called a girlfriend that morning. But David says he believes his mother's claim that she was unaware of her actions when she killed Richard. ""She took that hammer and she killed my father. I recognise what happened but we have to recognise what psychological control does. I don't know why she took that hammer. She doesn't understand why,"" he says. David says his mother still loves Richard, something he and his brother ""can't understand"". ""We don't know what to do with that... my father's not alive any more and he still has power over her."" David says he hopes the appeal ""will acknowledge my mother's mental abuse, will acknowledge what she suffered throughout her life"". ""The cause is not that she's a jealous wife,"" he adds. ""She has been manipulated psychologically all her life, tied down by this man, my father.  She deserves her right to freedom. She deserves for her abuse to be recognised.""

Man City close gap on Reds to four points,"Leroy Sane's winner came eight minutes after Roberto Firmino's equaliser Manchester City reignited the Premier League title race as they ended Liverpool's 20-game unbeaten start to the season to reduce their lead at the top of the table to four points. Pep Guardiola's hosts knew nothing less than a win at Etihad Stadium would do on a Thursday night riddled with tension that produced a game that was frenetic if not a classic. Leroy Sane produced the decisive moment 18 minutes from time as he collected Raheem Sterling's pass to fire across Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson, after it had seemed like Roberto Firmino's stooping header would maintain the visitors' unbeaten sequence. Sergio Aguero had earlier given City the lead with a rising, near-post drive just before the interval. That came after a moment of drama when Reds forward Sadio Mane hit the City post and John Stones scrambled the ball off the line after his attempted clearance struck goalkeeper Ederson - with data subsequently showing the ball had failed to cross by just 1.12cm. Both sides had chances in a frantic finale but it was City who claimed a crucial win. This video can not be played Wright still backs Liverpool for title despite defeat by 'magnificent' Man City Guardiola was blunt before the biggest Premier League game of the season: anything other than victory was not an option. And while City did not produce the purist style that is their trademark, they dug deep to get the job done despite some late moments of panic in their penalty box and wayward finishing in the other. City were in danger of falling off the pace following three recent losses that allowed Liverpool to open up an imposing advantage - and that was why the stakes were so high amid a crackling atmosphere. It was master marksman Aguero who made the crucial breakthrough with a brilliant near-post finish, thinking and moving quicker then Dejan Lovren to beat Alisson. City also showed real strength of character to respond just as the momentum Liverpool were generating from Firmino's leveller threatened to take the game away from them. And at the heart of it all was the magnificent Fernandinho - a man seemingly irreplaceable among the City's stellar cast - as he delivered a masterclass of controlled midfield play to steady his side when required. It should be said, though, that the hosts enjoyed a measure of good fortune when leniency from referee Anthony Taylor allowed captain Vincent Kompany to escape with only a yellow card for a reckless lunge at Mohamed Salah after he had been played into strife by Stones. But this was a huge night for City and Guardiola and they emphatically answered the questions that have been levelled at them. It was also a victory achieved without needing to call on the brilliance of Kevin de Bruyne. The sight of the Belgium midfielder as an unused substitute was an indicator of the strength still to come from the champions. They can now look upon a reduced Liverpool lead and believe they have very much kept alive their hopes of retaining the title. 'Man City show substance as well as style in crucial victory' 'Every game is a final' says Guardiola after 'good result for the Premier League' Football Daily: Title race back on as Man City beat Liverpool This video can not be played Man City defeat not easy to take - Klopp Liverpool's disappointment was clear as manager Jurgen Klopp and his players trudged off at the end of their first league defeat of the season - a result that backed up Klopp's insistence that this title race has a long way to run. The Reds were not at their intense best, although they can look back at Mane hitting the post and several other scrambles as key moments that went against them. They will be disappointed at the manner of City's opener as Aguero, with a brilliant finish, preyed on the fatal hesitation of Lovren, who had a thoroughly forgettable night. Yet once the frustration subsides, Liverpool can reflect on a superb start to the season that has left them with clear daylight at the summit - something that looked so unlikely just a few weeks ago. They are still in the position everyone wants to occupy. Why first defeat will not knock Liverpool's title belief - Lawrenson analysis Klopp bemoans lack of Kompany red card 'They should play each other every week' - how social media reacted Fernandinho made more tackles than any other player on his team (four) and won possession back nine times. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport:""I am proud of them, but not just today. We lost two games in four days but you can't forget what they have done for 16 months. We knew that it was a final today, if we lose it is almost over. ""All credit to these incredible players. That is how we have to play in the Champions League. Both teams tried to search for each other, we were not scared, we had no fear and we had a lot of pressure. ""They are leaders - it is four points but we have reduced the gap. We knew that if we won we would be in contention to fight for the Premier league, if we lose it is over. ""I don't remember a league so tough, there are so many huge contenders fighting for the title. Every game is a final."" This video can not be played Manchester City 2-1 Liverpool: Pep Guardiola proud of 'incredible' players Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Sky Sports:""It was a big pressure. Very intense game. We were unlucky in our finishing moments. Unluckier than City I would say. ""They had periods where they dominated the game and everybody felt the intensity. But we came back and had big chances. It is always like this. You have to score in those moments. When Aguero scores there is no angle. In similar situations we didn't score. ""It was not our or City's best game because we both made it difficult for the other team. I have already said to the boys this is OK. We lost it but it will happen. Tonight it is not nice but it is not the biggest problem."" Relive the action at Etihad Stadium Manchester City ended Liverpool's unbeaten start to the Premier League season in the 21st match - only Arsenal in 2003-04 (38 games), Manchester United in 2010-11 (24) and Man City in 2017-18 (22) have had longer unbeaten starts. This was only City's second win in their past 12 matches against Liverpool. They have lost seven of those but won at the Etihad in the league for the past two seasons. Since the start of the 2011-12 season, Aguero has scored 37 league goals for City in matches against the other 'big six' clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham) - 16 more than any other player. Liverpool have lost 10 of their 25 games under Klopp in January (winning eight), which makes up 29% of his 35 defeats as Reds boss. Since the start of last season, Sane has been involved in 26 goals in 25 home league appearances for Manchester City (nine goals, 17 assists). Firmino scored his 10th goal of the season for Liverpool, registering double figures for the fourth consecutive season (11 in 2015-16, 12 in 2016-17, 27 in 2017-18). The Reds conceded more than once in a Premier League game for the first time since drawing 2-2 at West Brom in April. Manchester City won a league match against a team starting the day top of the table for the first time since winning 2-1 against Liverpool in December 2013. Both teams are in FA Cup action, with Manchester City hosting Championship side Rotherham United on Sunday (14:00 GMT) and Liverpool visiting Premier League rivals Wolves on Monday (19:45).

Trans 'pioneer' Julia Grant dies at 64,"Julia Grant appeared in a series of BBC documentaries, starting in 1979 Julia Grant, the first trans woman to share her story on primetime British TV, has died at the age of 64 following a short illness. Ms Grant rose to prominence after appearing in the 1979 BBC documentary, A Change Of Sex. The BBC Two show, and its four follow-ups, told the story of her transition. David Pearson, who directed the series, described her as a ""pioneer"" who helped start ""a huge change in public attitudes towards trans people"". Ms Grant survived bowel cancer in recent years but suffered from multiple health problems in 2018 and died on 2 January. How do trans people decide their name? The schools learning from transgender students Her brother, Gary Roberts, told the BBC she had ""worked tirelessly for her community"". He added: ""You could say she was a bit like Marmite, but she probably built more bridges in her community than she burnt. ""She inspired a lot of people to believe in themselves and was always there to fight the cause."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Pearson added: ""It's difficult if you weren't around at that time to realise how closed and secretive that whole [trans] scene was - and the gay scene to some extent. ""Essentially, overnight, she made it possible for people to understand what it was like - and she continued to do that."" LGBTQ+ rights campaigner and Manchester Liberal Democrat leader John Leech said Ms Grant had been ""rightfully looked up to by many as a leader in the LGBTQ+ community, in particular here in Manchester"". Ms Grant first became involved in the BBC documentary series after contacting the broadcaster to complain about it describing a transvestite as a transsexual, she said in 2014. After speaking to a producer on the phone, she agreed to become the subject of a film exploring the process of transitioning to Julia. The documentary film, which eventually became a series, introduces her as catering manager George, who wishes to have gender reassignment surgery. It followed her journey from seeking advice at Charing Cross Hospital to living as a woman socially for a year, having surgery and then her life after this point. Almost nine million people tuned in to watch the first episode. This video can not be played Trans pioneer Julia Grant speaks to a psychiatrist about transitioning in 1979 Despite some negative coverage of the show by tabloid newspapers, the response from viewers was ""overwhelmingly positive"", Mr Pearson said. He added Ms Grant told him later in life that changing her gender was the ""best thing she ever did"". Born in Preston and raised with five sisters and two brothers in Fleetwood, Ms Grant worked at various points as a chef, sex worker, NHS adviser, writer, ceramics teacher, bar owner, hotel owner and festival organiser. She lived in Spain, France and the Netherlands. As well as appearing in the BBC documentaries, Ms Grant wrote two books about her life, helped set up Benidorm Gay Pride and spent time in the US counselling young people considering gender reassignment surgery. She remained active in the trans community throughout her life, although Mr Pearson says in more recent times some of her views have become increasingly controversial. In particular she didn't agree with young children transitioning using surgery, hormones or what is now known as the ""social gender role transition"" in which they live in their preferred gender identify full time. Correction 27 February 2018: This story originally said Ms Grant's opposition to children transitioning through surgery had been seen as controversial by some of her peers. It has now been amended to clarify that this controversy related primarily to her additional opposition to children having some other forms of gender realignment.

But this was a huge night for City and Guardiola and they emphatically answered the questions that have been levelled at them. It was also a victory achieved without needing to call on the brilliance of Kevin de Bruyne. The sight of the Belgium midfielder as an unused substitute was an indicator of the strength still to come from the champions. They can now look upon a reduced Liverpool lead and believe they have very much kept alive their hopes of retaining the title. 'Man City show substance as well as style in crucial victory' 'Every game is a final' says Guardiola after 'good result for the Premier League' Football Daily: Title race back on as Man City beat Liverpool This video can not be played Man City defeat not easy to take - Klopp Liverpool's disappointment was clear as manager Jurgen Klopp and his players trudged off at the end of their first league defeat of the season - a result that backed up Klopp's insistence that this title race has a long way to run. The Reds were not at their intense best, although they can look back at Mane hitting the post and several other scrambles as key moments that went against them. They will be disappointed at the manner of City's opener as Aguero, with a brilliant finish, preyed on the fatal hesitation of Lovren, who had a thoroughly forgettable night. Yet once the frustration subsides, Liverpool can reflect on a superb start to the season that has left them with clear daylight at the summit - something that looked so unlikely just a few weeks ago. They are still in the position everyone wants to occupy. Why first defeat will not knock Liverpool's title belief - Lawrenson analysis Klopp bemoans lack of Kompany red card 'They should play each other every week' - how social media reacted Fernandinho made more tackles than any other player on his team (four) and won possession back nine times. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport:""I am proud of them, but not just today. We lost two games in four days but you can't forget what they have done for 16 months. We knew that it was a final today, if we lose it is almost over. ""All credit to these incredible players. That is how we have to play in the Champions League. Both teams tried to search for each other, we were not scared, we had no fear and we had a lot of pressure. ""They are leaders - it is four points but we have reduced the gap. We knew that if we won we would be in contention to fight for the Premier league, if we lose it is over. ""I don't remember a league so tough, there are so many huge contenders fighting for the title. Every game is a final."" This video can not be played Manchester City 2-1 Liverpool: Pep Guardiola proud of 'incredible' players Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to Sky Sports:""It was a big pressure. Very intense game. We were unlucky in our finishing moments. Unluckier than City I would say. ""They had periods where they dominated the game and everybody felt the intensity. But we came back and had big chances. It is always like this. You have to score in those moments. When Aguero scores there is no angle. In similar situations we didn't score. ""It was not our or City's best game because we both made it difficult for the other team. I have already said to the boys this is OK. We lost it but it will happen. Tonight it is not nice but it is not the biggest problem."" Relive the action at Etihad Stadium Manchester City ended Liverpool's unbeaten start to the Premier League season in the 21st match - only Arsenal in 2003-04 (38 games), Manchester United in 2010-11 (24) and Man City in 2017-18 (22) have had longer unbeaten starts. This was only City's second win in their past 12 matches against Liverpool. They have lost seven of those but won at the Etihad in the league for the past two seasons. Since the start of the 2011-12 season, Aguero has scored 37 league goals for City in matches against the other 'big six' clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham) - 16 more than any other player. Liverpool have lost 10 of their 25 games under Klopp in January (winning eight), which makes up 29% of his 35 defeats as Reds boss. Since the start of last season, Sane has been involved in 26 goals in 25 home league appearances for Manchester City (nine goals, 17 assists). Firmino scored his 10th goal of the season for Liverpool, registering double figures for the fourth consecutive season (11 in 2015-16, 12 in 2016-17, 27 in 2017-18). The Reds conceded more than once in a Premier League game for the first time since drawing 2-2 at West Brom in April. Manchester City won a league match against a team starting the day top of the table for the first time since winning 2-1 against Liverpool in December 2013. Both teams are in FA Cup action, with Manchester City hosting Championship side Rotherham United on Sunday (14:00 GMT) and Liverpool visiting Premier League rivals Wolves on Monday (19:45).

China mission lands on Moon's far side,"This video can not be played Far side of Moon captured by Chinese spacecraft China says it has successfully landed a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first ever such attempt and landing. At 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT), the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, state media said. It is carrying instruments to analyse the unexplored region's geology, as well to conduct biological experiments. The landing is being seen as a major milestone in space exploration. There have been numerous missions to the Moon in recent years, but the vast majority have been to orbit, fly by or impact. The last crewed landing was Apollo 17 in 1972. Why China has its eye on the stars All pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite The Chang'e-4 probe has already sent back its first pictures from the surface, which were shared by state media. With no direct communication link possible, all pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite before being relayed to Earth. Previous Moon missions have landed on the Earth-facing side, but this is the first time any craft has landed successfully on the unexplored and rugged far side. Some spacecraft have crashed into the far side, either after system failures, or after they had completed their mission. How Chinese media reported the landing The myths and music about the moon's dark side Ye Quanzhi, an astronomer at Caltech, told the BBC this was the first time China had ""attempted something that other space powers have not attempted before"". The far side is not visible from the Earth due to ""tidal locking"" The Chang'e-4 was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China on 7 December; it arrived in lunar orbit on 12 December. It was then directed to lower itself toward the Moon, being careful to identify and avoid obstacles, Chinese state media say. The Chang'e-4 probe is aiming to explore a place called the Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n crater, located within the much larger South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history. ""This huge structure is over 2,500km (1,550 miles) in diameter and 13km deep, one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System and the largest, deepest and oldest basin on the Moon,"" Andrew Coates, professor of physics atUCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory,externalin Surrey, told the BBC. The event responsible for carving out the SPA basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the Moon's crust and down into the zone called the mantle. Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity. The science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin,allowing them to identify variations in its composition.,external A third objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon. Chang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations. Scientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea. A mock-up of the Chang'e-4 lander and rover, on display in Dongguan, China The lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere. The arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say. Other equipment/experiments include: A panoramic camera A radar to probe beneath the lunar surface An imaging spectrometer to identify minerals An experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations. Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth. The lunar far side is often referred to as the ""dark side"", though ""dark"" in this case means ""unseen"" rather than ""lacking light"". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime. China launch will prep for Moon landing Why China is fixated on the Moon China's scientific revolution But because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth. The far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the ""maria"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side. In an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September,external, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: ""The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link."" So the landers mustcommunicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao- or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May. Queqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina. China wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia. In 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon. It will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022. The chief designer of China's lunar exploration programme, Wu Weiren, has described Thursday's landing as ""an important milestone"" for the country's space effort, state media report. A full-size model of the Tianhe core module of China's space station The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success. But Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa. ""The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,"" he told the BBC. Ye Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open. ""They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,"" he said. China has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration. Only in 2003, it sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US. The far side landing has already been heralded by experts at Nasa as ""a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment"".

Sir Billy Connolly: 'I don't fear death',"This video can not be played Comedian Sir Billy Connolly has insisted he does not fear death despite his advancing years Sir Billy Connolly has insisted he does not fear death as he revealed how laughter was helping him cope with Parkinson's disease. The comedian said he viewed old age as an adventure that was preparing him for the ""next episode in the spirit world"". But he said there was ""still time to go yet, places to go, new friends to make, new songs to write and sing and jokes to tell"". The 76-year-old was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2012. Speaking in theBilly Connolly: Made in Scotlanddocumentary to be shown on BBC2 on Friday evening, Sir Billy said his age and his diagnosis with the degenerative brain condition meant he was now ""at the wrong end of the telescope of life"". The documentary, which was filmed before his 76th birthday, saw the comedy legend in reflective mood as he reminisced about his childhood in Scotland and his subsequent life and career. He said: ""My life is slipping away and I can feel it and I should. I'm 75 and I'm a damn sight nearer the end than I am the beginning. ""But it doesn't frighten me - it's an adventure and it's quite interesting to see myself slipping away, as bits slip off and leave me, talents leave and attributes leave. ""It's as if I'm being prepared for something, some other adventure, which is over the hill. I've got all this stuff to lose first, and then I'll be at the shadowy side of the hill doing the next episode in the spirit world."" Sir Billy Connolly on his health and his art Sir Billy: I'll be research guinea pig Sir Billy recently said his doctorexpects him to live until 90,externaldespite his diagnosis with Parkinson's, and has strongly rebuked claims by former TV chat show host Sir Michael Parkinson that his health was failing to such an extent that he was no longer able to recognise close friends. He also told BBC Scotland in October that he has some ""shoogly days"" but is otherwise ""perfectly OK"". In the documentary, he said it takes a ""certain calm"" to deal with the knowledge the condition is never going to go away, and will only get worse in the future. He added: ""Sometimes I don't have it. Sometimes I get angry with it, but that doesn't last long. I just collapse in laughter. ""I'm very lucky in as much as I made a bit of a mark, and you think well I must have done something right. ""And that keeps you company when you're older, the fact that when when you were creative, you created well. It accompanies you. It's a great companion. ""You can volunteer to take life seriously, but it is going to get you. You know they're going to win over you. It's harsh. You can either break down and complain about how miserable your life is, or have a go at it and survive. I think that's the basis of it all.""

Men jailed for streamed bus joyride,"This video can not be played The pair were arrested after their Facebook video was posted Two men who live streamed themselves joyriding in a bus have each been jailed for four weeks. James Jones and Johnathan Huckerby made off in the vehicle in Shepshed, Leicestershire, after the driver had stopped for a break. Magistrates heard that while police were searching for them, on the evening of 3 December, they posted a video on Facebook of the joyride. The footage included both of their names and they were later arrested. Jones, 27, of Armadale Drive, Leicester, and Huckerby, 28, of Pevensey Road, Loughborough, admitted taking the bus without consent. Kwok Wan, prosecuting, said: ""The driver turned off the engine and walked to take a break. ""When he returned, the bus was no longer there."" The two men had been drinking during the day, Leicester Magistrates' Court heard. Huckerby opened the door of the bus, and then egged on former bus driver Jones to drive off, the court was told. Darren Young, defending Huckerby, said the two men ""realised the severity"" of what had happened when a police car drove past before they parked the bus. Kate Nield, defending Jones, said ""he can only apologise for what he's done"", calling it ""a joke which had gone too far"". Jones also pleaded guilty to driving without insurance and Huckerby to possession of a class B drug. Because both men received suspended jail sentences last year - Jones for ""violent offences"" and Huckerby for arson - the time they must serve is increased. On top of the four-week sentences, Jones was jailed for another three months - and banned from driving for 30 weeks - and Huckerby for another eight weeks.

Drag act for children sparks outrage,"Drag Queen Story Time has toured the UK for two years An event at which a drag artist will read stories to children has sparked outrage on social media. Alyssa Van Delle has been invited to Taunton Library in February as part of LGBTQ+ History Month. The performer will read from children's books that cover LGBT themes or challenge traditional fairy tales. Event organiser Tom Canham said he was ""quite surprised"" at the criticism as previous events had been warmly received. One critic of the event, Rebecca Lush, wrote on Twitter: ""Keep sexuality in the bedroom, not in libraries, and certainly not for pre-school children."" Another, Louise Paine, wrote: ""Drag is adult entertainment, an over-sexualised, misogynistic portrayal of women, usually by gay men. ""This is not suitable for young children, especially when they are reading them stories which tell them they may have been born in the wrong body, an impossibility."" The tour has been running for two years, performing some 50 shows around the UK and reaching about 8,000 children. ""They love it - there's glitter, feather boas and they think it's amazing,"" said Mr Canham. The aim is to increase acceptance of people who identify as LGBTQ+, organisers say He said Van Delle had already done 27 shows and her act was age appropriate, as any professional entertainer's would be. ""LGBT literature is close to our hearts,"" Mr Canham said. ""If you read reports, they show LGBT and homophobic bullying in primary schools is very high, as children are not being introduced to [the literature]. ""This allows for it to be discussed and introduced."" The tour is also working with Islington Council to introduce a range of books for primary schools covering issues such as gender and sexual identity. The aim is help youngsters increase their understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. Somerset County Council, which runs Taunton Library, has declined to comment.

What is the shutdown's impact?,"A woman wearing a ""hungry hostage"" headband protests on Capitol Hill President Donald Trump's standoff with Democrats over funding for his proposed border wall has resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. How has it affected American life so far? Mr Trump insists the government will stay closed until he gets that funding, and as the shutdown enters day 34, Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have remained equally firm that there will be no congressional funding for a wall. A quarter of the federal government has been unfunded since 22 December, leaving 800,000 employees without pay. Here is some of the misery Washington's political gridlock is inflicting on the nation at large. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, who oversee airport security, have been calling in sick or quitting as the shutdown drags on, though the agency insists standards have not been compromised. Flight traffic controllers are alsofeeling the effects of the shutdown,external, working long shifts to cope with with record low numbers of fully-certified staff to handle over 43,000 daily flights. On Wednesday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association the Air Line Pilots Association, and the Association of Flight Attendants released a bleak joint statement. ""We cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented."" President Sara Nelson of the flight attendant's association has alsocalled for a general nationwide worker's strike,externalto end the shutdown. Resources at the Federal Bureau of Investigation are quickly running out, according to a new report comprised of agent stories from across the nation. Thomas O'Connor of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement: ""The resources available to support the work of FBI agents are currently stretched to the breaking point and are dwindling day by day."" The report reveals,externalthe shutdown has impacted criminal, counter-terrorism and intelligence work, delaying sensitive investigations and compromising many basic operations. Coast Guard families pick up groceries at a food pantry As federal workers are due to miss their second paychecks of 2019,Coast Guard commandant Adm Karl Schultz,externalsaid it was ""unacceptable that USCG members must rely on food pantries and donations to get through day-to-day life"". ""You, as members of the armed forces, should not be expected to shoulder this burden."" On Wednesday, Democratic Representative Derek Kilmer of Washington statetold The Hill,externala food pantry for Coast Guard members in his district has already run out of food. Around 8,500 Coast Guard civilian employees were offered a ""managing your finances during a furlough""tip sheet,externalearlier this month, including budgeting suggestions like having a garage sale or monetising hobbies. In addition to pay, these employees are missing federal housing subsidies that help offset their expensive coastal housing, according to the Washington Post.

Affected websites include the US Department of Justice, the Court of Appeals and Nasa. According to internet services website Netcraft, more than 80 security certificates used by .gov websites have expired. US shutdown leaves websites insecure The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended all non-essential work, causing nationwide concerns over unsafe food as most inspections have stopped. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Wednesday said the agency was working to ensure ""high risk"" facility checks continue. He said about one third of the FDA's food inspections are considered high risk, looking at goods like cheese, fresh produce and seafood. ""It's not business as usual, and we are not doing all the things we would do under normal circumstances,"" Mr Gottliebtold NBC News,external. According toa report by Syracuse University,external, over 42,000 immigration hearings have been cancelled as of 11 January. That number will go up by 20,000 cases each week, researchers estimate. The current backlog is already over 800,000. Immigration courts have been dealing with high numbers of cases and these indefinite delays will have a ""devastating impact"",Judge Dana Leigh Marks told PBS,external. Faced with deteriorating and increasingly hazardous conditions, including waste buildup and unsafe roads, National Parks across the country are struggling to stay open during the shutdown. With a skeleton staff unable to respond quickly to emergencies, at least seven people have died in parks since the shutdown,the Washington Post reported,external. In Joshua Tree,with ranger numbers down to just eight,external, vandals have cut down trees and used protected lands as campsites. On an administrative level, the parks are also facing issues: one couple toldCBS News,externaltheir wedding reservation at a park was abruptly cancelled ""due to administration"".

Lawmaker to take oath on Jefferson's Koran,"Ms Tlaib poses with supporters on her first day in Washington Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib has been sworn into office while wearing a traditional garment stitched by her Palestinian-born mother. Ms Tlaib had been expected to take her oath on a Koran owned by Thomas Jefferson, but changed her mind, according to the Detroit Free Press. Ms Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar became the first-ever Muslim female members of Congress on Thursday. Native-American Deb Haaland also wore traditional dress for the ceremony. The New Mexico Democrat, who is one of two first female Native American members of Congress, wore traditional dress of the Pueblo tribe, including silver and turquoise jewellery and moccasins. Native American Congresswoman Deb Haaland is wearing a traditional Pueblo outfit On Thursday, hundreds of lawmakers from across the US arrived in Washington to be sworn in as members of Congress. Although no text is required for the oath, many US lawmakers have traditionally held the Bible as they vowed to protect the US Constitution from ""all enemies, foreign and domestic"". In an interview with the Detroit Free Press,external, Ms Tlaib, 42, said she would be using the Koran owned by America's third president, but she later told the paper that she had instead decided to use a family Koran. ""My swearing in on the Koran is about me showing that the American people are made up of diverse backgrounds and we all have love of justice and freedom"". Ms Tlaib laughs as one of her children breaks into dabbing, a type of dance move, after she casts a vote for Speaker Pelosi ""It's important to me because a lot of Americans have this kind of feeling that Islam is somehow foreign to American history,"" she said. ""Muslims were there at the beginning... Some of our founding fathers knew more about Islam than some members of Congress now."" Allow Twitter content?

Islands hit as 270 containers fall off ship,"This video can not be played Footage filmed by the Dutch coastguard shows precariously balanced containers on board the MSC Zoe. Extensive debris has washed up on islands off the Dutch north coast after some 270 containers including chemicals fell off a cargo ship in a storm. As the extent of pollution became clear on five islands including Terschelling, coastguards searched the North Sea for missing containers. The cargo fell off the MSC Zoe near the German island of Borkum, but the tide carried many of them to the south-west. Initial images showed children's toys and TVs on Dutch beaches. But officials said three containers carried toxic substances, and Dutch and German coastguards warned local people to steer clear of them. One of those containers had a cargo of peroxide powder, and a 25kg bag of the chemical was found on the island of Schiermonnikoog on Thursday, along with several containers and their contents. The Panama-registered ship is described as the biggest in Europe, with a potential cargo of 19,000 containers. The Dutch coastguard searched for containers near the islands on Thursday As Storm Zeetje buffeted northern Germany with gale force winds late on Tuesday night, 270 containers of Zoe's cargo fell off the ship as it made its way through the Wadden Sea from the Belgian port of Antwerp. Waves of up to 10m (33ft) in height were reported on the night and images from the Dutch coastguard showed dozens of containers balanced precariously like dominoes on the deck, about to fall into the sea. By Wednesday morning, strong tides had already swept some of the containers on to beaches on Terschelling, Vlieland and Ameland and Dutch and German coastguard planes scoured the sea for the others. There were fears that other shipping could be damaged by the cargo. The Geneva-basedMSC company which owns the ship has asked a salvage company to use sonar equipment,externalto help retrieve the missing containers.

Democrats vow to pass US shutdown bills,"Democrats have vowed to pass bills that would end a government shutdown as they took control of the US House of Representatives on Thursday. But the bills will not include funding for President Donald Trump's Mexican border wall, the cause of the shutdown. The impasse will therefore continue, as Republicans still control the Senate and say they will not pass the funding bills without Mr Trump's approval. The partial shutdown has now lasted 13 days, affecting some 800,000 workers. Shutdowns occur when Congress fails to approve a budget for government operations, or the president refuses to sign it, by a certain deadline. Mr Trump's Republicans had passed a budget bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) funding for the wall in December, when they still had a majority in the House but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. The House majority has passed to the Democrats following the November mid-term elections. The impact of the government shutdown The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman Lawmaker to take oath on Jefferson's Koran Nancy Pelosi, who is the new House majority leader, said the Democrats would quickly pass budget legislation providing sufficient funds to end the shutdown. But she was quite clear what it would not include. Speaking onthe Today show,externalon Thursday, she reiterated: ""Nothing for the wall."" ""There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, 'We want you to do something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars,'"" she said. ""That sends the wrong message about who we are as a country."" Ms Pelosi also said she believed a sitting president could be indicted - althoughJustice Department guidelines disagree,external. How women are changing the face of Congress How US mid-terms just got worse for Trump The Democrats will try again to pass the blame for the shutdown on to the president, pointing out that the bills they will pass would be similar to legislation that had won bipartisan support in the Senate in December before Mr Trump signalled he would not back it. A Thai tourist snaps the consequences of the partial shutdown ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Ms Pelosi said. ""We have given the Republicans a chance to take yes for an answer."" One Democrat bill would temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security until 8 February, while another measure would fund other departments closed by the partial shutdown until 30 September. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said Republicans there will not back measures that Mr Trump does not support. He called the Democrats' move a ""total nonstarter"" and a ""political sideshow"". The BBC's David Willis says the legislation would be dead on arrival in the Senate. Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence met with Republican and Democratic leaders on Wednesday He held a meeting with congressional leaders in the situation room of the White House on Thursday. Mr Trump sought to frame the discussion more in the context of national security than budgetary matters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There was no agreement with the Democrats, although talks will continue on Friday. US media reported that Mr Trump, when asked why he would not end the shutdown, had said: ""I would look foolish if I did that."" A White House official later told Associated Press this meant Mr Trump believed it would be foolish not to pay for border security. In his first cabinet meeting of the new year, the president said the shutdown would last as long as it took to get his funding, adding ""could be a long time or could be quickly"". Mr Trump reportedly told Ms Pelosi she should support the wall as she was a ""good Catholic"" and the Vatican City had a wall. About 25% of the US federal government has no funding Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury Around 800,000 federal workers are now furloughed - that is, temporarily laid off due to a lack of funding - or working without pay The National Park Service has suspended all non-emergency services Many museums are closed Science labs face repercussions as many federally employed scientists have stopped working Native American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms.

Nancy Pelosi elected to lead diverse House,"This video can not be played Pelosi said she was privileged to serve with more than 100 women in Congress California Democrat Nancy Pelosi has again been elected as Speaker - the third most powerful role in Washington - in the US House of Representatives. She reclaimed the gavel after the most diverse class of lawmakers were sworn in and as Democrats took control of the House after mid-term elections gains. Her victory came as the US government remained partly shut down in a row over funds for the president's border wall. Ms Pelosi has said she wants to end the shutdown but will not support the wall. ""I'm particularly proud to be a woman Speaker of the house of this Congress, which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote,"" she said. ""And, that we all have the ability and the privilege to serve with over 100 women members of Congress - the largest number in history. "" Ms Pelosi, 78, seized the gavel as the House welcomed more women than ever before in the 116th Congress. Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (second left), Barbara Lee, Jahana Hayes, Lauren Underwood, and Sheila Jackson-Lee As of Thursday, 102 women serve in the House, an all-time high, including 36 newly elected members and a record 43 women of colour. While Republican women marked some firsts this past election season - like Marsha Blackburn becoming the first female Tennessee senator - the vast majority of these new lawmakers are Democrats. Among them are the first Muslim congresswomen - Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar - and the first Native American women to serve - New Mexico's Debra Haaland and Kansas' Sharice Davids. The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman Lawmaker to take oath on Jefferson's Koran How women are changing the face of Congress Nancy Pelosi stops for a photograph with her fellow Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York also became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. While celebrating the Democratic diversity during the swearing-in ceremonies, some on social media highlighted the contrast to the Republican members, who are mostly white men. Allow Twitter content?

Carol Miller of West Virginia is the only new female Republican representative, bringing the total number of conservative women in the House to 13 - a decrease from 23 before the mid-term elections. The 116th Congress has become the most diverse in history The first day of a new Congress is usually like the first day of school. New arrivals wander the halls in a daze. It's all handshakes and smiles; ceremony and sunshine. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate There was a big cloud over the proceedings at the Capitol this day, however. For the first time in US history, a government shutdown - the fourth-longest on record already - has stretched from one Congress into the next. There were still receptions and flowery speeches to supporters who travelled to Washington for the occasion. But the champagne toasts will be abbreviated, as the real work in Congress begins almost immediately. The House Democrats scheduled votes for their legislation to reopen the government just hours after the swearing-in ceremonies wrapped up. This is the opening move, however. Republicans in the Senate have pledged to only vote on measures that have Donald Trump's support - and the president continues to demand his border wall funding. As Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, told me earlier today, there's ""no end in sight"" for the shutdown. ""I'm realistic, not optimistic,"" he added. It may be a new day and a new Congress, but hope is already a scarce commodity. The partial US government shutdown began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December. Ms Pelosi and her fellow House Democrats have vowed to pass spending bills to end the shutdown, but have insisted the bills will not include any funding for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico. In her remarks on Thursday, Ms Pelosi promised to re-open the government ""to meet the needs of the American people"". ""I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unified,"" she added. ""Let us respect each other and respect the truth."" However, Senate Republicans, who must also agree on the legislation, have said they will not pass any bills without the president's approval, which means the gridlock will probably continue. Mr Trump's Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (Â£4bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate. Democrats won the majority of the House in the November mid-term elections. Speaking from the White House briefing room for his first time ever on Thursday, Mr Trump congratulated Ms Pelosi, saying: ""It's a very, very great achievement and hopefully we're going to work together."" The impact of the government shutdown Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats would quickly pass budget legislation providing sufficient funds to end the shutdown, but has not offered specifics. Speaking onthe Today show,externalon Thursday, she reiterated: ""Nothing for the wall."" ""There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, 'We want you to do something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars,'"" she said. ""That sends the wrong message about who we are as a country."" Ms Pelosi also said she believed a sitting president could be indicted - althoughJustice Department guidelines disagree,external. How US mid-terms just got worse for Trump The Democrats will also try to pass the blame for the shutdown on to the president, pointing out that the bills they will pass would be similar to legislation that had won bipartisan support in the Senate in December before Mr Trump signalled he would not back it. ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Ms Pelosi said. ""We have given the Republicans a chance to take yes for an answer."" Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence met with Republican and Democratic leaders on Wednesday One Democrat bill would temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security until 8 February, while another measure would fund other departments closed by the partial shutdown until 30 September. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said Republicans there will not back measures that Mr Trump does not support. He called the Democrats' move a ""total nonstarter"" and a ""political sideshow"". The president is due to resume budget talks with top Democrats and Republicans on Friday. About 25% of the US federal government has no funding Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury Around 800,000 federal workers are now furloughed - that is, temporarily laid off due to a lack of funding - or working without pay Native American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling National Parks have become hazardous without staff #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown Fashion consultant Tim Gunn, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, and singer Tony Bennett were guests of Pelosi Before taking the oath Ms Pelosi' invited her grandchildren, as well as any other children present in the chamber, to join her at the dais. Looking on was ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"" singer Tony Bennett, 92, who was a guest of Ms Pelosi andreportedly serenaded her at a dinner at the Italian embassy,externalthe night before. She also invited friends Tim Gunn from TV programme Project Runway, and Mickey Hart, the drummer of the San Francisco-based rock group the Grateful Dead. Ms Pelosi has previously spoken of her family's love for the Grateful Dead. When she was first sworn in as Speaker in 2007, she was joined by Mr Hart and other members of the psychedelic rock band who later celebrated by performing a concert in her honour.

Trans 'pioneer' Julia Grant dies at 64Julia Grant was the subject of five BBC documentaries chronicling her transition.,"Julia Grant appeared in a series of BBC documentaries, starting in 1979 Julia Grant, the first trans woman to share her story on primetime British TV, has died at the age of 64 following a short illness. Ms Grant rose to prominence after appearing in the 1979 BBC documentary, A Change Of Sex. The BBC Two show, and its four follow-ups, told the story of her transition. David Pearson, who directed the series, described her as a ""pioneer"" who helped start ""a huge change in public attitudes towards trans people"". Ms Grant survived bowel cancer in recent years but suffered from multiple health problems in 2018 and died on 2 January. How do trans people decide their name? The schools learning from transgender students Her brother, Gary Roberts, told the BBC she had ""worked tirelessly for her community"". He added: ""You could say she was a bit like Marmite, but she probably built more bridges in her community than she burnt. ""She inspired a lot of people to believe in themselves and was always there to fight the cause."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Pearson added: ""It's difficult if you weren't around at that time to realise how closed and secretive that whole [trans] scene was - and the gay scene to some extent. ""Essentially, overnight, she made it possible for people to understand what it was like - and she continued to do that."" LGBTQ+ rights campaigner and Manchester Liberal Democrat leader John Leech said Ms Grant had been ""rightfully looked up to by many as a leader in the LGBTQ+ community, in particular here in Manchester"". Ms Grant first became involved in the BBC documentary series after contacting the broadcaster to complain about it describing a transvestite as a transsexual, she said in 2014. After speaking to a producer on the phone, she agreed to become the subject of a film exploring the process of transitioning to Julia. The documentary film, which eventually became a series, introduces her as catering manager George, who wishes to have gender reassignment surgery. It followed her journey from seeking advice at Charing Cross Hospital to living as a woman socially for a year, having surgery and then her life after this point. Almost nine million people tuned in to watch the first episode. This video can not be played Trans pioneer Julia Grant speaks to a psychiatrist about transitioning in 1979 Despite some negative coverage of the show by tabloid newspapers, the response from viewers was ""overwhelmingly positive"", Mr Pearson said. He added Ms Grant told him later in life that changing her gender was the ""best thing she ever did"". Born in Preston and raised with five sisters and two brothers in Fleetwood, Ms Grant worked at various points as a chef, sex worker, NHS adviser, writer, ceramics teacher, bar owner, hotel owner and festival organiser. She lived in Spain, France and the Netherlands. As well as appearing in the BBC documentaries, Ms Grant wrote two books about her life, helped set up Benidorm Gay Pride and spent time in the US counselling young people considering gender reassignment surgery. She remained active in the trans community throughout her life, although Mr Pearson says in more recent times some of her views have become increasingly controversial. In particular she didn't agree with young children transitioning using surgery, hormones or what is now known as the ""social gender role transition"" in which they live in their preferred gender identify full time. Correction 27 February 2018: This story originally said Ms Grant's opposition to children transitioning through surgery had been seen as controversial by some of her peers. It has now been amended to clarify that this controversy related primarily to her additional opposition to children having some other forms of gender realignment.

Apple shares sharply lower in US trading,"Apple's shares ended Thursday down nearly 10% after chief executive Tim Cook blamed a slowdown in China sales for falling revenues. On Wednesday, the iPhone maker said it expected revenue of about $84bn (Â£67bn) for the last three months of 2018, down from a forecast of at least $89bn. Earlier, in Europe, shares in fashion firm Burberry were nearly 6% lower. LVMH and Hermes shares also fell. Those companies are increasingly reliant on Chinese sales. Like at other consumer goods companies, the festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter, but revenues of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016. Wednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years, prompting the share price plunge. Apple, which was until recently the largest publically trade company in the US, is now worth less than Microsoft, Amazon and Google's parent company, Alphabet. In a letter to investors,externalon Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" he said. Apple blames China for sales forecast cut â¢Is Apple making China a scapegoat? What's gone wrong at Apple? However, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones. It appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off. Production cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices. ""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. The firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year. Analysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands. On Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence. ""As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,"" Mr Cook wrote in the letter. He added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong. ""While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat?

Three convicted over BBC reporter's killing,"Ahmad Shah was gunned down in April last year A special Afghan tribunal has convicted three men of being involved in the murder of BBC journalist Ahmad Shah, a spokesman for the attorney general's office has told the BBC. Mr Shah, who worked for the BBC's Pashto language service, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen last April. The special anti-terrorism tribunal sentenced one man to death, the second one to 30 years in prison, and the third one to six years in prison. The case is going to the appeals court. The identity of Mr Shah's murderers have not been made public and their motive is not clear. The attorney general's office said the three were detained in Parwan prison (also known as Bagram jail), which mostly houses prisoners accused of terrorism, and the trial was held there. Remembering the BBC's talented Ahmad Shah The hell of losing loved ones in Afghanistan Remembering photographer Shah Marai Ahmad Shah joined the BBC from local radio in early 2017 with a brief to cover his home province of Khost, in south-eastern Afghanistan, but he branched out to cover the neighbouring provinces of Paktia and Paktika as well for television, radio and online. He first started working for the BBC as a freelance contributor before being recruited as a full-time reporter by BBC Pashto. He was killed as he cycled home to the village where he lived outside Khost city, and died of his injuries in hospital. Local security officials say the attack was carried out by two gunmen riding a motorbike. Mr Shah had not received any work-related threat or threatening calls, and his family was involved in no feuds, according to his father. The Taliban denied any involvement in his killing, saying ""he was a professional journalist and we are saddened"" by his death. It remains unclear why Mr Shah was killed He was the fifth BBC staff member to have been killed in Afghanistan since the country's devastating civil war in the 1990s. The others were: Mirwais Jalil, 25, who was attacked by four gunmen in 1994 Abdul Samad Rohaniwho was shot dead in Helmand Province in 2008 Ahmed Omed Khpulwak, 25, who was mistakenly killed by Nato-led forces in 2011 Mohammed Nazir, a BBC driver who was killed in a bomb attack in 2017 Dozens of private radio stations and TV channels, as well as hundreds of publications, have been launched in Afghanistan in recent years. Butthe country remains one of the most dangerous places for journalists,externalin the world. The day Ahmad Shah was shot dead, 30 April, was the deadliest for the media in the country's history. Nine members of the press had been killed earlier in the day as they gathered to cover a suicide attack in Kabul.

Pelosi's remarkable comeback,"When Nancy Pelosi is sworn in as Speaker of the House on Thursday, she becomes not just the third most powerful US politician but also the leader of the Trump opposition. Both loved and loathed, her comeback story is an extraordinary tale of political survival. After eight years in the political wilderness, Nancy Pelosi is back on top. In 2007, the California Democrat made history as the first female speaker of the US House of Representatives, but it was short-lived. This time, she's at the helm of a resurgent party with responsibility for initiating new laws through the lower chamber of Congress, not to mention guiding a slew of new investigations into the president. And she's done so despite being written off multiple times and labelled a pedestrian public speaker prone to the occasional gaffe, having high disapproval ratings and becoming a lightning rod for Republicans. Tying her name to embattled Democratic candidates had been an effective weapon for conservatives in the past but in the 2018 mid-term elections, it lost its punch. This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate In Virginia, for example, Republican incumbent David Brat mentioned Nancy Pelosi and her ""liberal agenda"" 21 times in an hour and a half at a debate. His Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, finally shot back: ""I question again whether Congressman Brat knows which Democrat in fact he's running against... My name is Abigail Spanberger."" She went on to win the district, one of 40 Democrats who captured Republican-held seats, giving the Democrats their largest surge in the House since the 1970s Watergate scandal. Now, with her return to the speaker's chair, Ms Pelosi again becomes the most powerful woman in US politics. It caps a remarkable journey for someone who grew up the youngest child in a family steeped in East Coast big-city politics, made a political name for herself in the most liberal corners of California and has dominated Democratic politics for nearly a decade and a half. This video can not be played Testy exchanges between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Office ""People have gone wrong by under-estimating her for years,"" says journalist Elaine Povich, who wrote a 2008 biography about Ms Pelosi. ""Never bet against her. She's consistently the hardest worker, the best organized and great vote counter."" These skills are going to be sorely tested in the days ahead, as the incoming speaker will have to balance the competing priorities of her Democratic caucus while facing incoming flames from the political Vesuvius that is Donald Trump. The public had a taste of such confrontations in December, when the two argued in the Oval Office about border wall funding. She emerged from that duel with Democrats singing her praises but for many on the left such fireworks should only be the beginning. They will be clamouring for aggressive oversight of the president while others want a legislative record that Democrats can run on. It's a recipe for intra-party conflict and indicates the treacherous path ahead for her to navigate. Although Republicans have typically painted Ms Pelosi as a ""San Francisco liberal"" enamoured with big government and far to the left on social issues, her roots are from a more practical style of politics on the other side of the continent. She grew up in a political family, one of seven children in the gritty East Coast city of Baltimore, Maryland, where her father - Thomas ""Big Tommy"" D'Alesandro Jr - was mayor. She was the youngest and the only girl. To be a politician in mid-century Baltimore meant succeeding at old-school Democratic machine politics. Keeping track of favours received and favours given. Knowing whom to help and whom to hurt - and how to do both. Ms Pelosi managed her family's political accounts, including answering the eight phone lines that connected to the house. She went to college in nearby Washington where she met and eventually married financier Paul Pelosi. They first moved to Manhattan, and then San Francisco, where Ms Pelosi started as a housewife. She had five children - four daughters and a son - in the space of six years. In 1976 she became involved in politics, using her old family connections to help then-California Governor Jerry Brown, running for president, win the Maryland primary. She then rose through the state's Democratic Party ranks, eventually becoming its chair. In 1988 - at the urging of the outgoing Democrat - she ran for a seat in Congress and won. In the House she worked her way up again. Because she represented a portion of the city with a large gay community, she made increasing Aids research funding a priority. She fought a multi-year bureaucratic battle to have a shuttered military base in San Francisco turned into a national park. Congresswoman Pelosi watches on as President Bill Clinton signs an executive order in 1993 In 2001, she ran against Maryland's Steny Hoyer - whom she once interned with back in Washington - for House minority whip, vote-counter and second in command of the caucus, and won a narrow victory. The next year she moved up to minority leader after Dick Gephardt of Missouri resigned. She was one of the highest-profile, most outspoken opponents of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and in 2005 successfully helped block President George W Bush's call for partial privatisation of the government-run Social Security retirement programme. When the Democrats won the majority in 2006 for the first time in 12 years, her legislative acumen had been established and her stand on the war - at least in the minds of Democrats - was vindicated. She became the clear choice for Speaker of the House and was elected by her party in a unanimous vote. In January 2007 the Californian made history as the first female speaker of the US House of Representatives. But four years later, Democrats lost control of the lower chamber of Congress. Despite the setback Ms Pelosi kept her head above the turbulent political waters, riding out a series of electoral defeats and beating back challenges within her own ranks, to take the gavel once more. Six legal headaches for Donald Trump How US mid-terms just got worse for Trump Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. It is second in line for the presidency, behind only the vice-president, although such an ascent would require an unlikely set of circumstances in which both offices were vacated. Its massive office, in the Capitol rotunda, reflects the prestige of the job, with its own balcony looking out toward the Washington Monument. Unlike the Senate, the majority party in the House - led by the speaker - has virtually unfettered control over the legislative process. The speaker and her deputies and committee chairs determine what bills are considered and voted on. They set the agenda and decide the rules governing debate. If a speaker can keep her majority in line - and Republicans over the last two years showed that is far from a certainty - the legislative process in the House can purr like a well-tuned machine. That was the case the last time Ms Pelosi was speaker. From 2009 to 2011, when Democrats had unified control of Congress and the White House, her chamber enacted an $840bn stimulus package in the aftermath of the 2008 economic collapse. She passed pro-union and cap-and-trade climate legislation (which never made it past the Senate and into law) and financial reform and a bill prohibiting gender discrimination in pay (which did). She also pushed hard to get the Affordable Care Act, which became the defining battle of the Barack Obama presidency, through the House and on to the president's desk. Deep in conversation with Barack Obama in 2014 Donna Edwards, then a member of the House from Maryland, describes Ms Pelosi's performance during the 2009 healthcare battles. ""In those negotiations, I watched Pelosi, the tactician,""she wrote in a Washington Post opinion article,external. ""She held scores of meetings, back-to-back, day into night. She juggled phone calls - House and Senate leaders, Cabinet secretaries, the president. ""All to get us to 'yes'. She paid the most attention to vulnerable members; Pelosi knew they would pay the highest price for doing the right thing, and they did. ""When all the men in the room wanted to give up - after the nose-dive in approval ratings, media vitriol and unrelenting protests - Pelosi started counting votes and doing the kind of bare-knuckles work that was needed."" Eight months after that final vote, Democrats lost 63 seats in the House and their majority - in part because of the conservative furore over healthcare reform, and Ms Pelosi's role in pushing it through. She had grown so politically toxic that she couldn't campaign publicly for Democrats. Republicans, smelling blood, aired more than 150,000 television spots that year that featured her - and she has become a favourite target ever since. It's part of the reason why,as recently as 2015, journalists were giving her ""practically zero chance"",externalof ever becoming speaker again. They were wrong. There are times in politics where the image matches the moment. Such was the case on 11 December, when Ms Pelosi walked out of the White House in a bright red coat, slipped on her sunglasses and addressed the gathered reporters. Her future, which had seemed uncertain even months earlier, was once again bright. She, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, had just finished a remarkable televised Oval Office sparring match with President Trump over border security and the impending government funding crisis. When Mr Trump implied she was not popular in her party, she shot back. ""Mr President, please don't characterise the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory."" This photo sparked a thousand memes Mr Trump wasn't all that wrong to suggest that Ms Pelosi was feeling some heat from members of her own party. During the mid-term elections, more than 60 Democratic candidates campaigned on a pledge to oppose her speakership bid. After their mid-term success, a group of 16 incoming House Democrats issued a letter calling on new party leadership. They suggested it was time for the 78-year-old Pelosi to hand over power to a new generation. In the ensuing weeks, however, the California Democrat went about slowly dismantling the rebellion. She peeled off some of the letter's signatories and sympathisers with promises of plum committee seats or prioritising their issues. Then came her White House showdown, which set Democrats buzzing and launched a thousand complimentary memes on social media. A day later Ms Pelosi all but secured her speakership with her biggest concession - agreeing to eight-year term limits for members of the House Democratic leadership, applied retroactively. ""Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" she said. Ms Pelosi is a woman in a party that has swept to power in large part due to the engagement and support of women. Fifty-eight percent of those who voted for Democrats in the House were women. There will be 89 women out of the 235 Democratic members of Congress. That's a far cry from when Ms Pelosi first entered Congress in 1988, when she was one of only 24 women in the entire 435-seat chamber. More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms. What does it mean for Congress - and America? So the question, then, is why has Ms Pelosi been a political survivor? She's not a compelling public speaker. Her delivery is choppy and, at times, grating. Her jokes range from mildly funny to groan-inducing. She can, however, count votes like few in Congress - a throwback to her days as the child of Baltimore city politics. She's exceedingly organised, in both her personal and professional life. Not far off from her 80th birthday, she is also tireless. She is up at 5:30 every morning and works late into the night. She seldom takes holidays. Perhaps because of these efforts, she's a fund-raising powerhouse. From 2002 to 2018, the period that marked her ascent to and occupation of the highest perch in her party's House leadership, she raised $680m for Democrats. ""Speaking was never her strong suit,"" Povich says. ""Her strong suit was the insider game, the coalition game, the organiser game."" Pelosi heads to the House chamber where her party swept back to power in 2018 In the days ahead, Ms Pelosi will face a formidable set of challenges. She must balance a restive base that yearns for confrontation with a more moderate Democratic establishment keen on keeping power, after eight years without. When asked recently about how she viewed Robert Mueller's ongoing Russia collusion investigation, her answer was an exercise in the art of the political dodge. ""From our standpoint, what we're interested in is meeting the needs of America's working families,"" she said. ""To spend our time lowering health-care costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs, increasing paycheques by building infrastructure of America. Both of those things are things that the president said he wanted to do during the campaign. So this is common ground."" Democrats these days appear to have little interest in finding common ground with Mr Trump. It's much more probable that the coming two years will be defined by acrimony, conflict and partisan gridlock. The part played by Ms Pelosi will be crucial. The Californian fought for eight long years to get back the gavel. It's time to see what she does with it.

Why China has its eye on space,"China is a relative late-bloomer when it comes to the world of space exploration. But just 15 years after it first sent an astronaut into orbit, China has become the first country to successfully land a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon. And in the next decades it plans not only to build a new space station, but also a base on the Moon and conduct missions to Mars. Importantly, Xi Jinping, the country's most powerful leader since Chairman Mao, has thrown his support behind the ""space dream"" - and with it billions in investment. Chinese state media, meanwhile, have cast the ""space dream"" as one step in the path to ""national rejuvenation"". So why are President Xi and China so keen to make their mark in space - and what does it mean for the rest of the world? According to Prof Keith Hayward, a fellow of the UK's Royal Aeronautical Society, China is being driven by the same motivations as the US, Russia and others. First, demand from the military, without which ""you would not have had half the money going in"". China mission lands on Moon's far side Second, as ""a good way to show off"". ""You could say that this is the space Silk Road - it demonstrates China is a force to be reckoned with,"" Prof Hayward notes. Third, hitherto untapped resources which have the potential to make whoever finds them wealthy. ""It is the classic triad that has driven investment in space for the better part of 50 odd years,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played The astronauts blasted off on 11 June to test rendezvous and docking technologies The landing of Chang'e-4 in January 2019 appears to sit comfortably within the second category - helping distinguish China as a force to be reckoned with, both globally and locally. ""It is something that is very, very good to have done,"" says Prof Hayward. ""It says, 'we may not have put a man on the moon but we are pretty damn close to it'. ""It also sends signals out to their neighbours - it is a good way of showing soft power, with a little bit of hard."" Why China is fixated on the Moon China's scientific revolution China itself has been open about the value of space exploration in terms of increasing its standing on the world stage. ""Lunar exploration is a reflection of a country's comprehensive national power,"" Prof Ouyang Ziyuan - one of the country's top scientists - told China's official newspaper People's Daily back in 2006. ""It is significant for raising our international prestige and increasing our people's cohesion."" But it is not the prestige which is likely to be of concern to countries like the US. Vice-President Mike Pence unveiled plans for a ""US Space Force"" in August 2018, saying it was needed because ""our adversaries have transformed space into a war-fighting domain already"". At the time, it was interpreted as a swipe at both Russia and China. However, despite China's latest success and future plans, Prof Hayward doesn't seem to think the US needs to be worried. ""The US is still a big, big spender - not necessarily through Nasa [the US space agency], but through the Pentagon,"" he said.  ""I cannot see China being able to match that level of spending."" But is this a new space race? After all, the landing came just days afterNasa's New Horizons probe successfully carried out a flyby of an icy worldsome 6.5bn km (4bn miles) away. India, meanwhile, has announced it will send a three-member team into space for the first time in 2022. It seems like everyone is keen to make their mark. So will China's advance worry other countries enough to cause them to adjust their future plans? Unlikely, says Prof Hayward. ""It is difficult to respond quickly - you are dealing here with some very long term plans."" Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' Tributes paid to 'Mother of the Hubble' How Chinese media reported the landing What's more, Bernard Foing, executive director of the European Space Agency's International Lunar Exploration Working Group, noted that any advance was good for the wider world. ""China has shown a great advance and a will to collaborate with international partners,"" he said. There is one country it cannot collaborate with, however: US counter-espionage legislation restricts Nasa from working bilaterally with Chinese nationals without express permission from Congress. It has also been suggested that, despite appearing to aim to play catch-up with the US and Russia, China potentially doesn't view itself as being in a race with anyone. ""China is following its own motivations and interests rather than pacing its programme in competition with anybody else,""John Logsdon, founder of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, told Wired magazine,externallast year. ""In my view, China is determining for itself what it wants to do, not in any formal competition with the quite uncertain plans of anybody else."" But, of course, space exploration is not just about political game playing. There are also ""genuine scientific objectives"" to the Chang'e-4 mission, Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society pointed out. A model of Chang'e 4 probe on display Prof Ouyang also spoke of the country's scientific and technological goals in an interview with the BBC back in 2013. ""In terms of the science, besides Earth we also need to know our brothers and sisters like the Moon, its origin and evolution and then from that we can know about our Earth,"" he said. And then there was the vast potential for resources, some of which could ""solve human beings' energy demand for around 10,000 years at least"". Bringing them back, however, remains a challenge - but one which China will seek to solve: Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth. There are many elements of Chinese mythology present in China's space exploration program.  to the Magpie bridge, China's relay satellite. Here's some background behind the names: Chang'e(pronounced Chang-er): China's lunar probe is named after the Moon goddess and one of the most popular figures in Chinese mythology. She was a beautiful young woman married to a famous archer, Hou-yi, who managed to win an immortality potion. He decided not to take it as it was only enough for one, giving it to Chang'e for safekeeping. But one day a student of Hou-yi tried to steal the potion. Unable to defeat him, Chang'e drank the potion and floated to the Moon, where she still lives. Hou-yi was heartbroken and every year when the Moon was at its fullest, he would lay out her favourite food in tribute to her - an annual tradition across China ever since. Jade rabbit:China's Moon rover is named after Chang'e's only companion on the Moon Magpie bridge:China's relay satellite takes its name from the story of a goddess's daughter who falls in love with a poor farm hand. They get married and eventually have children. But when the goddess finds out, she's furious - and banishes them to different sides of the Milky Way. Feeling sorry for the grieving couple, magpies decide that once a year, they would form a bridge to connect the two lovers. This day is celebrated every year in China, their own version of Valentine's Day. Where is Ultima Thule? Video, 00:01:04Where is Ultima Thule?

Chinese media hails probe landing,"State media described the landing as part of China's dream for a ""shared destiny"" Chinese state media and internet users are celebrating the Chang'e-4 probe landing on the far side of the Moon, calling it ""a major milestone in space exploration"", and comparing it favourably to past American and Russian missions. State broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) aired video simulations of the landing a couple of hours after it took place. Close-up pictures taken by the probe and relayed by the Queqiao (Magpie Bridge) satellite ""lifted the ancient mysterious veil"" of the far side, the broadcaster said. The mission was cast very much as an achievement for the world, not just China. ""The mission achieved humanity's first soft landing of a probe and the first relay communication between the Moon and Earth, opening a new chapter in human lunar exploration,"" CCTV said. The nationalist Global Times newspaper contrasted the ""open and cooperative"" nature of China's space mission with the US' Apollo and Soviet Union's lunar missions, which it described as driven by a ""struggle for hegemony"". China's lunar exploration mission ""has always harboured the dream of a human community of shared destiny"", it said. ""Since the start of our lunar exploration mission, all of our images and data have been presented openly to the international community and used by scientists worldwide,"" it added. News of the landing also generated some speculation internationally on Twitter, after some journalists and scientists noticed that two state media outlets - the China Daily newspaper and the broadcaster CGTN - deleted tweets confirming that the landing had been a success. The reason for the deletions is unclear but both outlets later released new tweets on the story, similar to the deleted ones, with only the time of the landing added. Twitter is largely blocked in China but the topic was also discussed by a few Chinese users on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, which is tightly moderated. ""China Daily and CGTN are both reporting the success of Chang'e-4 on Twitter. But there is no news at all from Xinhua back home,"" one user noted. Some Chinese social media users noticed the CGTN and China Daily tweet deletions Most users, however - numbering in the millions - expressed congratulations and pride in their country's achievements on Sina Weibo. On most state news portals, including Jinri Toutiao, Sina, Sohu, The Paper, Global Times and Xinhua, the Moon landing ranked second in popularity after a political story very important to Beijing -President Xi Jinping's New Year speech on Taiwan on 2 January. On Sina Weibo, the hashtag ""Chang'e-4 lands on far side of the moon"" was also pinned as an alternating top theme for the day on the platform's ""hot search"" list, along with news of China's new e-commerce law. A number of users strongly criticised Sina Weibo for not giving the landing sole top billing. ""Can't this be the top hot search item? Our country is too amazing!"" demanded one Weibo user. ""Scum Sina! This should be the first hot search item, OK? Great pride. Childhood dream!"" said another, popular Weibo post. State media outlets also widely shared images and video simulations of the landing on social platforms, including those banned in China BBC Monitoring,externalreports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Terrorist 'resisted' de-radicalisation,"Lewis Ludlow hoped to kill 100 people A man who planned to drive a van into 100 people in London was working with a government de-radicalisation programme at the time, a court has heard. Islamic State (IS) supporter Lewis Ludlow pleaded guilty last August to planning the Oxford Street attack and raising money for terrorism. But a sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey has now heard he was engaging with the Prevent programme at the time. Ludlow, from Rochester, Kent, told a contact: ""They think I'm stupid."" The former Royal Mail worker, a Muslim convert, has also used the name Ali Hussain. A phone, found in a storm drain near his home, contained images of ""hostile reconnaissance"" carried out at London landmarks, prosecutors said. He was put under 24-hour police surveillance and then arrested in April. The first of several attempts to engage Ludlow with Prevent had come in 2008 after he had been found carrying a knife at college, the court heard. Ludlow swore allegiance to Islamic State Ludlow, an associate of the convicted terrorist Anjem Choudhary, consistently refused to engage until late 2017 and early 2018 when he met an assigned mentor 17 times. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said an undercover police officer had observed Ludlow telling a contact: ""I have been exaggerating my depression and they think I'm stupid. I'm naive but not stupid or mad."" In messages with the contact, recovered by police, Ludlow wrote: ""I resisted the same programme twice in the past."" The woman had advised him to ""be polite with them,"" adding: ""Even if u dont believe it, fake it."" Ludlow, by then under intensive surveillance, replied: ""Yes."" Daniel De Simone, BBC News Home Affairs The government's controversial Prevent strategy is intended to stop people becoming involved in extremism or terrorist activity. Unlike its Desistance and Disengagement strand, which can be mandatory and is aimed at people already convicted of terror offences or returning from conflict zones, other parts of it are voluntary for adults and cannot be forced on those identified as needing support. Ahmed Hassan, the Parsons Green bomber, is one of several extremists who have notionally engaged with Prevent, while carrying on regardless. The details of Ludlow's meetings with his Prevent mentor are confidential and were not set out in court. However, it's understood that some involved in his case thought he was engaged in a sincere attempt at change. Those who were already investigating him had a different view. Attempts were made to involve Ludlow in Prevent over a decade, but if someone does not want to honestly de-radicalise they cannot be compelled. During the hearing, Ludlow took to the witness box. Evidence was being heard despite Ludlow's guilty pleas because there are still unresolved issues between the prosecution and defence ahead of sentencing. Asked by defence barrister Rebecca Trowler QC why he had said ""yes"" to a suggestion from the contact about faking engagement with Prevent, Ludlow said: ""I just thought that's her advice and I'll take it. I just didn't want any hassle."" Ludlow, who converted to Islam aged 16, said he had felt harassed by MI5 and Prevent, which is why he planned to move to the Philippines early last year. He told the court he first met Islamic extremist Anjem Choudhary and the now banned group al-Muhajiroun in 2010, adding that at first ""they seemed very nice"" before ""things went sour"". Ludlow said he fully disengaged from the group in 2016 after concluding ""this is giving me nothing but trouble"". Ms Trowler said Ludlow was ""a vulnerable man"" because of his mental health difficulties, his autism and associated depression. She said he was acting under the directions from the senior extremist in the Philippines and that his attack preparations were ""embryonic, of low value, and highly unlikely to come to fruition"". Ludlow made detailed notes of possible targets in London Police discovered he was communicating with a leading extremist in the Philippines, planning a multiple casualty vehicle attack in central London, and scouting targets such as the Disney Store on Oxford Street, the court had heard earlier. In a torn-up note recovered from a bin hear his home, Ludlow wrote ""it is a busy street it is ideal for an attack. It is expected nearly 100 could be killed."" Mr Heywood said images taken by Ludlow of various London landmarks were ""an exercise in reconnaissance"" to identify locations to carry out ""possible attacks against civilians"". Ludlow carried out ""hostile reconnaissance"" at landmarks including Madame Tussauds In January 2018, Ludlow bought a ticket to fly to the Philippines but he was stopped at the airport and his passport was seized. He claimed he was going to the country as a sex tourist but was found to have been in communication with a man named Abu Yaqeen in an area with a significant IS presence. In March, Ludlow sent him money via PayPal and created the Facebook account Antique Collections, which he was alleged to have used as a front to send money to south-east Asia for terrorism. The Old Bailey heard he filmed himself pleading allegiance to IS and stated: ""I spit on your citizenship, your passport, you can go to hell with that."" Ludlow was filmed in the company of Islamic extremist Trevor Brooks Ludlow called himself ""The Ghost"" The court was also shown images of Ludlow at public events with prominent Islamic extremists Anjem Choudary and Trevor Brooks. The hearing, which is expected to last three days, continues.

China mission lands on Moon's far sideThe robotic space mission is the first landing on the side of the Moon that never faces Earth.Science & EnvironmentComments,"This video can not be played Far side of Moon captured by Chinese spacecraft China says it has successfully landed a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first ever such attempt and landing. At 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT), the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, state media said. It is carrying instruments to analyse the unexplored region's geology, as well to conduct biological experiments. The landing is being seen as a major milestone in space exploration. There have been numerous missions to the Moon in recent years, but the vast majority have been to orbit, fly by or impact. The last crewed landing was Apollo 17 in 1972. Why China has its eye on the stars All pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite The Chang'e-4 probe has already sent back its first pictures from the surface, which were shared by state media. With no direct communication link possible, all pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite before being relayed to Earth. Previous Moon missions have landed on the Earth-facing side, but this is the first time any craft has landed successfully on the unexplored and rugged far side. Some spacecraft have crashed into the far side, either after system failures, or after they had completed their mission. How Chinese media reported the landing The myths and music about the moon's dark side Ye Quanzhi, an astronomer at Caltech, told the BBC this was the first time China had ""attempted something that other space powers have not attempted before"". The far side is not visible from the Earth due to ""tidal locking"" The Chang'e-4 was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China on 7 December; it arrived in lunar orbit on 12 December. It was then directed to lower itself toward the Moon, being careful to identify and avoid obstacles, Chinese state media say. The Chang'e-4 probe is aiming to explore a place called the Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n crater, located within the much larger South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history. ""This huge structure is over 2,500km (1,550 miles) in diameter and 13km deep, one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System and the largest, deepest and oldest basin on the Moon,"" Andrew Coates, professor of physics atUCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory,externalin Surrey, told the BBC. The event responsible for carving out the SPA basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the Moon's crust and down into the zone called the mantle. Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity. The science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin,allowing them to identify variations in its composition.,external A third objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon. Chang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations. Scientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea. A mock-up of the Chang'e-4 lander and rover, on display in Dongguan, China The lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere. The arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say. Other equipment/experiments include: A panoramic camera A radar to probe beneath the lunar surface An imaging spectrometer to identify minerals An experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations. Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth. The lunar far side is often referred to as the ""dark side"", though ""dark"" in this case means ""unseen"" rather than ""lacking light"". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime. China launch will prep for Moon landing Why China is fixated on the Moon China's scientific revolution But because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth. The far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the ""maria"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side. In an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September,external, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: ""The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link."" So the landers mustcommunicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao- or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May. Queqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina. China wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia. In 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon. It will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022. The chief designer of China's lunar exploration programme, Wu Weiren, has described Thursday's landing as ""an important milestone"" for the country's space effort, state media report. A full-size model of the Tianhe core module of China's space station The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success. But Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa. ""The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,"" he told the BBC. Ye Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open. ""They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,"" he said. China has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration. Only in 2003, it sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US. The far side landing has already been heralded by experts at Nasa as ""a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment"".

Islands hit as cargo falls off shipA big clean-up starts on five Dutch islands after a storm sweeps cargo into the sea.Europe,"This video can not be played Footage filmed by the Dutch coastguard shows precariously balanced containers on board the MSC Zoe. Extensive debris has washed up on islands off the Dutch north coast after some 270 containers including chemicals fell off a cargo ship in a storm. As the extent of pollution became clear on five islands including Terschelling, coastguards searched the North Sea for missing containers. The cargo fell off the MSC Zoe near the German island of Borkum, but the tide carried many of them to the south-west. Initial images showed children's toys and TVs on Dutch beaches. But officials said three containers carried toxic substances, and Dutch and German coastguards warned local people to steer clear of them. One of those containers had a cargo of peroxide powder, and a 25kg bag of the chemical was found on the island of Schiermonnikoog on Thursday, along with several containers and their contents. The Panama-registered ship is described as the biggest in Europe, with a potential cargo of 19,000 containers. The Dutch coastguard searched for containers near the islands on Thursday As Storm Zeetje buffeted northern Germany with gale force winds late on Tuesday night, 270 containers of Zoe's cargo fell off the ship as it made its way through the Wadden Sea from the Belgian port of Antwerp. Waves of up to 10m (33ft) in height were reported on the night and images from the Dutch coastguard showed dozens of containers balanced precariously like dominoes on the deck, about to fall into the sea. By Wednesday morning, strong tides had already swept some of the containers on to beaches on Terschelling, Vlieland and Ameland and Dutch and German coastguard planes scoured the sea for the others. There were fears that other shipping could be damaged by the cargo. The Geneva-basedMSC company which owns the ship has asked a salvage company to use sonar equipment,externalto help retrieve the missing containers. Overnight into Thursday, the MSC Zoe docked at Bremerhaven. Several containers were spotted in German waters and a further 11 were seen by the Dutch coastguard floating between the islands of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog. Funeral urns wash up on Dutch beaches Cigarettes removed from container on English coast MSC Napoli hero recalls dramatic rescue By Thursday five Dutch islands in the Wadden Sea had seen debris from the MSC Zoe wash up on its beaches. On Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog volunteers were helping on Thursday to clear up the mess spilt the previous day. Around 100 soldiers were being sent to the islands part of the clean-up operation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Among the rubbish found on Terschelling's long, sandy beaches were shoes, bags, cushions, chairs, TVs and plastic cups. Broken TVs lay on the beach on Terschelling hours after the containers fell into the sea Children found pink toys among the rubbish. Volunteers had to scoop polystyrene packaging from the dunes. On Ameland, local officials said 130,000kg of debris had been cleared up along an 8km (five-mile) stretch of beach. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When the MSC Napoli ran aground off the south-west coast of England in 2007, 80 containers washed ashore. Police had to shut a local beach as people scoured the debris for motorbikes and other merchandise. Police had to use old laws on scavenging that require people to return goods from the stricken ship. Although some flat screen TVs were found in the debris on Wednesday, most concerns on the Dutch islands focused on the environmental damage to the area.

Apple shares down over 9% in US trading,"Apple's shares ended Thursday down nearly 10% after chief executive Tim Cook blamed a slowdown in China sales for falling revenues. On Wednesday, the iPhone maker said it expected revenue of about $84bn (Â£67bn) for the last three months of 2018, down from a forecast of at least $89bn. Earlier, in Europe, shares in fashion firm Burberry were nearly 6% lower. LVMH and Hermes shares also fell. Those companies are increasingly reliant on Chinese sales. Like at other consumer goods companies, the festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter, but revenues of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016. Wednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years, prompting the share price plunge. Apple, which was until recently the largest publically trade company in the US, is now worth less than Microsoft, Amazon and Google's parent company, Alphabet. In a letter to investors,externalon Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" he said. Apple blames China for sales forecast cut â¢Is Apple making China a scapegoat? What's gone wrong at Apple? However, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones. It appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off. Production cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices. ""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. The firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year. Analysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands. On Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence. ""As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,"" Mr Cook wrote in the letter. He added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong. ""While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat?

Call to protect food standards after Brexit,"Chlorinated chicken is a familiar feature on US shelves but is banned in the EU Food standards must be protected after the UK leaves the EU, the farming industry has said. The National Farmers Union said it had heard enough ""warm words"" from ministers and action was needed now. Its president, Minette Batters, said any attempt to encourage cheap imports after Brexit in an effort to cut food bills should be ""fought to the death"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove said standards should not be ""bartered away"" in pursuit of short-term trade gains. In a speech to the Oxford Farming Conference, he also urged MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal later this month and warned of ""considerable turbulence"" for farmers if the UK left on 29 March without a deal with the EU. The NFU has said a no-deal exit would be ""catastrophic"" for the industry and could potentially open the UK to goods that are not produced to the high standards of food safety, animal welfare and environmental protection that are the hallmark of British farmers. Farmers warned of Brexit no-deal 'turbulence' Brexit: A really simple guide It warned that to avoid food price rises as a result of a no-deal Brexit, the government could unilaterally lower import tariffs, encouraging food producers to buy in inferior materials. ""The biggest threat to us, the biggest threat to the environment is we decide to import cheap raw ingredients and add value to them under the union jack,"" Mrs Batters said. Please upgrade your browser ""That is A1 critical right now. Get that bit wrong and it really will not work."" Campaigners have warned the UK could be forced to allow imports of hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, currently banned by the EU, as part of any future trade deal with the US. While Brexit offered a ""massive"" export opportunity for British farmers, Mrs Batters said there were real risks to the reputation of the industry if import controls were relaxed. She urged Mr Gove to show leadership by getting guaranteed standards of minimum animal welfare, environmental protection and food ""enshrined in some form of legislation"". ""At the moment we've had a lot of warm words on standards,"" she said. ""We've had commitment from various ministers saying that we would not want a trade deal that brought food in produced to lower standards, but the real challenge is how. ""Of course agriculture's always the last chapter in any trade deal to be agreed so we feel it's really important, we don't want anybody lying down in front of a bus...we want it put in writing."" The government's proposals for agriculture after Brexit are contained in a new Agriculture Bill which is currently being debated in Parliament. Environmental campaigners said it should include plans for an independent regulator to ensure that minimum standards to protect water, soil, wildlife and animal welfare are maintained. ""We can only guarantee long-term food security by protecting and managing the natural assets which enable food production,"" said its chairman Martin Lines. ""If the government does not amend the bill to include minimum standards - and put a stop to the environmental degradation caused by intensive farming - British farmers will be in danger of losing their livelihoods."" Mr Gove said concerns the UK would have to lower its food standards to access US markets were not new, because they had been raised a few years ago during discussions over the now aborted plan for an EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership. ""The two particular foods that were in the headlines were chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-enhanced beef. I have been clear that we do not intend to lower our standards, as that would lead to uncertainty for the consumer and would undermine the strength of our domestic production and the reputation it enjoys."" While there were different ways of providing the assurances that producers and consumers wanted, he said he was keen on exploring more informative food labelling to identify products that were ""inappropriate, low quality or potentially unhealthy"". Labour called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that farming standards would not be undercut by any post-Brexit trade deals, while the Liberal Democrats said farmers needed certainty to plan ahead.

Gaming worth more than video and music,"Red Dead Redemption 2 sold more than one million physical copies in 2018 The video games sector now accounts for more than half of the UK's entire entertainment market, according to a new report. The industry is worth Â£3.86bn ($4.85bn) - more than double its value in 2007 - said the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA). That makes it more lucrative than video and music combined. The success is largely down to three games: Fifa 19, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. The games market has grown, despite the fact that the physical console and PC games market shrank slightly in 2018, and digital also had a modest 12.5% growth. Chief executive of ERA, Kim Bayley said: ""The games industry has been incredibly effective in taking advantage of the potential of digital technology to offer new and compelling forms of entertainment. Despite being the youngest of our three sectors, it is now by far the biggest."" Fifa remains a firm favourite with gamers Three games -  Fifa 19, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - each sold more than one million physical units in the UK during 2018. The figures do not take account of the success of mobile and free games such as Fortnite, which has more than 200 million players around the world. Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHS Markit said: ""During the last five years the games sector has benefited hugely from the mainstream adoption of games apps on smart devices, and the transition from physical distribution to digital distribution in established parts of the market such as console gaming. ""Games are now truly mass market and a very important part of the entertainment sector."" He added: ""Growth has been fuelled by the dominance of free content and in-game monetisation, which expands the adoption of games but also removes the cap on spending for those gamers that are really engaged in the experiences. ""The flexibility of interactive content means it is unique in that it can be monetised in this way, which is an advantage over other forms of entertainment.""

N Korea ambassador to Italy 'disappears',"Jo Song-gil was thought to have been living in Rome with his wife and children before he disappeared South Korea's spy agency has told officials that North Korea's ambassador to Italy has disappeared. The announcement follows unconfirmed reports that Pyongyang's top diplomat in Italy had sought asylum from an unidentified Western country. Jo Song-gil, the acting North Korean ambassador to Rome, is the son and son-in-law of high-ranking North Korean officials. The last senior diplomat to defect was the deputy ambassador in London. Thae Yong-ho abandoned his post in 2016, along with his wife and children. He defected to South Korea. As one of the highest-ranking officials to ever defect from the North, his move was seen as a blow to Kim Jong-un's regime. He would go on to urge the world to spread information in North Korea to undermine Mr Kim's status among his people. Jo Song-gil was the top envoy at North Korea's embassy in Rome Speaking after a briefing from the spy agency on Thursday, Kim Min-ki, a government MP, told reporters that Mr Jo fled the Rome embassy more than a month ago. ""Acting ambassador Jo Song-gil's term was ending in late November last year and he escaped the diplomatic compound in early November,"" the MP said. South Korean's National Intelligence Service, which interrogates all defectors from the North, told lawmakers they had not had any contact from him since then. The agency would not confirm that he is trying to defect to another country. My friend the North Korean defector Defector: Soft power 'could bring N Korea uprising' Meet North Korea's first family Mr Jo's wife is believed to be with him. Italy's foreign ministry has told the BBC that it has no record of an asylum request made by Mr Jo. Diplomatic sources said the last Italy heard of him was when officials received a note last year from the North Korean government saying that Mr Jo was being replaced. South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo has reported that Mr Jo is in a ""safe place"" with his family, citing a diplomatic source. Analysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul High-profile defections by one of North Korea's elite are rare and would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong-un. State media has often insisted that any defections by diplomats are part of a plot by South Korea or the United States to undermine its government. Pyongyang considers them traitors to the country and its people, and defectors say there can be severe consequences for any family members left behind. The last senior diplomat to defect, Thae Yong-ho, once said that he made his decision as he wanted to give his two sons an education outside the impoverished state. He has told reporters in South Korea that he worked with Jo Song-gil. He claimed that Mr Jo was responsible for delivering luxury goods to North Korea via an Italian company and that he may know more about Pyongyang's nuclear plans. This is the kind of information US intelligence services would be keen to get their hands on. But where is the 48-year-old envoy? Has he asked for asylum? It is unlikely any country will confirm Jo Song-gil's whereabouts until it is clear he and his family are safe. Mr Jo, 48, has been acting ambassador in Rome since October 2017 after Italy expelled then-ambassador Mun Jong-nam in protest over a North Korean nuclear test a month earlier. North Korea's embassy in Italy manages relations with the UN's Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization, which provides important aid to the country. Kim Jong-un facial mask stirs controversy The North Korean spies who want to go home North Korean diplomats stationed abroad usually have to leave several family members behind in Pyongyang to prevent their defection. But Mr Jo is thought to have been in Rome with his wife and children, privileges that suggest his family is influential. Both his father and father-in-law were diplomats. His father-in-law Lee Do-seop was a well-known ambassador to Thailand and Hong Kong, according to Thae Yong-ho. North Korean representatives overseas are said to be closely watched by their fellow diplomats for any sign of disloyalty to the regime. However several have defected over the past few decades. Thae Yong-ho was North Korea's deputy ambassador to Britain when he defected in 2016 They include Ko Yong-hwan and Hyon Song-il, who defected to the South in 1991 and 1996 respectively after abandoning their posts in Africa. Jang Sung-gil, a former ambassador to Egypt, took asylum in the US in 1997 with his family, including a brother who was a diplomat working in London. The disappearance of Jo Song-gil comes after a year that saw a dramatic turnaround in relations between North and South Korea, with three meetings held between the countries' leaders. But if Mr Jo has indeed defected, it will not impact inter-Korean relations, ""unless Pyongyang thinks the escape was arranged by South Korean authorities"", Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, told the AFP news agency.

Apple shares fall almost 9% at US open,"Apple's shares ended Thursday down nearly 10% after chief executive Tim Cook blamed a slowdown in China sales for falling revenues.

Hospitals 'coping better with winter',"Hospitals seem to be coping better with winter, NHS England figures suggest. Data released for the festive period showed fewer A&E closures and ambulance delays than the same period last year. Levels of flu and vomiting bug Norovirus also remain low. NHS England said the improvement was a result of good planning and hard work by staff. But senior doctors warned the picture could deteriorate in the coming week because of an impending cold snap. The figures released on Thursday cover the two weeks to last Sunday. They showed there were 32 A&E diverts - where doors are closed to ambulances. That compares with 45 in the same period last year. Meanwhile, about one in nine ambulance crews faced delays dropping patients off at hospital. It reached a peak of one in five last year. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""Thanks to the hard work and preparation of NHS staff, the health service is performing better this winter than last."" Christmas performance figures are not available yet for the rest of the UK.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Those working in the NHS are cautious about saying hospitals have escaped the chaos seen in previous winters. Last January, non-emergency operations had to be cancelled en masse to help ease the burden on A&Es and there were reports of large numbers of patients queuing in corridors. That is all still happening to some extent, but there is a sense that the service is coping better, with improved access to social care and GPs cited as two key factors. Nonetheless, pressures remain incredibly high, with the three key waiting-time targets for the NHS - covering A&Es, cancer and routine operations - still being missed. And there is also an acknowledgement that if a sustained cold spell develops, or if flu levels start rising, things could unravel. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said he was ""expecting severe difficulties"" as the cold snap sets in over the next week and added further stress to stretched NHS services. And he said hospitals still saw ""fits and spells of manic activity"" over the last week despite the signs of improvement.

Man jailed for BBC presenter rape threatsGordon Hawthorn sent letters to Points West presenter Alex Lovell over six years.Bristol,"BBC Points West presenter Alex Lovell was repeatedly sent threatening letters A man who stalked a BBC presenter with letters in which he threatened to rape her has been jailed. Gordon Hawthorn, 69, of Street, Somerset, sent the threats to Points West's Alex Lovell over six years. Ms Lovell started suffering panic attacks as a result of the threats, which included claims he was watching her closely enough ""to smell her hair"". At Bristol Crown Court the judge, Martin Picton, said Hawthorn left Ms Lovell ""frightened and miserable"". Ms Lovell began receiving Hawthorn's cards at the BBC's regional centre on Whiteladies Road, Bristol, in 2012. Hawthorn - who was jailed for two and a half years - had previously pleaded guilty at the city's magistrates' court to one count of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. Gordon Hawthorn pleaded guilty to one count of stalking involving serious alarm or distress He sent the presenter letters for more than six years but they became more threatening between January 2016 and March 2018, police said. His conduct ""amounted to stalking and caused Ms Lovell serious alarm or distress, which had an adverse effect on her usual day-to-day activities"", the charge stated. Reacting to the sentence, the 45-year-old said she welcomed the ""strong message"" sent out by the courts and that ""justice has been done"". ""I am really pleased that it is over but also that it sends a strong message that it's not OK and that anyone reporting being frightened in this way is going to be taken seriously,"" she added. Ms Lovell said she had suffered panic attacks and at times had been ""convinced he was near"". ""He said... that he was watching, that he was close enough to smell my hair."" ""There were four years of cards that were just filthy, and then suddenly there were two years of threats that got progressively worse."" She added notes were ""really terrifying""â¦ and they stated ""that he was strong enough to have raped several times before."" Hawthorn was caught following a police appeal, which led to a member of the public telling officers she had received a similar card. During his police interview Hawthorn was read a number of the messages he sent her. One card, with a rabbit on the front, said he ""only rapes blondes"" and asked: ""How does it feel... to now learn that your stalker has already raped six women."" It was signed: ""From your stalker and soon to be your rapist."" Tests showed Hawthorn's DNA matched that found on cards sent to Ms Lovell. Judge Picton said Hawthorn chose to send ""disgusting frightening letters"" to the presenter. ""The letters you sent caused distress and fear. She knew the author of those letters was watching. ""When out and about she couldn't be sure you wouldn't be watching for her."" Man admits BBC presenter rape threats Police hunt greetings card stalker Det Ch Insp Simon Brickwood from Avon and Somerset Police said Hawthorn was ""paying the price for his cruel campaign of harassment"". ""This case highlights the fact that stalking doesn't have to be physically watching or following someone."" He praised Ms Lovell for her ""bravery in speaking out about her distressing ordeal to encourage other victims of stalking and harassment to seek help and report offences"". Ms Lovell contacted police in January 2016 when the cards started to become more threatening Man admits BBC presenter rape threats Police hunt greetings card stalker HM Courts & Tribunals Service 'Peak yet to come' as people told to wear masks to limit virus spread Bristol doctor jailed for attacking petrol pumps at M25 services Great British Pub Awards runner-up donates prize money to local charity âHotter than a Turbo Island bonfireâ Sound engineer crafts device to play records through digital set up X-Press makes a Mark on local charity New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Why China has its eye on the stars,"China is a relative late-bloomer when it comes to the world of space exploration. But just 15 years after it first sent an astronaut into orbit, China has become the first country to successfully land a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon. And in the next decades it plans not only to build a new space station, but also a base on the Moon and conduct missions to Mars. Importantly, Xi Jinping, the country's most powerful leader since Chairman Mao, has thrown his support behind the ""space dream"" - and with it billions in investment. Chinese state media, meanwhile, have cast the ""space dream"" as one step in the path to ""national rejuvenation"". So why are President Xi and China so keen to make their mark in space - and what does it mean for the rest of the world? According to Prof Keith Hayward, a fellow of the UK's Royal Aeronautical Society, China is being driven by the same motivations as the US, Russia and others. First, demand from the military, without which ""you would not have had half the money going in"". China mission lands on Moon's far side Second, as ""a good way to show off"". ""You could say that this is the space Silk Road - it demonstrates China is a force to be reckoned with,"" Prof Hayward notes. Third, hitherto untapped resources which have the potential to make whoever finds them wealthy. ""It is the classic triad that has driven investment in space for the better part of 50 odd years,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played The astronauts blasted off on 11 June to test rendezvous and docking technologies The landing of Chang'e-4 in January 2019 appears to sit comfortably within the second category - helping distinguish China as a force to be reckoned with, both globally and locally. ""It is something that is very, very good to have done,"" says Prof Hayward. ""It says, 'we may not have put a man on the moon but we are pretty damn close to it'. ""It also sends signals out to their neighbours - it is a good way of showing soft power, with a little bit of hard."" Why China is fixated on the Moon China's scientific revolution China itself has been open about the value of space exploration in terms of increasing its standing on the world stage. ""Lunar exploration is a reflection of a country's comprehensive national power,"" Prof Ouyang Ziyuan - one of the country's top scientists - told China's official newspaper People's Daily back in 2006. ""It is significant for raising our international prestige and increasing our people's cohesion."" But it is not the prestige which is likely to be of concern to countries like the US. Vice-President Mike Pence unveiled plans for a ""US Space Force"" in August 2018, saying it was needed because ""our adversaries have transformed space into a war-fighting domain already"". At the time, it was interpreted as a swipe at both Russia and China. However, despite China's latest success and future plans, Prof Hayward doesn't seem to think the US needs to be worried. ""The US is still a big, big spender - not necessarily through Nasa [the US space agency], but through the Pentagon,"" he said.  ""I cannot see China being able to match that level of spending."" But is this a new space race? After all, the landing came just days afterNasa's New Horizons probe successfully carried out a flyby of an icy worldsome 6.5bn km (4bn miles) away. India, meanwhile, has announced it will send a three-member team into space for the first time in 2022. It seems like everyone is keen to make their mark. So will China's advance worry other countries enough to cause them to adjust their future plans? Unlikely, says Prof Hayward. ""It is difficult to respond quickly - you are dealing here with some very long term plans."" Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' Tributes paid to 'Mother of the Hubble' How Chinese media reported the landing What's more, Bernard Foing, executive director of the European Space Agency's International Lunar Exploration Working Group, noted that any advance was good for the wider world. ""China has shown a great advance and a will to collaborate with international partners,"" he said. There is one country it cannot collaborate with, however: US counter-espionage legislation restricts Nasa from working bilaterally with Chinese nationals without express permission from Congress. It has also been suggested that, despite appearing to aim to play catch-up with the US and Russia, China potentially doesn't view itself as being in a race with anyone. ""China is following its own motivations and interests rather than pacing its programme in competition with anybody else,""John Logsdon, founder of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, told Wired magazine,externallast year. ""In my view, China is determining for itself what it wants to do, not in any formal competition with the quite uncertain plans of anybody else."" But, of course, space exploration is not just about political game playing. There are also ""genuine scientific objectives"" to the Chang'e-4 mission, Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society pointed out. A model of Chang'e 4 probe on display Prof Ouyang also spoke of the country's scientific and technological goals in an interview with the BBC back in 2013. ""In terms of the science, besides Earth we also need to know our brothers and sisters like the Moon, its origin and evolution and then from that we can know about our Earth,"" he said. And then there was the vast potential for resources, some of which could ""solve human beings' energy demand for around 10,000 years at least"". Bringing them back, however, remains a challenge - but one which China will seek to solve: Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth. There are many elements of Chinese mythology present in China's space exploration program.  to the Magpie bridge, China's relay satellite. Here's some background behind the names: Chang'e(pronounced Chang-er): China's lunar probe is named after the Moon goddess and one of the most popular figures in Chinese mythology. She was a beautiful young woman married to a famous archer, Hou-yi, who managed to win an immortality potion. He decided not to take it as it was only enough for one, giving it to Chang'e for safekeeping. But one day a student of Hou-yi tried to steal the potion. Unable to defeat him, Chang'e drank the potion and floated to the Moon, where she still lives. Hou-yi was heartbroken and every year when the Moon was at its fullest, he would lay out her favourite food in tribute to her - an annual tradition across China ever since. Jade rabbit:China's Moon rover is named after Chang'e's only companion on the Moon Magpie bridge:China's relay satellite takes its name from the story of a goddess's daughter who falls in love with a poor farm hand. They get married and eventually have children. But when the goddess finds out, she's furious - and banishes them to different sides of the Milky Way. Feeling sorry for the grieving couple, magpies decide that once a year, they would form a bridge to connect the two lovers. This day is celebrated every year in China, their own version of Valentine's Day. Where is Ultima Thule? Video, 00:01:04Where is Ultima Thule?

The music and myths about the Moon,"A Chinese robot has started exploring the far side of the Moon. The Chang'e-4 probe will explore the surface and carry out geological experiments. China plans to follow this up with further missions to return Moon rock to laboratories on Earth. But it's not just scientists who are fascinated with the Moon's hidden face. Musicians, film-makers and, of course, conspiracy theorists have all been inspired by that secret, barren landscape. For music fans, the phrase Dark Side of the Moon will forever conjure up Pink Floyd's 1973 concept album. In reality, the far side of the Moon is not dark - we never see it because the Moon orbits the Earth at around the same rate it spins. All parts of the Moon receive sunlight. It's likely that the members of Pink Floyd weren't referring to this phenomenon of Tidal Locking with their album title, though. The Dark Side of the Moon, here, is a metaphor for mental illness. One of the first pictures of the far side of the moon. The Moon has been thought to have an effect on events - and moods - here on Earth for thousands of years. Ancient Babylonians recorded the phases of the Moon on clay tablets. But it wasn't until Isaac Newton identified gravity in the 18th Century that we began to understand its effect on tides. In 1959 a Russian probe took the first photographs of the Moon's hidden face, and it was first seen by the naked eye almost ten years later when American astronauts flew past. There seems to be something tantalising about the hidden side of the Moon, though. The thought that it's always there, circling the Earth, yet just out of reach. And that's sparked several conspiracy theories over the years. There have been claims that astronauts saw a secret lunar base there - even some kind of castle. And some have even gone so far as to suggest aliens were encountered on the lunar surface. Nasa, unsurprisingly, says there's no truth to any of these theories. It does seem possible, though, that at the height of the Cold War between the USA and Russia, both sides considered using the far side of the Moon for a show of force. Reports claim there were plans to detonate a nuclear bomb there as a show of strength. Thankfully even if that's true, the idea never got anywhere close to lift-off. No castles, no secret bases... this picture was sent back by the Chinese probe Writers and film-makers have been inspired by the far side of the Moon, too, though none seem to have produced anything with the longevity of Pink Floyd's masterpiece. A 1990 horror film entitled The Dark Side of the Moon tells the story of a group of astronauts who discover an abandoned shuttle there. They later discover it went missing in the Bermuda Triangle and is home to an alien which feeds on human souls. We haven't had the chance to watch, but its average score of 2.6 on Rotten Tomatoes seems about right. In literature, the website Goodreads returns more than 200 results for books entitled Dark Side of the Moon, including a 1976 tale from children's author William Corlett about the journey of a lonely, troubled astronaut. So whatever the Chang'e-4 probe tells us about rock formations and craters, it seems certain that the hidden face of the Moon will continue to exert a gravitational pull on imaginations here on planet Earth.

Two held over Channel migrant crossings,"National Crime Agency officers examine a boat at Greatstone beach in Kent that arrived carrying 12 migrants on 31 December 2018 Two men have been arrested on suspicion of arranging the ""illegal movement of migrants"" across the English Channel during December. The pair - an Iranian and a Briton - were arrested in Manchester. More than 230 people have reached the UK in small boats since November. The UK is due to redeploy two Border Force patrol boats to the Channel from the Mediterranean, where they have been helping with thethousands of people who have tried to cross to Europe. The 33-year-old Iranian and 24-year-old British man were arrested by the National Crime Agency in Pendleton, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday. The UK Border Force currently has two coastal patrol vessels in the Channel as well as a cutter, HMC Vigilant, which can rescue several boatloads of people at once. Home Secretary Sajid Javid says two of the three Border Force vessels currently in the Med -HMC Seeker and Protector,external- will return. But the Home Office would not give further ""operational"" details of where they were or when that might happen. Mr Javid is also reported to have requested help from the Royal Navy in the Channel - offshore patrol vessel HMS Mersey could be used. A total of 239 people are known to have reached the UK in small boats since November, including12 migrants found off the Kent coast last week. The Ministry of Defence said the armed forces were ""ready to provide additional capacity and expertise"". Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? Border Force vessels return to patrol Channel Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? UN warns on Mediterranean crossing danger It comes afterMr Javid sparked controversy during a visit to Border Force staffin Dover on Wednesday by questioning whether those risking their lives to cross the English Channel in small boats were ""genuine"" refugees. The home secretary also defended escalating the UK's response to the crossings, saying 80% of the 539 people who had attempted to make the crossing in small boats in 2018 had done so since October. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map More widely, figures released in May showed an estimated 2,366 people entered the UK ""clandestinely"" in 2016-17 - on boats, via ferries or on lorries. The estimate for 2017-18 was 1,832. It is not known how many of those who entered the country in this way went on to apply for asylum in the UK. In 2017, there were 26,350 asylum applications in total. A decision was made in 21,290 of those cases, with 31.8% gaining some form of protection. During the same period, there were 198,255 applications for asylum made in Germany, 126,550 in Italy and 91,070 in France. Lib Dem spokesman for home affairs, Sir Ed Davey, said the government had ""lost control of our borders"" because of cuts of 600 border staff since 2015. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Rather than taking the blame for that, they're scape-goating the most vulnerable people, blaming the refugees. That's just moral cowardice."" Safe routes such as the refugee family reunion scheme and vulnerable persons resettlement scheme should be used, he said. Conservative MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan said France could look ""just as well"" as the UK at a ""genuine"" refugee's case and said she had asked Mr Javid to investigate how the UK could ""help the French to manage this more"". But she added: ""That Channel waterway is the most congested piece of waterway in the world. ""People getting into small boats are incredibly likely to lose their lives. Nobody wants to see that happen."" French police said they stopped 14 migrants attempting to cross the Channel from Boulogne on Tuesday - the latest in a growing number of people intercepted by the French authorities in the past month. The government has agreed a joint action plan with France, which includes the redeployment of the two Border Force vessels from the Mediterranean. Only one of the five Border Force cutters had been working in the Straits of Dover. The two being brought back have been taking part in Operation Frontex, the pan-European effort to deal with much larger migration flows from North Africa and the Middle East, to Italy and Greece.

Saudi Arabia opens Khashoggi murder trial,"Jamal Khashoggi was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October The trial of 11 individuals over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has begun in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, state media report. Prosecutors have asked for the death penalty for five of the defendants. Khashoggi, a prominent US-based critic of the Saudi government, was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on 2 October. Prosecutors say he was murdered in a ""rogue"" operation by agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has refused Turkey's request to extradite 18 suspects for trial, including 15 alleged agents who it says flew to Istanbul to carry out the killing. Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Journalist who stepped into a consulate and vanished Little information was released by state media other than that the first session of the criminal court's hearing of the case had begun and that the 11 defendants and their lawyers were present. Defence lawyers requested a copy of the indictment sheet and time to review it. No date was set for the next hearing. Requests to Turkey for evidence had not yet been answered, the attorney general said in a statement carried on the Saudi Press Agency. No names of the defendants have been officially released. Earlier statements said another 10 people were also being investigated. In November, Deputy Public Prosecutor Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan said investigators had concluded thatan intelligence officer ordered Khashoggi's murder, applying a lethal injection inside the consulate. The officer had been tasked with persuading the dissident journalist to return to the Gulf kingdom, he added. Khashoggi's body was dismembered inside the building and the body parts were then handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the grounds, according to Mr Shalaan. The remains have not yet been found. Turkey has identified 15 men it believes to be Saudi agents arriving at and departing from Istanbul's international airport around the time of the killing. But whether any of them are now on trial in Riyadh is unknown. Some of the men captured on Turkish CCTV. It is unclear if any of them are on trial One man who will not be on trial is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, who has been accused by some in the West of being behind the killing. US officials have reportedly saidsuch an operation would have needed the prince's approval,external. Prince Mohammed has denied any role in what he has called a ""heinous crime that cannot be justified"". The US has imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the crown prince who it alleged was ""part of the planning and execution of the operation"" that led to Khashoggi's murder. Again, it is unclear if any of the 17 are being tried. Analysis by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The key question a lot of people will be asking about this trial is: Will it tell us the whole story about how Khashoggi died? The past history of previous trials in Saudi Arabia would tend to indicate that it won't. Commenting on the first day of the trial today, Amnesty International said ""Saudi Arabia's criminal justice system falls far short of international law"". The human rights group, which has called for a UN investigation into the journalist's murder, added that ""the impartiality of any investigation by the Saudi authorities is inevitably highly questionable"". The Saudi authorities have previously defended their justice system saying it is based on Sharia (Islamic law) and that therefore it is above criticism. But Saudi trials are notoriously opaque and due to the absence of a standard criminal code judges are often given leeway to hand out arbitrary punishments. Saudi Arabia profile As a prominent journalist, he covered major stories including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of Osama Bin Laden for various Saudi news organisations. Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document For decades he was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year. From there, he wrote columns for the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of the crown prince. Jamal Khashoggi in his own words In his first column for the newspaper, Khashoggi said he feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. In his last column,he criticised Saudi involvement in war in Yemen,external.

Islands hit as cargo falls off ship,"This video can not be played Footage filmed by the Dutch coastguard shows precariously balanced containers on board the MSC Zoe. Extensive debris has washed up on islands off the Dutch north coast after some 270 containers including chemicals fell off a cargo ship in a storm. As the extent of pollution became clear on five islands including Terschelling, coastguards searched the North Sea for missing containers. The cargo fell off the MSC Zoe near the German island of Borkum, but the tide carried many of them to the south-west. Initial images showed children's toys and TVs on Dutch beaches. But officials said three containers carried toxic substances, and Dutch and German coastguards warned local people to steer clear of them. One of those containers had a cargo of peroxide powder, and a 25kg bag of the chemical was found on the island of Schiermonnikoog on Thursday, along with several containers and their contents. The Panama-registered ship is described as the biggest in Europe, with a potential cargo of 19,000 containers. The Dutch coastguard searched for containers near the islands on Thursday As Storm Zeetje buffeted northern Germany with gale force winds late on Tuesday night, 270 containers of Zoe's cargo fell off the ship as it made its way through the Wadden Sea from the Belgian port of Antwerp. Waves of up to 10m (33ft) in height were reported on the night and images from the Dutch coastguard showed dozens of containers balanced precariously like dominoes on the deck, about to fall into the sea. By Wednesday morning, strong tides had already swept some of the containers on to beaches on Terschelling, Vlieland and Ameland and Dutch and German coastguard planes scoured the sea for the others. There were fears that other shipping could be damaged by the cargo. The Geneva-basedMSC company which owns the ship has asked a salvage company to use sonar equipment,externalto help retrieve the missing containers. Overnight into Thursday, the MSC Zoe docked at Bremerhaven. Several containers were spotted in German waters and a further 11 were seen by the Dutch coastguard floating between the islands of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog. Funeral urns wash up on Dutch beaches Cigarettes removed from container on English coast MSC Napoli hero recalls dramatic rescue By Thursday five Dutch islands in the Wadden Sea had seen debris from the MSC Zoe wash up on its beaches. On Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog volunteers were helping on Thursday to clear up the mess spilt the previous day. Around 100 soldiers were being sent to the islands part of the clean-up operation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit,"Chlorinated chicken is a familiar feature on US shelves but is banned in the EU Food standards must be protected after the UK leaves the EU, the farming industry has said. The National Farmers Union said it had heard enough ""warm words"" from ministers and action was needed now. Its president, Minette Batters, said any attempt to encourage cheap imports after Brexit in an effort to cut food bills should be ""fought to the death"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove said standards should not be ""bartered away"" in pursuit of short-term trade gains. In a speech to the Oxford Farming Conference, he also urged MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal later this month and warned of ""considerable turbulence"" for farmers if the UK left on 29 March without a deal with the EU. The NFU has said a no-deal exit would be ""catastrophic"" for the industry and could potentially open the UK to goods that are not produced to the high standards of food safety, animal welfare and environmental protection that are the hallmark of British farmers. Farmers warned of Brexit no-deal 'turbulence' Brexit: A really simple guide It warned that to avoid food price rises as a result of a no-deal Brexit, the government could unilaterally lower import tariffs, encouraging food producers to buy in inferior materials. ""The biggest threat to us, the biggest threat to the environment is we decide to import cheap raw ingredients and add value to them under the union jack,"" Mrs Batters said. Please upgrade your browser ""That is A1 critical right now. Get that bit wrong and it really will not work."" Campaigners have warned the UK could be forced to allow imports of hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, currently banned by the EU, as part of any future trade deal with the US. While Brexit offered a ""massive"" export opportunity for British farmers, Mrs Batters said there were real risks to the reputation of the industry if import controls were relaxed. She urged Mr Gove to show leadership by getting guaranteed standards of minimum animal welfare, environmental protection and food ""enshrined in some form of legislation"". ""At the moment we've had a lot of warm words on standards,"" she said. ""We've had commitment from various ministers saying that we would not want a trade deal that brought food in produced to lower standards, but the real challenge is how. ""Of course agriculture's always the last chapter in any trade deal to be agreed so we feel it's really important, we don't want anybody lying down in front of a bus...we want it put in writing."" The government's proposals for agriculture after Brexit are contained in a new Agriculture Bill which is currently being debated in Parliament. Environmental campaigners said it should include plans for an independent regulator to ensure that minimum standards to protect water, soil, wildlife and animal welfare are maintained. ""We can only guarantee long-term food security by protecting and managing the natural assets which enable food production,"" said its chairman Martin Lines. ""If the government does not amend the bill to include minimum standards - and put a stop to the environmental degradation caused by intensive farming - British farmers will be in danger of losing their livelihoods."" Mr Gove said concerns the UK would have to lower its food standards to access US markets were not new, because they had been raised a few years ago during discussions over the now aborted plan for an EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership. ""The two particular foods that were in the headlines were chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-enhanced beef. I have been clear that we do not intend to lower our standards, as that would lead to uncertainty for the consumer and would undermine the strength of our domestic production and the reputation it enjoys."" While there were different ways of providing the assurances that producers and consumers wanted, he said he was keen on exploring more informative food labelling to identify products that were ""inappropriate, low quality or potentially unhealthy"". Labour called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that farming standards would not be undercut by any post-Brexit trade deals, while the Liberal Democrats said farmers needed certainty to plan ahead.

MPs call for petrol price watchdog,"A group of MPs is calling for an independent fuel price watchdog - to be called Pumpwatch - to monitor the cost of petrol and diesel. Petrol stations that charge fair prices would be entitled to display a ""kitemark"" logo. The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Fair Fuel is accusing the industry of increasing its profit margins at the expense of motorists. But petrol retailers said the idea of a watchdog was ""pretty impracticable"". The plan to set up Pumpwatch follows a petition organised by pressure group FairFuel UK. It has collected 14,000 signatures since the week before Christmas. Why do fuel prices vary so much? The MPs said that petrol retailers made an average profit of 8p a litre in the first nine months of 2018, but this had increased to more than 13p a litre by the end of the year. The margin on diesel prices had risen from 8.6p a litre to 11p a litre, they said. The average price of unleaded petrol is currently 120.92p a litre, according to Catalyst Experian, with 65% of the price accounted for by fuel duty and VAT. ""Drivers need reassurance that they are not paying way over the odds for fuel,"" said Kirstene Hair, the chair of the APPG. ""In rural communities where public transport is poor and unreliable, people need their vehicles to get from A to B. It is essential that they pay the fairest price. That is where a price monitoring system would support them."" Fuel price campaigners argue that, even though pump prices have fallen over the last six months, they have not fallen as fast as wholesale costs. In other words, they remain too high. But the industry firmly rejected the plan for a price watchdog. ""While it is possibly a well-meaning idea, it would be pretty impracticable,"" said Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association. ""Who is going to check prices at 8,500 forecourts? And if you have a kitemark, what's going to be the acceptable margin?"" He said that low-volume petrol stations in rural areas needed a much higher profit margin than high-volume outlets. ""If people don't like high prices, they can go to a cheaper forecourt,"" he added. Inflation eases, as petrol prices fall The RAC agreed that retailers had been increasing their profitability. ""Retailers have been taking greater margins than they would normally do, and that's caused prices to be higher than they should be,"" said Simon Williams, the RAC's fuel spokesman.

Farmers warned of Brexit no-deal 'turbulence',"Mr Gove said the UK was on the cusp of a ""fourth agricultural revolution"" Farmers and food producers face ""considerable turbulence"" if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said. He told the Oxford Farming Conference it was a ""grim and inescapable fact"" there would be tariffs on exports and new sanitary and other border checks. While ""not perfect"", he said Theresa May's Brexit deal would protect market access and provide economic certainty. But Labour said ""basic legislation"" was not in place to prepare for Brexit. And environmental campaigners said Mr Gove should set up an independent regulator to ensure that minimum standards to protect water, soil, wildlife and animal welfare are maintained. Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit Brexit ferry firm in terms gaffe Brexit: A really simple guide The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March, with MPs due to vote in the Commons in mid-January on the prime minister's withdrawal deal. Urging MPs to support the PM's deal, Mr Gove said it would ensure the UK left the Common Agricultural Policy but, at the same time, provide a smooth transition period for agriculture and guarantee continuous tariff-free and quota-free access to EU markets. From 2021, he said, the UK would be able to ""largely diverge from EU regulation"", enabling it to pursue its land management priorities and invest in technology which the EU has ""turned its back on"". ""All of these are real gains that our departure from the EU can bring, but these real gains risk being undermined if we leave the EU without a deal,"" he said. Subsidies for farmers will continue to be paid at the current EU level until 2022 Mr Gove, a leading figure in the 2016 Leave campaign, rejected suggestions that warnings about the economic impact of a no-deal exit were being over-stated and another example of ""Project Fear"". ""No-one can be blithe or blase about the real impact on food producers in this country of leaving without a deal,"" he said. Gove sets out post-Brexit farm funding New EU fishing rules 'could hurt UK industry' It was a ""grim and inescapable fact"", he said, that beef and lamb exports could face export tariffs of at least 40% if the UK defaulted to World Trade Organization rules, while standard tariffs of 11% could be levied on a host of agricultural products. ""The combination of significant tariffs, where none exist now, friction and checks at the border, where none exist now, and the requirements to re-route or pay more for transport when current arrangements are frictionless, will all add to costs for producers,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser The government has guaranteed to pay subsidies to farmers at current EU levels until 2022. After that there will be a ""transitional period"" in England, with an increasing link between funds and maintaining ""public goods"", such as access to the countryside and planting meadows. Mr Gove said these commitments offered farmers greater certainty than their EU competitors. But Conservative former minister Guto Bebb, who backs another Brexit referendum, said the proposed deal would leave ""all the big questions unanswered"". ""There is no kind of fantasy Brexit deal that can meet all the promises made to farmers or the rural economy,"" he said. And Labour said Mr Gove's vision for the future of farming was ""irrelevant while basic legislation is not even in place and there are serious concerns about Defra's preparedness for a no-deal scenario that would be devastating for farmers"". The National Farmers Union said an ""orderly"" Brexit was vital for the industry's future prosperity and to fail to deliver that would be ""catastrophic"". ""That's primarily because a lot of our input, 90% of our animal medicines and vaccines, chemicals and fertilisers, are produced in the EU,"" its president Minette Batters said. ""We don't make those kind of things in the UK any more."" In his speech, Mr Gove insisted maintaining animal welfare and food safety was critical to the industry's reputation and sustainability and the UK ""must not barter them away in a short-term trade off"". The NFU is calling for ""more than warm words"" on the issue, with specific legislation to ensure the same standards are applied to imported food as home-grown produce.

Man jailed for BBC presenter rape threats,"BBC Points West presenter Alex Lovell was repeatedly sent threatening letters A man who stalked a BBC presenter with letters in which he threatened to rape her has been jailed. Gordon Hawthorn, 69, of Street, Somerset, sent the threats to Points West's Alex Lovell over six years. Ms Lovell started suffering panic attacks as a result of the threats, which included claims he was watching her closely enough ""to smell her hair"". At Bristol Crown Court the judge, Martin Picton, said Hawthorn left Ms Lovell ""frightened and miserable"". Ms Lovell began receiving Hawthorn's cards at the BBC's regional centre on Whiteladies Road, Bristol, in 2012. Hawthorn - who was jailed for two and a half years - had previously pleaded guilty at the city's magistrates' court to one count of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. Gordon Hawthorn pleaded guilty to one count of stalking involving serious alarm or distress He sent the presenter letters for more than six years but they became more threatening between January 2016 and March 2018, police said. His conduct ""amounted to stalking and caused Ms Lovell serious alarm or distress, which had an adverse effect on her usual day-to-day activities"", the charge stated. Reacting to the sentence, the 45-year-old said she welcomed the ""strong message"" sent out by the courts and that ""justice has been done"". ""I am really pleased that it is over but also that it sends a strong message that it's not OK and that anyone reporting being frightened in this way is going to be taken seriously,"" she added. Ms Lovell said she had suffered panic attacks and at times had been ""convinced he was near"". ""He said... that he was watching, that he was close enough to smell my hair."" ""There were four years of cards that were just filthy, and then suddenly there were two years of threats that got progressively worse."" She added notes were ""really terrifying""â¦ and they stated ""that he was strong enough to have raped several times before."" Hawthorn was caught following a police appeal, which led to a member of the public telling officers she had received a similar card. During his police interview Hawthorn was read a number of the messages he sent her. One card, with a rabbit on the front, said he ""only rapes blondes"" and asked: ""How does it feel... to now learn that your stalker has already raped six women."" It was signed: ""From your stalker and soon to be your rapist."" Tests showed Hawthorn's DNA matched that found on cards sent to Ms Lovell. Judge Picton said Hawthorn chose to send ""disgusting frightening letters"" to the presenter. ""The letters you sent caused distress and fear. She knew the author of those letters was watching. ""When out and about she couldn't be sure you wouldn't be watching for her."" Man admits BBC presenter rape threats Police hunt greetings card stalker Det Ch Insp Simon Brickwood from Avon and Somerset Police said Hawthorn was ""paying the price for his cruel campaign of harassment"". ""This case highlights the fact that stalking doesn't have to be physically watching or following someone."" He praised Ms Lovell for her ""bravery in speaking out about her distressing ordeal to encourage other victims of stalking and harassment to seek help and report offences"". Ms Lovell contacted police in January 2016 when the cards started to become more threatening Man admits BBC presenter rape threats Police hunt greetings card stalker HM Courts & Tribunals Service 'Peak yet to come' as people told to wear masks to limit virus spread Bristol doctor jailed for attacking petrol pumps at M25 services Great British Pub Awards runner-up donates prize money to local charity âHotter than a Turbo Island bonfireâ Sound engineer crafts device to play records through digital set up X-Press makes a Mark on local charity New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

India state paralysed amid temple protest,"The entry of two women into the Sabarimala temple sparked angry scenes Violent protests have paralysed the southern Indian state of Kerala after two women made history by entering a prominent Hindu temple. Schools across the state are closed and public transport too has been suspended. One person was killed in clashes on Wednesday. The Sabarimala temple was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. The Supreme Court revoked the ban in September, which prompted outrage. On Wednesday,Bindu Ammini, 40, and Kanakadurga, 39, entered the shrinearound dawn and became the first women to do so. This video can not be played Sabarimala: Women defy historic temple ban Thursday saw a second day of protests across the state. Right-wing groups, supported by India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), demanded a state-wide shutdown. They wanted schools, colleges and businesses to remain closed as a sign of protest. The state government, which supports the Supreme Court ruling, stepped up security and deployed police across the state for protection. But fearing violence, schools and shops were closed. And buses did not run as protesters blocked highways and other roads. In total, more than 700 people were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday. Sixty police officers were injured, more than 80 public buses were damaged and at least a dozen police vehicles were attacked. Violence broke out in several cities and towns on Wednesday as groups of protesters clashed with police, who fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Police used tear gas to break up protests Police told news agency AFP that at least 15 people were injured after protesters hurled stones at them. According to local media reports,around 100 people were arrested by police,externalin one district, where a mob assaulted a woman police officer. Police told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that they have also detained two people in connection with the death of a man during the protests on Wednesday. Shops were closed as they feared violence Several journalists were also attacked,externalin the protests that engulfed the state capital, Thiruvathapuram. Police said they are investigating the matter. Indian airlines have issued warnings to passengers travelling to Kerala. The Kerala state government supports the court verdict and Mr Vijayan has repeatedly said his government will provide the security to enforce it. But India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has argued that the court ruling is an attack on Hindu values. The issue has become increasingly contentious in the run-up to India's general election, scheduled for April and May. Critics have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. The Indian god who bars women from his temple Why has a Hindu temple divided India's women? Even the protests have turned into an ideological battle between the right and the left - most of the protesters belong to right-wing groups affiliated to the BJP; and those who support the court ruling are affiliated to Kerala's left-wing coalition government. The Supreme Court decision to let women worship at the Sabarimala shrine came after a petition argued that the custom banning them violated gender equality. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, rather than banning women in a broad age group from entering at all. Protesters have consistently argued that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayyappa. Devotees believe Lord Ayyappa is a an avowed bachelor They say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity, who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy and hence, women of a certain age are not allowed into the temple.

Late Christmas surge boosts Next sales,"This video can not be played Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas Next has reported a sharp rise in online sales over the Christmas period, while trading at its stores declined. The retailer said strong sales during the three weeks prior to Christmas and the October half-term holiday had made up for a ""disappointing"" November. In a continuation of recent trends, online sales rose 15.2% between 28 October and 29 December from a year earlier, while store sales fell 9.2%. In total, full-price sales at the retailer were up 1.5% over the period. The retailer expects an annual profit of Â£723m, slightly lower than its previous forecast of Â£727m. It blamed the lower forecast on strong sales of less profitable items such as beauty products and personalised gifts. John Lewis reports Christmas sales jump What went wrong on the High Street last year? High Streets have 'twice as many shops as needed' The company said it was particularly difficult to forecast how its business would perform this year, due to the uncertainty around the UK's upcoming departure from the European Union. ""People are maybe a little bit more cautious, given the uncertainties around Brexit. But I think that's as strong as you can put it,"" said Next chief executive Lord Wolfson, a prominent supporter of Brexit. At the moment, Next assumes economic conditions this year will be the same as the second half of last year and expects store sales to fall 8.5% and online sales to be up 11%. Next shares rose more than 6% after its trading statement. That follows a near 20% fall in December when investors were rattled by a profit warning from online fashion retailer Asos. ""Next has delivered some Christmas cheer to the retail sector, but only because its online offering is doing so well. Numbers from the high street stores look pretty dire,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. However, he points out that stores still make an important contribution to Next as half of online sales are picked up in shops. Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Predictions of a Christmas nightmare for retailers appear to have been wide of the mark - at least judging by the trading update from Next, traditionally the first of the big players to confess how they did at Christmas. Sales in the three weeks before Christmas were strong, and there was a big shift from High Street to online sales. Next, thanks in part to long experience with its directories, has always led the High Street pack when it comes to online sales, and it is well placed to benefit from the move to the internet. It remains to be seen whether next week's Christmas trading numbers - especially those from Debenhams and Marks & Spencer - elicit the same positive response. Debenhams is seen as the weakest of the big High Street names, with its shares trading at historic lows, while Marks & Spencer is the middle of a wide-ranging restructuring that will see it shed staff and stores. The update from Next follows strong Christmas trading figures from John Lewis Partnership, which reported an 11% rise in sales in the last week of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The partnership includes both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets. Attention will now turn to rival retailers Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, which release trading statements next week. ""We think John Lewis and Next will have outperformed thanks to their strong online presence, so we still wouldn't rule out some bad news from Debenhams or M&S,"" said retail analyst Nick Bubb.

LED lights making dent in UK energy demand,"Installing a single low-energy LED bulb may make a trivial contribution to cutting the carbon emissions that are overheating the planet. But if millions choose LEDs, then with a twist of the collective wrist, their efforts will make a small but significant dent in the UK's energy demand. Studies show making products more efficient has - along with other factors - already been slightly more effective than renewable energy in cutting CO2 emissions. The difference is that glamorous renewables grab the headlines. The ""Cinderella"" field of energy efficiency, however, is often ignored or derided. The new analysis of government figures comes from the environmental analysis website Carbon Brief. Its author says EU product standards on light bulbs, fridges, vacuum cleaners and other appliances have played a substantial part in reducing energy demand. Provisional calculations show that electricity generation in the UK peaked around 2005. But generation per person is now back down to the level of 1984 (around 5 megawatt hours per capita). Itâs widely known that the great switch from coal power to renewables has helped the UK meet ambitions to cut carbon emissions. The report says the use of renewables reduced fossil fuel energy by the equivalent of 95 terawatt hours (TWh) between 2005 and now. And last year renewables supplied a record 33% share of UK electricity generation. But in the meantime, humble energy efficiency has contributed to cutting energy demand by 103 TWh. In other words, in the carbon-cutting contest, efficiency has won â so far. And whatâs more, efficiency is uncontroversial, unlike wind and solar. The energy efficiency story doesnât just apply to households. There have been major strides amongst firms, too. Big supermarkets have worked hard to improve the performance of their lighting and refrigeration. And because firms and individuals are using less energy, that has offset the rise in energy prices. So whilst the prices have gone up, often bills have gone down. The issue is complicated, though. Other factors have to be taken into account, such as energy imported via cables from mainland Europe, population growth and shifts from old energy-intensive industries. Simon Evans from Carbon Brief told BBC News: âAlthough the picture is complex itâs clear that energy efficiency has played a huge role in help the UK to decarbonise â and I donât think itâs got the recognition it should have. ""Say you change from a B or C-rated fridge to an A++ rated fridge. That can halve your energy use from the appliance, so itâs pretty significant.â The UK government has consistently said it champions energy efficiency, but campaigners say it could do more. The UNâs climate body also supports energy efficiency as a major policy objective, although the issue features little in media coverage. But supporters of efficiency argue that ratcheting up efficiency standards for everything from planes and cars to computer displays and freezers offers the best-value carbon reductions without the pain of confronting the public with restrictions on their lifestyle choices. Joanne Wade from the Association for Conservation of Energy told BBC News: âI havenât seen these figures before but Iâm not surprised. âThe huge improvement in energy efficiency tends to be completely ignored. People havenât noticed it because if efficiency improves, they are still able to have the energy services that they want. I suppose I should reluctantly agree that the fact that no-one notices it is part of its appeal.â Scientists will be keen to point out that government-imposed energy efficiency is just one of a host of cures needed to tackle the multi-faceted problem of an overheating planet.

Apple blames China for sales forecast cut,"Apple has rattled investors with news that its sales have been slowing, blaming economic weakness in China. In a surprise disclosure, the iPhone maker said it anticipated revenue of about $84bn (Â£67bn) for the three months to 29 December. In November it forecast sales of at least $89bn - a prediction that had already disappointed investors. Apple's share price sank more than 7% in after hours trade, extending its more than 28% slide since November. Apple's warning about a Chinese slowdown has reached certain luxury retailers with large Chinese customer bases. Burberry is down 6%, Mulberry 4% lower, and LVMH, Hermes and Richemont are 3% lower. The festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter. But revenue of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016. In a letter to investors,externalon Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat? What's gone wrong at Apple? Are clouds gathering over the world economy? However, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones. Wednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years. It appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off. Apple to create $1bn Texas base Are you ready to break up with your phone? Production cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices. ""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. To sum up what Mr Cook told investors: some of this is under Apple's control, and some of it isn't. The economic realities in China - where growth is slowing - mean a region which Apple relied on heavily for new customers is no longer providing that boost. Coupled with a US-China trade war, this might get worse. There's little Mr Cook can do about that, save lobbying hard,as he has already,external, for exemptions that help protect Apple's business. But there's something else important at play here. The phenomenal smart phone era, a period that made Apple the world's richest company, is winding down. That isn't news. It's just happening more quickly than Apple had anticipated. Better, more reliable devices, with longer-lasting batteries, mean people aren't desperate to upgrade at the end of their contract. And ask yourself: what exactly was new about the latest iPhone model? Not a lot. Not enough. Will Apple's other products and services be enough to sustain its position? It has been trying to diversify what it does for some time with products like the Apple Watch and other online services, which have grown quickly but fall way short of the profit gained from the all-conquering iPhone. Trusted commentators are now expecting the company to make a major acquisition to give investors something to feel optimistic about. The firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year. Analysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands. On Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence. ""As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,"" Mr Cook wrote in the letter. He added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong. ""While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat?

'Water ice on Moon's surface',"The distribution of surface water-ice at the Moon's south pole (left) and north pole (right) Scientists say they have definitive evidence for water-ice on the surface of the Moon. The ice deposits are found at both the north and south poles, and are likely to be ancient in origin. The result comes from an instrument on India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, which explored the Moon between 2008 and 2009. Details of the workhave been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).,external The distribution of the ice deposits is patchy. At the lunar south pole, most of the ice is concentrated in craters. At the northern pole, the water-ice is both more sparse and more widely spread. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument aboard Chandrayaan identified three specific signatures of water-ice at the lunar surface. M3 not only picked up the reflective properties one would expect from ice, but was able to directly measure the distinctive way its molecules absorb infrared light. This meant that it could differentiate between liquid water and vapour and solid ice. This picture of the Moon's south polar region was captured by Japan's Kaguya spacecraft Temperatures on the Moon can reach a searing 100C in daytime, which doesn't provide the best conditions for the survival of surface ice. But because the Moon is tilted on its axis by about 1.54 degrees, there are places at the lunar poles that never see daylight. Scientists estimate that temperatures in permanently shadowed craters at the Moon's poles do not rise above -157C (-250F). This would create an environment where deposits of water-ice could remain stable for long periods. The result supports previous indirect detections of surface ice at the Moon's south pole. However, those results could potentially be explained by other phenomena - such as unusually reflective lunar soil. If there's enough ice sitting at the surface - within the top few millimetres - the water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon. It could potentially be turned into drinking water for the occupants of a lunar base, or ""split"" into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. The split oxygen could also be used by astronauts for breathing.

"India state paralysed amid temple protestProtests erupted after two women defied a religious ban to enter the Sabarimala temple.IndiaNewton-John dismisses death rumoursGrease star says ""rumours of my death... greatly exaggerated"" following reports she had weeks to live.Entertainment & Arts","The entry of two women into the Sabarimala temple sparked angry scenes Violent protests have paralysed the southern Indian state of Kerala after two women made history by entering a prominent Hindu temple. Schools across the state are closed and public transport too has been suspended. One person was killed in clashes on Wednesday. The Sabarimala temple was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. The Supreme Court revoked the ban in September, which prompted outrage. On Wednesday,Bindu Ammini, 40, and Kanakadurga, 39, entered the shrinearound dawn and became the first women to do so. This video can not be played Sabarimala: Women defy historic temple ban Thursday saw a second day of protests across the state. Right-wing groups, supported by India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), demanded a state-wide shutdown. They wanted schools, colleges and businesses to remain closed as a sign of protest. The state government, which supports the Supreme Court ruling, stepped up security and deployed police across the state for protection. But fearing violence, schools and shops were closed. And buses did not run as protesters blocked highways and other roads. In total, more than 700 people were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday. Sixty police officers were injured, more than 80 public buses were damaged and at least a dozen police vehicles were attacked. Violence broke out in several cities and towns on Wednesday as groups of protesters clashed with police, who fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Police used tear gas to break up protests Police told news agency AFP that at least 15 people were injured after protesters hurled stones at them. According to local media reports,around 100 people were arrested by police,externalin one district, where a mob assaulted a woman police officer. Police told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that they have also detained two people in connection with the death of a man during the protests on Wednesday. Shops were closed as they feared violence Several journalists were also attacked,externalin the protests that engulfed the state capital, Thiruvathapuram. Police said they are investigating the matter. Indian airlines have issued warnings to passengers travelling to Kerala. The Kerala state government supports the court verdict and Mr Vijayan has repeatedly said his government will provide the security to enforce it. But India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has argued that the court ruling is an attack on Hindu values. The issue has become increasingly contentious in the run-up to India's general election, scheduled for April and May. Critics have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. The Indian god who bars women from his temple Why has a Hindu temple divided India's women? Even the protests have turned into an ideological battle between the right and the left - most of the protesters belong to right-wing groups affiliated to the BJP; and those who support the court ruling are affiliated to Kerala's left-wing coalition government. The Supreme Court decision to let women worship at the Sabarimala shrine came after a petition argued that the custom banning them violated gender equality. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, rather than banning women in a broad age group from entering at all. Protesters have consistently argued that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayyappa. Devotees believe Lord Ayyappa is a an avowed bachelor They say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity, who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy and hence, women of a certain age are not allowed into the temple.

Chinese 'Jack the Ripper' executed,"Gao's first killing took place in 1988, he was only caught years later in 2016 A Chinese serial killer convicted of murdering 11 girls and women between 1988 and 2002 has been executed. Gao Chengyong, dubbed ""Jack the Ripper"" by Chinese media, followed his victims home before robbing, raping and murdering them. He cut their throats and mutilated their bodies. Gao, a married father of two, was arrested in 2016 at the grocery store he ran in Baiyin, Gansu province. Police managed to trace the 53-year-old through a series of DNA tests. Gao's first murder was in May 1988, the year his son was born. A 23-year-old woman was found in Baiyin with 26 stab wounds to her body. Subsequent murders followed a similar pattern, with the killer often targeting young women who lived alone. Gao also cut off parts of his victim's reproductive organs, according to the Beijing Youth Daily. His youngest victim was eight years old. Women in Baiyin would not walk alone in the streets without being accompanied by male relatives or friends after the spate of attacks. The killings stopped in 2002 but it was only years later that a breakthrough came, when Gao's uncle was arrested for a minor crime. He gave a DNA sample which police then linked to the crimes, determining they must have been committed by a relative - which was later confirmed to be Gao. He was sentenced to death last year. The court in Baiyin called his actions ""despicable"". His execution on Thursday was announced on the court's Weibo account. It is not clear how the execution was carried out, though death sentences in China are mostly carried out by lethal injection or a firing squad.

Girl's abandoned round-world yacht found,"The 40-foot vessel Wild Eyes was found upturned and covered in barnacles Almost nine years after being abandoned in the Indian Ocean, a yacht belonging to a teenage round-the-world sailor has turned up off southern Australia. US girl Abby Sunderland was aged 16 in 2010 when she attempted to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe, but a storm crippled her vessel. She was rescued more than 3,220km (2,000 miles) from the coasts of both Africa and Australia. The yacht was spotted on Monday, upturned and covered in barnacles. It was reported to authorities by a tuna-spotting plane about 10km south of Kangaroo Island, a popular tourist destination in South Australia, police said. ""My heart skipped a beat,"" Ms Sunderland said in a statement reported by Australian media. ""It brought back many memories - good and not so good - but it was neat to see it after so long. It looked a little creepy but that's to be expected after so long."" Abby Sunderland aboard Wild Eyes in Cape Town, South Africa, in May 2010 Ms Sunderland had set sail from California in January 2010, but five months later her mast snapped in 9m (30ft) high waves in the Indian Ocean. The teenager lost contact with her family for some 20 hours, during which time the yacht's emergency beacons were activated. A plane from Perth spotted the teenager's stricken boat and made contact with her, prompting a sea rescue. She was picked up by a French sailing vessel and taken to Reunion island, a French overseas territory near Madagascar. Ms Sunderland had been attempting to beat the record set by her brother, Zac, who sailed solo around the world in 2009 at the age of 17. At the time, her family rejected criticism from some over their decision to allow her to make the attempt, saying she was prepared and mentally well-equipped to deal with the challenge. The feat was completed by 16-year-old Australian sailor Jessica Watson,externalin the same year.It was also achieved by a younger 16-year-old, Dutch girl Laura Dekker, in 2012. Ms Sunderland has since co-written a book about her experience. She is now married with three children and lives in Alabama, media reports said.

Man killed at Scientology complex in Sydney,"Police outside the Church of Scientology centre in Sydney's north on Thursday A 16-year-old has been arrested after a man was stabbed to death and another injured at a Church of Scientology complex in Sydney, Australia. The violence on Thursday followed a ""domestic incident"" that took place a day earlier, according to authorities. Police said both victims were church employees. The man who died was believed to be aged 24 and from Taiwan. The Church of Scientology said it was providing the police with any assistance needed in the investigation. ""We cannot make any further comment beyond the fact that the victim was a beloved member of our Church,"" the church's liaison office in Australia said in a statement. The stabbings allegedly took place in a driveway about 12.30 local time (01.30 GMT) after the boy was asked to leave. He had dropped a 25cm (10in) knife after being confronted by officers with Tasers, said New South Wales Police. Chief Insp Simon Jones said the alleged attacker was ""of Asian descent"" and had had a ""lawful reason"" to be at the headquarters. Staff had asked him to leave ""solely"" because of Wednesday's incident, the policeman said, adding he would not elaborate further. The 24-year-old man died in hospital from a single wound to his neck. The other man, aged about 40, appeared to have superficial injuries. The 13,500 square metre property in Sydney's north is the largest Scientology centre outside the US, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.

Brexit deal gives farmers certainty - Gove,"Mr Gove said the UK was on the cusp of a ""fourth agricultural revolution"" Farmers and food producers face ""considerable turbulence"" if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said. He told the Oxford Farming Conference it was a ""grim and inescapable fact"" there would be tariffs on exports and new sanitary and other border checks. While ""not perfect"", he said Theresa May's Brexit deal would protect market access and provide economic certainty. But Labour said ""basic legislation"" was not in place to prepare for Brexit. And environmental campaigners said Mr Gove should set up an independent regulator to ensure that minimum standards to protect water, soil, wildlife and animal welfare are maintained. Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit Brexit ferry firm in terms gaffe Brexit: A really simple guide The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March, with MPs due to vote in the Commons in mid-January on the prime minister's withdrawal deal. Urging MPs to support the PM's deal, Mr Gove said it would ensure the UK left the Common Agricultural Policy but, at the same time, provide a smooth transition period for agriculture and guarantee continuous tariff-free and quota-free access to EU markets. From 2021, he said, the UK would be able to ""largely diverge from EU regulation"", enabling it to pursue its land management priorities and invest in technology which the EU has ""turned its back on"". ""All of these are real gains that our departure from the EU can bring, but these real gains risk being undermined if we leave the EU without a deal,"" he said. Subsidies for farmers will continue to be paid at the current EU level until 2022 Mr Gove, a leading figure in the 2016 Leave campaign, rejected suggestions that warnings about the economic impact of a no-deal exit were being over-stated and another example of ""Project Fear"". ""No-one can be blithe or blase about the real impact on food producers in this country of leaving without a deal,"" he said. Gove sets out post-Brexit farm funding New EU fishing rules 'could hurt UK industry' It was a ""grim and inescapable fact"", he said, that beef and lamb exports could face export tariffs of at least 40% if the UK defaulted to World Trade Organization rules, while standard tariffs of 11% could be levied on a host of agricultural products. ""The combination of significant tariffs, where none exist now, friction and checks at the border, where none exist now, and the requirements to re-route or pay more for transport when current arrangements are frictionless, will all add to costs for producers,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser The government has guaranteed to pay subsidies to farmers at current EU levels until 2022. After that there will be a ""transitional period"" in England, with an increasing link between funds and maintaining ""public goods"", such as access to the countryside and planting meadows. Mr Gove said these commitments offered farmers greater certainty than their EU competitors. But Conservative former minister Guto Bebb, who backs another Brexit referendum, said the proposed deal would leave ""all the big questions unanswered"". ""There is no kind of fantasy Brexit deal that can meet all the promises made to farmers or the rural economy,"" he said. And Labour said Mr Gove's vision for the future of farming was ""irrelevant while basic legislation is not even in place and there are serious concerns about Defra's preparedness for a no-deal scenario that would be devastating for farmers"". The National Farmers Union said an ""orderly"" Brexit was vital for the industry's future prosperity and to fail to deliver that would be ""catastrophic"". ""That's primarily because a lot of our input, 90% of our animal medicines and vaccines, chemicals and fertilisers, are produced in the EU,"" its president Minette Batters said. ""We don't make those kind of things in the UK any more."" In his speech, Mr Gove insisted maintaining animal welfare and food safety was critical to the industry's reputation and sustainability and the UK ""must not barter them away in a short-term trade off"". The NFU is calling for ""more than warm words"" on the issue, with specific legislation to ensure the same standards are applied to imported food as home-grown produce.

US and Colombia vow to cut coca production,"President Ivan Duque (L) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met in the coastal city of Cartagena US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he is ""deeply concerned"" about the increased production of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, in Colombia. At a meeting with Colombian President Ivan Duque, Mr Pompeo said the two countries would try to reduce coca production by 50% by 2023. Colombia has already vowed to step up its coca eradication programme. A recent UN report said the amount of agricultural land used for coca crops in Colombia had hit record levels. The country has fought for years to tackle cocaine production, with the US providing about $400m (Â£318m) annually to help combat the producers and traffickers. The battle over Colombia's coca fields Drones hunt cocaine in Colombia Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, while the US is the world's largest consumer. ""The United States remains deeply concerned about the surge in coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia since 2013, and its impact on each of our two countries,"" Mr Pompeo said while alongside President Duque in Cartagena. ""We know we must do our part to reduce demand in our country and we'll work alongside you here as well."" This video can not be played Colombia's battle with cocaine traffickers Mr Duque thanked the US for its support in the drugs war. Speaking last month, Mr Duque said that more than 80,000 hectares of illicit crops had been eradicated in 2018. The government says it aims to remove another 100,000 hectares in 2019. But Colombia says more money is needed to persuade farmers to switch to less lucrative, legal crops. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issued statistics in September that showedcoca production acreage in Colombia in 2017 was the highest ever recorded,external. The total area given over to cultivation - about 171,000 hectares - was an estimated 17% higher than 2016. Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, much of which ends up in the US The UN said the region bordering the Pacific ocean in Colombia was the most intensively cultivated. On its own, the state of Narino on the frontier with Ecuador has more farmland dedicated to coca than the whole of Peru, which is another large producer. Eighty per cent of the coca has been grown in the same area for the past 10 years, while crops produce 33% more coca leaf than they did in 2012, the report said. In August, newly electedPresident Duque said the government would create a new drug-fighting policy, saying the goal was to have ""concrete results"" in the next four years.

US government shutdown: What's the impact?,"A woman wearing a ""hungry hostage"" headband protests on Capitol Hill President Donald Trump's standoff with Democrats over funding for his proposed border wall has resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. How has it affected American life so far? Mr Trump insists the government will stay closed until he gets that funding, and as the shutdown enters day 34, Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have remained equally firm that there will be no congressional funding for a wall. A quarter of the federal government has been unfunded since 22 December, leaving 800,000 employees without pay. Here is some of the misery Washington's political gridlock is inflicting on the nation at large. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, who oversee airport security, have been calling in sick or quitting as the shutdown drags on, though the agency insists standards have not been compromised. Flight traffic controllers are alsofeeling the effects of the shutdown,external, working long shifts to cope with with record low numbers of fully-certified staff to handle over 43,000 daily flights. On Wednesday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association the Air Line Pilots Association, and the Association of Flight Attendants released a bleak joint statement. ""We cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented."" President Sara Nelson of the flight attendant's association has alsocalled for a general nationwide worker's strike,externalto end the shutdown. Resources at the Federal Bureau of Investigation are quickly running out, according to a new report comprised of agent stories from across the nation. Thomas O'Connor of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement: ""The resources available to support the work of FBI agents are currently stretched to the breaking point and are dwindling day by day."" The report reveals,externalthe shutdown has impacted criminal, counter-terrorism and intelligence work, delaying sensitive investigations and compromising many basic operations. Coast Guard families pick up groceries at a food pantry As federal workers are due to miss their second paychecks of 2019,Coast Guard commandant Adm Karl Schultz,externalsaid it was ""unacceptable that USCG members must rely on food pantries and donations to get through day-to-day life"". ""You, as members of the armed forces, should not be expected to shoulder this burden."" On Wednesday, Democratic Representative Derek Kilmer of Washington statetold The Hill,externala food pantry for Coast Guard members in his district has already run out of food. Around 8,500 Coast Guard civilian employees were offered a ""managing your finances during a furlough""tip sheet,externalearlier this month, including budgeting suggestions like having a garage sale or monetising hobbies. In addition to pay, these employees are missing federal housing subsidies that help offset their expensive coastal housing, according to the Washington Post. Some furloughed workers have been using food pantries to keep their families fed as they go unpaid during the shutdown This video can not be played US shutdown: 'My son wants to sell art to pay our bills' Security certificates for dozens of official websites have not been renewed. Affected websites include the US Department of Justice, the Court of Appeals and Nasa. According to internet services website Netcraft, more than 80 security certificates used by .gov websites have expired. US shutdown leaves websites insecure The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended all non-essential work, causing nationwide concerns over unsafe food as most inspections have stopped. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Wednesday said the agency was working to ensure ""high risk"" facility checks continue. He said about one third of the FDA's food inspections are considered high risk, looking at goods like cheese, fresh produce and seafood. ""It's not business as usual, and we are not doing all the things we would do under normal circumstances,"" Mr Gottliebtold NBC News,external. According toa report by Syracuse University,external, over 42,000 immigration hearings have been cancelled as of 11 January. That number will go up by 20,000 cases each week, researchers estimate. The current backlog is already over 800,000. Immigration courts have been dealing with high numbers of cases and these indefinite delays will have a ""devastating impact"",Judge Dana Leigh Marks told PBS,external. Faced with deteriorating and increasingly hazardous conditions, including waste buildup and unsafe roads, National Parks across the country are struggling to stay open during the shutdown. With a skeleton staff unable to respond quickly to emergencies, at least seven people have died in parks since the shutdown,the Washington Post reported,external. In Joshua Tree,with ranger numbers down to just eight,external, vandals have cut down trees and used protected lands as campsites. On an administrative level, the parks are also facing issues: one couple toldCBS News,externaltheir wedding reservation at a park was abruptly cancelled ""due to administration"". So-called ""toilet angels"" have been volunteering to clean facilities at Joshua Tree National Park Following a brutal hurricane season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been forced to delay next year's preparations. Forecast model updates, emergency trainings, and field experiments have all been halted. ""People keep saying it doesn't matter because hurricane season is so far away - dead wrong,"" National Hurricane Center scientist Eric Blake tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

Without federal employees to keep national landmarks clean, cities have had to use their own funds. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser has been using the district's local resources to keep the capital clean at a cost of $46,000 (Â£36,500) per week. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has committed to paying $65,000 a day to ensure the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island stay rubbish-free and open for tourists. New York is paying for Statue of Liberty upkeep from local funds Across the country, small towns built around federal institutions are bracing for long-term effects thanks to the shutdown. In Ogden, Utah, restaurants and small businesses have slashed hours after losing the patronage of thousands of federal employees in the area,the Washington Post reported.,external Federal workers have started protests on Capitol Hill As many federally employed scientists stop working at agencies like the National Science Foundation, labs across the country are facing repercussions.

One woman told the BBC her husband's work with cancer drug trials could see delays. ""Timing can literally be life or death,"" she said of the trial participants. Hundreds of Nasa staff missed presenting their work at US astronomy's biggest conference this year due to no funding. Nasa is also unable to fix the Hubble Space Telescope, which broke this week, as key employees are furloughed. All Smithsonian museums, one of DC's tourist highlights, are closed DC tourists have been shut out of all the popular Smithsonian museums since the shutdown as well as the Gallery of Art and Arboretum. Smithsonian spokeswoman Linda St Thomas told the BBC an estimated 1.2 million visitors will be turned away if the shutdown continues through January and two thirds of Smithsonian employees are furloughed. Thanks to an earlier appropriations bill, the Capitol Building is still open. Native American tribes receive substantial federal funding for essential services like healthcare and food as part of a deal negotiated decades ago in exchange for Native lands. In Michigan, a Chippewa tribe has already been forced to use their own funds to pay some $100,000 (Â£79,400) to keep clinics and food pantries open,the New York Times reported,external. Similar stories have cropped up across the country. Some Navajo tribes in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah are trapped in their homes without access to groceries and medicine due to unploughed roads. In Minnesota, police officers on the Boise Forte Indian Reservation are already working without pay. Soybean farms, pictured, have been hit hard by the trade war with China With the Department of Agriculture unfunded, farmers across the country are facing troubles applying for federal assistance. Farmers were promised aid as President Trump's trade war with China continues, but the offices handling applications has been closed since 28 December. Federal loan applications and information sites for farmers are also going unmaintained. Government reports -including some supply-and-demand estimates farmers rely on,external- will also not be released on time, even if the shutdown ends soon. Operated by the Department of Homeland Security, the E-verify programme allows employers to confirm that potential hires are able to work legally in the US. It has been offline since 22 December, which could make it easier for illegal immigrants to get jobs if employers bypass verification. Thanks to meals scheduled prior to the shutdown, federal inmates feasted on holiday treats like grilled steak and pies while their guards worked without pay. ""You are seeing prisoners getting steak, roast beef and Cornish hens, and you can't put that kind of food on the table for your own family,"" Eric Young, president of the national prison workers union,told USA Today,external. Unsurprisingly, tensions are high between staff and prisoners. ""The inmates know what's going on, they know about the shutdown, and they are laughing at us,"" one prison chief told the paper. An organisation that helps US citizens overseas who have suffered sexual assault or domestic violence told the BBC they would close on 13 January, having run out of funds. Pathways to Safety International's funding comes through the US Department of Justice, and that money ran out on 6 January. Executive Director Paula Lucas told the BBC that it would cause ""an emergency situation for Americans stranded abroad without critical services."" The Administrative Office of the US Courts,externalsays it has enough funding to operate until 1 February, at which point all non-essential staff at 94 federal district courts and other top courts nationwide will join the furloughed. This could mean civil cases are suspended, and hearings and filings are rescheduled,Bloomberg reported,external. Criminal cases will be prioritised, but with courts operating on minimum staffing, there could still be delays in proceedings.

Is this the end of owning music?,"Sales of vinyl are at a 25-year high, but growth stagnated in 2018 Sales of CDs plummeted by 23% last year, as consumers flocked to streaming services for their music. Just 32 million CDs were sold in 2018 - almost 100 million fewer than in 2008; and a drop of 9.6 million year-on-year. The growth of vinyl also began to plateau, with 4.2 million records sold, a rise of just 1.6%, said the BPI. Shrinking shelf space in supermarkets,externalcontributed to the slowdown, butHMV's troublessuggest we are increasingly uninterested in owning our music. The CDs that did sell in large quantities tended to appeal to older, non-traditional music buyers - with six of the year's top 10 albums either film soundtracks or Now compilations. The picture is the same in America, where CD sales have fallen 80% in the last decade, from roughly 450 million to 89 million. In a sign of the times, two of the records nominated for album of the year at the Grammys (H.E.R.'s self-titled debut and Cardi B's Invasion of Privacy) weren't even released on CD in the US - the first time that's happened since 1984. ""Lots of us have changed the way we consume music and film, and more people are streaming from Netflix or Spotify,"" Kim Bayley of the Entertainment Retailers Association recently told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""But I think we should remember that [physical music] is almost a Â£2bn business. Even HMV has sales still of a quarter of a billion pounds, so that's not a small business."" Did streaming cause HMV to fail? 2019's most anticipated new music The top 10 albums of 2018 8 predictions for music from expert pop forecasters Jon Tolley, who runs the independent record shop Banquet Records argues that streaming can co-exist with vinyl and CDs. ""I don't buy it that physical music is necessarily competing with streams. We all access music and film on the internet, and that's fine and healthy and valid, but you wouldn't look at the Mona Lisa on your phone and think it's the same thing as going to see it in a gallery."" ""The reason vinyl sales are at a 25-year high is because people are rejecting this part of modern society where everything is immediate and nothing means anything."" Mumford and Sons star Ben Lovett agrees. ""We all use Spotify but I think we all value vinyl,"" he told BBC News. ""We've spent a lot more time talking about how we put our vinyl out than we have done about how we're going to stream our songs. ""We will literally talk about the weight of the vinyl, the presentation, the quality of the cut - all that stuff. People don't know how important it is to us."" Fellow musicianJack White recently told Rolling Stone,externalhe thought the CD was on the way out. ""I definitely believe the next decade is going to be streaming plus vinyl - streaming in the car and kitchen, vinyl in the living room and the den. Those will be the two formats. And I feel really good about that."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

In contrast to the physical market, streaming services are flourishing. A total of 91 billion songs were played on Spotify, Apple Music and their competitors last year - the equivalent of 1,300 songs per person in the UK - and streaming now accounts for nearly two thirds (63.6%) of all music consumption in the UK. The popularity of on-demand music was enough to compensate for the slump in CD sales and downloads; giving the industry its fourth consecutive year of growth. A total of 142.9 million albums were either streamed, purchased or downloaded, with an estimated retail value of Â£1.33 billion, said trade body the BPI. However, it was a poor year for new talent. Anne-Marie's Speak Your Mind was the year's biggest-selling debut album, shifting 160,000 copies - but no other British debut sold more than 100,000, the threshold for a gold disc; while Jorja Smith and Giggs' debut albums both went silver, with sales in excess of 60,000 copies.

"Man killed at Scientology complex in SydneyA teenager has been arrested after the man was stabbed to death and another was injured, say police.","Police outside the Church of Scientology centre in Sydney's north on Thursday A 16-year-old has been arrested after a man was stabbed to death and another injured at a Church of Scientology complex in Sydney, Australia. The violence on Thursday followed a ""domestic incident"" that took place a day earlier, according to authorities. Police said both victims were church employees. The man who died was believed to be aged 24 and from Taiwan. The Church of Scientology said it was providing the police with any assistance needed in the investigation. ""We cannot make any further comment beyond the fact that the victim was a beloved member of our Church,"" the church's liaison office in Australia said in a statement. The stabbings allegedly took place in a driveway about 12.30 local time (01.30 GMT) after the boy was asked to leave. He had dropped a 25cm (10in) knife after being confronted by officers with Tasers, said New South Wales Police. Chief Insp Simon Jones said the alleged attacker was ""of Asian descent"" and had had a ""lawful reason"" to be at the headquarters. Staff had asked him to leave ""solely"" because of Wednesday's incident, the policeman said, adding he would not elaborate further. The 24-year-old man died in hospital from a single wound to his neck. The other man, aged about 40, appeared to have superficial injuries. The 13,500 square metre property in Sydney's north is the largest Scientology centre outside the US, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.

"US and Colombia vow to cut coca productionThe US secretary of state says he is ""deeply concerned"" about increased production of the leaves.","President Ivan Duque (L) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met in the coastal city of Cartagena US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he is ""deeply concerned"" about the increased production of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, in Colombia. At a meeting with Colombian President Ivan Duque, Mr Pompeo said the two countries would try to reduce coca production by 50% by 2023. Colombia has already vowed to step up its coca eradication programme. A recent UN report said the amount of agricultural land used for coca crops in Colombia had hit record levels. The country has fought for years to tackle cocaine production, with the US providing about $400m (Â£318m) annually to help combat the producers and traffickers. The battle over Colombia's coca fields Drones hunt cocaine in Colombia Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, while the US is the world's largest consumer. ""The United States remains deeply concerned about the surge in coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia since 2013, and its impact on each of our two countries,"" Mr Pompeo said while alongside President Duque in Cartagena. ""We know we must do our part to reduce demand in our country and we'll work alongside you here as well."" This video can not be played Colombia's battle with cocaine traffickers Mr Duque thanked the US for its support in the drugs war. Speaking last month, Mr Duque said that more than 80,000 hectares of illicit crops had been eradicated in 2018. The government says it aims to remove another 100,000 hectares in 2019. But Colombia says more money is needed to persuade farmers to switch to less lucrative, legal crops. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issued statistics in September that showedcoca production acreage in Colombia in 2017 was the highest ever recorded,external. The total area given over to cultivation - about 171,000 hectares - was an estimated 17% higher than 2016. Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, much of which ends up in the US The UN said the region bordering the Pacific ocean in Colombia was the most intensively cultivated. On its own, the state of Narino on the frontier with Ecuador has more farmland dedicated to coca than the whole of Peru, which is another large producer. Eighty per cent of the coca has been grown in the same area for the past 10 years, while crops produce 33% more coca leaf than they did in 2012, the report said. In August, newly electedPresident Duque said the government would create a new drug-fighting policy, saying the goal was to have ""concrete results"" in the next four years.

Curb Your Enthusiasm's Bob Einstein dead,"Comedian Bob Einstein, who appeared in Curb Your Enthusiasm and created the character Super Dave Osborne, has died Veteran comedy writer and actor Bob Einstein has died aged 76, his brother confirmed on Twitter. Albert Brooks, who is also a comedian, paid tribute to ""a great brother, father and husband"" and ""brilliantly funny man"". ""You will be missed forever,"" he said. Einstein was most famous for the role of Marty Funkhouser in the HBO satirical comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm, which he played from 2004 to 2017. He won fans portraying Larry Middleman in the third season of Arrested Development, and in Hollywood heist caper Ocean's Thirteen, where he played Matt Damon's con artist father. Einstein also created death-defying stuntman Super Dave Osborne, playing the character on sketch comedy show Bizarre, on Late Show with David Letterman, and eventually in his own series from 1987.

UK firms squeezed by labour shortage,"Finding workers with the right skills is becoming increasingly difficult, according to the British Chambers of Commerce UK firms are being squeezed by labour shortages, rising prices and a slowdown in sales. More companies than ever before are finding it hard to recruit staff according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). It warned that higher costs meant more manufacturers were expecting to raise prices. The proportion of services firms saying sales were improving had dropped to a two year low. Four fifths of employers in manufacturing, and almost as many in the service sector, reported difficulties in finding the right workers. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the BCC, said these findings suggested the government should listen more closely to business when it came to drawing up its migration policies. ""Business concerns about the government's recent blueprint for future immigration rules must be taken seriously - and companies must be able to access skills at all levels without heavy costs or bureaucracy,"" he said. The BCC said that the lack of clarity over the process of leaving the European Union had led to stagnating growth and business confidence in the UK. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the BCC, said the UK economy was facing ""persistent Brexit uncertainty and rising cost pressures"". He added that subdued household spending levels and tightening cash flow was making it hard for businesses, particularly in the services industries to grow. However he said that upward pressure on prices from higher wage settlements remained relatively muted. The BCC's survey covers 6,000 firms, employing over one million people across the UK.

LED lights 'could dent UK energy demand',"Installing a single low-energy LED bulb may make a trivial contribution to cutting the carbon emissions that are overheating the planet. But if millions choose LEDs, then with a twist of the collective wrist, their efforts will make a small but significant dent in the UK's energy demand. Studies show making products more efficient has - along with other factors - already been slightly more effective than renewable energy in cutting CO2 emissions. The difference is that glamorous renewables grab the headlines. The ""Cinderella"" field of energy efficiency, however, is often ignored or derided. The new analysis of government figures comes from the environmental analysis website Carbon Brief. Its author says EU product standards on light bulbs, fridges, vacuum cleaners and other appliances have played a substantial part in reducing energy demand. Provisional calculations show that electricity generation in the UK peaked around 2005. But generation per person is now back down to the level of 1984 (around 5 megawatt hours per capita). Itâs widely known that the great switch from coal power to renewables has helped the UK meet ambitions to cut carbon emissions. The report says the use of renewables reduced fossil fuel energy by the equivalent of 95 terawatt hours (TWh) between 2005 and now. And last year renewables supplied a record 33% share of UK electricity generation. But in the meantime, humble energy efficiency has contributed to cutting energy demand by 103 TWh. In other words, in the carbon-cutting contest, efficiency has won â so far. And whatâs more, efficiency is uncontroversial, unlike wind and solar. The energy efficiency story doesnât just apply to households. There have been major strides amongst firms, too. Big supermarkets have worked hard to improve the performance of their lighting and refrigeration. And because firms and individuals are using less energy, that has offset the rise in energy prices. So whilst the prices have gone up, often bills have gone down. The issue is complicated, though. Other factors have to be taken into account, such as energy imported via cables from mainland Europe, population growth and shifts from old energy-intensive industries. Simon Evans from Carbon Brief told BBC News: âAlthough the picture is complex itâs clear that energy efficiency has played a huge role in help the UK to decarbonise â and I donât think itâs got the recognition it should have. ""Say you change from a B or C-rated fridge to an A++ rated fridge. That can halve your energy use from the appliance, so itâs pretty significant.â The UK government has consistently said it champions energy efficiency, but campaigners say it could do more. The UNâs climate body also supports energy efficiency as a major policy objective, although the issue features little in media coverage. But supporters of efficiency argue that ratcheting up efficiency standards for everything from planes and cars to computer displays and freezers offers the best-value carbon reductions without the pain of confronting the public with restrictions on their lifestyle choices. Joanne Wade from the Association for Conservation of Energy told BBC News: âI havenât seen these figures before but Iâm not surprised. âThe huge improvement in energy efficiency tends to be completely ignored. People havenât noticed it because if efficiency improves, they are still able to have the energy services that they want. I suppose I should reluctantly agree that the fact that no-one notices it is part of its appeal.â Scientists will be keen to point out that government-imposed energy efficiency is just one of a host of cures needed to tackle the multi-faceted problem of an overheating planet.

North Korea ambassador to Italy 'in hiding',"Jo Song-gil was thought to have been living in Rome with his wife and children before he disappeared South Korea's spy agency has told officials that North Korea's ambassador to Italy has disappeared. The announcement follows unconfirmed reports that Pyongyang's top diplomat in Italy had sought asylum from an unidentified Western country. Jo Song-gil, the acting North Korean ambassador to Rome, is the son and son-in-law of high-ranking North Korean officials. The last senior diplomat to defect was the deputy ambassador in London. Thae Yong-ho abandoned his post in 2016, along with his wife and children. He defected to South Korea. As one of the highest-ranking officials to ever defect from the North, his move was seen as a blow to Kim Jong-un's regime. He would go on to urge the world to spread information in North Korea to undermine Mr Kim's status among his people. Jo Song-gil was the top envoy at North Korea's embassy in Rome Speaking after a briefing from the spy agency on Thursday, Kim Min-ki, a government MP, told reporters that Mr Jo fled the Rome embassy more than a month ago. ""Acting ambassador Jo Song-gil's term was ending in late November last year and he escaped the diplomatic compound in early November,"" the MP said. South Korean's National Intelligence Service, which interrogates all defectors from the North, told lawmakers they had not had any contact from him since then. The agency would not confirm that he is trying to defect to another country. My friend the North Korean defector Defector: Soft power 'could bring N Korea uprising' Meet North Korea's first family Mr Jo's wife is believed to be with him. Italy's foreign ministry has told the BBC that it has no record of an asylum request made by Mr Jo. Diplomatic sources said the last Italy heard of him was when officials received a note last year from the North Korean government saying that Mr Jo was being replaced. South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo has reported that Mr Jo is in a ""safe place"" with his family, citing a diplomatic source. Analysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul High-profile defections by one of North Korea's elite are rare and would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong-un. State media has often insisted that any defections by diplomats are part of a plot by South Korea or the United States to undermine its government. Pyongyang considers them traitors to the country and its people, and defectors say there can be severe consequences for any family members left behind. The last senior diplomat to defect, Thae Yong-ho, once said that he made his decision as he wanted to give his two sons an education outside the impoverished state. He has told reporters in South Korea that he worked with Jo Song-gil. He claimed that Mr Jo was responsible for delivering luxury goods to North Korea via an Italian company and that he may know more about Pyongyang's nuclear plans. This is the kind of information US intelligence services would be keen to get their hands on. But where is the 48-year-old envoy? Has he asked for asylum? It is unlikely any country will confirm Jo Song-gil's whereabouts until it is clear he and his family are safe. Mr Jo, 48, has been acting ambassador in Rome since October 2017 after Italy expelled then-ambassador Mun Jong-nam in protest over a North Korean nuclear test a month earlier. North Korea's embassy in Italy manages relations with the UN's Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization, which provides important aid to the country. Kim Jong-un facial mask stirs controversy The North Korean spies who want to go home North Korean diplomats stationed abroad usually have to leave several family members behind in Pyongyang to prevent their defection. But Mr Jo is thought to have been in Rome with his wife and children, privileges that suggest his family is influential. Both his father and father-in-law were diplomats. His father-in-law Lee Do-seop was a well-known ambassador to Thailand and Hong Kong, according to Thae Yong-ho. North Korean representatives overseas are said to be closely watched by their fellow diplomats for any sign of disloyalty to the regime. However several have defected over the past few decades. Thae Yong-ho was North Korea's deputy ambassador to Britain when he defected in 2016 They include Ko Yong-hwan and Hyon Song-il, who defected to the South in 1991 and 1996 respectively after abandoning their posts in Africa. Jang Sung-gil, a former ambassador to Egypt, took asylum in the US in 1997 with his family, including a brother who was a diplomat working in London. The disappearance of Jo Song-gil comes after a year that saw a dramatic turnaround in relations between North and South Korea, with three meetings held between the countries' leaders. But if Mr Jo has indeed defected, it will not impact inter-Korean relations, ""unless Pyongyang thinks the escape was arranged by South Korean authorities"", Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, told the AFP news agency.

Girl's abandoned round-world yacht foundIt was crippled in the Indian Ocean in 2010 during a record attempt by 16-year-old Abby Sunderland.Australia,"The 40-foot vessel Wild Eyes was found upturned and covered in barnacles Almost nine years after being abandoned in the Indian Ocean, a yacht belonging to a teenage round-the-world sailor has turned up off southern Australia. US girl Abby Sunderland was aged 16 in 2010 when she attempted to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe, but a storm crippled her vessel. She was rescued more than 3,220km (2,000 miles) from the coasts of both Africa and Australia. The yacht was spotted on Monday, upturned and covered in barnacles. It was reported to authorities by a tuna-spotting plane about 10km south of Kangaroo Island, a popular tourist destination in South Australia, police said. ""My heart skipped a beat,"" Ms Sunderland said in a statement reported by Australian media. ""It brought back many memories - good and not so good - but it was neat to see it after so long. It looked a little creepy but that's to be expected after so long."" Abby Sunderland aboard Wild Eyes in Cape Town, South Africa, in May 2010 Ms Sunderland had set sail from California in January 2010, but five months later her mast snapped in 9m (30ft) high waves in the Indian Ocean. The teenager lost contact with her family for some 20 hours, during which time the yacht's emergency beacons were activated. A plane from Perth spotted the teenager's stricken boat and made contact with her, prompting a sea rescue. She was picked up by a French sailing vessel and taken to Reunion island, a French overseas territory near Madagascar. Ms Sunderland had been attempting to beat the record set by her brother, Zac, who sailed solo around the world in 2009 at the age of 17. At the time, her family rejected criticism from some over their decision to allow her to make the attempt, saying she was prepared and mentally well-equipped to deal with the challenge. The feat was completed by 16-year-old Australian sailor Jessica Watson,externalin the same year.It was also achieved by a younger 16-year-old, Dutch girl Laura Dekker, in 2012. Ms Sunderland has since co-written a book about her experience. She is now married with three children and lives in Alabama, media reports said.

Next online sales jump as stores suffer,"This video can not be played Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas Next has reported a sharp rise in online sales over the Christmas period, while trading at its stores declined. The retailer said strong sales during the three weeks prior to Christmas and the October half-term holiday had made up for a ""disappointing"" November. In a continuation of recent trends, online sales rose 15.2% between 28 October and 29 December from a year earlier, while store sales fell 9.2%. In total, full-price sales at the retailer were up 1.5% over the period. The retailer expects an annual profit of Â£723m, slightly lower than its previous forecast of Â£727m. It blamed the lower forecast on strong sales of less profitable items such as beauty products and personalised gifts. John Lewis reports Christmas sales jump What went wrong on the High Street last year? High Streets have 'twice as many shops as needed' The company said it was particularly difficult to forecast how its business would perform this year, due to the uncertainty around the UK's upcoming departure from the European Union. ""People are maybe a little bit more cautious, given the uncertainties around Brexit. But I think that's as strong as you can put it,"" said Next chief executive Lord Wolfson, a prominent supporter of Brexit. At the moment, Next assumes economic conditions this year will be the same as the second half of last year and expects store sales to fall 8.5% and online sales to be up 11%. Next shares rose more than 6% after its trading statement. That follows a near 20% fall in December when investors were rattled by a profit warning from online fashion retailer Asos. ""Next has delivered some Christmas cheer to the retail sector, but only because its online offering is doing so well. Numbers from the high street stores look pretty dire,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. However, he points out that stores still make an important contribution to Next as half of online sales are picked up in shops. Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Predictions of a Christmas nightmare for retailers appear to have been wide of the mark - at least judging by the trading update from Next, traditionally the first of the big players to confess how they did at Christmas. Sales in the three weeks before Christmas were strong, and there was a big shift from High Street to online sales. Next, thanks in part to long experience with its directories, has always led the High Street pack when it comes to online sales, and it is well placed to benefit from the move to the internet. It remains to be seen whether next week's Christmas trading numbers - especially those from Debenhams and Marks & Spencer - elicit the same positive response. Debenhams is seen as the weakest of the big High Street names, with its shares trading at historic lows, while Marks & Spencer is the middle of a wide-ranging restructuring that will see it shed staff and stores. The update from Next follows strong Christmas trading figures from John Lewis Partnership, which reported an 11% rise in sales in the last week of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The partnership includes both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets. Attention will now turn to rival retailers Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, which release trading statements next week. ""We think John Lewis and Next will have outperformed thanks to their strong online presence, so we still wouldn't rule out some bad news from Debenhams or M&S,"" said retail analyst Nick Bubb.

Why China is fixated on the Moon,"This video can not be played David Shukman visits an exhibition in Guiyang, southern China, that explores China's obsession with the Moon The Moon could be a ""beautiful"" source of minerals and energy, a top Chinese scientist has told the BBC. Exotic materials including helium-3 and the potential for solar power could prove invaluable for humankind, he says. The comments come from Prof Ouyang Ziyuan of the department of lunar and deep space exploration. His first interview with the foreign media provides insights into China's usually secretive space programme. Prof Ouyang was speaking ahead of the first Chinese attempt to land an unmanned spacecraft on the lunar surface. The Chang'e 3 lander is due to launch imminently, perhaps as soon as Sunday evening, UK time. It will be the first to make a soft touchdown on the Moon since an unmanned Russian mission in 1976. No humans have set foot on the lunar surface since America's Apollo missions ended in 1972. Prof Ouyang is an adviser to the mission and his comments reveal the scale of Chinese thinking about the Moon. The Chang'e 3 lander is heading for a crater known as Sinus Iridum He said the forthcoming venture would land in an ancient crater 400km wide called Sinus Iridum, thought to be relatively flat and clear of rocks, and explore its geology. He explained that there were three motivations behind the drive to investigate the Moon. ""First, to develop our technology because lunar exploration requires many types of technology, including communications, computers, all kinds of IT skills and the use of different kinds of materials. This is the key reason,"" he told BBC News. ""Second, in terms of the science, besides Earth we also need to know our brothers and sisters like the Moon, its origin and evolution and then from that we can know about our Earth. ""Third, in terms of the talents, China needs its own intellectual team who can explore the whole lunar and solar system - that is also our main purpose."" After the first two Chang'e craft orbited the Moon, the next two missions will try to land on it and the following two will attempt to bring samples back to Earth. Manned expeditions will then take place, according to Prof Ouyang. ""After all of this work, which is that China can make the achievement of arriving at the Moon and safely landing and that we can bring samples back; and once we finish all these unmanned projects, we will send Man there."" A rationale for this long-term programme is that ""there are many ways humans can use the Moon"", and he outlined a startling vision for its exploitation. With no air on the Moon, solar panels would operate far more efficiently, he believes, and a ""belt"" of them could ""support the whole world"". The Moon is also ""so rich"" in helium-3, which is a possible fuel for nuclear fusion, that this could ""solve human beings' energy demand for around 10,000 years at least"". Chang'e 3 model: Not since the Soviets' Luna 24 mission has there been a soft landing Prof Ouyang highlighted the combination of an extremely thin atmosphere and massive temperature extremes offering a unique possibility for manufacturing that does not exist on Earth. He also spelled out the potential riches in lunar minerals and metals - a feature highlighted in an exhibition about the Moon which I visited in his home city of Guiyang. ""The Moon is full of resources - mainly rare earth elements, titanium, and uranium, which the Earth is really short of, and these resources can be used without limitation. ""But it's unnecessary to get them now because it's very costly."" Prof Ouyang summed up his vision for the goal of lunar exploration: ""There are so many potential developments - it's beautiful - so we hope we can fully utilize the Moon to support sustainable development for humans and society."" China is steadily developing its human spaceflight capability so it can put people on the Moon Coming from a representative of a poorer, less ambitious nation, these ideas might be seen as purely wishful thinking. But China has been methodically and patiently building up the key elements needed for an advanced space programme - from launchers to manned missions in Earth orbit to unmanned planetary craft - and it is investing heavily. This comes as China is seen by neighbouring countries in Asia as flexing its muscles, most recently over control of airspace over the South China Sea. Chinese officials stress their desire to cooperate on space projects but lunar exploration is also regarded as a statement of national prowess. Ouyang has himself been blunt about this in the past, as here in 2006: ""Lunar exploration is a reflection of a country's comprehensive national power,"" he said in an interview with the official newspaper People's Daily. ""It is significant for raising our international prestige and increasing our people's cohesion."" One leading British space scientist, Prof Richard Holdaway of the government-funded laboratory RAL Space, has long experience of working with China. He believes China could have astronauts on the lunar surface by 2025. ""They started from a long way back but now they're catching up fast - they want to monitor what's happening on the ground, they want to be part of the analysis of climate change and a much bigger programme looking at the Moon for mining or as a staging post to other parts of the Solar System."" I asked him if the idea of a Chinese moonbase extracting minerals was remotely plausible. ""It's perfectly plausible from the technical point of view, absolutely plausible from the finance point of view because they have great buying power, so I think, yes, there's nothing at all to stop them doing that probably within something like 10 years. So a great deal is riding on the Chang'e 3 launch - national prestige, the quest for technological prowess and the desire to harness all available natural resources. If all goes according to plan, the spacecraft will take six days to reach the Moon and then face the challenge of a soft landing. But it is clear that a successful mission will pave the way for the next boots to walk on the lunar surface to be worn by Chinese astronauts.

Could China launch 'fake moon'?,"The Moon, seen over Chengdu, could be backed by a fake one - but there would be significant hurdles A Chinese company has announced ambitious plans to put a ""fake moon"" into space to brighten the night sky. According to the People's Daily state newspaper, officials at a private aerospace institute in Chengdu want to launch this ""illumination satellite"" in orbit by 2020, and say it will be bright enough to replace street lights. The straight-out-of-sci-fi news has sparked fascination, scepticism from scientists, lots of questions and outright mockery. Not much - and the little information that is available is somewhat contradictory. People's Daily first reported it last week,external, quoting comments made at an innovation conference by Wu Chunfeng, chairman of the neatly named Chengdu Aerospace Science Institute Microelectronics System Research Institute Co, Ltd. Mr Wu said the idea had been in testing for a few years and the technology was now in place to make it happen, with a launch scheduled for 2020. The China Daily newspaper quoted Mr Wu as saying that three ""huge mirrors"" could be launched by 2022. It's not clear from any of the reports whether this project has any official backing. The artificial moon would work as a mirror,external, reflecting sunlight back to Earth, according to China Daily. The place spacecraft go to die China's Jade Rabbit rover dies on Moon Panda-shaped solar power plant opens in China It would orbit 500km about Earth - roughly the same height as the International Space Station. The Moon orbits, on average, about 380,000km above Earth. The reports gave no details about what the fake moon would look like, but Mr Wu said it would reflect sunlight across an area of between 10km and 80km with brightness ""eight times"" that of the real Moon. According to Mr Wu, both the accuracy and intensity of the light would be controllable. To save money. It might sound ridiculous but the Chengdu aerospace officials say putting a fake moon in space could actually end up being cheaper than paying for street lights. The cost of street lights could outweigh the cost of the satellite, Chengdu aerospace officials say China Daily quoted Mr Wu as saying illuminating an area of 50sq km could save up to 1.2bn yuan ($173m; Â£132m) a year in electricity charges. It could also ""illuminate blackout areas"" after, say, a natural disaster like an earthquake. ""Think of this as sort of an investment,"" Dr Matteo Ceriotti, a lecturer in Space Systems Engineering at the University of Glasgow, told the BBC. ""Electricity at night is very expensive so if you could say, have free illumination for up to 15 years, it might work out better economically in the long term."" Scientifically, it's viable, says Dr Ceriotti. But to serve its purpose, the fake moon would have to be permanently in orbit over Chengdu - a relatively tiny area when you look at the Earth from space. There is already a fair amount of light pollution in Chengdu That would mean it would need to be in geostationary orbit, which is about 37,000km from the Earth. ""The only problem is at that distance you'd need the satellite pointing direction to be extremely accurate,"" said Dr Ceriotti. ""If you want to light up an area with an error of say 10km, even if you miss by one 100th of a degree you'll have the light pointing at another place."" And to have any impact from that distance, the mirror would have to be truly colossal. Kang Weimin, director at the Harbin Institute of Technology, told the People's Daily that the light of the satellite would be similar to a ""dusk-like glow"" and ""should not affect animals' routines"". But social media users in China have concerns. Has anybody thought what another moon would mean for moths? Some said it will surely confuse nocturnal animals, while others say that many cities in China already suffer from light pollution. ""The moon would significantly increase the night-time brightness of an already light-polluted city, creating problems for Chengdu's residents who are unable to screen out the unwanted light,"" John Barentine, director of Public Policy at the International Dark Sky Association, told news outlet Forbes. Dr Ceriotti told the BBC that if the light is too strong ""it will disrupt the night cycle of nature and this could possibly affect animals"". ""But conversely if the light is so faint then the question is, what is the point of it?"" No, a space mirror to create daylight at night has actually been tried before. In 1993, Russian scientists released a 20m-wide reflector from a supply ship heading to the Mir Space Station, which was orbiting at between 200km and 420km. Znamya 2 briefly beamed a spot of light about 5km in diameter to Earth. The light marched across Europe at 8km/hr, before the satellite burned up on re-entry. Attempts to build a bigger model,externalof Znamya failed in the late 1990s, leadingthe BBC's science editor at the time,externalto say there was ""not the slightest chance that the Earth will be girdled with space mirrors in the foreseeable future"".

Warming seas linked to bluefin tuna surge,"Growing numbers of bluefin tuna are being seen in the waters around the UK because of the warming impact of a long term ocean current say researchers. These large, speedy fish are a globally endangered species and almost disappeared from the UK around 40 years ago. Scientists say that their recent rise is connected to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Now in a warm phase, the current makes UK waters more hospitable for the fish. Calls to fish endangered bluefin tuna Could big-game fishing return to the UK? Giant tuna causes 'frenzy' at salmon farm Bluefin tuna are one of the largest and fastest fish on the planet - they can weigh up to 900kg and can travel at speeds of up to 70 kilometres per hour (43mph). In the 1930s, the species was a common sight in the seas off Scarborough and was highly prized by big-game fishers. However, from the 1940s, the species began to decline and by the early 1990s had all but disappeared. But over the past five years or so, sightings of the warm blooded fish have increased off the UK once again with many of these encounters captured on social media. Allow Twitter content?

This situation has been mirrored in the Nordic seas, in the waters between Greenland and Norway which witnessed a spectacular collapse in tuna numbers in the 1960s, when the fish declined dramatically in just two years. Researchers now believe that the warming and cooling impact of the long term current, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is key to the ebb and flow of the species. The scientists'new paper has been published,externalin the journal Science Advances. The team looked at the changing abundance and distribution of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic over the past 200 years. They've concluded that the major factor influencing the movement of bluefin is the AMO. ""The ecological effects of the AMO have long been overlooked and our results represent a breakthrough in understanding the history of bluefin tuna in the North Atlantic,"" said lead author Dr Robin Faillettaz from the University of Lille. He believes that while current numbers of sightings of the UK may indicate that the species is doing well, this may not be the case everywhere. ""When water temperature increases during a positive AMO, bluefin tuna move further north. However, the most positive (warming) phases of the AMO also have a detrimental effect upon recruitment in the Mediterranean, which is currently the most important spawning ground, and that will affect adult abundance a few years later."" ""If the AMO stays in a highly positive phase for several years, we may encounter more bluefin tuna in our waters but the overall population could actually be decreasing."" It's a measure of a naturally occurring climate cycle in the North Atlantic that see sea surface temperatures rise and fall over long  time periods. Approximately every 60 to 120 years the AMO switches between positive and negative phases. During positive (warm) phases, Ireland and the UK experience warmer weather but it also brings more hurricanes and drives drought in the US midwest. A cooler AMO can lead to drought in many parts of Africa. Right now the fishing of bluefin tuna in British waters is prohibited. But the recent rise in bluefin numbers has encouraged campaigners to petition the government to allow amateur fishers to catch the endangered species. The Angling Trust want to establish a ""catch and release"" licensed fishery which they believe would have enormous economic benefits for areas such as Cornwall. But the scientists involved with the latest study are cautious about this approach. Bluefin numbers in the Mediterranean have declined while increasing around the UK ""Bluefin tuna have been extensively overfished during the 20th century and the stock was close to its lowest in 1990, a fact that further indicates the recent changes in distribution are most likely environmentally driven rather than due to fisheries management and stock recovery,"" said co-author Dr Richard Kirby from the Secchi Disk Foundation. ""Before we further exploit bluefin tuna either commercially or recreationally for sport fishing, we should consider whether it would be better to protect them by making the UK's seas a safe space for one of the ocean's most endangered top fish."" According to experts, the impact of global warming on top of the AMO is likely to alter the familiar patterns seen in bluefin tuna over several hundred years. The authors believe that increasing global temperatures may see the species persist for longer in cooler waters around the UK and in the Nordic seas. It might also cause the fish to disappear from the Mediterranean sea, the world's most important bluefin fishery.

Border Force vessels return,"The UK Border Force found a dinghy and 12 migrants at Greatstone, Kent, on Monday Two UK Border Force boats will be redeployed from overseas to patrol the Channel in response to recent migrant crossings, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the operation would protect human life, as well as borders. Mr Javid met Border Force officials earlier after agreeing a joint action plan with France. Twelve migrants were found on the Kent coast on Monday, bringing the total number of people to have reached the UK by boat since November to 239. The home secretary said around 230 people tried to cross the Channel in December, but half of them were ""disrupted"" by French officials and did not leave France. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? No easy answers to migrant issue - Javid Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit' The decision to recall the vessels was taken by the Home Office after some MPs - including Conservative backbenchers - called for more Border Force patrols to be deployed. Only one of the five Border Force cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - had been working in the Dover Strait. The two being brought back are currently in the Mediterranean. The Border Force also has three of its six coastal patrol vessels in the Channel, but the Home Office said this remained under ""constant review"". Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Mr Javid said the incidents around the Channel were still a ""serious concern"" to him, adding: ""It's both about protecting human life but also about protecting our borders. ""When it comes to human life, clearly I want to make sure that we are doing all we can to protect people. ""This is one of the most treacherous stretches of water. Twenty-one miles with people taking grave risk, really putting their lives into their own hands by taking this journey."" But in a message to those thinking of crossing the Channel this way, he added: ""We will do everything we can to make sure it is not a success, in the sense that I don't want people to think that if they leave a safe country like France they can get to Britain and then just get to stay."" By Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe Correspondent The port of Calais The port at Calais is ringed with barbed wire and security fences, floodlights and cameras. Parked up in the dunes behind it are police vans full of officers monitoring the city and coast. It is here the refugees try to sneak through, boarding small boats in the dead of night. Mostly men from Iran, Afghanistan and Eritrea and elsewhere, they live in small, squalid encampments. Having trekked all the way from their home countries, the few hundred refugees here are determined to reach the UK in any way possible. Mohamed from Iran, told me he had tried twice in the past week, setting off in a tiny boat with 10 other men who had all paid smugglers to help them. He is trying to reach the UK because his wife and children are already there. On their first attempt they ran out of fuel. The second time they got close to the English coast and phoned 999, seeking assistance from UK coastguards, but he said a French vessel turned up instead and they were returned to France. The reason refugees are increasingly trying the sea crossing, we were told, is that heightened security around French ports and the Channel tunnel has made it almost impossible to stow away on lorries and trains. It is in desperation that people are turning to boats instead. Mr Javid, who returned from a family holiday in South Africa after coming under pressure to act, earlier agreed an ""enhanced action plan"" with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to be put in place in the coming week. It includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said Theresa May supported the home secretary's work to tackle the ""deeply concerning rise"" in migrants crossing the Channel on small boats. Two more cutters will be deployed in the Channel Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said it was important illegal migrants were not allowed to stay in the UK. He told BBC News: ""What we need to see now is this Dover patrol work hand in glove with the French authorities in a new Channel compact, so that anyone found in the English Channel in one of these unseaworthy craft can be helped carefully and safely back to the French coast - so that they know there is no chance of getting into Britain."" But Ben Bano, from the Seeking Sanctuary migrant support group, warned migrants should not be demonised. He said: ""We have to hold on to the fact that people, however desperate they are, are our brothers and sisters in humanity, and that is what we need to keep reminding people about. And they are refugees unless proved otherwise."" Writing on Twitter on Sunday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety."" And speaking to the Guardian, his shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Mr Javid of exploiting the problem. She told the paper:,external""There's no question that, with Brexit and also with the approach of the meaningful vote in January, people are being whipped up about migration issues, because the government thinks this is the best way of frightening people to vote for their deal."" A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Apple blames China as it cuts forecast,"Apple has rattled investors with news that its sales have been slowing, blaming economic weakness in China. In a surprise disclosure, the iPhone maker said it anticipated revenue of about $84bn (Â£67bn) for the three months to 29 December. In November it forecast sales of at least $89bn - a prediction that had already disappointed investors. Apple's share price sank more than 7% in after hours trade, extending its more than 28% slide since November. Apple's warning about a Chinese slowdown has reached certain luxury retailers with large Chinese customer bases. Burberry is down 6%, Mulberry 4% lower, and LVMH, Hermes and Richemont are 3% lower. The festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter. But revenue of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016. In a letter to investors,externalon Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat? What's gone wrong at Apple? Are clouds gathering over the world economy? However, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones. Wednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years. It appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off. Apple to create $1bn Texas base Are you ready to break up with your phone? Production cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices. ""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. To sum up what Mr Cook told investors: some of this is under Apple's control, and some of it isn't. The economic realities in China - where growth is slowing - mean a region which Apple relied on heavily for new customers is no longer providing that boost. Coupled with a US-China trade war, this might get worse. There's little Mr Cook can do about that, save lobbying hard,as he has already,external, for exemptions that help protect Apple's business. But there's something else important at play here. The phenomenal smart phone era, a period that made Apple the world's richest company, is winding down. That isn't news. It's just happening more quickly than Apple had anticipated. Better, more reliable devices, with longer-lasting batteries, mean people aren't desperate to upgrade at the end of their contract. And ask yourself: what exactly was new about the latest iPhone model? Not a lot. Not enough. Will Apple's other products and services be enough to sustain its position? It has been trying to diversify what it does for some time with products like the Apple Watch and other online services, which have grown quickly but fall way short of the profit gained from the all-conquering iPhone. Trusted commentators are now expecting the company to make a major acquisition to give investors something to feel optimistic about. The firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year. Analysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands. On Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence. ""As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,"" Mr Cook wrote in the letter. He added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong. ""While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,"" he said. Is Apple making China a scapegoat?

On-the-run killer wins right to appeal,"This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim A man found guilty of killing his date in a speedboat crash has won the right to appeal against his conviction, despite being on the run. Jack Shepherd, of Paddington, was jailed for six years in July for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown, 24. Shepherd, who was absent from his Old Bailey trial,let Ms Brown, of Clacton, drive his speedboat ""at full throttle"". The Court of Appeal confirmed a judge had given him permission to appeal against the conviction on 19 December. Shepherd had applied in August for permission toappeal against his conviction and sentence. Charlotte Brown died in December 2015 when Shepherd took her on a date on his speedboat Ms Brown's parents, Graham Brown and Roz Wickens, said they did not want to comment on the appeal until after 22 January, when they will meet Home Secretary Sajid Javid to discuss efforts to trace Shepherd. They have previously said it was ""not fair"" Shepherd had not faced justice. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error First date speedboat death man sentenced A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force was aware the appeal process had begun. The spokesman said Shepherd remained wanted for Ms Brown's death and urged anyone who knew his whereabouts to contact police.
