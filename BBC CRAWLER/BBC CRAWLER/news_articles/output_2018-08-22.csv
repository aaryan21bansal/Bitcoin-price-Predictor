Child passport renewal error hits hundreds,"This video can not be played Mother whose child's passport renewal was rejected by error hits out at Home Office More than 1,000 children born in the UK to parents from eight EU countries have been refused British passport renewals because of a Home Office error. Families were not asked for full documentation when they initially applied for and got passports. Now when they apply to renew those passports, the applications are being rejected as the families are unable to provide the old paperwork. The Home Office said it will assist affected children to get citizenship. It said the error in guidance made in 2008 was corrected in 2014 and it ""regrets any inconvenience or delay that this has caused"". Those affected are children of nationals from the eight countries that joined the EU in 2004, known as the A8, including Poland and the Czech Republic. Families were not asked for the proper documentation when the passports were first issued Children of nationals from those countries areautomatically born a British citizen,externalif one or both parents have the status of a resident at the time of their birth. Permanent residency is typically obtained once an EU national completes a continuous five-year period of work in the UK. The Home Office now says that in some cases officials failed to check the required residency paperwork, most commonly the Workers Registration Scheme (WRS) certificate, and refuse to renew the passports unless documents are provided. The WRS was scrapped in 2011 and families have said it is impossible to obtain copies of the certificates as the records are no longer kept by the government. Piotr Lugowski, who has been working in the UK for 13 years, said even when supplied with the WRS, the Home Office rejected an application to renew his eight-year-old son's passport. Piotr Lugowski has lived in the UK for 13 years and his eight-year-old son was born in the country Mr Lugowski said: ""When he was three years old we applied for a British passport for him and we received the passport very quickly, I think within one week, without any problems, and the passport was valid for five years. ""This year we put in an application for a new one and I was thinking it would be a very quick process, but we started receiving a lot of letters from the Home Office asking for more and more documents."" Despite sending WRS certificates as well as his permanent residency card, he said his application was rejected. Eventually he was told he could apply for his son's ""naturalisation"" for free so that he becomes a British citizen again. He is awaiting the decision but says the whole experience has left a bitter taste. He told the BBC: ""I feel they want to make us not welcome here anymore. ""I feel that from the government and that is very sad."" Ania Smaczynska, who moved to the UK in 2007, said she faced the same problem when trying to renew her six-year-old daughter's passport. She said it ""looks like they took my daughter's British nationality"", adding: ""In the beginning I was very angry, now I think I'm sad. ""I feel like a second-category person."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We want there to be no doubt - if you are settled in the UK legally, any child you have in this country thereafter is British."" He said a ""support function"" has been set up to identify renewal applications affected and where appropriate, ""support them to first register their child as a British citizen"" with the Home office covering the Â£1,012 fee.

'I don't care if Trump paid off a porn star',"""I don't care if he paid off a pornstar,"" says Cathy DeGrazia News that two former Trump advisers are facing prison time may have provoked a media firestorm in the nation's capital. But to the president's core supporters it's just a distraction from the good work he's doing. ""This is the sort of stuff that should be in People magazine,"" says James Montfort III, when I call him to ask what he makes of the legal turmoil surrounding Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. ""It's more important to get North Korea to give up their nuclear arms, it's more important to make sure Mexico is playing fair on trade - than it is to worry about whether Donald Trump had consensual sex with someone years ago."" Whether or not President Trump directed Mr Cohen, his former personal lawyer, to pay porn star Stormy Daniels ""hush money"" is irrelevant to James from Virginia. He is far more interested in talking up what he says are the president's huge achievements in office. This video can not be played Trump voter: 'They all break the law' ""This is not going to change my loyalty or dedication to him,"" he says, arguing that the national conversation should instead focus on issues such as low unemployment and a healthy economy. I wasn't surprised by James' unerring loyalty. Ever since I met him in August 2016, just weeks after Mr Trump was officially nominated as the Republican candidate, his support has been unwavering. Trump ex-lawyer 'happy' to aid Russia probe Trump heaps praise on 'brave' Manafort James isn't an outlier. As I call a number of other Trump voters across different states, a pattern emerges in how they see the entire story. To them it's nothing more than a conspiracy against the man they elected. ""Everyone wants to talk about sex,"" says Cathy De Grazia, who I met as she campaigned for Mr Trump in the state of New Hampshire in 2016. James Montfort III (centre) professes unerring loyalty for the president ""I don't care if he paid off a porn star or a playboy bunny, that doesn't impact his policy making."" Cathy says she doesn't watch TV much these days, and listens instead to talk radio hosts such as Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly. Will Trump remain bulletproof? Can Democrats avoid impeachment talk? ""Michael Cohen once publicly said he would always be loyal to 'Mr Trump',"" writes O'Reilly in hislatest blog to his audience,external. ""But now Cohen opines that his friend of many years is a danger to the country. June Savage ""Maybe Cohen is auditioning for the role of Brutus in the prison play."" The narrative in some conservative media circles has been to portray Mr Cohen as a fall guy, a sentiment Trump supporters sympathise with. What did we learn from the Manafort trial? Cohen Trial: Who is the woman in the blue dress? ""He has been coerced and threatened,"" says Cathy, who believes both the Manafort and Cohen cases are the product of what she calls the ""depth of corruption"" in the FBI. ""I think there's been a tremendous misuse of power and authority,"" she adds. This video can not be played Trump again denied there had been any collusion with Russia to get him elected Ever since Mr Trump took office he has railed against the FBI and intelligence services, and it seems that strength of feeling has filtered down to his base. A phone call to June Savage, a real estate agent and Trump loyalist in Miami, Florida, confirms this sentiment. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Manafort: The man who helped Trump win ""They went on a fishing expedition and they caught two big fish,"" argues June, who unsuccessfully ran to become mayor of Miami Beach last year. ""This is all smoke and mirrors to create a negative atmosphere. The FBI can make up stories once they find a target,"" she argues. ""This target was the president."" This video can not be played A law professor outlines President Trump's perilous legal situation In a throwback to conversations during the 2016 campaign, June believes the real target should be Hillary Clinton. ""They [the Clintons] are one hair away from being investigated about everything that's been going on in this country,"" she says. ""They wanted her to have a clean slate. They have double standards."" The FBI ultimately cleared Mrs Clinton of criminal wrongdoing over her use of a private email server while she was US secretary of state. But that hasn't stopped Trump supporters citing the former Democratic presidential candidate's name as evidence of bias against their man. This video can not be played Journalists start running - with the woman in the blue dress drawing particular attention Several also mentioned the tax affairs ofReverend Al Sharpton,external, a civil rights activist and host on left-leaning MSNBC, arguing that if Manafort's past was examined, so should Sharpton's. And to the Trump base, there's still no proof the president is guilty of a criminal act, or indeed collusion. ""I haven't seen anything that implicates Donald Trump in anything,"" Frank Ruppert, a retiree who lives on the Maryland-West Virginia border, tells me. I phoned Frank - whom I first met after Mr Trump took office - while he was catching up on the day's headlines on Fox News. ""On some of the other networks they're talking about how Trump could be impeached for crimes he hasn't even committed, they've been saying that for two years,"" he adds. Frank Ruppert would vote for Trump again Some have accused Fox News of not focusing enough on the plight of Manafort and Cohen, going big instead on the arrest of a Mexican immigrant who is accused of killing a young woman from Iowa, Mollie Tibbetts. But for much of the Trump base, the agenda of some conservative news outlets merely reflects their own political outlook. ""I'd vote for Trump again, just like everyone would've voted for Bill Clinton again,"" says Frank. ""He's [Mr Trump] created jobs and economic growth, I can't see anything bad in what he's doing."" And as long as his supporters and media allies feel the same, perhaps the president has nothing to worry about.

Wind mapping satellite lifts offThe Aeolus spacecraft launches into orbit to make the first truly global maps of wind behaviour.Science & Environment,"Aeolus data should mean there are fewer surprises in the forecasts A British-assembled satellite has been launched into space to make the first truly global maps of wind behaviour. The Aeolus spacecraft will get its data by firing a powerful laser down into the atmosphere to trace the movement of air particles. Meteorologists are hopeful the mission will have a big impact on the quality of medium-range weather forecasts. Aeolus launched on a Vega rocket from French Guiana at 18:20 local time (22:20 BST). The rocket was due to lift off on Tuesday, but the launch was postponed - ironically - due to high altitude winds. The satellite should begin a programme of testing once it is safely at an altitude of 320km. Team members hope that routine forecasting should be incorporating the laser's information within the year. Aeolus will fire an ultraviolet laser through the atmosphere and measure the return signal using a large telescope The light beam gets scattered back off air molecules and small particles moving in the wind at different altitudes Meteorologists will adjust their numerical models to match the information gathered by the satellite, improving accuracy The biggest impacts are expected on medium-range forecasts - those that look at weather conditions a few days hence Aeolus is only a demonstration mission but it should blaze the trail for future operational weather satellites that use lasers Aeolus: Wind satellite weathers technical storm Aeolus was originally planned to launch a decade ago Currently, there are multiple ways to measure the wind, from whirling anemometers and weather balloons to the satellites that infer wind behaviour by tracking clouds in the sky. But these are all limited indications that tell us what is happening in particular places or at particular heights. Aeolus on the other hand will gather wind data across the entire Earth, from the ground to the stratosphere (30km). The biggest benefits should come to forecasts that look a few days ahead. Bad storms in Europe, for example, will sometimes have their origin in the tropics, and when meteorologists fail to anticipate their severity it's often because the initial-state conditions given to computer models contained inaccurate wind information. The tropics are the key region where the Sun dumps its energy into the Earth system. It is this solar input that triggers the large-scale patterns of circulation in the atmosphere. ""These patterns then propagate both north and south and influence the variability at the mid-latitudes, and, in particular for medium-range forecasts, this influence is very important,"" explainedErland KÃ¤llÃ©n,external, a former director of research at theEuropean Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts,external(ECMWF). Mr KÃ¤llÃ©n, who is now director of the Centre for Climate Research in Singapore, said: ""If we don't get the tropics right in the initial state for the forecasting, we can't then get the mid-latitudes right in the medium range."" Simulations of the forthcoming data suggest Aeolus's impact will be like doubling the number of weather balloons available to meteorologists. Forecast quality is anticipated to increase by 2-4% outside of the tropics and by up to 15% in the tropics themselves. Aeolus should keep working for at least three to four years Technical problems mean Aeolus is more than a decade late. TheEuropean Space Agency,external, whose project this is, first approved the mission in 1999, with the intention of launching the satellite in 2007. But engineersstruggled to get the ultraviolet laser to workin the conditions it would experience in orbit. TheBritish arm of Airbus,external, which led the assembly of Aeolus, essentially had to mothball the chassis, or bus, of the spacecraft for several years while new designs for the laser were sought. Aeolus is arguably the most difficult mission ever implemented by Esa. Many thought it might never fly. Anders Elfving is the agency's Aeolus project manager. He told BBC News: ""Really what has fundamentally helped us - has motivated us - is the user community, because nobody else serves them with wind information globally. ""We will really still be, after sixteen years, the only supplier of it. And very soon we can give meteorologists our data pipeline and they can tell us: 'yes, you have the breakthrough we wanted'."" Aeolus is just a one-off demonstration mission, which raises the question of what happens when it inevitably reaches the end of its working life. If it delivers on its promise, forecasters will be loath to lose the advantage. But it would not be Esa's role to produce a second spacecraft. The agency is in the business of R&D, of trialling new concepts. It would be down to others to fund follow-on missions. In Europe, this would fall either toEumetsat,external, the intergovernmental organisation that runs Europe's operational weather satellites, or the European Commission through its own Earth observation programme, known asCopernicus,external. It is conceivable also that international partners, such as the US and China, would be interested in lofting a constellation of satellites.

Corbyn wreath row explained,"Jeremy Corbyn was pictured at a wreath-laying ceremony in 2014 Jeremy Corbyn has faced questions about a wreath-laying ceremony he attended in Tunisia in 2014. The Labour leader has said he visited the cemetery to honour innocent people killed in a 1985 Israeli air strike. But he has faced criticism because the event took place near memorials for people who were accused of having links to a terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympic Games. In recent days the issue has returned to the headlines. Here's what we know: In September 2014, when still a backbench MP, Mr Corbyn attended a conference in Tunis, organised by the Centre for Strategic Studies for North Africa. It was called the International Conference on Monitoring the Palestinian Political and Legal Situation in the Light of Israeli Aggression. Jeremy Corbyn will not apologise over Tunisia wreath row Jeremy Corbyn reacts to 'terror memorial' claims One of its aims was to reconcile differences between the two main Palestinian factions: Hamas and Fatah. Other attendees included former US attorney general Ramsey Clark and Ossama Hamdan, the foreign representative of Hamas, as well as Conservative peer Lord Sheikh and Liberal Democrat Lord Phillips. During the trip, Mr Corbyn took up an invitation to join a delegation paying respects to those killed in a 1985 Israeli bombing of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) headquarters in Tunis. Photographs suggest a wreath was laid at the base of a large statue erected in memory of the victims and that Mr Corbyn was next to the memorial, mostly in the background, not holding a wreath. The delegation then seems to have moved on to a cemetery three miles (5km) away, which houses a monument to those killed in the attack. It also includes graves of people accused of having links to the 1972 Munich massacre, when Palestinian group Black September killed 11 hostages from the Israeli Olympic team and a West German police officer. Read more about the 1972 Munich Olympics attack The Palestinian Embassy in Tunisia'sFacebook page,externaldescribed the event as a memorial to the 1985 attack, making no mention of the controversial graves. Among those present were high-level Palestinian figures including Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad, Maher Taher of thePopular Front for the Liberation of Palestineand Palestinian ambassador to Tunisia, Salman el-Herfi. See how the memorials are arranged, in this video from the BBC's Rana Jawad. This video can not be played Inside the Tunisia cemetery at the centre of the Jeremy Corbyn wreath-laying row Yes. Mr Corbyn has confirmed he did lay a wreath, saying this was for those who died in the 1985 bombing. But critics have pointed out that a photograph from the event appears to show him standing opposite the graves of Atef Bseiso and Salah Khalaf, two senior PLO officers who were accused of links to the Munich attack and were assassinated. The Daily Mail, which first published the image, quoted Ilana Romano, the widow of weightlifter Yossef who was killed at Munich, saying: ""To go to the grave of a person behind the killing of 11 athletes, he should be ashamed and apologise."" There is no photograph of Mr Corbyn laying the wreath at this spot. A memorial for the 1985 air strike is feet away. The BBC's Rana Jawad, who has visited the cemetery, said she understood the area next to the pair's graves to be the spot where dignitaries and diplomats gather every year to remember victims of the 1985 bombing, as well as senior PLO members. The cemetery signs, and markings on the graves and memorial, are in Arabic. Mr Corbyn's spokesman has said he did not take part in laying wreaths on the men's graves. A Labour spokesman also told the Guardian the two men had denied having links with the terrorist group, and that the PLO also disputed this. This video can not be played Corbyn asked about Tunisia wreath-laying criticism Since the controversy first hit the headlines during the 2017 general election campaign, Mr Corbyn has repeatedly said he was in Tunisia to promote peace in the Middle East and was commemorating victims of the 1985 Israeli bombing. Attention has focused on a 2014 Morning Star article, in which he wrote that ""wreaths were laid at the graves of those who died on that day and on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991"". Mossad is the Israeli intelligence agency. Mr Corbyn has not confirmed precisely who he was referring to in this article. Atef Bseiso was killed in Paris in 1992, and Salah Khalaf was assassinated in Tunisia in 1991. On Monday, after photographs from the event emerged in the press, Mr Corbyn was asked to clarify his involvement. He said he had been at the event as part of a conference which was ""all about the search for peace"". Asked about his Morning Star reference to wreaths for ""others killed by Mossad"", he said he was present but added: ""I don't think I was actually involved in it"". On Tuesday, when pressed further about the pictures of him holding a wreath, he said: ""I laid one wreath along with many other people, as I have said, in memory of all those who died in the awful attack in 1985, which, as I keep repeating, was condemned by the whole world."" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has attacked Mr Corbyn, accusing him of laying a wreath ""on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre"" and saying he deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"". Mr Corbyn said his claim was ""false"" and hit back at the Israeli prime minister, condemning his government's treatment of Palestinian protesters. The Labour leader has also been criticised from within his own party by MP Luciana Berger, who tweeted: ""Being 'present' is the same as being involved. ""When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. There can also never be a 'fitting memorial' for terrorists. Where is the apology?"" Israeli PM attacks Corbyn in wreath row The Conservatives have sought to capitalise on the row, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid suggesting Mr Corbyn should resign. But Mr Corbyn's supporters defended him. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn had ""devoted his life to promoting justice and peace"" which involved ""meeting people who haven't shared those ideals"". Backbench MP Chris Williamson said the Labour leader's ""enemies"" were using the story to ""destabilise"" him, accusing them of ""indulging in egregious smears"".

Trump ex-lawyer 'happy' to aid Russia probe,"From left: Michael Cohen, Donald Trump, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal US President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, is said to be ""more than happy"" to speak to the inquiry into alleged collusion with Russia. Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to violating finance laws during the 2016 presidential election by handling hush money for Mr Trump's alleged lovers. Cohen is ready to ""tell everything about Donald Trump that he knows"", his personal lawyer, Lanny Davis, said. Mr Trump has argued that Cohen had made up stories in order to get a deal. 'I don't care if Trump paid off a porn star' The president denies there was any collusion with Russia to get him elected. In an interview with Fox & Friends, the president said he had found out about the payments ""later on"", and that they did not come out of the campaign. In July,Mr Cohen released audio tapes of him and Mr Trump allegedly discussing payments to a former playboy modelbefore the 2016 presidential election. Cohen, who has been Mr Trump's personal lawyer for more than a decade, has pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He said he had paid hush money to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr Trump, at the direction of ""the candidate"" - a clear reference to Mr Trump. Cohen said the payment was made for the ""principal purpose of influencing [the 2016] election"". Cohen has reached a plea deal with prosecutors, which may see his prison sentence reduced from 65 years to five years and three months. This video can not be played Trump again denied there had been any collusion with Russia to get him elected Investigators have also demanded Cohen appear in court as part of a separate probe into the Trump Foundation, US media report. Will Trump remain bulletproof? A crazy day in Trumpland: Blow by blow Who is the woman in the blue dress? On the same day that Cohen pleaded guilty,a jury convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafortof bank and tax fraud charges. It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department probe, led by former FBI chief Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller has been investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to swing the election in his favour. Russia has denied claims it interfered in the elections. Mr Trump has responded to both the Cohen and Manafort cases with a series of tweets criticising Cohen and praising Manafort.

In his interview with Fox, the president denied the hush money constituted a campaign violation, saying the payments ""didn't come out of the campaign, they came from me, and I tweeted about it"". Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump ""did nothing wrong, there are no charges against him"". Both prosecutors and Cohen agree that Cohen violated campaign finance laws. This video can not be played Trump voter: ""Everybody lies"" Cohen has admitted to handling payments to two women - thought to be porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal - who said they had affairs with Mr Trump. Undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis has asked why the US president should not be prosecuted for the crimes Cohen had confessed to committing on his behalf. McDougal apologises for 'Trump affair' Michael Cohen: Trump's pit bull There is no confirmation that Cohen will speak to Mr Mueller's Russia inquiry. However, Mr Davis says his client is ""more than happy"" to talk, and has knowledge of whether Donald Trump knew in advance about the computer hacking which undermined his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In summer 2016, embarrassing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server were made public. Russian intelligence officers have since been charged in absentia for the hack. This video can not be played Michael Cohen's lawyer: 'It is indisputable... that Donald Trump directed Cohen' Cohen also has knowledge, Mr Davis said, of a meeting at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016 between Trump campaign aides and a Russian delegation which was promising political ""dirt"". Mr Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, went into the meeting in the belief that he would be offered ""official documents and information that would incriminate"" Mrs Clinton. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? What new Trump Tower documents tell us Under US campaign law, it is illegal for a US citizen to solicit foreigners for campaign donations or contributions - although legal experts are divided on whether the offer of information counts as such. President Trump has denied knowing in advance about the meeting. However, according to US media,Cohen has said that Mr Trump had known about the meeting beforehandand that he is willing to state this to the Russian inquiry. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter People in Washington are talking about impeachment - while in the West Wing staffers show a steely resolve. In an area known as Lower Press, located on the ground level of the West Wing, many people seemed on edge - as if they were waiting for something to happen. In a hallway in an area of the West Wing known as Upper Press, I ran into Bill Shine, the president's communications chief, followed by a small group of men - all in a hurry. He shook my hand and gave me a tight smile. For him, the day was only beginning, and it looked like it was going to be a long one. Mr Trump has admitted reimbursing Cohen for paying one of the women, having earlier denied any knowledge of it. But Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Mr Trump, told reporters there had been ""no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president"" in the charges against Cohen. This video can not be played A law professor outlines President Trump's perilous legal situation In any case, Mr Trump is unlikely to face criminal charges as long as he remains president, legal experts say. How easy is it to impeach a president? He could potentially be sacked by Congress under the US constitution's provision for impeaching a president over ""high crimes and misdemeanours"". But for that to happen, Mr Trump's opponents in the Democratic Party would have to win control of both houses. Even if they did well in the mid-term elections in November, they would almost certainly need to persuade members of Mr Trump's Republicans to change sides over the issue. No US president has ever been removed from office on the basis of impeachment.

Corbyn mulls tech tax to fund journalism,"The Labour leader spoke on the state of journalism and the BBC A windfall tax could be levied on tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Facebook to pay for public interest journalism, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leadercalled for radical reform,externalof the ""failing"" news media in a speech at the Edinburgh TV Festival. Other ideas include a ""digital licence fee"" - paid for by big tech companies and internet providers - and publishing data on BBC employees' social class. The Conservatives said the ""internet tax"" would increase consumers' bills. Corbyn attacks press over spy 'smears' Corbyn wreath row explained BBC rejects complaints over Corbyn hat Speaking on Thursday in the Alternative MacTaggart lecture, Mr Corbyn said the British press is ""the least trusted press in Europe"". He said he wants greater investment in investigative, public interest journalism. Existing not-for-profit news organisations, like the Bureau for Investigative Journalism, could be given charitable status, he said. This ""public interest media fund"" could be paid for either through a content sharing and advertising revenue agreement with Google, similar to that agreed in France or Belgium in 2013. Or, if it is not possible, he said a Labour government would be prepared to explore a one-off tax on the profits of the market-leading search engine and other platforms. Mr Corbyn said he supports local journalism and ""salutes"" unions who have fought for media jobs Mr Corbyn also said: He wants a ""dogged"" local media with the ""money and time"" to work on stories. He said quality journalism ""requires decent pay"", citing statistics which show 24% of journalists earn less than Â£20,000 a year Journalists in the private sector could elect their editors to help ""make them accountable to their staff"" as well as corporate bosses New ""news co-operatives"" could be created to report on local government, private contractors operating public services, and regulated bodies ""The best journalism takes on the powerful, in the corporate world as well as government and helps create an informed public,"" he said. The Labour leader, who has been subject to fierce attacks by sections of the British press and has criticised leading tech firms over tax avoidance and data misuse, claimed journalists are being ""held back"" by media tycoons and, in the case of the BBC, by excessive state influence. Mr Corbyn also suggested a series of proposals for the BBC, including publishing the social class of ""all creators of BBC content, whether in-house or external"". Responsibility for deciding the licence fee could be taken away from ministers and handed to an independent body. And he said the digital top-up to the licence fee from tech giants could help reduce the cost of the licence fee for poorer households. He also suggested: BBC staff and licence-fee payers could elect some BBC Board members which he said would reduce political influence National and regional BBC boards could be expanded with quotas for women and minority groups to ""help decentralise the BBC"" A publicly-owned ""sister organisation to the BBC"" could be created called the British Digital Corporation, to provide information and entertainment to rival Netflix and Amazon David Sillito, BBC media and arts correspondent There are two big themes here. One the state of journalism, the other the state of the BBC. With sales of newspapers dropping, journalism - especially local journalism - is without doubt going through a difficult period. Extra cash would make a big difference but offering tax breaks and subsidies to 'public interest journalism' brings the challenge of a government deciding what sort of journalism is in the 'public interest'. Politics also underlies the proposals for the BBC. Getting rid of the negotiations with the government over the BBC's Charter and handing control over setting the licence fee to an independent body would remove one of the political levers over the corporation. Elections for BBC Board members would introduce its own political questions. The underlying point behind all this is Jeremy Corbyn's feeling that the print media and TV and radio news is failing the public - and Labour has not been given fair coverage. Responding to a question from a journalist about the recent ongoing media coverage ofanti-Semitism in the Labour Party,Mr Corbyn said his speech was not an act of ""retribution or retaliation"" to recent negative reports. He added that he has ""spent his life opposing racism and anti-Semitism in any form"". The Conservatives said Labour's proposals were economically illiterate and would hurt consumers. ""Tech companies would just put up their prices and pass this internet tax straight onto families and businesses across the country - adding more pressure to weekly bills,"" said its deputy chair James Cleverly. Ian Murray, the executive director of the Society of Editors, said it welcomed any debate - provided it is done without a political agenda - and the industry would need to discuss the proposals with any future Labour government. Antony Walker, the deputy head of techUK which represents over 950 technology companies, said many firms are already working withthe Cairncross Review,,externalset up to look at the future of journalism in the UK. Mr Corbyn has long supported a review of media ownership rules amid longstanding concerns within the party about the power of companies such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and 21st Century Fox.

DNA shows cave girl was half Neanderthal,"Denisova cave in Siberia: Scene of an ancient liaison Once upon a time, two early humans of different ancestry met at a cave in Russia. Some 50,000 years later, scientists have confirmed that they had a daughter together. DNA extracted from bone fragments found in the cave show the girl was the offspring of a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. The discovery, reported in Nature, gives a rare insight into the lives of our closest ancient human relatives. Neanderthals and Denisovans were humans like us, but belonged to different species. ""We knew from previous studies that Neanderthals and Denisovans must have occasionally had children together,"" says Viviane Slon, researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA) in Leipzig, Germany. ""But I never thought we would be so lucky as to find an actual offspring of the two groups."" Present-day, non-African humans have a small proportion of their DNA that comes from Neanderthals. Some other non-African populations, depending on where they live, also have a fraction of their DNA that comes from an Asian people known as Denisovans. Excavations at the cave The fact the genes have been passed down the generations shows that interbreeding must have happened. However, the only known site where fossil evidence of both Denisovans and Neanderthals has been found is at Denisova cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. Furthermore, fewer than 20 so-called archaic humans (those belonging to species other than our own,Homo sapiens) have had their genomes sequenced. ""Out of this very little number we find one individual that has half-and-half mixed ancestry, "" Dr Slon told BBC News. When other studies are taken into account, ""you start to get a picture that over all of our evolutionary history humans always mixed with each other"". Neanderthals and Denisovans are known to have overlapped in time in Eurasia. The two groups lived until about 40,000 years ago; Neanderthals in the west and Denisovans in the east. As Neanderthals migrated eastwards, they may have encountered Denisovans at times, as well as early modern humans. ""Neanderthals and Denisovans may not have had many opportunities to meet,"" says Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo, director of MPI-EVA. ""But when they did, they must have mated frequently - much more so than we previously thought."" The girl's story has been pieced together from a single fragment of bone found in the Denisova cave by Russian archaeologists several years ago. The cave is the only place where fossils of Neanderthals and Denisovans have been found It was brought to Leipzig for genetic analysis. ""The fragment is part of a long bone, and we can estimate that this individual was at least 13 years old,"" says Bence Viola of the University of Toronto. The researchers deduced that the girl's mother was genetically closer to Neanderthals who lived in western Europe than to a Neanderthal individual who lived earlier in Denisova Cave. This shows that Neanderthals migrated between western and eastern Europe and Asia tens of thousands of years before they died out. Genetic tests also revealed that the Denisovan father had at least one Neanderthal ancestor further back in his family tree. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Student had 'no support' before death,"University staff knew Natasha Abrahart was ""in crisis"" before her death, the pre-inquest review heard A vulnerable university student who told a department manager she had suicidal thoughts did not receive well-being support, a coroner has heard. Natasha Abrahart, 20, a second year physics student at the University of Bristol, died on 30 April. A pre-inquest review panel was told she had emailed a student administration manager in February and told her she had tried to take her own life. Natasha is one of 11 students at the university to die since October 2016. At the hearing at Avon Coroner's Court, the barrister for Natasha's parents, Robert and Margaret Abrahart, asked if it was ""appropriate"" their daughter had no contact with the university's well-being service, despite staff in her department being aware she was ""in crisis"". He said the family had ""real concerns"" about the conduct of the university's staff, and the fact its policies and procedures were unchanged since Natasha's death. He added the family are worried that without action, students may still be at risk when the next term starts in September. In a statement, their lawyer Gus Silverman said: ""The number of recent deaths amongst students at the University of Bristol has been a matter of considerable, and understandable, public concern."" University student suicide rates revealed A University of Bristol spokesperson said: ""We offer our sincere sympathies to Natasha's family following her tragic death and will co-operate fully with the coroner to ensure any lessons learnt are built into the support we provide our students. ""We are putting in place a structure of preventative services and policies to try and avoid our students reaching crisis point."" Coroner Maria Voisin requested further statements from the university prior to the next pre-inquest review hearing. The full inquest is expected to take place next year.

The bridge of desperation," The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has led to one of the largest mass migrations in Latin America’s history. President Nicolás Maduro blames “imperialists” - the likes of the US and Europe - for waging “economic war” against Venezuela and imposing sanctions on many members of his government. But his critics say it is economic mismanagement - first by predecessor Hugo Chávez and now President Maduro himself - that has brought Venezuela to its knees. The country has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It was once so rich that Concorde used to fly from Caracas to Paris. Now, its economy is in tatters. Four in five Venezuelanslive in poverty. People queue for hours to buy food. Much of the time they go without. People are dying from a lack of medicines. Inflation is at 82,766% and there are warnings it could exceedone million per cent by the end of this year. Venezuelans are trying to get out. TheUN says2.3 million people have fled the country - 7% of the population. More than a million have arrived in Colombia in the past 18 months. Many of those Venezuelans have come over the Simón Bolívar International Bridge. The Simon Bolivar International Bridge photographed in February 2018 (EPA/Rex/Shutterstock) The bridge is about 300m long and 7m wide. It straddles the Rio Táchira in the eastern Andes, a river that snakes along the border between Colombia and Venezuela. The river bed can sometimes dry up but heavy rains soon change that. The two small towns the bridge connects - San Antonio del Táchira on the Venezuelan side and Villa del Rosario in Colombia - are in two very different worlds. Colombians rarely pop over the border to do their shopping in Venezuela like they used to. It’s almost entirely one-way traffic nowadays. Every day at 05:00 Colombian time, (06:00 in Venezuela), the sound of a fence being dragged across tarmac breaks the silence in the valley and marks the opening of the bridge to pedestrians. The queue from Venezuela into Colombia usually builds steadily overnight. When the gates open, it’s like athletes out of the starting blocks. Venezuelans can’t get over quickly enough. Some people are stopped by guards and told to open their bags. While most do so without drama, you can see panic in some faces when people realise they are about to be caught. With Venezuela’s economy in crisis, there’s an incentive to smuggle staples like meat and cheese into Colombia so it can be sold for higher prices. The people doing it aren’t Mr Bigs - they’re mostly just Venezuelans desperate to raise money to buy other essentials. Venezuelans pass through migration checks on the bridge One woman, whose meat is confiscated, wails: “What am I meant to do?” The guard replies gruffly: “This is a humanitarian corridor - you can take food into Venezuela but you can’t take it out.” And so it repeats throughout the day. Those with nothing to declare - or perhaps just the lucky ones who aren’t stopped - walk on through. The trundle of suitcase wheels is the soundtrack of this bridge. When you get to the end of the bridge, you reach what’s known as La Parada, or “the stop” in English. It’s a bustling community that makes its money from border trade. Market sellers, pharmacies, shops and bus companies all vying for sales from those crossing the bridge. Most of the street traders here used to be Colombians - this is after all Colombia. But increasingly, Venezuelans have also started setting up shop here, trying to sell their wares in a country where the currency hasn’t been decimated. Right at the end of the bridge, amid the chorus of street-sellers, one man shouts: “Who wants to sell their hair?” In front of a metal barrier protecting the bridge, Laura Castellanos sits on a plastic stool. The 25-year-old has long wavy brown hair to the bottom of her back. She looks uneasy. A woman is stood behind her, scissors in hand. Laura is about to lose most of her hair. She’s nursing her two-month old daughter Paula who is wrapped up in a big fluffy blanket and wearing a stripy pink hat. She yawns as she lies patiently in her mother’s arms, unaware of the border chaos around her. Laura’s husband Jhon Acevedo is nearby looking after their two older daughters. The hair-cutter is lifting up the top layer of Laura’s hair and cutting what’s underneath right back to the roots. She doesn’t want to talk much. It’s almost as if she’s embarrassed. With every snip she hands a chunk of hair to another woman standing next to her. The hair buyer says nothing and looks away. It feels like a cold transaction, nothing more. Laura is getting paid 30,000 pesos ($10) for her hair. It’ll be sold on to make extensions or wigs. “It’s the first time I’ve done it,” she says with a mixture of nervousness and embarrassment. She’s come for the day from the town of Rubio, about an hour from the border. Laura is selling her hair because her eldest daughter, eight-year-old Andrea, has diabetes and the family needs to raise money to pay for her insulin which she takes three times a day. The family has run out of supplies and it’s been three days since little Andrea last had her shots. Jhon’s salary as a saddler doesn’t always stretch to pay for his daughter’s drugs. “There’s no medicine, it’s hard,” says Laura. “People are dying in Venezuela because they can’t get the medicines they need.” After five minutes of cutting, the family heads off to find a pharmacy. At first glance you can’t tell Laura’s had most of her hair removed. The hair-cutter has left a thin layer of long hair on top to hide the truth. Laura admits she feels a bit sad. “It will pay for something at least,” she says. Her husband Jhon says they’re looking for a “pirate” pharmacy - an informal stall that sells drugs in plastic cabinets on the street. Insulin pens will be cheaper there than in a walk-in drug store. A Colombian “pirate” pharmacy But on the streets around La Parada there’s no way of knowing that what they are buying is the real deal. Counterfeits abound but it’s a risk Laura and the family think is worth taking. “There’s no insulin back home, you can’t get it anywhere,” Laura says as she eyes the best-before date on the side of the insulin pen. They pick up two dark blue pens for 8,000 pesos each ($2.65) and go on their way. That will last them nearly two months before they have to begin the search again. It’s not enough time for Laura’s hair to grow back. Andrea with her insulin pen On the other side of the road, not more than 10m from where Laura was getting her hair cut, 29-year-old Celene Cacique is sitting on the pavement. The mother-of-three has a black, red and white jacket with a picture of Mickey Mouse. She’s nursing her youngest - two-month-old baby Isabella who is wrapped up in a pink blanket and has a little hat on. The sun is strong during the day but the early mornings are crisp here - wrapping up babies is a good idea. The bigger the blanket, the better. Celene Cacique (second left) and her baby Isabella Celene got here at 06:45, queuing for the health centre which opens at 08:00. She’s chatting to other mothers who’ve all come to vaccinate their babies. Lined up along the pavement are brightly-coloured prams and bundled-up babies. The Colombian government opened the centre at the end of the bridge to attend to the large number of Venezuelans who are coming over the border to get vaccines. With severe shortages of medicines and vaccines in Venezuela,an estimated one million children are now unvaccinatedand diseases that never used to be a problem are now re-emerging. Diphtheria and measles are just some of those making a come-back. It’s the second time Celene has had to make the journey over the border. “I came eight days ago and there were more than 120 kids,” she says.  “They only let 100 in and the other 20 weren’t served. You have to get here early.” It’s been a very tough few months for Celene. When she was just four months pregnant with Isabella, her husband was killed. Michel worked as a lorry driver, moving cargo across the border between Venezuela and Colombia. Driving home at 10 in the evening on his motorbike, he hit a cow in the middle of the road and was killed instantly. The hospital called her at three in the morning to tell her he was in the mortuary. “There are no lights on the road,” explains Celene matter-of-factly. “There’s so much theft, people take cables, copper, they leave nothing. It’s how they find money to pay for food.” Venezuela’s economic problems effectively cost Michel his life. President Maduro is the worst thing Chávez left us” That’s a feeling shared by many. When Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999, there was hope. He was a man who championed the poor in what has always been a deeply divided society. He was a vibrant and controversial figure who wanted to lead a socialist revolution in Venezuela. But Chavez was helped by strong commodity prices that funded his ambitious social programmes. With a fall in oil prices, President Maduro has had no such luck  - and little of the charisma his predecessor had. During his leadership, the country has fallen into economic decline. “The government does whatever it wants, it has all the power,” says Celene. “Only God can help us - it’s the only thing left.” But Celene has a lifeline. Her mother-in-law lives in the US and sends back $500 every couple of months. With her new baby, and two older children who are four and eight, Celene is unable to work. So she relies on that money to keep her afloat. It’s money that she also shares with her sister, her brother-in-law and their baby. Jessica Pérez is sitting next to Celene, cradling 14-month-old Santiago. Jessica Pérez and son Santiago It’s easier for us because we’re near the border but the people in the middle of the country have no way of doing this... I don’t know how they survive with children there” She says that if a woman has a Caesarean-section in a public hospital now, she has to bring her own supplies. In 2016,infant mortality rose 30% in Venezuela.Maternal mortality jumped 65%. It’s figures like these that drive Venezuelans - if they have the means - to head to Colombia to seek medical help. At 08:00, the health centre opens. Dozens of women clutching their tiny babies file in, taking their seats on a row of benches under a large shelter with a corrugated iron roof. Santiago receiving his vaccinations Within minutes, screams echo throughout the makeshift centre. Three nurses are sitting at a small table. There are several cool boxes on top, each containing vaccines. One by one, they call up the babies and they are given a host of jabs. They’re making the most of the free health care. Celene’s little Isabella is being given a 5-in-1 vaccine, as well as polio, rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines. “Maduro needs to have a conscience and go. At least leaving will would give us hope - we don’t have any hope anymore,” says Celene. “Children are dying from malnutrition, it’s a critical situation.” She won’t stop. She has so much to say about the crisis back home. “The president ignores it all - he says it’s fine and it’s a lie,” she says. “It’s really sad because you realise that nobody in any country can help us. What do we do? We survive.” Warning: This chapter contains images of injury While pop-up health centres by the bridge can deal with less serious illnesses, 10 minutes’ drive away into the centre of the nearest city Cúcuta, the Erasmo Meoz hospital is struggling with far bigger problems. The red-brick university hospital is creaking under the pressure. In the emergency ward, patients are lined up in hospital beds along the wall and in front of doors. Family members are gathered around the beds, comforting their relatives. Those who are able to are sitting on a row of plastic chairs. Other patients are in wheelchairs, attached to drips. Outside the ward, in the hospital courtyard, more people are waiting. In among the mass of people, a group of prisoners, chained by the wrists, is guided to another part of hospital for treatment. The emergency ward has capacity for 75 beds. But there are currently 100 patients in this room. There’s hardly any space to move. In a room off the main ward, a dead body lies waiting. Covered in a white cotton sheet, and tied tight around the neck and feet, it’s there for all to see until a member of staff finally wheels it through the crowds of beds and on to the mortuary. There’s no space or time for a peaceful exit in this chaotic hospital. Each bed is marked with the patient’s nationality. Ángel Escobar, 28, is one of the Venezuelans. His mother is wrapping bandages around arms which are red-raw, blistered and weeping. Ángel Escobar Ángel, his brother Teobaldo and their mother Cecilia recently made the journey from the city of Barinas, 350km from the border. They didn’t have the money for a bus ticket, so instead they hitched several rides, nursing Ángel and his wounds along the way. Ángel used to be a motorcycle mechanic. Five years ago, he was fixing a bike in his workshop when a spark caused a petrol tank to explode. “I got second and third degree burns,” he explains. “I waited in hospital in Venezuela for help - it never came.” Instead his situation got worse. He contracted three infections in hospital and he went downhill rapidly. The injuries he’s got look so red and recent but this has been five years of daily pain. The seeping raw skin is the aftermath of the infections, not the burns themselves. “They didn’t treat him because they didn’t have supplies,” Cecilia explains. She says there wasn’t even an infection specialist at the hospital to help. Ángel has got large scaly scabs on top of his skin that are slowly coming off now he’s in hospital. His arms are deformed because of an error made by the doctors in Venezuela. In Colombia he says he’s being looked after at last. Dr Andrés Eloy Galvis Jaimes, who is in charge of the emergencies ward, says the situation is getting out of hand. “Thirty per cent of our patients in emergencies are Venezuelans,” he says. “The national government isn’t giving us extra money. There’ll come a moment that we won’t have any more resources for anyone. That’s a real fear.” Around the corner, a middle-aged man is lying on a bed in the corridor waiting for a gall-bladder operation. He came over from San Antonio, the town just across the bridge. He’s been lying here for four days. A patient awaits his gall-bladder operation “In Venezuela you can’t get anything, you just die,” he says. “There aren’t even sedatives,” he adds laughing. He used to work in a bag factory but it closed down. Now, he earns his money smuggling petrol. “There’s nothing else to do,” he says. Every night he works in “las trochas” - the word used for illegal trails that cross the border. It’s a journey of 20 minutes, there and back, he says. He does the trip two or three times a night. “They give it away in Venezuela,” he says, of the heavily-subsidised fuel. While hyperinflation has seen prices of most goods soar in Venezuela, petrol prices have remained low. A bottle of water can cost 30,000 times the price of filling up a tank in Venezuela. To smuggle 250 litres, he says he pays off the soldiers with 15,000 Colombian pesos ($5) and gets 20,000 pesos himself. Smugglers earn a tidy sum reselling fuel over the border. It’s one of the reasons President Maduro said earlier this month that he wanted to get rid of universal subsidies and allow prices to rise to international levels. On the Ruta Nacional 55, a main road leading south out of Cúcuta, a group of seven Venezuelans are walking along the side of the road, hoping to hitch a lift. Their belongings are in holdalls strapped across their backs or in small rucksacks. A couple have bags of water. Eliane Pedrique took a bus from Valencia, Venezuela’s third largest city,  to the border with Colombia. From there, her only option was to walk to the city of Pamplona to find work. It’s about 60km. She’s not very well-equipped and only has sandals to wear. But with the bus fare costing 100,000 pesos ($33 dollars), it’s a luxury she can’t afford. Eliane Pedrique and her friend walking to Pamplona Eliane has left her two children, aged five and two, with her mother. “I feel really sad,” she says, crying. “There’s no way of earning money. There’s no work and the small amount you can earn doesn’t even stretch to buy rice,” she says. “You have to leave to be able to earn that little extra money so you can help.” In Venezuela she sold ice cream and fruit on the streets. She used to sell fruit juice too but with the price of sugar going up so much, she had to stop. She couldn’t afford nappies for her baby so instead she used bits of cloth, known as “guayucos” and then a plastic bag wrapped around it to keep the urine from leaking. “They didn’t want me to go,” she says of her family she’s left behind. “They asked me to be careful but they have faith. We have to go forward for the sake of our children.” She’s going to Pamplona unsure of what she will do but willing to try anything. “If you don’t work, you don’t eat,” she says. “It’s one of the terrible consequences of this awful government we have in Venezuela. In truth, it’s hit us hard and it’s been even worse since he won the elections again in May,” she says of President Maduro. She wants to go home in two months to give her family the money she has earned, and then return to Colombia once again. If she goes back to Venezuela, she’ll notice some big changes. The presidenthas overhauled the country’s currency, the bolivar, slashing five zeroes off it and pegging it to a state-backed cryptocurrency called the Petro. He also raised the minimum wage by over 3,000%. While these changes have been justified as an attempt by the Maduro administration to rein in spiralling inflation and improve the lives of millions, few people have faith they will alter the economic realities of the country. In the heat, the walk isn’t easy. Some people along the way have been kind, giving the walkers fruit and water. But not everyone is friendly. The day they arrived, one man gave them water with plant fertiliser in it.

The day they arrived, one man gave them water with plant fertiliser in it. Edgar Centeno met Eliane on the border and they’ve joined up for moral support along the walk. Edgar is 21 with a partner and two-year-old boy back home. In Venezuela he worked in various jobs - fixing air-conditioning units was just one of his lines of work. Edgar Centeno “You need at least 10 jobs to be able to survive,” he says. Colombia though is a place of opportunity. On Edgar’s back is a red, yellow and blue rucksack. They’re the colours of the Venezuelan flag. It’s a bag given to Venezuelan school children by the government but it’s become a common sight among migrants. “My aim is not to go back empty-handed,” he says, as he walks along the road. “I made a promise to myself that I have to provide a good future for my son. Whatever happens, I need to support him.” He doesn’t know where he’ll end up, he may carry on through South America to find the right job. He’s weighing up Peru as an option. That dream though may not be easy to achieve. Venezuela’s neighbours are tightening their borders. Ecuador has declared a state of emergency with more than 4,000 Venezuelans crossing the Colombia-Ecuador border every day. Both Ecuador and Peru have also said Venezuelans will need passports to enter their countries - until now, an ID card had been enough. All of the walkers blame the president for the crisis the country’s in. Edgar struggles to articulate what he feels and then comes out with it. “He’s useless, he’s scum,” he says. “He blames everyone apart from himself,” adds Elaine. “He doesn’t take any responsibility. He just needs to go.” You would expect people like Eliane and Edgar, who are leaving Venezuela, to have an anti-Maduro bent. But the government maintains that the criticisms regularly levelled against it are unfair - that if it wasn’t for the US “imperialists” who want to control Venezuela, or the sanctions imposed on members of President Maduro's government and an opposition he says is hell-bent on destroying the country, then Venezuela would be in much better shape. President Maduro and his administration often paint themselves as the innocent victims in this story of Venezuela’s decline. And they paint those who leave as deserters of the socialist cause. Edgar, Elaine and their friends don’t want to stick around. They have ground to cover before the day ends. They cross the road and start walking towards their new - and unknown - future. As the day goes on, the queues carry on building on the border. Hundreds of people wait in line at immigration for a stamp in their passport to make their onward journey more straightforward. There are queues at money transfer houses where Venezuelans wait patiently to pick up much-needed funds from relatives and friends who live abroad. And there are queues for buses - people waiting with suitcases piled up high, their entire possessions carefully packed as they head to meet their friends and families across South America. But for every Venezuelan lucky enough to be moving on, there remain dozens who don’t have the resources to go anywhere. Johnny, Angel and Yember are hanging around the middle of the bridge, waiting for Venezuelans to come over. Dressed in T-shirts, ripped jeans and trainers, they’ve each got a luggage trolley in hand with rope wrapped around the handles - they’re ready to tie up the heavy bags of incoming Venezuelans and help them get to the nearest bus stop. They’re all recent arrivals from the capital Caracas, Valencia and San Cristobal. They’ve stayed by the border to earn some money before moving on. But business as a “maletero” is slow. “The people coming from Venezuela are immigrants with nothing,” they say. They’re coming in search of money and better lives so few nowadays have the spare change for a luggage-handler. On a good day, they earn 15,000 pesos ($5) but on a bad one, not even a cent. They’ve given up hope of change back home. With President Maduro winning the elections, he now has another six-year term they think he’ll complete. “If things could end peacefully, then that would be the best thing,” says Johnny. He dismisses the idea of the military turning against the president. “A coup could mean lots of people, including children, would die. But if things could end, well...” he trails off, thinking of the options. From the bridge where the maleteros are, you can see a blue-painted cage. Inside is a figure of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Virgen del Carmen). She’s the patron saint of drivers and of the Army in the Andes. In a part of the world where hope is fading, faith remains strong. Fitting too that her home is an insecure frontier town, an area where soldiers operate around the clock. A figure of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel The virgin sits across a dirt road, in front of a metal yard where Pompilio Rincón is throwing slabs of aluminium on to a scrap heap. He says there are lots of metal collectors that come over from Venezuela. “Before, Venezuelans would come in their cars and trucks,” he says. Now, people are bringing metal on their backs - women and children too.” As he chats, a young teenager in a smart checked short-sleeved t-shirt comes in with a big bag and dumps his treasure on to the massive set of scales on the floor of the warehouse. He hopes to get 1,500 pesos (50 cents) per kilo of his metal. Scrap metal dealer Pompilio Rincón with young collector Breiner Hernández Breiner Hernández, 15, comes from San Cristóbal in Venezuela. He goes to school in the morning and when he’s not studying, he’s looking for metal. Every few days he jumps on the bus with his bag to sell on the other side of the border here in La Parada. “With scrap metal, what I make in one month in Venezuela, I make in one day here,” he explains, adding that the money goes to help his family eat. He lives with his grandfather who looks after Breiner's two younger siblings so his salary matters. He’s been doing this since the start of the year. “The situation is really difficult,” he says. He can’t vote but it doesn’t stop him having an opinion on his country’s politics. “No one wants Maduro, he treats people really badly,” he says. “We need a change.” As the sun starts to set, more and more Venezuelans head back over the bridge, their jobs done for the day. Food purchased, medical appointments met. One passer-by loaded with nappies shouts “what a humiliation” - people having to leave their country to buy basic goods so they can survive. But even as the afternoon fades, there are still plenty of people still trying to enter Colombia. They’re queuing up along a bright yellow metal fence, like corralled cattle, waiting for their turn to show their documents and be allowed in.

On one fence, there’s a billboard. The sign reads ""Territorio de Paz"" or Territory of Peace. “Territory of peace” it reads. But one soldier mutters. He sounds fed up. He may work for the government but he suffers the same as his compatriots. His salary doesn’t stretch and he can’t eat a decent meal. “I wonder how long I can last here,” he tells me as he too contemplates his escape. Built with Shorthand"
Murdered model's girlfriend 'threatened',"Harry Uzoka was killed by a stab wound to the heart in January The girlfriend of a murdered male model says she has received death threats after being named during the trial of her boyfriend's killers. George Koh, 24, was convicted of stabbing his more successful fashion rival Harry Uzoka 25, in the heart. The court heard Koh bragged about having sex with Mr Uzoka's girlfriend, Ruby Campbell, who is also a model. She has taken to social media to deny having sex with Koh and said she had received ""multiple death threats"". In an Instagram post accompanying a picture of her and Mr Uzoka, she insisted she had never met Koh, who stabbed her boyfriend in the heart while she was away working in Los Angeles and Sweden.

'Gun factory' found on industrial estate,"The NCA said the premises was advertised as a gearbox repair business and contained an engineering workshop Crime investigators have uncovered what they say is a ""sophisticated"" illegal gun factory on an industrial estate. Two handguns and ammunition were found by officers who arrested three men leaving the building on the Diplocks estate in Hailsham, East Sussex. The National Crime Agency said it subsequently found equipment which it believes is part of a ""large-scale"" gun and ammunition manufacturing operation. Three men have been remanded in custody until 17 September on firearms charges. Investigators discovered the set-up when they went to the building, housing an engineering workshop, in Diplocks Way on Saturday. The NCA said the three men were arrested at the site and a Taser was used to detain one of them. The NCA said officers found firearms and ammunition Officers who searched the premises, which was advertised as a gearbox repair business, seized machinery and components which they believe were for use ""in the criminal manufacture of firearms and ammunition"" and would make about 30 handguns. The NCA said a number of handguns ""in various stages of production"" and what appeared to be templates and metal were found. Rob Hickinbottom, head of the NCA's national firearms threat centre, said: ""We suspect that this operation has disrupted a group that would appear to be involved in the criminal production of firearms. ""As a result we have prevented a potentially large quantity of weapons from getting onto the black market and into the hands of criminals."" Greg Akehurst, 29, of no fixed address, Mark Kinman, 63, of Bramwell Mews, Hailsham, and Kyle Wood, 30, of Gratwicke Drive, Littlehampton, were remanded in custody by Brighton magistrates on Monday and are due to appear at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court on 17 September.

A dramatic day in Trumpland dissected,"Supporters of President Trump greeted him at a rally in West Virginia hours after his former aides learned they face jail Two dramatic moments in court, only minutes apart. Since Donald Trump became US president 19 months ago, there has been no shortage of spectacle. But there have been few days as eventful or potentially impactful as 21 August, 2018. This is how that day unfolded. Since May 2017, a special investigation headed by former FBI chief Robert Mueller has been looking into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and whether Donald Trump's victorious campaign team colluded with Russia. Among the first of the 32 people and three companies charged as part of the investigation was Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's former campaign chief. Meanwhile, another investigation stemming from the special counsel has been bubbling under the surface for a few months: New York prosecutors have been examining the dealings of Mr Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. 21 August - 09:30 eastern time (14:30 BST) In Alexandria, Virginia, a jury is starting its fourth day of deliberations in Mr Manafort's trial - he faces 18 allegations of falsifying his tax returns, committing bank fraud, and failing to file reports of foreign bank accounts. The two-week trial is the first to emerge from the special counsel investigation. Among the witnesses for the prosecution was Rick Gates, Mr Manafort's former right-hand man. In accusing Mr Manafort of not declaring all his income, the prosecution had detailed his extravagant purchases - including a $15,000 (Â£11,640) ostrich jacket. Some of Manafort's many jackets that were shown to the jury 11:36 There are signs the jury in Virginia may be close to returning a verdict - news agencies reveal that jurors have asked the judge what they should do if they cannot reach a unanimous conclusion. 11:59 In breaking news, MSNBC report that Mr Cohen is in talks about a possible plea deal. Over the next 90 minutes, the news is confirmed by a number of other US media outlets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, in a note to the court, Mr Mueller's team says it is not yet ready to sentence him. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says this is a sign that Flynn, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the presidential transition, is still co-operating with Mr Mueller and that his usefulness to the investigation is ongoing. 14:42 The Associated Press reveal that a plea deal has been reached in the Cohen case. Media report that he will appear before a federal court in Manhattan at 16:00. 16:05 Mr Cohen arrives at court. Michael Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Mr Trump 16:25 An urgent line by Reuters flashes in newsrooms:Jury reaches verdict in bank and tax fraud trial of former Trump campaign chairman Manafort Over the next 10 minutes, the full verdict is read out:Manafort is found guilty on eight chargesof tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. But the jury fails to reach a verdict on 10 other charges and the judge declares a mistrial on those. Manafort could face up to 80 years in jail.

It is not yet clear, despite his plea deal, whether Cohen is co-operating with the special counsel investigation. The deal does mean he could face a reduced jail sentence, of up to five years and three months. 17:19 Robert Khuzami, the prosecutor in the Cohen case, hold a press conference outside the federal court in Manhattan. ""These are very serious charges and reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over an extended period of time,"" he says. 17:38 President Trump emerges from Air Force One in Charleston, West Virginia, where he will be taking part in a rally later that night. Reporters shout, asking whether he has any reaction to the Manafort and Cohen cases as he walks down the steps. He doesn't immediately reply but later walks over to the gathered journalists. This video can not be played President Trump: ""I feel very badly for Paul Manafort"" ""Paul Manafort is a good man,"" he says. ""He was with Ronald Reagan, he was with a lot of different people over the years and I feel very sad about that. It doesn't involve me, very sad thing that happened, nothing to do with Russian collusion, absolutely nothing to do with - it's a witch hunt and a disgrace."" He doesn't address the Michael Cohen plea deal. 21:32 In an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis says his client is happy to co-operate with the Russia investigation. ""Mr Cohen has knowledge on certain subjects that should be of interest in the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows,"" he says.

Will Trump remain bulletproof?,"Mr Trump has effectively been implicated in the commission of a crime Tuesday's duelling courtroom dramas in New York and Virginia were the kind of body blows that would stagger, if not fell, most presidencies. And those were just the two top headlines in a day that contained a string of dismal news for Donald Trump. Will any of this matter? The president - at least among his base - has appeared politically bulletproof. Bulletproof for now, however, doesn't necessarily mean bulletproof forever. At some point, the projectiles - perhaps after the mid-terms, when Republican control of Congress and power to set the political agenda may be blunted - may start finding the mark. Here's a look at just how bad a day this was for the president. The president's former personal lawyer didn't just stand in court on Tuesday and accuse the president of lying - although he did do that. By saying that Mr Trump - ""individual-1"" in the plea agreement - directed him to make or oversee payments in 2016 to secure the silence of women poised to accuse the president of having adulterous affairs with them, he effectively implicated the president in the commission of a crime. Cohen pleaded guilty in a Manhattan court to violating campaign finance laws Cohen admitted that his payments constituted campaign contributions that either were directed from an illegal corporate source or in excess of allowable amounts for an individual. Both acts carry a five-year maximum prison sentence. The president in the past has denied having any knowledge of the payments. His legal team has since walked that back and asserted that he only had general knowledge after the fact. Now, however, Cohen is saying Mr Trump knew about them from the start. And it's not just Cohen's word against the president's. In the case of the payment to Karen MacDougal - ""woman-1"" in the plea agreement - his lawyer has already released an audio recording in which Cohen and then-candidate Mr Trump discussed the issue. Trump 'directed' hush money, says Cohen Who is Michael Cohen? Add to this the fact that ""woman-2"", adult film actress Stormy Daniels, is now poised to resume her lawsuit against Mr Trump to get out of her non-disclosure agreement brokered by Cohen. A judge put the suit on hold pending the criminal investigation into Cohen, which now appears to be resolved. That suit could turn up more evidence of Mr Trump's involvement in the illegal $130,000 hush-money payment Cohen has now confessed to making to her on the eve of the 2016 election. It's heavy seas ahead for the president any way you look at it. Special Counsel Robert Mueller was under considerable pressure to get a conviction in his case against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. Even though the charges did not directly relate to the central thrust of his investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, it was the first time his team had to face a jury. If they had walked away without a conviction, either through a hung jury or an outright acquittal, the accusations from Trump loyalists that the investigation was a waste of resources and time would have reached a fevered pitch. Trump fears 'perjury trap' in Russia inquiry It wasn't an across-the-board victory for Mr Mueller, given that the jury couldn't reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 counts, but convictions on tax fraud, failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and bank fraud are points on the board. Add that to the numerous indictments of Russian individuals and companies and plea agreements already reached with Trump campaign officials George Papadopolous, Michael Flynn and Rick Gates, as well as with London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and computer programmer Richard Pinedo, and the special counsel team is producing a growing list of accomplishments. After the verdicts were announced, Manafort's lawyer told the press that his client was ""disappointed"". That may be a bit of an understatement. Even with convictions on only eight of the 18 criminal counts against him, Mr Trump's former campaign chair could be looking at a lengthy prison sentence. And Manafort faces a second trial in Washington DC next month for money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, conspiracy to defraud the US, making false statements and witness tampering. It's the bulk of the legal case against the long-time Washington lobbyist. Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts Manafort's lawyers had insisted on the two separate trials, perhaps because they thought they he had a better chance of acquittal from an Alexandria jury or friendlier federal judges in the Northern Virginia district. If so, that plan backfired. Manafort may be hoping for a presidential pardon, given that Mr Trump has said his prosecution was politically motivated and that he was a ""good man"". The president can only pardon for federal crimes, however, and Manafort's conviction on tax fraud opens him up to future state-level charges, which Mr Trump has no power to forgive. Now 69-year-old Manafort is facing a lengthy prison sentence - and more legal battles to come. And while he hasn't shown a willingness to co-operate with Mr Mueller's investigation so far, that could change. What did we learn from Manafort trial? Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Manafort, after all, attended the June 2016 Trump tower meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr with Russian nationals, originally billed as a means to gather damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton. He took a series of cryptic notes on the topic, which he might be willing to explain to the special counsel - in exchange for lightened sentence. Having one's former campaign chair end up as a convicted felon is not good news. If Manafort flips, however, a bad day for Mr Trump could, in hindsight, be a catastrophic one. Buried under Tuesday afternoon's news was another nugget from the special counsel's office, that it has requested the sentencing of former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn be delayed once again. ""Due to the status of the investigation, the Special Counsel's Office does not believe that this matter is ready to be scheduled for a sentencing hearing at this time,"" Mr Mueller's lawyers told the court overseeing Flynn's plea deal. That would indicate that Flynn, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the Trump presidential transition, is still co-operating with Mr Mueller and that his usefulness to the investigation is ongoing. It might also mean that a formal sentencing hearing could reveal information Mr Mueller would prefer to keep secret at this time. Either way, it's a sign that, behind the scenes, gears are still grinding in Mr Mueller's investigation. Two weeks ago Chris Collins of New York, the first member of the House of Representatives to endorse Mr Trump's presidential bid, was indicted for insider trading. On Tuesday afternoon, Duncan Hunter - the second congressman to do so - was charged with using campaign funds for personal expenses, including trips for his family to Hawaii and Italy. Earlier in the day Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled a sweeping programme of political reform measures she said were necessary to address widespread political corruption in Washington DC. That included a ban on all lobbying by former top government officials, a prohibition of all members of Congress and White House staff from holding individual corporate stocks and a requirement that all president and vice-presidential candidates disclose eight years of tax returns. Similar calls for fixing a broken political system helped Democrats sweep into power in Congress in 2006. It did the same for Republicans in 1994. Mr Trump's ""drain the swamp"" rhetoric was a constant rallying cry for his supporters in 2016. After Tuesday's onslaught of convictions, pleas and indictments, Warren's slate of proposals could prove to be a potent mid-term weapon for Democrats this November, if they know how to use it.

Hospital 'neglected' woman who died in A&E,"Royal Cornwall Hospital failed to carry out ""basic observations"" on Katy Lowry A hospital neglected a disabled woman who died in A&E by failing to carry out basic medical checks after she was admitted, an inquest has concluded. Katy Lowry, 30, who had chromosomal abnormalities and learning difficulties, was taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital on 13 December 2016. She had been vomiting every 15 minutes for nearly 24 hours. Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon concluded Miss Lowry died of natural causes, contributed to by neglect. She said the failure to carry out basic observations and adequate assessment on Miss Lowry when she arrived at the hospital had ""led or contributed to her death"". Her fatal collapse happened about two-and-a-half hours after arriving at the hospital and she could not be resuscitated. More Cornwall stories here Expert witness and consultant surgeon Andrew Wyman said if observations had been taken and treatment of IV fluids and antibiotics had been started Miss Lowry would not have died. Katy Lowry with her mother Beverley Richards Nurse Simon Taylor, who had been on triage duty, said he decided not to take Miss Lowry's observations as she would have needed to have taken some of her clothing off - something he felt would be ""inappropriate"". The inquest heard Mr Taylor had said in an interview following the incident he had very little time to triage each patient and undressing Miss Lowry would have taken ""a lot of time"" because she was in a wheelchair. In evidence he denied he had said this. The inquest heard a number of opportunities were missed to take the observations. The omission was described as a ""gross failure"" by the hospital's chief nurse Kim O'Keefe, who apologised ""unreservedly"" on behalf of the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust for Miss Lowry's death. Miss Lowry's medical cause of death was recorded as pulmonary aspiration due to hiatus hernia and acute cholecystitis - inflammation of the gall bladder. In a statement, Miss Lowry's brother Christopher said the family had wanted to know the true cause of his sister's death. ""Was this detectable, treatable and her death preventable, and sadly we know now the answer is 'yes' to all three,"" he said. He added: ""Katy, we miss your laughter, your singing, your sparkly shoes and socks and your pennies left all over the house, we even miss the sound of your noisy toys. All of our lives are less colourful now."" Vaughan Temby from DisAbility Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, said: ""Katy would still be here if she had not been viewed as a disabled person first but as a patient first."" In a statement after the hearing Mrs O'Keeffe said Miss Lowry's death ""should not have happened"". She said: ""Over the past 12 months we have been strenuously working to be an Improving Trust in safety, governance and delay and we are committed to learning from the investigation into Katy's care.""

Radiologist shortage 'affecting cancer care',"Radiologists carry out complex procedures including cancer tumour therapies A shortage of senior radiologists around the UK is causing delays for patients, and affecting cancer and other medical care. Radiologists' leaders say the situation is unacceptable and must be tackled by ministers. Figures suggest their workload of reading and interpreting scans has increased by 30% between 2012 and 2017. But the number of consultant radiologists in England has gone up by just 15% in that time. The figures, given to the BBC by the Royal College of Radiologists, also suggest the number of these senior posts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has remained static over that period. Carol Johns is worried about her mother Maria, who is in constant pain because of swollen feet and ankles. Over a six-month period there has been been a series of delays with scans and follow-up appointments, and Maria has still not been told the results or what the problem might be. ""You just can't get through to people - it's answer phones - you're just banging your head against a brick wall most of the time. ""I just want to see some light at the end of the tunnel, really, to get her some treatment and hopefully get a bit more quality of life,"" Carol said. Dr Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists said: ""I can't overestimate how worrying it is. ""I do really feel the entire service will collapse if something isn't done about training more radiologists in the UK to fill all the vacant consultant posts, so we have to get imaging properly staffed - and right - and enough radiologists trained to make up this deficit."" The Royal College of Radiologists says NHS hospitals have increasingly had to outsource analysis of complex scans to private companies or pay for existing staff to do overtime. The total annual bill for this across the UK has doubled over the five-year period to Â£116 million. The vacancy rate for consultant posts in the UK has increased from 9% to over 10% in just two years, with Northern Ireland seeing the highest rate at more than 18%. Radiologists say their work is central to much of what the NHS does The Royal College says more trainee radiologists are needed - with extra funding required for training and a ""concerted effort"" to retain staff. The workload has increased significantly with more sophisticated technology available. Some doctors, known as interventional radiologists, carry out complex procedures using image guidance to facilitate precisely targeted therapy. This includes treating cancer tumours and dealing with blocked veins using small catheters. Treating a higher number of elderly patients with complex conditions has also added to the workload. Radiologists argue that their work is central to much of what the NHS does, so staff shortages are having a serious impact on patients by prolonging waits. The new figures highlighting workforce shortages come the week after news thata Scottish health board has no interventional radiologistsafter the departure of the last remaining specialist in that field. The NHS Highland health board said patients needing emergency care by these experts, which was usually provided at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, would be sent to Aberdeen or Dundee. The Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health, Jeane Freeman, said there had been ""an international shortage of radiologists affecting health services worldwide"". But she said 50 specialist training places for clinical radiologists would be created over the next five years. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it had nearly doubled the size of the radiology training programme in Wales. ""We have also created a new National Imaging Academy to provide state-of-the-art facilities for training more radiologists."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the number of clinical radiologists in England had gone up by 29% since 2010. ""We want to see numbers continue to rise and over the next three years we are also putting in place more training for doctors to specialise in clinical radiology.""

Shoppers ill after fumes alert,"Hundreds of people have been evacuated from Silverburn Silverburn shopping centre near Glasgow had to be evacuated after a number of people were reported feeling unwell. Police Scotland said the alarm was raised at the complex at about 12:40 on Wednesday. It is understood the problem, at the Tesco end of the centre, may have been caused by paint fumes which were circulated through an air vent. Up to 50 people, including children and pensioners, were treated at the scene for breathing difficulties. Six shoppers were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow as a precaution. The alarm was raised at about 12:40 on Wednesday The problem was reported at the Tesco end of the centre Insp Derek Kelly told BBC Scotland: ""It is too early to speculate on the exact cause of it but there has been maintenance. ""There has been painting going on in the shopping centre and it could be the case that some of the fumes have made their way into the ventilation system, which may have caused people to suffer very minor respiratory trouble."" The officer said the problem was reported in the food court area but confirmed the painting was being carried out in another part of the centre. One woman who was in the complex at the time tweeted: ""In silverburn over an hour ago myself and lots of others went into fits of spontaneous coughing, reported this to a silverburn staff member. Do you have any explanation @shopsilverburn?"" Paramedics are treating shoppers at the scene The centre did not reply to the post but later used its own Twitter account to provide an update on the situation. It said: ""We've temporarily evacuated Silverburn as a precautionary measure and the emergency services are in attendance. The safety of our customers and staff is always our number one priority. We will keep you updated on the situation."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Outrage as tourists strip off in fountain,"Two English-speaking tourists who are being hunted by police for stripping off in a monumental Italian fountain have been called ""idiots"" by the country's deputy prime minister. The men were filmed frolicking in the fountain in Piazza Venezia in Rome, with one pulling down his underwear and posing for photographs. The footage has sparked outrage and their behaviour called ""ignorant"". Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini said: ""Italy is not their home bathroom"". The video,published on a blog in Rome,,externalshows the pair in their underpants grinning and bathing in the fountain at the Altare della Patria, a monument in honour of the first king of Italy after the country's unification. The monument also holds the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, in memory of all fallen soldiers. The Altare della Patria is sometimes nicknamed ""the wedding cake"" The two men laugh and joke with each other in the water, before one pulls down his underwear and smiles for the camera. Some passers-by laugh and take photographs, although others can be seen shaking their head and appearing to tell the two men to get out of the fountain. Thelocal police said the incident,,externalwhich happened on Sunday, was ""illegal and offensive"" and it was trying to find the two men. It said the two people are foreign and ""native English speakers"". Matteo Salvini, the country's deputy prime minister, tweeted: ""I will know how to educate these idiots if they are caught. ""Italy is not their home bathroom."" Meanwhile, Rome's deputy mayor Luca Bergamo said he condemns their behaviour, which he said ""offends each of us, the memory of our country and the fallen, to whom the monument is dedicated"". ""We are faced with a behaviour that denotes stupidity and ignorance, lack of respect for the history of Rome and Italy.

"DNA shows cave girl was half NeanderthalGenetic detective work gives a rare insight into the liaisons of early humans living 50,000 years ago.Science & Environment","Denisova cave in Siberia: Scene of an ancient liaison Once upon a time, two early humans of different ancestry met at a cave in Russia. Some 50,000 years later, scientists have confirmed that they had a daughter together. DNA extracted from bone fragments found in the cave show the girl was the offspring of a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. The discovery, reported in Nature, gives a rare insight into the lives of our closest ancient human relatives. Neanderthals and Denisovans were humans like us, but belonged to different species. ""We knew from previous studies that Neanderthals and Denisovans must have occasionally had children together,"" says Viviane Slon, researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA) in Leipzig, Germany. ""But I never thought we would be so lucky as to find an actual offspring of the two groups."" Present-day, non-African humans have a small proportion of their DNA that comes from Neanderthals. Some other non-African populations, depending on where they live, also have a fraction of their DNA that comes from an Asian people known as Denisovans. Excavations at the cave The fact the genes have been passed down the generations shows that interbreeding must have happened. However, the only known site where fossil evidence of both Denisovans and Neanderthals has been found is at Denisova cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. Furthermore, fewer than 20 so-called archaic humans (those belonging to species other than our own,Homo sapiens) have had their genomes sequenced. ""Out of this very little number we find one individual that has half-and-half mixed ancestry, "" Dr Slon told BBC News. When other studies are taken into account, ""you start to get a picture that over all of our evolutionary history humans always mixed with each other"". Neanderthals and Denisovans are known to have overlapped in time in Eurasia. The two groups lived until about 40,000 years ago; Neanderthals in the west and Denisovans in the east. As Neanderthals migrated eastwards, they may have encountered Denisovans at times, as well as early modern humans. ""Neanderthals and Denisovans may not have had many opportunities to meet,"" says Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo, director of MPI-EVA. ""But when they did, they must have mated frequently - much more so than we previously thought."" The girl's story has been pieced together from a single fragment of bone found in the Denisova cave by Russian archaeologists several years ago. The cave is the only place where fossils of Neanderthals and Denisovans have been found It was brought to Leipzig for genetic analysis. ""The fragment is part of a long bone, and we can estimate that this individual was at least 13 years old,"" says Bence Viola of the University of Toronto. The researchers deduced that the girl's mother was genetically closer to Neanderthals who lived in western Europe than to a Neanderthal individual who lived earlier in Denisova Cave. This shows that Neanderthals migrated between western and eastern Europe and Asia tens of thousands of years before they died out. Genetic tests also revealed that the Denisovan father had at least one Neanderthal ancestor further back in his family tree. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Austrian caught speeding 42 times in a rowThe baker was unaware he was speeding - until he received dozens of tickets from the same camera.,"File photo: The Austrian man said he never knew he was speeding - until the tickets arrived A baker has been fined â¬3,000 (Â£2,700) for speeding on the same Austrian road 42 times in a row. Heimo Wallner was caught by the same device every day he returned from work at three in the morning. He told Austrian media he could not see signs for the 30km/h (18.5mph) limit on that stretch of road in the dark - and drove at the standard 50km/h (31mph). It took more than a month for the first penalty to arrive - by which time he had clocked up dozens more. Mr Wallner started his job in Klagenfurt, about 30 minutes' drive from his home in the southern region of Carinthia, in February. He received his first speeding notice in May. ""Then I thought there would be more to come - and it would get expensive,"" he said. Mr Wallner said he did not notice the speed camera - set up near a school on the route - because the area was always very dark in the middle of the night. His car was captured by an infra-red camera, which does not fire a visual flash. Man settles Â£36k Dubai speeding fines Finn given 54,000-euro speeding fine Out of about 50 trips, he was recorded driving at a consistent 50km/h 42 times in a row. He paid all 42 penalties to avoid the lengthy and expensive procedure to challenge them, he said. He told Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung: ""You cannot lodge an appeal against all the fines in one go, so I would have had to make 42 separate challenges."" ""These are a good two months' wages for me, and there's no rebate for a bulk fine either."" Police did remove about â¬300 from his total, he said, but he has still had to cancel his plans for a Greek holiday. Mr Wallner added that his wife did not blame him for the expense.

Saudi woman activist 'faces death penalty',"Israa al-Ghomgham's supporters have released a photograph showing her as a young girl Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has reportedly sought the death penalty for five activists, including the female rights defender Israa al-Ghomgham. Human Rights Watch said they recently went on trial at a terrorism tribunal,externalon charges including ""participating in protests"" in the restive Qatif region. It has been the scene of demonstrations by the minority Shia Muslim community. Ms Ghomgham is believed to be the first Saudi woman to possibly face the death penalty for rights-related work. HRW warned that it set ""a dangerous precedent for other women activists currently behind bars"" in the Gulf kingdom. At least 13 human rights defenders and women's rights activists have been arrested since mid-May,external, accused of activities deemed a risk to national security. Some have been released, but others remain detained without charge. Human Rights Watch said the prosecutor's demand ""set a dangerous precedent"" HRW said Ms Ghomgham was an activist well known for participating in and documenting the mass protests that have taken place in Qatif since 2011. Members of the Shia community have taken to the streets to complain about the discrimination they say they face from the Sunni-led government. Ms Ghomgham and her husband were reportedly arrested in December 2015, and they have been held at Dammam's al-Mabahith prison ever since. Saudi Arabia freezes Canada trade ties for urging activists' release Have executions doubled in Saudi Arabia? The public prosecutor accused Ms Ghomgham and the other four activists of charges including ""participating in protests in the Qatif region"", ""incitement to protest,"" ""chanting slogans hostile to the regime"", ""attempting to inflame public opinion"", ""filming protests and publishing on social media"", and ""providing moral support to rioters"", according to HRW. The prosecutor reportedly called for them to be given the death penalty,externalat the start of their trial based on the Islamic legal principle of ""tazir"", under which the judge has discretion over what constitutes a crime and over the sentence.

""Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behaviour, is monstrous,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW's Middle East director, said in a statement. ""Every day, the Saudi monarchy's unrestrained despotism makes it harder for its public relations teams to spin the fairy tale of 'reform' to allies and international business."" The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights and ALQST, a London-based Saudi human rights group, have called on the authorities to drop the charges against Ms Ghomgham. The Saudi government has so far not commented on Ms Ghomgham's trial. However, courts have sentenced to death several Shia activists after convicting them of what human rights groups have called politically-motivated charges. Officials have said those executed were guilty of terrorism-related offences, including taking up arms against the government and attacking security forces.

Boy fined ÃÂ£500 for kicking dog to death,"Teddy was killed by a teenager who ""completely lost his temper"" A 15-year-old boy has been fined Â£500 for punching and kicking a ""much-loved"" pet dog to death. The boy, who cannot be named, was 14 when the ""prolonged attack"" happened in St Ives, Cornwall on 31 October. He wasfound guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal last monthafter a two-day trial. The teenager has been banned from keeping animals for five years and ordered to pay Â£500 compensation. More news from Devon and Cornwall In sentencing, Justice Diana Baker said the dog, Teddy, suffered a fractured skull and multiple blunt force trauma injuries to his head, neck and torso resulting in internal bleeding. Addressing the boy, she said domestic violence has ""severely affected"" his emotional wellbeing. ""You are a young man who has lived with domestic violence for a long time,"" she added. ""Domestic violence under the influence of alcohol that has severely affected your emotional wellbeing and ability to deal with stressful situations."" This video can not be played Jacqueline Stevens said Teddy was a gentle dog that did not growl at anyone A victim impact statement from Teddy's owner Jacqueline Stevens, 71, was read to the court. She explained how she had hand-reared the Staffordshire bull terrier and kept him for nine years. ""My life has been ripped apart and has been changed forever,"" she said. She added that she now ""dreads going to St Ives"" due to the ""sad associations and memories"". The incident happened when the dog held down a pet terrier belonging to the family of the convicted boy who had a ""total loss of control"", the court heard. Are we tough enough on animal cruelty? The boy was sentenced to an 18-month rehabilitation order with 18 months of supervision. He was also given an eight-week curfew. The Â£500 fine will be paid by his mother at a rate of Â£50 a week. The boy will not be allowed to apply for the ban on him keeping animals to be lifted for the next three years. However, the court heard the family would be able to keep their pet terrier. RSPCA inspector Jon Phipps paid tribute to the witnesses that gave evidence. He said: ""It was clear how traumatised they were, and indeed, still are about what they saw that day but without their help, this case could never have come to court and there would be no justice for Teddy.""

Shoppers ill after fumes alertA number of people are being treated for breathing difficulties after a shopping centre was evacuated.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Hundreds of people have been evacuated from Silverburn Silverburn shopping centre near Glasgow had to be evacuated after a number of people were reported feeling unwell. Police Scotland said the alarm was raised at the complex at about 12:40 on Wednesday. It is understood the problem, at the Tesco end of the centre, may have been caused by paint fumes which were circulated through an air vent. Up to 50 people, including children and pensioners, were treated at the scene for breathing difficulties. Six shoppers were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow as a precaution. The alarm was raised at about 12:40 on Wednesday The problem was reported at the Tesco end of the centre Insp Derek Kelly told BBC Scotland: ""It is too early to speculate on the exact cause of it but there has been maintenance. ""There has been painting going on in the shopping centre and it could be the case that some of the fumes have made their way into the ventilation system, which may have caused people to suffer very minor respiratory trouble."" The officer said the problem was reported in the food court area but confirmed the painting was being carried out in another part of the centre. One woman who was in the complex at the time tweeted: ""In silverburn over an hour ago myself and lots of others went into fits of spontaneous coughing, reported this to a silverburn staff member.

Forbes highest-paid actor revealedThe Forbes list of best-paid actors puts George Clooney at the top and The Rock in second place.Entertainment & Arts,"Dwayne Johnson has nearly doubled his 2017 earnings Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has nearly doubled his 2017 earnings, making $119m (Â£92m) in the past 12 months, according to Forbes highest paid actor list. The top spot was awarded to George Clooney, whose $239m (Â£180m) was already disclosed inlast month's celebrity rich list. Scarlett Johannson was revealed as the highest paid actress last week, earning $40.5m (Â£31.9m). That would have placed the Black Widow star as seventh in the male rankings. This is a departure from last year's Forbes list, which saw highest paid actress Emma Stone fail to score in the top 10 male earnings. Scarlett Johansson's earnings have risen from $10m to $40.5m in the past year, Forbes said Actors Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Jackie Chan and Will Smith were all in the top tier - earning more than Johannson, with seventh place Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar matching the actress's income. Completing the top 10 were Adam Sandler, US actor Chris Evans and Salman Khan. While last year's best paid actors list mainly features the same names as last year, 2017's top earner Mark Wahlberg, who made $68m (Â£52.5m), was missing entirely. George Clooney returns to this year's list, thanks to the sale of his Casamigos tequila company to drinks giant Diageo in a deal worth $1bn (Â£753m). Will Smith was sixth in this year's list of highest paid actors Dwayne Johnson's $119m (Â£92m) earnings are down to a number of box office successes, including Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Skyscraper, Baywatch and Fast & Furious 8. Another actor returning to this year's list is Will Smith, whose $42m (Â£32.5m) income puts him in sixth place.

I sang opera during my brain surgery,"Sarah-May Philo after her brain surgery A stand-up comedian had her doctors in stitches as they performed life-saving brain surgery. Sarah-May Philo told jokes and even sang the opera classic Ave Maria as surgeons removed a tumour during a nine-hour operation. The 34-year-old comic and special needs teacher from Dennistoun in Glasgow knew she would have to be awake to measure brain function but her dialogue with medical staff went beyond all expectations. When Sarah-May Philo suffered a seizure in 2016, doctors uncovered a tumour in her brain she had been living with symptom-free for more than 15 years. The tumour - called an oligodendroglioma - had to be removed and she would need to be awake for most of the operation. Sarah-May and fiance Paul Griffin She toldBBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Michelle McManus: ""They found a tumour which was apparently taking up half of my brain. They said it had taken a long time to grow and my brain had just adapted and survived. ""Functions on my brain were on the wrong side because of it - they called me an unusual case. ""They gave no other option than to operate. They had to get it out, or at least try to get most of it out."" Theatre staff were entertained by patient Sarah-May but the ""show"" served an important monitoring purpose She explained; ""They took the size of a tennis ball out of my head and left 15% of it behind because it would have affected my speech and movement to remove it. ""Because I stayed awake the whole time, they could tell when my speech was affected or when I couldn't clench my first. So I effectively had to continually talk for eight hours."" The surgery took place in March this year at the Queen Elizabeth University hospital in Glasgow. But things took an unusual turn when Sarah-May was brought to consciousness on the operating table. As a comedian she was used to talking, but then the powerful pain killers kicked in. The operation took place at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in March this year She said: ""It was formally only the speech and language therapist who was to talk to me. ""But by hour three or four, the whole surgical staff and the anaesthetist were chatting away and making jokes. ""At one point the surgeon behind me said 'Oops!' and I was like 'what do you mean, Oops, you're in my brain!'"" When she revealed she was an operatically-trained singer, Sarah-May was asked to give the theatre a song, and ended up performing a version of Ave Maria to an appreciative captive audience. She made up songs about the staff around her and teased the surgeon as he worked. Sarah-May said she found the whole process fascinating. Sarah-May after her surgical procedure Sarah-May has blogged about her treatment and shared scans of the tumour She added: ""I have always loved medical programmes. The fact it was me didn't hit until much later and I was just very, very curious. I got them to take pictures and now I have an album of pictures of the inside of my brain!"" Sarah-May said the surgery was the best part of her treatment. After struggling with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, she is feeling better and has returned to her job as a special needs teacher. Her comedy is still on the agenda and she thinks there's a show-worth of material in her operating table experience. She said: ""The future is bright now. I didn't make the Edinburgh Festival this year but I'll be back next year for sure.""

"Graduate's diabetic firm 'worth millions'Dr Harry Destecroix, 31, co-founded Ziylo while finishing his PhD in Bristol four years ago.Bristol","Dr Harry Destecroix co-founded the company Ziylo while studying at Bristol University A graduate who co-founded a company while studying at university could become a multi-millionaire after it was sold in a deal potentially worth Â£623m.

Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's purchase means it now has full rights to develop glucose responsive insulins. Dr Destecroix, described the molecule could be the ""holy grail"" of insulin and said he hoped the sale will offer ground-breaking treatment for diabetics. He said: ""It wasn't a surprise when the discovery was made two years ago. When we saw the properties it had, we were astounded."" Ziylo, a university spin-out company, developed a synthetic molecule which works by binding glucose in the bloodstream more effectively. The molecule is a product of 20 years' work at the Anthony Davis lab at the university, which specialises in molecular chemistry. Danish firm Novo Nordisk, one of the biggest manufacturers of diabetes medicines, will now aim to use this molecule to develop a new type of insulin which aims to help diabetics manage their condition more safely. The next steps will involve further research and work to create the new drug followed by clinical trials. It is likely to take about 10 years to come to market and the Â£623m figure is based on this potential success. The glucose binding molecules discovered by the Ziylo team have the potential to lead to the development of insulins, which can potentially remove the risk of hypoglycaemia, when blood sugar levels fall below normal.

Austrian caught speeding 42 times in a rowThe baker was unaware he was speeding - until he received dozens of tickets from the same camera.Europe,"File photo: The Austrian man said he never knew he was speeding - until the tickets arrived A baker has been fined â¬3,000 (Â£2,700) for speeding on the same Austrian road 42 times in a row. Heimo Wallner was caught by the same device every day he returned from work at three in the morning. He told Austrian media he could not see signs for the 30km/h (18.5mph) limit on that stretch of road in the dark - and drove at the standard 50km/h (31mph). It took more than a month for the first penalty to arrive - by which time he had clocked up dozens more. Mr Wallner started his job in Klagenfurt, about 30 minutes' drive from his home in the southern region of Carinthia, in February. He received his first speeding notice in May. ""Then I thought there would be more to come - and it would get expensive,"" he said. Mr Wallner said he did not notice the speed camera - set up near a school on the route - because the area was always very dark in the middle of the night. His car was captured by an infra-red camera, which does not fire a visual flash. Man settles Â£36k Dubai speeding fines Finn given 54,000-euro speeding fine Out of about 50 trips, he was recorded driving at a consistent 50km/h 42 times in a row. He paid all 42 penalties to avoid the lengthy and expensive procedure to challenge them, he said. He told Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung: ""You cannot lodge an appeal against all the fines in one go, so I would have had to make 42 separate challenges."" ""These are a good two months' wages for me, and there's no rebate for a bulk fine either."" Police did remove about â¬300 from his total, he said, but he has still had to cancel his plans for a Greek holiday. Mr Wallner added that his wife did not blame him for the expense.

Boy fined Â£500 for kicking dog to death,"Teddy was killed by a teenager who ""completely lost his temper"" A 15-year-old boy has been fined Â£500 for punching and kicking a ""much-loved"" pet dog to death. The boy, who cannot be named, was 14 when the ""prolonged attack"" happened in St Ives, Cornwall on 31 October. He wasfound guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal last monthafter a two-day trial. The teenager has been banned from keeping animals for five years and ordered to pay Â£500 compensation. More news from Devon and Cornwall In sentencing, Justice Diana Baker said the dog, Teddy, suffered a fractured skull and multiple blunt force trauma injuries to his head, neck and torso resulting in internal bleeding. Addressing the boy, she said domestic violence has ""severely affected"" his emotional wellbeing. ""You are a young man who has lived with domestic violence for a long time,"" she added. ""Domestic violence under the influence of alcohol that has severely affected your emotional wellbeing and ability to deal with stressful situations."" This video can not be played Jacqueline Stevens said Teddy was a gentle dog that did not growl at anyone A victim impact statement from Teddy's owner Jacqueline Stevens, 71, was read to the court. She explained how she had hand-reared the Staffordshire bull terrier and kept him for nine years. ""My life has been ripped apart and has been changed forever,"" she said. She added that she now ""dreads going to St Ives"" due to the ""sad associations and memories"". The incident happened when the dog held down a pet terrier belonging to the family of the convicted boy who had a ""total loss of control"", the court heard. Are we tough enough on animal cruelty? The boy was sentenced to an 18-month rehabilitation order with 18 months of supervision. He was also given an eight-week curfew. The Â£500 fine will be paid by his mother at a rate of Â£50 a week. The boy will not be allowed to apply for the ban on him keeping animals to be lifted for the next three years. However, the court heard the family would be able to keep their pet terrier. RSPCA inspector Jon Phipps paid tribute to the witnesses that gave evidence. He said: ""It was clear how traumatised they were, and indeed, still are about what they saw that day but without their help, this case could never have come to court and there would be no justice for Teddy.""

Briton feared dead after banana boat accident,"Richard Chapelow pictured in 2010 A British man is feared dead after he was reportedly thrown from a banana boat at the Santa Clara Dam in Portugal on Monday. Richard Chapelow had been a guest of Jon Hunt, the billionaire founder of the Foxtons estate agency. Mr Hunt said: ""My family and I are devastated by the loss of Richard...it is a time of great sorrow."" The Foreign Office confirmed it was assisting the family of a British man reported missing in Portugal. Mr Chapelow - believed to be 29 and a marketing account manager from London - visited the area, an hour north of the Algarve region, with a group of 10 other Britons, according to local reports. He is understood to be a friend of Mr Hunt's son, Harry Hunt. A banana boat is an inflatable tube, usually towed by a speedboat (stock picture) The Santa Clara Dam, one of the largest man-made lakes in Portugal, is used for both watersports and fishing. Local volunteer fire chief Mario Batista told Portuguese media four people were on a banana boat with another six on a boat towing the inflatable. One rider disappeared after all four were thrown from the float, he added. Mr Batista said the lake's depth and poor visibility have made the search difficult. Divers and firefighters are reportedly resuming the search on Wednesday. The Hunt family said they were ""devastated by the loss of Richard, following a tragic accident at Santa Clara Dam."" ""Our thoughts and prayers are wholly with Richard's family, and we ask that both families are given space to grieve such a painful loss. ""We will be working closely with the Portuguese authorities to understand what has happened, and are grateful to the local police and fire services for their efforts.""

RSPCA gets warning over 'six-figure' pay-out,"The RSPCA has been given an official warning by the charity watchdog for reportedly awarding a former chief executive a six-figure pay-off. The Charity Commission began an inquiry afterthe Times reported,externalthat acting head Michael Ward was paid a sum more than his Â£150,000 salary when he left. It said Mr Ward, 57, received the pay-off in May after he said he did not get the permanent post because of his age. The RSPCA said it was committed to the ""highest standards of governance"". The animal welfare organisation declined to comment on the settlement. The Charity Commission criticised RSPCA trustees for not ensuring the decision was made properly, ""particularly given the large sum of money involved"". Trustees had ""failed to act with reasonable care and skill"" when negotiating the sum, the watchdog said. An official warning, which did not name Mr Ward or include details of his pay-off, said the failings amounted to ""mismanagement in the administration of the charity"". The Charity Commission's deputy chief executive, David Holdsworth, said the RSPCA was a ""much-loved national institution performing a crucial role in animal protection"" and said the public ""rightly expect that it should be run by its trustees to the highest standards"". ""Unfortunately, that has not been the case and the charity's governance has fallen short, which has led to people asking legitimate questions about the pay-out to the former executive,"" he said. ""Issuing an official warning signals to the trustees that we expect them to resolve this important issue and take immediate steps to improve the charity's governance."" RSPCA boss leaves after a year in role Probe into NI group funded by Quaker trust Mr Holdsworth said the use of formal legal powers was a ""significant step"" and said the commission would take further regulatory action if the trustees did not act on the official warning. He said the RSPCA's appointment of a new chief executive, the election of a new council and the introduction of a new code of conduct provided an opportunity for a ""fresh start"" for the charity. In a statement, the charity said: ""The RSPCA ruling council is fully committed to the very highest standards of governance. ""Council continues to implement the recommendations of the governance review, with more than 90% of them completed, and is working hard with our new chief executive on the outstanding items."" It said the charity's council was ""united in its commitment to ensuring the RSPCA is a modern, outward looking organisation"". Mr Ward was appointed as interim chief executive in June 2017, following the departure of Jeremy Cooper -who left after just over a year into the role. Chris Sherwood succeeded Mr Ward as chief executive in August 2018. He was previously chief executive of relationship charity Relate. The RSPCA went two years without a permanent chief executive after Gavin Grant left for health reasons in 2014.

Agents 'turn away housing benefit tenants',"This video can not be played Stephen Tyler says he was forced to sleep in his car Letting agents are discriminating against tenants on housing benefit, an undercover investigation has found. Shelter and the National Housing Federation found one in 10 agents in England refused to let to those on the benefit. The undercover investigation found the policy was enforced even if tenants could afford the rent. Stephen Tyler told the BBC that housing benefit discrimination had forced him to sleep in his car. The wheelchair user told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""We have been trying to find accommodation since we were evicted from our last property when we asked for adaptations to be made for wheelchair access. ""I phone anything up to 20 landlords, estate agents, a day and none of them will accept DSS (tenants on Department of Social Security housing benefits)."" The Birmingham resident said he had approached his council as well as housing associations, but ""no one wants to help at all"". A spokesman for Mr Tyler's local council, Birmingham City, said it had offered him ""suitable alternative accommodation"". It added: ""While this is far from an ideal situation, and is no doubt distressing for Mr Tyler and his family, unfortunately we are faced with a national housing crisis that is affecting an unprecedented number of families across the region."" Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""This ugly undercurrent of discrimination is wreaking havoc on hundreds of thousands of people's lives. 'No DSS' is an outdated and outrageous example of blatant prejudice."" The investigation into 149 regional letting agent branches found five of England's leading letting agents were discriminating against tenants on housing benefit, with Haart was the worst offender.. Haart - named by the investigation as the worst offender Mystery shoppers, deployed by the charities, had encountered a ban on housing benefit tenants in eight out of 25 Haart branches. A spokesman for Haart said: ""It is not our policy to refuse housing benefit tenants - anyone who passes referencing checks is able to rent properties listed with our branches. We do regularly arrange tenancies for those claiming housing benefits and currently have 112 tenancies where this is the case. ""This research has brought to light that some of our branches are misinformed and we are working to ensure that this policy is being followed across our network. We are sorry for any occasion where this has not been the case."" Others named as having individual branch policies not to accept people on housing benefit were Bridgfords (two out of 25 branches visited), Dexters (two out of 25), Fox & Sons (two out of 24) and Your Move (one out of 25). Almost half of all branches called during the investigation said they had no suitable homes or landlords willing to let to someone on housing benefit, the report said. The report claims that a shortfall in social housing means that an estimated 1.64 million adults rely on housing benefit to help cover private rents. It said the majority were women, and especially single mothers with childcare responsibilities, while people who receive disability benefits were three times more likely to need a housing benefit top-up. David Cox, chief executive of letting agents' body Arla Propertymark, said: ""Rents are paid in advance, whereas housing benefit is paid in arrears, and therefore with such a shortage of rental accommodation, landlords and agents will naturally choose a tenant who can pay the rent when it is due, rather than a tenant who is always a month in arrears. ""We have called on government time and time again to resolve this problem. But our calls have fallen on deaf ears. A Ministry of Housing spokesman said those on housing benefit who felt discriminated against could complain to redress schemes, which all letting and managing agent must be part of by law. He added: ""We are determined to tackle stigma in social housing and the private rented sector. Just last week we published our Social Housing Green Paper setting out our plans to rebalance the relationship between tenants and landlords.""

Shoppers ill after Silverburn fumes alert,"Hundreds of people have been evacuated from Silverburn Silverburn shopping centre near Glasgow had to be evacuated after a number of people were reported feeling unwell. Police Scotland said the alarm was raised at the complex at about 12:40 on Wednesday. It is understood the problem, at the Tesco end of the centre, may have been caused by paint fumes which were circulated through an air vent. Up to 50 people, including children and pensioners, were treated at the scene for breathing difficulties. Six shoppers were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow as a precaution. The alarm was raised at about 12:40 on Wednesday The problem was reported at the Tesco end of the centre Insp Derek Kelly told BBC Scotland: ""It is too early to speculate on the exact cause of it but there has been maintenance. ""There has been painting going on in the shopping centre and it could be the case that some of the fumes have made their way into the ventilation system, which may have caused people to suffer very minor respiratory trouble."" The officer said the problem was reported in the food court area but confirmed the painting was being carried out in another part of the centre. One woman who was in the complex at the time tweeted: ""In silverburn over an hour ago myself and lots of others went into fits of spontaneous coughing, reported this to a silverburn staff member. Do you have any explanation @shopsilverburn?"" Paramedics are treating shoppers at the scene The centre did not reply to the post but later used its own Twitter account to provide an update on the situation. It said: ""We've temporarily evacuated Silverburn as a precautionary measure and the emergency services are in attendance. The safety of our customers and staff is always our number one priority. We will keep you updated on the situation."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Student's diabetes firm makes millions,"Dr Harry Destecroix co-founded the company Ziylo while studying at Bristol University A graduate who co-founded a company while studying at university could become a multi-millionaire after it was sold in a deal potentially worth Â£623m. Dr Harry Destecroix, 31, co-founded Ziylo while studying for his PhD at the University of Bristol four years ago. It created a new technology which can be developed to treat diabetes more effectively. Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's purchase means it now has full rights to develop glucose responsive insulins. Dr Destecroix, described the molecule could be the ""holy grail"" of insulin and said he hoped the sale will offer ground-breaking treatment for diabetics. He said: ""It wasn't a surprise when the discovery was made two years ago. When we saw the properties it had, we were astounded."" Ziylo, a university spin-out company, developed a synthetic molecule which works by binding glucose in the bloodstream more effectively. The molecule is a product of 20 years' work at the Anthony Davis lab at the university, which specialises in molecular chemistry. Danish firm Novo Nordisk, one of the biggest manufacturers of diabetes medicines, will now aim to use this molecule to develop a new type of insulin which aims to help diabetics manage their condition more safely. The next steps will involve further research and work to create the new drug followed by clinical trials. It is likely to take about 10 years to come to market and the Â£623m figure is based on this potential success. The glucose binding molecules discovered by the Ziylo team have the potential to lead to the development of insulins, which can potentially remove the risk of hypoglycaemia, when blood sugar levels fall below normal. In some cases this can be fatal, or cause other serious conditions like seizures or a coma. ""Novo Nordisk, as the leader in the diabetes field, is the ideal company to maximise the potential of the Ziylo glucose binding molecules in glucose responsive insulins and diabetes applications, and it brings hope of a truly ground-breaking treatment to diabetes patients,"" added Dr Destecroix. Rock star claims 'breakfast beast' fame 'Party house' hosts largest bat colony Nazi items sold on National Trust land Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Ziylo was founded by Dr Harry Destecroix, Dr Anthony Davis and Tom Smart and has a total of 30 stakeholders. Other directors of Ziylo include the primary investor, Keith Macdonald and the Dr Andrew Chapman, who also led the development of this science.

Ryanair compensation cheques 'bounced',"Ryanair sent unsigned compensation cheques to customers meaning they could not be banked Ryanair passengers who have received compensation for cancelled and delayed flights have been charged extra fees after banks rejected the cheques. The airline said up to 190 customers were sent unsigned cheques, out of a batch of 20,000. One passenger, who waited 11 months for compensation, said she was now worse off after the bank added a fee of 20 euros (Â£17.94). Ryanair has apologised and blamed the problem on an ""administrative error"". Since April, more than one million Ryanair passengers in Europe have had delayed or cancelled flights, according to the airline's own figures. The latest one-day pilots' walk-out on 10 August led to the cancellation of nearly 400 flights. Ryanair, which is Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has blamed other delays on bad weather or air traffic control shortages. Ryanair has experienced a summer of disruption in Europe The Civil Aviation Authority recently stepped into advise passengers caught up in strikes that they should apply for compensation. Known as EU261, compensation is set at 250 euros (Â£224) for flights of up to 1,500km (932 miles), and 400 euros (Â£358) for longer flights in Europe and North Africa. Businessman Gordon Fong received Â£440 after his flight home from Spain in June was first diverted and then landed at a different UK airport, leaving him with a 150-mile taxi journey to his home in Bournemouth. ""But when I received the cheque there was no signature,"" he said. ""I took time off work to drive to the bank but was told by the teller I couldn't use it. I had to go back to the website to try and get them to respond and send a new cheque, but I still haven't had a reply."" The BBC has spoken to 10 other people who said their compensation from Ryanair had been refused by the bank. Karen and John Joyce waited 11 months for compensation from Ryanair Karen Joyce, 50, said she spent 11 months waiting for compensation from Ryanair after her 25th wedding anniversary holiday flight was cancelled in September. Ryanair paid part of her claim but when she went to cash a second cheque it was returned by the bank - along with a 20 euro (Â£17.94) fee ""I was totally dumbstruck. We were loyal Ryanair customers and for them to bounce the cheque as well I just thought was disgusting,"" she said. When Mrs Joyce, from Manchester, contacted Ryanair, she spent 20 minutes on the phone to a customer service representative. ""Then he just put the phone down,"" she said. ""I have not received anything from Ryanair."" In a statement, Ryanair said ""a very small number of cheques"" processed in July were issued without a required signatory ""due to an administrative error"". It said the cheques had been ""re-issued to customers along with a letter of explanation"" on 15 August. ""We apologise again for any inconvenience caused to customers,"" the airline added. Ryanair cancels flights as pilots walk out No compensation for cancelled flights Ryanair passengers may claim compensation Ryanair also said customers whose flights were cancelled ""were either refunded or re-accommodated on to alternative flights and we process all valid EU261 compensation claims within 10 working days"". ""Ryanair complies fully with EU261 legislation, under which no compensation is payable to customers when the (strike) delay/cancellation is beyond the airline's control. ""If these strikes, by a tiny minority of Ryanair pilots, were within Ryanair's control, there would have been no strikes and no cancellations."" A series of summer strikes by Ryanair pilots have caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled Ryanair is in dispute with pilots in five countries. Its financial report shows that in the last year it has paid out 25m euros (Â£22.4m) in EU261 compensation claims arising from the disruption of its timetable last autumn. The report says EU261 costs increased as ""passengers have a higher propensity to claim than in prior years"". Last year, Ryanair made profits of Â£1.3bn after tax. It carried 130 million passengers in 2017. Ryanair cancels flights as pilots walk out Passengers stuck in airport delay 'chaos' No compensation for cancelled flights Ryanair threatened by fresh strikes Ryanair fleet cuts put 300 jobs at risk Ryanair passengers may claim compensation Ryanair cancels 600 flights over strike Ryanair Civil Aviation Authority London Stansted Airport New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Scrapping 1p coins 'will not raise prices',"One of the most vociferous arguments made against scrapping 1p and 2p coins in the UK is that shops would automatically round up prices. But analysis by Bank of England economists says the fear of everything becoming more expensive would be unfounded if coppers were ditched. It says card payments make the issue irrelevant, and far fewer items are now priced ending in 99p. The government recently ruled out scrapping coppers amid a backlash. In the chancellor's Spring Statement, a Treasury consultation about the mix of coins in circulation appeared topave the way for the end of 1p and 2p coins. Aswift reverse by the Prime Minister's official spokesmandeclared there were no plans to scrap the copper coins: ""One of the elements was whether the denominational mix of coins meets the public need. From the early reaction it looks as if it does."" Pretty penny: considerable sum of money Penny dropped: something was finally understood Penny-dreadful: a cheap, often lurid, book or magazine Penny-pinching: miserly Penny-wise: Careful and thrifty in small matters Source: Collins English Dictionary That Treasury consultation explained that surveys suggested six in 10 of UK 1p and 2p coins were only used once before being put in a jar or discarded, while one in 12 was thrown into a bin. The value of the 1p coin has also been reduced by inflation so, in effect, the 1p coin is now worth less than the halfpenny when it was abolished in 1984. Among many of those who support the continuing use of copper coins, the belief is that retailers would simply round up prices to the nearest 5p if copper coins were scrapped. Writing on the Bank of England's blog,Bank Underground,external, Marilena Angeli and Jack Meaning argue that - even if this happened - it would have little or no effect on the cost of living, as measured by inflation. They said that many people bought more than one item at a time. By the time three items were bought, any effect of rounding on prices would be negated. Secondly, they argued that the growth of non-cash payments - particularly contactless cards - meant that shoppers could still be charged the exact amount when paying by card. Thirdly, the duo quoted figures showing that only 12% of prices ended with 99p, with a falling number of items now priced at, say, Â£1.99. Penny pitching: Your eight uses for 1p and 2p coins Debit card payments more popular than cash Who do you trust after cash? Many countries - including Canada, the home of Bank of England governor Mark Carney - have ditched their low denomination coins. Australia, Brazil, and Sweden are among many others to do so. Various studies from around the world showed that removing low denomination coins would have little or no impact on prices, Ms Angeli and Mr Meaning wrote. ""As inflation steadily erodes the purchasing power of low denomination coinage, the case for its removal becomes stronger,"" the Bank of England economists conclude. ""This is not a new phenomenon and has been seen time and again, the world over. Even in the UK there is a precedent with the abolition of the halfpenny in 1984. ""Many of the arguments that were made in the early 1980s around the inflationary impact of removing that particular tiny coin are being made now. However, the evidence, including our own work on UK price data suggests they are unfounded."" The conclusion does not form part of Bank of England policy, but is published on the Bank's blog aimed at ""sharing views that challenge - or support - prevailing policy orthodoxies"".

James Anderson looped Ravichandran Ashwin to slip in front of a handful of spectators after Nottinghamshirereversed their decisionto charge a Â£10 entry fee and allowed free admission. The home side were 317 all out, giving India victory by 203 runs - only their seventh success in a Test in England. The visitors also drag their deficit in the series back to 2-1 with two matches remaining. The fourth Test in Southampton begins on 30 August. It is a fine comeback from Virat Kohli's side, who were steamrollered to lose the second Test by an innings.

On this occasion, they surrendered all 10 wickets between lunch and tea on Sunday to be dismissed for 161 in their first innings. They were in danger of another collapse on Tuesday untilJos Buttler and Ben Stokes shared a fifth-wicket partnership of 169that exhibited all the virtues of patient, careful and responsible Test batting. Now, the question for Joe Root's side is can they follow the example of Buttler and Stokes to move on from the recklessness that has contributed to their recent Test results being so inconsistent? Questions over who joins Alastair Cook at the top of the order have now spread to Cook himself, while current partner Keaton Jennings is in desperate need of runs in his second attempt at Test cricket. Ollie Pope looked skittish at Trent Bridge, though allowances can be made for a 20-year-old in his second Test, and the Bairstow injury seems likely to leave a vacancy in the middle order. On top of the batting, England continue to be hampered by dropped catches - 14 have gone down in three Tests so far this series. The winning moment took India just 17 balls on Wednesday India were awful in the second Test at Lord's, bowled out for 107 and 130 and seemingly over-reliant on the runs of captain Kohli, who was struggling with a back problem.

All of the top order spent some time at the crease, debutant wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant provided dynamism, while Hardik Pandya had a fine all-round match and was part of an incisive four-man pace attack.

Airport flood cars a 'potential death trap',"Customers said their cars flooded while at Belfast International's Park and Fly car park Belfast International Airport has refused to reveal how many cars were damaged and subsequently written off after its car park flooded in July. BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show has heard from one passengerwho said staff told her up to 1,000 cars may have been damaged. She said the airport did not tell her about flooding, which happened after heavy rain on 28 July. Belfast International Airport have made no comment. The AA said flooding could cause safety systems to fail. ""You could be driving what could amount to a death trap,"" the AA's Ian Crowder told the Nolan Show. The airport was badly hit by heavy rainfall on 28 July. Northern Ireland was hit by heavy rainfall on 28 July The Met Office said the airport recorded an ""incredible"" 88.2mm of rainfall in a single afternoon, more than the average rainfall for the entire month. Two people who spoke to the Nolan Show said their cars had been parked in a field that is used as an overflow area for the airport's Park and Fly car park. At least two of the flooded cars have been written off. BBC News NI cannot verify exactly how many cars have been affected, but it is believed many more could have been affected and potentially damaged by flood water. Nick Mitford, another Belfast International Airport customer, told the Nolan Show: ""The salvage guy who came to take my car away from the insurance company, when I told him it had been flooded he sort of said 'oh, was it up at the airport?' ""Which took me back a little, and I said yes it was and he said. 'oh yeah, there's in excess of 100 cars involved in this.'"" He criticised the airport and said they should have been more open with him as a customer. ""They had my details. Now, I'm not asking them to assess my car or to work out whether or not my car has been flooded or not,"" Mr Mitford said. ""But I don't think it's beyond the duty of care they owe to me to just inform me that there had been an incident and that I might want to make arrangements not to potentially drive an unsafe car home with my family in it."" Mr Mitford told the Nolan Show his insurance company believed his car will now have to be written off. A caller into the Nolan Show, Emma, also said her car had been written off after being flooded. She said that an employee at the airport's Park and Ride told her husband that ""there were nearly 1,000 cars affected"". Ian Crowder from the AA told the Nolan Show that there are safety risks around cars that could have been flooded. Travel expert Simon Calder said the situation at the airport was extraordinary and terrifying ""This story raises so many questions and safety is one of the key ones. ""If a car has been flooded water can affect the electronics in the car, it affects the exhaust, it can affect all sorts of aspects of the vehicle. ""If [as one caller suggested] the level of the water in the car was up to the dashboard level then it could well have affected the electronics which manage the airbag. ""The airbag could potentially go off without notice - or not go off if it has to. He added: ""Where water has got into the car, insurance companies almost always will write the car off as a category A or B so that the car is taken off the market and can't be sold."" Travel expert Simon Calder described the situation as extraordinary and ""terrifying"". ""It is extraordinary that a big international airport should be taking this attitude instead of doing what's right for the customer. ""People would of course forgive it. It's going to be an expensive business but it's going to be even more expensive if they refuse to talk to you."" The airport management team is refusing to release any details about what happened, or what rights its passengers have. But customers are demanding answers. Caller Emma told the programme: ""My car has been written off and I've had confirmation from the insurance company how much they are going to pay out.

Trump accused of directing hush money,"This video can not be played Michael Cohen leaves court as some of the charges against him are listed US President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty in a New York court to violating campaign finance laws. He said he had done so at the direction of ""the candidate"", for the ""principal purpose of influencing [the] election"". The admission was related to hush money paid to Mr Trump's alleged lovers. Mr Trump has not commented. In May, he admitted reimbursing Cohen for paying one of the women, having earlier denied any knowledge of it. Cohen, 51, admitted eight counts on Tuesday, including tax and bank fraud, in a plea deal with prosecutors which may see his prison sentence reduced from 65 years to five years and three months. Will Trump remain bulletproof? On the same day,a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafortof bank and tax fraud charges. The developments in the Cohen and Manafort cases have revived speculation that the president himself may face legal proceedings. Clearly referring to Mr Trump, Cohen said he had been directed by ""a candidate for federal office"" to break federal election laws. Cohen pleaded guilty to counts of tax evasion, making false statements to a financial institution, wilfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution and making a campaign contribution at the request of a candidate or campaign. Sentencing was set for 12 December and he was released on bail of $500,000 (Â£390,000). Who is Michael Cohen? This video can not be played Trump again denied there had been any collusion with Russia to get him elected Cohen's voice quavered as he answered routine questions from the judge. Asked whether he had consumed any alcohol or drugs before making his guilty plea, he told Judge William Pauley he had only had a glass of 12-year-old Glenlivet, a single-malt scotch, with dinner the night before. Nick Bryant, BBC News, in court This was the legal summer blockbuster that journalists had been waiting months for and, in terms of courtroom drama and potential political impact, the appearance of Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's one-time Mr Fix-it, didn't disappoint. It was his admission that he had knowingly broken campaign finance laws that was by far the most politically explosive. It was extraordinary to hear him tell the court that he had done so in co-ordination with, and at the direction of, the candidate. Though he did not mention his name - or those of the women in question - the candidate is, of course, his former boss, Mr Trump. Though Cohen has admitted guilt, he has not agreed as part of the plea agreement to co-operate with federal prosecutors, either in New York or those working on the investigation led by the special counsel Robert Mueller. He left court to chants of ""lock him up"" from a few of his fellow New Yorkers. Robert Khuzami, the deputy US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Cohen's crimes had been ""particularly significant"" because he was a trained lawyer. Cohen, he said, had failed over the past five years to report income on $1.3m from a taxi business, $100,000 from brokerage commissions and $200,000 from consultancy fees. He said Cohen had provided ""sham"" invoices to the campaign for legal fees that he allegedly provided last year. The prosecutor also said Cohen had sought reimbursement for his ""excessive campaign contribution"" by submitting the bogus invoices to the campaign. Porn star Stormy Daniels says she was paid $130,000 by Cohen just days before the 2016 election to keep quiet about an affair she says she had a decade earlier with Mr Trump. Cohen also recorded a conversation with Mr Trump two months before the election in which they discussed buying the rights to a kiss-and-tell story by former Playboy model Karen McDougal who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. McDougal apologises for 'Trump affair' Undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. The lawyer for Ms Daniels - who is suing both Mr Trump and Cohen for defamation - tweeted that the court developments had boosted her case against the president. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played CNN reporter asks Mr Trump about Michael Cohen back in July The people around Donald Trump Cohen worked at the Trump Organization for more than a decade and continued to serve as Mr Trump's personal lawyer and fixer after the election. The FBI seized a number of files in April from Cohen's office and a hotel room used by him in New York. They had conducted the raid reportedly following a tip-off from Robert Mueller's team. ""If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?"" Cohen's lawyer,  Lanny Davis, asked after Tuesday's proceedings. Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Mr Trump, told reporters that there had been ""no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president"" in the charges against Cohen. In any case, Mr Trump is unlikely to face criminal charges as long as he remains president, legal experts say. What is conceivable is that he could be sacked by Congress under the US constitution's provision for impeaching a president over ""high crimes and misdemeanours"". For that to happen, Mr Trump's opponents in the Democratic Party would have to win control of both houses. How easy is it to impeach a president? Even if they did well in the mid-term elections in November, they would almost certainly need to persuade members of Mr Trump's Republicans to change sides over the issue. No US president has ever been removed from office on the basis of impeachment. The chances of impeachment would increase dramatically were an ongoing investigation led by Robert Mueller to conclude that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to sway the 2016 election - a charge denied by Russia and described by Mr Trump as a ""witch hunt"". Cohen's lawyer said his client was keen to ""tell truth to power"" and that what he had to say was going to be of great interest to Mr Mueller.

Trump's former lawyer 'happy' to testify,"From left: Michael Cohen, Donald Trump, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal US President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, is said to be ""more than happy"" to speak to the inquiry into alleged collusion with Russia. Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to violating finance laws during the 2016 presidential election by handling hush money for Mr Trump's alleged lovers. Cohen is ready to ""tell everything about Donald Trump that he knows"", his personal lawyer, Lanny Davis, said. Mr Trump has argued that Cohen had made up stories in order to get a deal. 'I don't care if Trump paid off a porn star' The president denies there was any collusion with Russia to get him elected. In an interview with Fox & Friends, the president said he had found out about the payments ""later on"", and that they did not come out of the campaign. In July,Mr Cohen released audio tapes of him and Mr Trump allegedly discussing payments to a former playboy modelbefore the 2016 presidential election. Cohen, who has been Mr Trump's personal lawyer for more than a decade, has pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He said he had paid hush money to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr Trump, at the direction of ""the candidate"" - a clear reference to Mr Trump. Cohen said the payment was made for the ""principal purpose of influencing [the 2016] election"". Cohen has reached a plea deal with prosecutors, which may see his prison sentence reduced from 65 years to five years and three months.

On the same day that Cohen pleaded guilty,a jury convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafortof bank and tax fraud charges. It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department probe, led by former FBI chief Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller has been investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to swing the election in his favour. Russia has denied claims it interfered in the elections. Mr Trump has responded to both the Cohen and Manafort cases with a series of tweets criticising Cohen and praising Manafort.

""Paul Manafort is a good man,"" he told reporters, although he stressed that ""it doesn't involve me"". He also tweeted that Cohen had pleaded ""guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime"", adding: ""President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!"" He was referring to howBarack Obama's 2008 campaign was fined $375,000,externalfor failing to report some campaign donations within 48 hours - although experts at the time said the violations were relatively minor given the size of the campaign. In his interview with Fox, the president denied the hush money constituted a campaign violation, saying the payments ""didn't come out of the campaign, they came from me, and I tweeted about it"". Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump ""did nothing wrong, there are no charges against him"". Both prosecutors and Cohen agree that Cohen violated campaign finance laws.

Undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis has asked why the US president should not be prosecuted for the crimes Cohen had confessed to committing on his behalf. McDougal apologises for 'Trump affair' Michael Cohen: Trump's pit bull There is no confirmation that Cohen will speak to Mr Mueller's Russia inquiry. However, Mr Davis says his client is ""more than happy"" to talk, and has knowledge of whether Donald Trump knew in advance about the computer hacking which undermined his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In summer 2016, embarrassing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server were made public. Russian intelligence officers have since been charged in absentia for the hack. This video can not be played Michael Cohen's lawyer: 'It is indisputable... that Donald Trump directed Cohen' Cohen also has knowledge, Mr Davis said, of a meeting at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016 between Trump campaign aides and a Russian delegation which was promising political ""dirt"".

Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? What new Trump Tower documents tell us Under US campaign law, it is illegal for a US citizen to solicit foreigners for campaign donations or contributions - although legal experts are divided on whether the offer of information counts as such. President Trump has denied knowing in advance about the meeting. However, according to US media,Cohen has said that Mr Trump had known about the meeting beforehandand that he is willing to state this to the Russian inquiry. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter People in Washington are talking about impeachment - while in the West Wing staffers show a steely resolve. In an area known as Lower Press, located on the ground level of the West Wing, many people seemed on edge - as if they were waiting for something to happen. In a hallway in an area of the West Wing known as Upper Press, I ran into Bill Shine, the president's communications chief, followed by a small group of men - all in a hurry. He shook my hand and gave me a tight smile. For him, the day was only beginning, and it looked like it was going to be a long one. Mr Trump has admitted reimbursing Cohen for paying one of the women, having earlier denied any knowledge of it. But Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Mr Trump, told reporters there had been ""no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president"" in the charges against Cohen.

I sang opera during my brain surgeryComedian Sarah-May Philo sang and told jokes while a surgeon removed her life-threatening brain tumourGlasgow & West Scotland,"Sarah-May Philo after her brain surgery A stand-up comedian had her doctors in stitches as they performed life-saving brain surgery. Sarah-May Philo told jokes and even sang the opera classic Ave Maria as surgeons removed a tumour during a nine-hour operation. The 34-year-old comic and special needs teacher from Dennistoun in Glasgow knew she would have to be awake to measure brain function but her dialogue with medical staff went beyond all expectations. When Sarah-May Philo suffered a seizure in 2016, doctors uncovered a tumour in her brain she had been living with symptom-free for more than 15 years. The tumour - called an oligodendroglioma - had to be removed and she would need to be awake for most of the operation. Sarah-May and fiance Paul Griffin She toldBBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Michelle McManus: ""They found a tumour which was apparently taking up half of my brain. They said it had taken a long time to grow and my brain had just adapted and survived. ""Functions on my brain were on the wrong side because of it - they called me an unusual case. ""They gave no other option than to operate. They had to get it out, or at least try to get most of it out."" Theatre staff were entertained by patient Sarah-May but the ""show"" served an important monitoring purpose She explained; ""They took the size of a tennis ball out of my head and left 15% of it behind because it would have affected my speech and movement to remove it. ""Because I stayed awake the whole time, they could tell when my speech was affected or when I couldn't clench my first. So I effectively had to continually talk for eight hours."" The surgery took place in March this year at the Queen Elizabeth University hospital in Glasgow. But things took an unusual turn when Sarah-May was brought to consciousness on the operating table. As a comedian she was used to talking, but then the powerful pain killers kicked in. The operation took place at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in March this year She said: ""It was formally only the speech and language therapist who was to talk to me. ""But by hour three or four, the whole surgical staff and the anaesthetist were chatting away and making jokes. ""At one point the surgeon behind me said 'Oops!' and I was like 'what do you mean, Oops, you're in my brain!'"" When she revealed she was an operatically-trained singer, Sarah-May was asked to give the theatre a song, and ended up performing a version of Ave Maria to an appreciative captive audience. She made up songs about the staff around her and teased the surgeon as he worked. Sarah-May said she found the whole process fascinating. Sarah-May after her surgical procedure Sarah-May has blogged about her treatment and shared scans of the tumour She added: ""I have always loved medical programmes. The fact it was me didn't hit until much later and I was just very, very curious. I got them to take pictures and now I have an album of pictures of the inside of my brain!"" Sarah-May said the surgery was the best part of her treatment. After struggling with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, she is feeling better and has returned to her job as a special needs teacher. Her comedy is still on the agenda and she thinks there's a show-worth of material in her operating table experience. She said: ""The future is bright now. I didn't make the Edinburgh Festival this year but I'll be back next year for sure.""

Cohen was Trump's pit bull,"Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's once fiercely loyal lawyer, has struck a plea deal with prosecutors investigating possible campaign finance violations and tax fraud. Who is he anyway? When an FBI team raided Cohen's office in New York on 9 April, they arrived at a workspace fit for the silver screen. It's 30-odd floors up at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in a corner - but not very spacious - office at the Squire Patton Boggs law firm. Cohen's office is decked out with paraphernalia from his time at the Trump Organization and on Trump's presidential campaign, as well as from superhero movies - Thor's hammer, Captain America's shield. Also hard to miss - a nearly full-length impressionist-style painting of Cohen himself at the press secretary's podium in the White House briefing room. Cohen has remained in Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, during ups and downs at the Trump Organization and on the campaign. But as Cohen has been named a subject of a federal investigation in New York, his relations with Donald Trump have deteriorated. Cohen, 51, had prided himself in going above and beyond the line of duty as the president's personal lawyer. He considered himself Trump's protector. He'll do anything for him,telling Vanity Fair last September,externalhe'd ""take a bullet"" for the president. The day before the FBI raid, Cohentweeted,externala month-old story about him with a Joyce Maynard quote: ""A person who deserves my loyalty receives it"" followed by his own pledge: ""I will always protect our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA"". Cohen is the son of an immigrant who escaped a Nazi concentration camp in Poland. He grew up in Long Island, right outside of New York City, before attending American University in Washington and Cooley Law School in western Michigan. Trump defended Cohen in an unrelated meeting after the FBI raided his office and hotel Back in New York, Cohen worked at a law firm, married an Ukrainian immigrant, ran a successful taxi business and made a failed run for New York City Council, all before entering Trump's orbit. Cohen was introduced to Donald Trump by his son, Donald Jr, in 2006. Cohen's family had purchased a number of properties in the Trump World Tower near the United Nations, and Cohen had become the treasurer of the building's board. He had grown up idolising Trump, reading The Art of the Deal multiple times. So when Trump offered him a job after he had advised on a few legal matters, Cohen was shocked. Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal The porn star scandal Trump can't shake Fox host unmasked as Trump lawyer client He took the job, becoming executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization in 2007. From then on, he was practically part of the family - close with Trump's adult children, regularly dining with them and their spouses. He was also an early fan of the idea of President Trump. In 2011, he helped launch a website, Should Trump Run?, to gauge public opinion. He was on board when Trump announced his candidacy in 2015. Cohen's been described as the president's ""pit bull"" and extension of Trump himself. He speaks with a thick Long Island accent and avoids alcohol much like his boss. Cohen is high energy, speaks assertively and has an affinity for Hermes belts and eccentric jackets. Cohen is not press shy. He prides himself on taking everyone's calls. When a CNN published a story about his role in covering up Donald Trump's alleged affair,externalwith adult film actress Stormy Daniels, he texted it to me. ""How do you feel about being called fixer?"" I asked him. ""Not insulted,"" he replied. Cohen chats with friends ahead of a hearing on the FBI raid But he's also visibly affected by what's written about him. In late 2017 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, Cohen was heard complaining about a recent story written about him. He called it ""fake news,"" saying the only news anyone should believe about him is what comes out of his own mouth. Well before the FBI raid, Cohen was named as a key figure in the alleged Russian effort to sway the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favour. The ""Steele Dossier"" - a report by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by research firm Fusion GPS to investigate Trump - specifically points to a trip Cohen allegedly made to Prague in late summer of 2016 to meet Kremlin representatives. Cohen has repeatedly denied the report or having ever been to the Czech Republic.He recently tweeted another denial,externalin light of a new report claiming Mueller has proofbacking up that element of the dossier,external. But it began to unravel for Cohen when the news broke of a hush money payment he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels - who claims she had an affair with Trump before he was president. Since Special Counsel Robert Mueller began his investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia, Trump had been advised by his other lawyers to keep his distance from Cohen. However - perhaps in a signal of loyalty - Trump had dinner with Cohen the night before Daniels' interview aired on CBS' 60 Minutes. The raid on Cohen's office and hotel in search of files related to the Daniels payment and other matters, however, was a surprise. Cohen was working out of the offices of a major New York law firm ""No-one saw this coming,"" a source familiar with Cohen's thinking on the matter said. Out of all the possible persons of interest to Mueller, Cohen has been closest to the president the longest - save the members of Trump's immediate family. He knows the most. And his legal troubles in New York come from a ""referral"" from the special counsel's office. The southern district of New York - where Cohen's case is being handled - is known for being aggressive. As the federal prosecutors reportedly considered charges against him, his loyalty to Mr Trump seemed to soften - he told ABC News that his top concern was his family. In the immediate aftermath of the FBI raid, Trump came to his friend's defence - both on Twitter, complaining of a witch hunt, and in person, calling Cohen a ""good man"". But his tone soon changed when Cohen's lawyer released audio of a conversation he had with Mr Trump about the Stormy payment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were also reports that Mr Cohen claimed Mr Trump knew in advance of the infamous Trump Tower meeting in 2016 where Russians met members of the campaign with the promise of offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's current lawyer, said Mr Cohen had ""lied all his life"".

A dramatic day in Trumpland,"Supporters of President Trump greeted him at a rally in West Virginia hours after his former aides learned they face jail Two dramatic moments in court, only minutes apart. Since Donald Trump became US president 19 months ago, there has been no shortage of spectacle. But there have been few days as eventful or potentially impactful as 21 August, 2018. This is how that day unfolded. Since May 2017, a special investigation headed by former FBI chief Robert Mueller has been looking into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and whether Donald Trump's victorious campaign team colluded with Russia. Among the first of the 32 people and three companies charged as part of the investigation was Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's former campaign chief. Meanwhile, another investigation stemming from the special counsel has been bubbling under the surface for a few months: New York prosecutors have been examining the dealings of Mr Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. 21 August - 09:30 eastern time (14:30 BST) In Alexandria, Virginia, a jury is starting its fourth day of deliberations in Mr Manafort's trial - he faces 18 allegations of falsifying his tax returns, committing bank fraud, and failing to file reports of foreign bank accounts. The two-week trial is the first to emerge from the special counsel investigation. Among the witnesses for the prosecution was Rick Gates, Mr Manafort's former right-hand man. In accusing Mr Manafort of not declaring all his income, the prosecution had detailed his extravagant purchases - including a $15,000 (Â£11,640) ostrich jacket. Some of Manafort's many jackets that were shown to the jury 11:36 There are signs the jury in Virginia may be close to returning a verdict - news agencies reveal that jurors have asked the judge what they should do if they cannot reach a unanimous conclusion. 11:59 In breaking news, MSNBC report that Mr Cohen is in talks about a possible plea deal. Over the next 90 minutes, the news is confirmed by a number of other US media outlets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, in a note to the court, Mr Mueller's team says it is not yet ready to sentence him. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says this is a sign that Flynn, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the presidential transition, is still co-operating with Mr Mueller and that his usefulness to the investigation is ongoing. 14:42 The Associated Press reveal that a plea deal has been reached in the Cohen case. Media report that he will appear before a federal court in Manhattan at 16:00. 16:05 Mr Cohen arrives at court. Michael Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Mr Trump 16:25 An urgent line by Reuters flashes in newsrooms:Jury reaches verdict in bank and tax fraud trial of former Trump campaign chairman Manafort Over the next 10 minutes, the full verdict is read out:Manafort is found guilty on eight chargesof tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. But the jury fails to reach a verdict on 10 other charges and the judge declares a mistrial on those. Manafort could face up to 80 years in jail. Mr Manafort had denied all charges 16:31 The judge in the Cohen case reveals that the former Trump lawyer is to plead guilty to at least five counts of tax fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. 16:35 Once the full verdict in the Manafort trial becomes clear, reporters sprint out of the Alexandria courthouse in droves to break the news to their outlets.

It is not yet clear, despite his plea deal, whether Cohen is co-operating with the special counsel investigation. The deal does mean he could face a reduced jail sentence, of up to five years and three months. 17:19 Robert Khuzami, the prosecutor in the Cohen case, hold a press conference outside the federal court in Manhattan. ""These are very serious charges and reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over an extended period of time,"" he says. 17:38 President Trump emerges from Air Force One in Charleston, West Virginia, where he will be taking part in a rally later that night. Reporters shout, asking whether he has any reaction to the Manafort and Cohen cases as he walks down the steps. He doesn't immediately reply but later walks over to the gathered journalists. This video can not be played President Trump: ""I feel very badly for Paul Manafort"" ""Paul Manafort is a good man,"" he says. ""He was with Ronald Reagan, he was with a lot of different people over the years and I feel very sad about that. It doesn't involve me, very sad thing that happened, nothing to do with Russian collusion, absolutely nothing to do with - it's a witch hunt and a disgrace."" He doesn't address the Michael Cohen plea deal. 21:32 In an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis says his client is happy to co-operate with the Russia investigation. ""Mr Cohen has knowledge on certain subjects that should be of interest in the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows,"" he says.

Non-summer 'summer holiday' ad banned,"The ASA ruled summer holidays to be in June, July and August A Tui TV ad offering a ""perfect summer holiday"" which could only be taken in September or October has been banned. A travel period between September 1 and October 31 was ""unlikely to align"" with consumers' understanding of the term summer holiday, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) concluded. Following a complaint to the ASA, Tui argued its summer holiday season ran from April to October. In response to the ruling, the company said the ad had been altered. The television ad for Tui holidays in June featured a voiceover stating: ""It's not too late to discover Turkey with Tui from Â£279 per person this summer...perfect summer holidays that put you in the middle"", while on-screen text specified that the price applied to departures between 1 September and 31 October. A viewer claimed the departure dates were not during the summer holiday period and complained the ad was misleading. Tui said its summer holiday period ran from 1 April to 31 October, pointing out that the ad showed both adult-only groups as well as families. Ad clearance agency Clearcast said the first two weeks of departures were still within summer months and suggested it would have been confusing to spell out that the offer covered summer and autumn. The ASA said consumers would interpret the term ""summer holidays"" to mean holidays available for travel during June, July and August. When do the seasons begin and end? It ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form, adding: ""We told Tui UK to ensure that their future advertising did not mislead by claiming to offer summer holidays if those holidays were outside of the period that consumers were likely to consider as summer."" A Tui spokesman said: ""We note the ASA's ruling and can confirm that we've already taken action to amend this advert for future use.""

On-the-run prisoner caught by police,"This video can not be played Prisoner Shaun Walmsley spent 18 months on the run after escaping during a hospital visit A convicted murderer who escaped during a prison visit to a hospital has been arrested after being on the run for more than a year. Shaun Walmsley, 29, was sprung from custody during a visit to Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool in February 2017. Merseyside Police said he was arrested in Leeds on Tuesday. He later appeared at Liverpool and Knowsley Magistrates' Court charged with escape from lawful custody. With shoulder length brown hair and a beard, he appeared by video-link and spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. Shaun Walmsley was serving a life sentence for murder when he escaped He was remanded in custody to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on 19 September. Walmsley was serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years. He escaped when two men armed with a knife and a gun confronted guards outside the Liverpool hospital during a scheduled visit from HMP Walton. Police previously issued CCTV images showing the scene of Walmsley's escape A gold-coloured Volvo used as a getaway car was later found abandoned in the Fazakerley area of Liverpool. A reward of Â£20,000 of Walmsley's own money was offered by police for information. The money was seized following his arrest and conviction for the murder. Walmsley was arrested after armed officers stopped a car in the Harehills area of Leeds. Detectives also worked with officers from the National Crime Agency and police forces in Europe to locate Walmsley. He was sentenced to life in prison in June 2015 for his involvement in the murder of 33-year-old Anthony Duffy in 2014. Mr Duffy, 33, was lured to an address in Aintree in May 2014 and ""repeatedly stabbed"".

Should workers be asked what they earn?,"The practice of many firms of asking job applicants what they currently earn is partly to blame for trapping women on low pay, a charity has said. The ""salary question"" means women underpaid in their current job are more likely to be underpaid in the next one, the Young Women's Trust charity said. It said including salary details in job adverts instead would help close the gender pay gap between men and women. The CBI warned the move could have ""unintended consequences"". A spokesperson for the employers' organisation said: ""Closing the gender pay gap is complex. Publishing pay bands on job adverts is good practice, but banning conversations about pay isn't the best solution and could have unintended consequences."" The CBI said issues such as the availability of affordable childcare and careers advice were also important factors in closing the gender pay gap. What is the gender pay gap? Nine ways to narrow the gender pay gap Why do some job adverts put women off applying? Asking applicants about previous or current pay has already been banned in New York and California. The Young Women's Trust, a charity that supports young women on low or no pay, says that, other than in exceptional circumstances, UK organisations should follow suit. Large firms had to publish their gender pay gap for the first time this year The government this year introduced a requirement that UK companies with 250 or more employees must publish their gender pay gap data. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Across the UK, men earned 18.4% more than women in April 2017, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS). The Young Women's Trust commissioned a YouGov poll which found that nearly half of advertised jobs did not include any wage details with the practice most common in the private sector. The charity says that making pay more transparent would make it harder for employers to, even unintentionally, pay men and women different amounts for similar roles. The Women's Trust says many employers agree that organisations should publish salary details for all roles to increase transparency, with some saying it is best practice as it encourages more applicants. In the charity's survey 48% of employers were in favour of the measure to bring about gender equality in the workplace. Its chief executive, Carole Easton, said: ""We have to break the cycle that traps women in low pay. Women often start work on a lower salary than men, move to a new job and are paid based on their previous wage, as opposed to what they or the role are worth - so they continue to be paid less."" She said that their research showed women were more likely to disregard jobs if they felt their skills didn't match up to them, whereas men would often apply anyway. Including salary details in job adverts would help women to see that jobs are in fact at their level and give them an idea of where they should be negotiating from to progress their pay, Ms Easton added. The charity's analysis of Office for National Statistics data found that women lose out on nearly Â£140bn a year in total due to the full-time gender pay gap. Well over three-quarters of UK firms pay their male staff more than their female workers. Why do some job adverts put women off applying?

It has been a pleasure taking you through this Test. Scroll down for highlights and reaction. We'll be back on 30 August with the fourth Test from Southampton. Just one spinner in Moeen? Rashid out? #bbccricket Andy Gill:Shots like the one Pope played in the second innings serve as a reminder that he needs to bat at six and be allowed to learn Test cricket. Cook, Mitchell, Root, Moeen, Stokes, Pope, Buttler, Woakes, Curran, Broad, Anderson. Joe Root, on the availability of Alastair Cook, whose wife is due to give birth soon:""As far as I know he will be available, the due date is not until quite a bit later on. Obviously Jonny has a fracture, he felt fine to bat but I think it's something we'll have to look at over the next few days. He'll have to rest it and see, we can't make a snap decision now. We are very fortunate that Jos is in the team and is a very able keeper but obviously it would be nice to have Jonny batting, if not keeping."" I think you're in the minority there, Nathan. #bbccricket Nathan Bundy:Slightly controversially I wouldn't change the team for the fourth Test. They should be judged on how they come back from a bad performance. There were a few India players who could have been given the man of the match award in this Test. Kohli got it for his century but Hardik Pandya blew away England in that collapse on day two. He took 5-28 in six overs. I'd also like to give a mention to Jasprit Bumrah. He was excellent in the second innings, bowling fast and finding movement. He took 5-85 in 29 overs, comfortably getting through the biggest workload of all of the India bowlers. The series would look different if Bumrah had have been fit for the first two Tests. #bbccricket or text 81111 Henri Cooke:Burns Cook Root Moeen Stokes Pope Buttler (c) Curran Rashid Broad Anderson. Two spinners on the last two pitches could help. Tough to leave Woakes out, but I prefer the variety of having a left armer. Joe Root once again backed his openers Keaton Jennings and Alastair Cook despite them both failing again in this Test. ""If you look at this series itâs been
very challenging for the top order,"" Root said. ""We need to be realistic weâve got two very good
players at the top of the order. We need to find our own methods as a batting
group."" Jennings averages 18.80 in the series and Cook averages 16.00. Jennings top score is 42 and Cook's 29. #bbccricket or text 81111 Elliot GC:Vince and Jennings have had their chances.

it will pay massive dividends. On Bairstow's broken finger: ""Itâs very early days so weâll see how

Trevor, Essex BBC Test Match Special More from England coach Trevor Bayliss, speaking about England slip catching issues:""We do a lot of work in practice but in the games there is a lot more pressure on and confidence wise you drop one or two and all the eyes are on us. There are some new guys in the team so it will take a little time to create a combination but it's not from a lack of practice."" Vic MarksEx-England spinner on BBC Test Match Special Jos Buttler saying that his century was his proudest moment shows Test cricket is still valued incredibly highly by the players, it gnaws away at the brain. Trevor Bayliss is right, although I'm sure he would like to have it all sewn up by now, it should make for a terrific finale to the series. Joe Root at the presentation on Sky Sports: ""Itâs a strong England team. It
was always going to be a difficult decision (on the selection). Weâve been
performing extremely well to get ahead in the series. In this series we could
have bowled slightly fully and straighter. However, India played very well. You
have to give credit to them for doing that. Conditions were difficult but itâs
fair to say we massively under performed. ""That partnership from Jos and Ben is a
real lesson to our team on how to play Test cricket. They adapted to the
situation and built the partnership looking very clear on how they were going
to score the runs. We need to make sure when we turn up to Southampton we score
400 or more in the first innings."" Alex is calling for significant changes including a new England captain. Do you agree? Send us your XIs.

The guys are aware of it (batting collapses) and working on things all the time, we hope that partnership will be the catalyst for going forward. The guys we have in the team go hard at the ball, constantly we are working on that you can still play shots with good footwork but it's about playing the situation.""

Puppy sales at pet shops set to be banned,"Pet shops and dealers in England will be banned from selling puppies and kittens under government plans. The proposals,which have gone out to consultation,external, will mean those wanting to buy or adopt a pet less than six months old will have to go to the breeder or a rescue centre. A ban on licensed sellers dealing in dogs and cats less than eight weeks old is already coming in on 1 October. Campaigners welcomed the announcement, but warned of ""potential loopholes"". The ban aims to reduce the health problems associated which emerge when animals are reared in poor conditions. It is a victory for the Lucy's Law campaign, which has been calling for the ban to be implemented. The campaign was named after a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who was badly treated in the puppy farming system. Lucy was rescued in 2013 at five years old from a Welsh puppy farm. She had a series of health problems, including a curved spine as a result of being kept in a cramped cage, and epilepsy. She died in 2016. Allow Facebook content?

A petition supporting Lucy's Law was signed by nearly 150,000 people and was debated in Parliament in May. There are no records of the number of puppies sold via third parties, but the animal charity Blue Cross has estimated it is between 40,000 and 80,000 per year in Great Britain. The Department for Environment, Food and rural Affairs said fewer than 100 third party sellers - which includes some pet shops - are licensed in England. Calls for Wales pet shop puppy sales ban Are we tough enough on animal cruelty? The rise of the dog-napper Speaking in support of a change, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""People who have a complete disregard for pet welfare will no longer be able to profit from this miserable trade."" TV vet Marc Abraham, who launched the campaign for Lucy's Law, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Lucy's Law will make all breeders and puppy farms ""completely transparent and accountable"" which ""completely raises the stakes for animal welfare"". ""There's nowhere to hide, a pet shop can't blame the breeder and the breeder can't blame the pet shop,"" he said. ""Everyone selling is accountable so this is a very exciting time for animal welfare."" He said Lucy was a ""beautiful little soul"" whose condition when she was rescued was ""so heartbreaking"". ""Lisa Garner, her owner, rehabilitated her and popped her in the hands of various celebrities and got this huge social media following and helped raised awareness about not only puppy farming, but rescue dog adoption,"" he said. ""Then she sadly passed away and succumbed to all her injuries in December 2016. ""We launched Lucy's Law a year after her passing as a tribute to her and all the breeding dogs that are hidden from the public."" The Mayhew Animal Home charity has previously highlighted the case of Luna, a Jack Russell terrier who was sold online despite being ill with a suspected skin disease. At six weeks old, Luna was already under the legal age required for puppies to be sold - but the seller claimed the young dog was 10 weeks old. Jack Russell terrier Luna was illegally sold underage online In another case, the Dogs Trust said a French bulldog called Lola was forced to travel from eastern Europe so her puppies could be born and sold in the UK at a higher price. Two of her puppies later died. Paula Boyden, from the Dogs Trust, welcomed the ban but warned ""potential loopholes"" needed to be closed off for it to be successful. She said there should be additional measures including regulating re-homing organisations. Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club secretary, said the ban would ""stop the suffering of many dogs and send a very strong message to puppy buyers that it is never OK to see a puppy in any environment other than the one it was born and raised in, and with its mum"". Chris Wainwright, deputy chief executive of the RSPCA, told BBC News that a ban was ""overdue"" and said he hoped it would raise welfare standards. ""We've had this explosion in this market with loads of rogue traders, lots of rogue dealers and it's meant the public are often unsuspecting. They think they're buying from a reputable breeder, actually they're buying from a middle person,"" he said. ""It means the breeders aren't getting the scrutiny on their premises because they're passing these dogs off to third parties and it often leaves families with sick animals and the tragedy of that occurs."" Queen guitarist Brian May, who supports the Lucy's Law campaign, said it was ""a day for celebration"". The Pet Industry Federation said puppy farms should be closed down but added there were concerns that an outright ban on third party sales would lead to sales ""going underground"". Other rules already coming into force on 1 October include a requirement for any licensed pet seller to include their licence number in the advert as well as identifying the local authority that issued it and for breeders to show puppies alongside their mother before a sale is made. In Wales,campaigners have also called for Lucy's Lawand the government has said it would ""investigate the potential banning of third party sales"". Legislation it introduced in 2014 requires all dog breeders to apply for a licence. In Scotland, a members' bill to end puppy farmingwas introduced in May.

Bank scam victims 'shouldn't be blamed',"Banks have been warned that it's ""not fair"" to automatically blame customers for money lost through a scam. Last year, customers transferred nearly Â£240m to fraudsters, only a quarter of which was refunded by financial firms. The Financial Ombudsman service said fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were due to customer carelessness. The service, which resolves customer disputes, said victims who lost money had a good chance of being reimbursed. ""It's not fair to automatically call a customer grossly negligent simply because they've fallen for a scam. ""That's especially true in light of the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems - and convince customers that their money is at risk,"" said Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman and chief executive of the Financial Ombudsman Service. She said when a customer had fallen for a fraud or a scam, typically both they and the bank denied they had done anything wrong. One customer called Brian contacted the Ombudsman service after his bank refused to refund him Â£7,000 in a text message scam. Brian received a message he thought was from his bank and unwittingly gave out his security details and passcodes. As a result, the bank said he had been grossly negligent and refused to refund the money. After reviewing the details, the Ombudsman decided it was a sophisticated fraud, and that the fraudsters had gained Brian's trust and therefore his actions were reasonable. They forced the bank to reimburse Brian's Â£7,000. Another fraud victim called Jas contacted the Ombudsman over several large withdrawals on her monthly statement which she didn't recognise. The bank said she must have made them herself or given someone her pin number. The Ombudsman found her account of what happened and the details about where she kept her card ""consistent and plausible"". The bank was forced to refund the disputed transactions because the Ombudsman said the bank had also failed to show Jas had been grossly negligent. 'Scammers struck as my mum was dying' Ms Wayman said there was ""a very high bar"" for banks to prove customers had been ""grossly negligent"", meaning the banks were not liable for the money their customer had lost. ""If they can't do that, it's likely we'll tell them to cover the money their customer has lost,"" she said. Examples of the tactics used by fraudsters including creating fake websites which look identical to banks' online systems - or text messages which look like they're from someone's bank.

Rashid out? #bbccricket Andy Gill:Shots like the one Pope played in the second innings serve as a reminder that he needs to bat at six and be allowed to learn Test cricket. Cook, Mitchell, Root, Moeen, Stokes, Pope, Buttler, Woakes, Curran, Broad, Anderson. Joe Root, on the availability of Alastair Cook, whose wife is due to give birth soon:""As far as I know he will be available, the due date is not until quite a bit later on. Obviously Jonny has a fracture, he felt fine to bat but I think it's something we'll have to look at over the next few days. He'll have to rest it and see, we can't make a snap decision now. We are very fortunate that Jos is in the team and is a very able keeper but obviously it would be nice to have Jonny batting, if not keeping."" I think you're in the minority there, Nathan. #bbccricket Nathan Bundy:Slightly controversially I wouldn't change the team for the fourth Test. They should be judged on how they come back from a bad performance. There were a few India players who could have been given the man of the match award in this Test. Kohli got it for his century but Hardik Pandya blew away England in that collapse on day two. He took 5-28 in six overs. I'd also like to give a mention to Jasprit Bumrah. He was excellent in the second innings, bowling fast and finding movement. He took 5-85 in 29 overs, comfortably getting through the biggest workload of all of the India bowlers. The series would look different if Bumrah had have been fit for the first two Tests. #bbccricket or text 81111 Henri Cooke:Burns Cook Root Moeen Stokes Pope Buttler (c) Curran Rashid Broad Anderson. Two spinners on the last two pitches could help. Tough to leave Woakes out, but I prefer the variety of having a left armer. Joe Root once again backed his openers Keaton Jennings and Alastair Cook despite them both failing again in this Test. ""If you look at this series itâs been
very challenging for the top order,"" Root said. ""We need to be realistic weâve got two very good
players at the top of the order. We need to find our own methods as a batting
group."" Jennings averages 18.80 in the series and Cook averages 16.00. Jennings top score is 42 and Cook's 29. #bbccricket or text 81111 Elliot GC:Vince and Jennings have had their chances.

fair to say we massively under performed. ""That partnership from Jos and Ben is a
real lesson to our team on how to play Test cricket. They adapted to the

"Student's diabetes firm makes millionsDr Harry Destecroix, 31, co-founded Ziylo while finishing his PhD in Bristol four years ago.Bristol","Dr Harry Destecroix co-founded the company Ziylo while studying at Bristol University A graduate who co-founded a company while studying at university could become a multi-millionaire after it was sold in a deal potentially worth Â£623m. Dr Harry Destecroix, 31, co-founded Ziylo while studying for his PhD at the University of Bristol four years ago. It created a new technology which can be developed to treat diabetes more effectively. Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's purchase means it now has full rights to develop glucose responsive insulins. Dr Destecroix, described the molecule could be the ""holy grail"" of insulin and said he hoped the sale will offer ground-breaking treatment for diabetics. He said: ""It wasn't a surprise when the discovery was made two years ago. When we saw the properties it had, we were astounded."" Ziylo, a university spin-out company, developed a synthetic molecule which works by binding glucose in the bloodstream more effectively. The molecule is a product of 20 years' work at the Anthony Davis lab at the university, which specialises in molecular chemistry. Danish firm Novo Nordisk, one of the biggest manufacturers of diabetes medicines, will now aim to use this molecule to develop a new type of insulin which aims to help diabetics manage their condition more safely. The next steps will involve further research and work to create the new drug followed by clinical trials. It is likely to take about 10 years to come to market and the Â£623m figure is based on this potential success. The glucose binding molecules discovered by the Ziylo team have the potential to lead to the development of insulins, which can potentially remove the risk of hypoglycaemia, when blood sugar levels fall below normal. In some cases this can be fatal, or cause other serious conditions like seizures or a coma. ""Novo Nordisk, as the leader in the diabetes field, is the ideal company to maximise the potential of the Ziylo glucose binding molecules in glucose responsive insulins and diabetes applications, and it brings hope of a truly ground-breaking treatment to diabetes patients,"" added Dr Destecroix. Rock star claims 'breakfast beast' fame 'Party house' hosts largest bat colony Nazi items sold on National Trust land Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Ziylo was founded by Dr Harry Destecroix, Dr Anthony Davis and Tom Smart and has a total of 30 stakeholders.

Australia PM battles cabinet rebellionMalcolm Turnbull is facing a growing party divide which has thrown Australian politics into upheaval.Australia,"Malcolm Turnbull is fighting to retain leadership of his party A third Australian government minister has resigned amid reports a fresh attempt to oust Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as party leader is under way. James McGrath, assistant minister to the prime minister, insisted his resignation was accepted on Wednesday. On Tuesday Mr Turnbull won a party leadership vote. Ten ministers then offered to resign, including challenger Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Turnbull is under pressure over poor polling and a divisive energy policy. He initially accepted Mr Dutton's resignation and that of International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells but rejected the other eight, including Mr McGrath's. Mr Turnbull's centre-right coalition will face a general election by May next year, after recently losing a key by-election in Queensland. On Wednesday eveningMr McGrath posted his resignation letter on Facebook,externaland said he had insisted it be accepted. Meanwhile Australian media reports said Liberal party MPs were being asked to sign a document calling for a party meeting at which Mr Turnbull would face another challenge. However reports suggested any meeting was unlikely to take place on Wednesday. The ex-policeman who challenged Australia's PM Under pressure Turnbull abandons climate policy Australia: Coup capital of the democratic world Mr Dutton has said he is still campaigning for the leadership. ""You do not go into a ballot believing that you can lose and if I believe that a majority of colleagues support me then I would consider my position,"" he told radio station 3AW. Mr Turnbull initiated the first vote among Liberal Party MPs on Tuesday in an attempt to end growing speculation about his position as leader of the Liberal party.He won the vote 48-35. ""The iron laws of arithmetic confirmed my leadership,"" he told reporters on Wednesday when asked about his future. Aside from Mr Dutton, those who offered resignations included three senior ministers in Mr Turnbull's 23-member cabinet, Australian media reported. Peter Dutton has said he could still have a chance at taking the leadership from Mr Turnbull Mr Turnbull accepted Mr Dutton's resignation and that of International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. He confirmed he had asked eight ministers to stay on in his ministry despite their offers to stand down, a decision he said aimed to ""maintain the stability of the government of Australia"". The opposition Labor party accused the government of being in ""chaos"". The under-pressure PM has now withdrawn two major policies, admitting defeat over a company tax plan on Wednesday. He had earlier abandoned a key commitment to set an emissions reduction target in law, in an attempt to ward off party conflict. Many Australians online have responded to the battle in Canberra with a sense of frustration and dismay. Labor tried to move a motion of no confidence against the prime minister in parliament on Tuesday. ""While chaos reigns, the country is not governed,"" Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek said. Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament. Over the past decade, Australian politics has been marked by a series of leadership coups, with three sitting prime ministers deposed by party rivals within their first terms.

Child sight 'risked by eye test delays',"Children are developing permanent problems with their vision because they are not being given eye tests early enough, optometrists have warned. An Association of Optometrists survey of 1,200 people indicated a quarter of school-age children had not been taken for a sight test by their parents. Of parents surveyed, 52% thought tests would be given in primary school. While some schools do offer screening, the tests are less comprehensive than those provided free on the NHS. Delayed diagnosis can make treatment for sight problems such as amblyopia, known as ""lazy eye"", much less effective. Screens and eyesight: What can parents do? Game used to test children's eyesight One in 50 children will develop amblyopia, where one or both eyes are unable to build a strong link to the brain, causing vision to not develop properly. TheNHS recommends,externalthat children should be screened for the condition when they turn four because it becomes harder to treat after the age of six. Treatments include glasses and using an eye patch or eye drops to obscure the vision in the stronger eye to make the weaker one work harder. Jane Thompson's daughter, Eve, was diagnosed with amblyopia at the age of seven Jane Thompson's daughter, Eve, was diagnosed with amblyopia at the age of seven. The optometrist in her case said it was too late to try eye-patching for Eve, although prescription glasses have helped improve her vision. Eve is now 14. Jane, from West Yorkshire, said: ""It made me feel like a terrible parent, really, because you want to do your best by your children and then finding out that there is a problem that could've been sorted earlier, but you weren't aware of it, was really hard to handle."" Eve said: ""I'd always been seeing out of my right eye and didn't realise anything was wrong. ""My right eye - I can see and it's how it should be. But then as soon as they cover it up and everything's blurry, it's quite scary - I can't see out of this eye."" Chloe was diagnosed with amblyopia at the age of three In contrast, Nicola Rothera's daughter, Chloe, five, was diagnosed with amblyopia at the age of three and was young enough to use an eye patch. ""If I'd had left her eyesight the way it was, then the left eye wouldn't have been within the legal driving limits, so it would have restricted her in future life,"" said Nicola, from Bradford. ""An eye test at a certain age should be compulsory because it may be the case with some children they might not have their first eye test until they're maybe six, or possibly older, and at that point you're restricting time, if there is a problem, in which to be able to correct their vision."" The Association of Optometrists (AOP) also surveyed 1,246 practising optometrists and found: 74% had seen children in the past year whose vision problems could have been treated more successfully with an earlier diagnosis Of these, 89% had diagnosed cases of amblyopia in the past year that could have been better treated if they had been spotted earlier Farah Topia, from the AOP, said: ""Catching conditions early can be massively important for a child's development. ""For amblyopia, treating a condition early means that the chances of improving the vision in that eye are a lot better. ""All children under 16 are entitled to an NHS-funded sight test. ""It's really important for us to make parents aware that this is available for them and available for their children to access."" The AOP's A B See campaign calls on parents to take their children for an NHS-funded sight test at local opticians every two years, or more often if their optometrist recommends it.

Hut sold on southernmost point of British Isles,"Mr Lawrence said the unusual site visit was the best day in the office he had ever had One of a few ""rare"" buildings at the southern-most point of the British Isles has been sold. The hut, built on Les Minquiers - a group of rocks about nine miles (14.4 km) south of Jersey - was sold for ""a six-figure sum"". Fewer than 20 huts have been built on the reef, which France sought to claim in the 1950s. Advocate James Lawrence, who travelled by sea for a site visit, said only five had been sold in the past 50 years. More news from the Channel Islands The ""priceless"" huts are ""closer in size to a garden chalet"", according to Mr Lawrence, who said the property had been bought by ""a Jersey company"". He added: ""Ordinarily, these beautiful huts are passed through families from one generation to the next, so the fact that one was subject to a transaction is rare."" Many of the chalets are thought not to have changed hands since they were built in the 19th Century. Les Minquiers forms part of the Jersey Parish of Grouville, and is eight miles (12.8 km) away from the French Chausey Islands. The area is protected by conservation treaty, theRamsar Convention,external, due to its unique ecology. In 1953 the International Court of Justice settle a dispute over the reef's sovereignty between Britain and France, who both claimed it through historical ties. The court unanimously found in favour of the UK, and the Jersey law firm Viberts says ownership of properties on the islands by Jersey residents, who paid taxes for their maintenance, ""seemed to have been a deciding factor which lead the court to that outcome"". Local historian Doug Ford says the reef, one of three which surround Jersey, was created about 7,000 years ago by rising sea levels. He said: ""Some say the name Minquiers is derived for the Breton word for a sanctuary - minihi, others that it comes from the Norman word for fish seller - minkier, while a third theory is that it means 'a ground teeming with fish'.

"Will Trump remain bulletproof?The US president has survived numerous body blows, but will he shrug off the latest courtroom dramas?US & Canada","Mr Trump has effectively been implicated in the commission of a crime Tuesday's duelling courtroom dramas in New York and Virginia were the kind of body blows that would stagger, if not fell, most presidencies. And those were just the two top headlines in a day that contained a string of dismal news for Donald Trump. Will any of this matter? The president - at least among his base - has appeared politically bulletproof. Bulletproof for now, however, doesn't necessarily mean bulletproof forever. At some point, the projectiles - perhaps after the mid-terms, when Republican control of Congress and power to set the political agenda may be blunted - may start finding the mark. Here's a look at just how bad a day this was for the president. The president's former personal lawyer didn't just stand in court on Tuesday and accuse the president of lying - although he did do that. By saying that Mr Trump - ""individual-1"" in the plea agreement - directed him to make or oversee payments in 2016 to secure the silence of women poised to accuse the president of having adulterous affairs with them, he effectively implicated the president in the commission of a crime. Cohen pleaded guilty in a Manhattan court to violating campaign finance laws Cohen admitted that his payments constituted campaign contributions that either were directed from an illegal corporate source or in excess of allowable amounts for an individual. Both acts carry a five-year maximum prison sentence. The president in the past has denied having any knowledge of the payments. His legal team has since walked that back and asserted that he only had general knowledge after the fact. Now, however, Cohen is saying Mr Trump knew about them from the start. And it's not just Cohen's word against the president's. In the case of the payment to Karen MacDougal - ""woman-1"" in the plea agreement - his lawyer has already released an audio recording in which Cohen and then-candidate Mr Trump discussed the issue. Trump 'directed' hush money, says Cohen Who is Michael Cohen? Add to this the fact that ""woman-2"", adult film actress Stormy Daniels, is now poised to resume her lawsuit against Mr Trump to get out of her non-disclosure agreement brokered by Cohen. A judge put the suit on hold pending the criminal investigation into Cohen, which now appears to be resolved. That suit could turn up more evidence of Mr Trump's involvement in the illegal $130,000 hush-money payment Cohen has now confessed to making to her on the eve of the 2016 election. It's heavy seas ahead for the president any way you look at it. Special Counsel Robert Mueller was under considerable pressure to get a conviction in his case against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. Even though the charges did not directly relate to the central thrust of his investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, it was the first time his team had to face a jury. If they had walked away without a conviction, either through a hung jury or an outright acquittal, the accusations from Trump loyalists that the investigation was a waste of resources and time would have reached a fevered pitch. Trump fears 'perjury trap' in Russia inquiry It wasn't an across-the-board victory for Mr Mueller, given that the jury couldn't reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 counts, but convictions on tax fraud, failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and bank fraud are points on the board. Add that to the numerous indictments of Russian individuals and companies and plea agreements already reached with Trump campaign officials George Papadopolous, Michael Flynn and Rick Gates, as well as with London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and computer programmer Richard Pinedo, and the special counsel team is producing a growing list of accomplishments. After the verdicts were announced, Manafort's lawyer told the press that his client was ""disappointed"". That may be a bit of an understatement. Even with convictions on only eight of the 18 criminal counts against him, Mr Trump's former campaign chair could be looking at a lengthy prison sentence. And Manafort faces a second trial in Washington DC next month for money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, conspiracy to defraud the US, making false statements and witness tampering. It's the bulk of the legal case against the long-time Washington lobbyist. Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts Manafort's lawyers had insisted on the two separate trials, perhaps because they thought they he had a better chance of acquittal from an Alexandria jury or friendlier federal judges in the Northern Virginia district. If so, that plan backfired. Manafort may be hoping for a presidential pardon, given that Mr Trump has said his prosecution was politically motivated and that he was a ""good man"". The president can only pardon for federal crimes, however, and Manafort's conviction on tax fraud opens him up to future state-level charges, which Mr Trump has no power to forgive. Now 69-year-old Manafort is facing a lengthy prison sentence - and more legal battles to come. And while he hasn't shown a willingness to co-operate with Mr Mueller's investigation so far, that could change. What did we learn from Manafort trial? Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Manafort, after all, attended the June 2016 Trump tower meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr with Russian nationals, originally billed as a means to gather damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton. He took a series of cryptic notes on the topic, which he might be willing to explain to the special counsel - in exchange for lightened sentence. Having one's former campaign chair end up as a convicted felon is not good news. If Manafort flips, however, a bad day for Mr Trump could, in hindsight, be a catastrophic one. Buried under Tuesday afternoon's news was another nugget from the special counsel's office, that it has requested the sentencing of former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn be delayed once again. ""Due to the status of the investigation, the Special Counsel's Office does not believe that this matter is ready to be scheduled for a sentencing hearing at this time,"" Mr Mueller's lawyers told the court overseeing Flynn's plea deal. That would indicate that Flynn, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the Trump presidential transition, is still co-operating with Mr Mueller and that his usefulness to the investigation is ongoing. It might also mean that a formal sentencing hearing could reveal information Mr Mueller would prefer to keep secret at this time. Either way, it's a sign that, behind the scenes, gears are still grinding in Mr Mueller's investigation. Two weeks ago Chris Collins of New York, the first member of the House of Representatives to endorse Mr Trump's presidential bid, was indicted for insider trading. On Tuesday afternoon, Duncan Hunter - the second congressman to do so - was charged with using campaign funds for personal expenses, including trips for his family to Hawaii and Italy. Earlier in the day Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled a sweeping programme of political reform measures she said were necessary to address widespread political corruption in Washington DC. That included a ban on all lobbying by former top government officials, a prohibition of all members of Congress and White House staff from holding individual corporate stocks and a requirement that all president and vice-presidential candidates disclose eight years of tax returns. Similar calls for fixing a broken political system helped Democrats sweep into power in Congress in 2006. It did the same for Republicans in 1994. Mr Trump's ""drain the swamp"" rhetoric was a constant rallying cry for his supporters in 2016. After Tuesday's onslaught of convictions, pleas and indictments, Warren's slate of proposals could prove to be a potent mid-term weapon for Democrats this November, if they know how to use it.

Australia PM battles cabinet rebellion,"Malcolm Turnbull is fighting to retain leadership of his party A third Australian government minister has resigned amid reports a fresh attempt to oust Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as party leader is under way. James McGrath, assistant minister to the prime minister, insisted his resignation was accepted on Wednesday. On Tuesday Mr Turnbull won a party leadership vote. Ten ministers then offered to resign, including challenger Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Turnbull is under pressure over poor polling and a divisive energy policy. He initially accepted Mr Dutton's resignation and that of International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells but rejected the other eight, including Mr McGrath's. Mr Turnbull's centre-right coalition will face a general election by May next year, after recently losing a key by-election in Queensland. On Wednesday eveningMr McGrath posted his resignation letter on Facebook,externaland said he had insisted it be accepted. Meanwhile Australian media reports said Liberal party MPs were being asked to sign a document calling for a party meeting at which Mr Turnbull would face another challenge. However reports suggested any meeting was unlikely to take place on Wednesday. The ex-policeman who challenged Australia's PM Under pressure Turnbull abandons climate policy Australia: Coup capital of the democratic world Mr Dutton has said he is still campaigning for the leadership. ""You do not go into a ballot believing that you can lose and if I believe that a majority of colleagues support me then I would consider my position,"" he told radio station 3AW. Mr Turnbull initiated the first vote among Liberal Party MPs on Tuesday in an attempt to end growing speculation about his position as leader of the Liberal party.He won the vote 48-35. ""The iron laws of arithmetic confirmed my leadership,"" he told reporters on Wednesday when asked about his future. Aside from Mr Dutton, those who offered resignations included three senior ministers in Mr Turnbull's 23-member cabinet, Australian media reported. Peter Dutton has said he could still have a chance at taking the leadership from Mr Turnbull Mr Turnbull accepted Mr Dutton's resignation and that of International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. He confirmed he had asked eight ministers to stay on in his ministry despite their offers to stand down, a decision he said aimed to ""maintain the stability of the government of Australia"". The opposition Labor party accused the government of being in ""chaos"". The under-pressure PM has now withdrawn two major policies, admitting defeat over a company tax plan on Wednesday. He had earlier abandoned a key commitment to set an emissions reduction target in law, in an attempt to ward off party conflict. Many Australians online have responded to the battle in Canberra with a sense of frustration and dismay. Labor tried to move a motion of no confidence against the prime minister in parliament on Tuesday. ""While chaos reigns, the country is not governed,"" Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek said. Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament. Over the past decade, Australian politics has been marked by a series of leadership coups, with three sitting prime ministers deposed by party rivals within their first terms.

Murder charge in missing Iowa jogger case,"Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, has been charged with murder in the first degree A man has been charged with murder in connection with the disappearance of missing Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts, police say. Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, is in the US illegally, authorities say. Remains believed to be Ms Tibbetts' were earlier found in a cornfield near her hometown of Brooklyn. The 20-year-old University of Iowa student went missing on 18 July while dog-sitting at the home of her boyfriend and his brother. She was last seen by neighbours on a run. Her family reported her missing the next day when she did not arrive at work. Iowa Division of Criminal Investigations special agent Rick Rahn said in a press conference Mr Rivera is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Mr Rivera allegedly saw Ms Tibbetts running and followed her before he says he ""blacked out"". ""I can't speak about the motive,"" Mr Rahn told reporters. ""I can just tell you that it seemed that he followed her, seemed to be drawn to her on that particular day, for whatever reason he chose to abduct her."" Mr Rahn said Mr Rivera was ""very compliant"" and willing to talk, and said that he led police to her body. An arrest warrant saysMr Rivera is charged with murder in the first degree,external. He would receive a mandatory life sentence if convicted. The University of Iowa student has been missing for more than a month Authorities were led to the body in the early hours of 21 August, in a cornfield in Poweshiek County - which includes Ms Tibbetts' Brooklyn hometown. The body had corn stalks placed on top of it, Mr Rahn told reporters. A surveillance video of Ms Tibbetts jogging, and of Mr Rivera's car, helped authorities track the suspect down, he said. Police received more than 4,000 tips during their 34-day investigation. Investigators had previously used social media and Fitbit data in an effort to trace her. After the arrest, President Donald Trump told an audience at a rally in West Virginia the crime ""should have never happened"". ""You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico,"" he told the crowd. ""And you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman."" Mr Trump called on his fellow Republicans to sweep the midterm elections in November in order to strengthen immigration laws. Both of Iowa's Republican senators urged Congress to pass a law requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take custody of any undocumented migrant who is charged with a crime that results in serious injury or death. ""No family should ever have to endure such a tragedy, especially one that could have been prevented,"" said Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst. ""Too many Iowans have been lost at the hands of criminals who broke our immigration laws. We cannot allow these tragedies to continue,"" they added. Republican Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said in a statement: ""We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can to bring justice to Mollie's killer.""

Is India ready to send someone to space?,"India's ""monster rocket"" carried a huge satellite into space in 2017 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that India will carry out a manned space flight by 2022.  Science writer Pallava Bagla asks whether the country's space agency can pick up the gauntlet. Scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) reckon they will need $1.28bn (Â£1.01bn) to fulfil Mr Modi's challenge - and they think they can launch the flight within 40 months. There are many reasons why they believe it can be done. They hope to use the country's heaviest rocket - the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III or GSLV Mk-III - for the space flight. Four reasons India is going big on space Inequality in India can be seen from outer space This 640-tonne, 43-metre tall rocket was launched successfully in 2017. The coverage of the launch was euphoric, and often colourful, with websites comparing the rocket to the weight of 200 elephants or five jumbo jets. This rocket can launch 10 tonnes of payload into low-Earth orbit- an altitude of 2,000km (1,200 miles) or less above the planet - which is more than enough to send a crew into space, say scientists. With some modifications, the launch pad from a site off the Bay of Bengal can easily be used to launch astronauts, they say. The author in a locally developed a space suit for the astronauts The space agency carried out a successful ""pad abort test"" in July which saw a test vehicle - carrying no humans, only a dummy - hurled skywards by a set of powerful in-built thrusters. The demonstration simulated what would happen to the crew ship in the event of a rocket failure on the launch pad. Indian scientists have also developed light weight silicon tiles that can resist getting burnt and will be used to coat the outside of the space vehicle. (When a spacecraft comes back into the Earth's atmosphere it faces roasting temperatures above 1,000C due to friction.) An Ahmedabad-based laboratory has already developed a space suit for the astronauts. The biggest challenge, according to scientists, will be to train the astronauts and to develop the necessary life support system to keep them alive in space. ""The astronaut programme will not only bolster national pride, it will also galvanise the youth to take up a career in science,"" Isro chairman and well-known rocket scientist, K Sivan, told me. Dr Sivan says that since India still does not have the full capability of training astronauts, ""expertise of other agencies"" could be sought to keep to the deadline. Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian to travel into space in 1984 in a Soviet rocket, says a manned space flight is a ""natural corollary of every space programme that has attained a level of maturity - a coming of age, if you will."" To date Russia, the US and China have sent astronauts into space.  If India can achieve this, it will become the fourth country to launch humans into space. But there are some scientists who believe the goal of the space mission is misplaced. The women scientists who took India into space ""Sending Indians into space is the most silly and idiotic idea, especially 50 years after Neil Armstrong first landed on the moon,"" veteran space scientist V Siddhartha says. Armstrong, who died in 2012, set foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969, famously describing the event as ""one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"". Mr Siddhartha says robotic missions can now do many things that astronauts do, without the risk of sending humans into space. Dr Sivan counters this by saying that there are still many tasks only human intelligence can perform. He adds that India seeks to build up its own capabilities to launch Indians into space. ""If colonies have to be set up outside Earth for the human civilisation, how can India, one of the oldest civilisations, be left behind and wanting,"" he said. The rocket carrying 104 satellites was launched from the Sriharikota space centre in 2017 Professor K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific adviser to the federal government, told me India has the ""perfect technology and cultural environment"" for the mission. In the past, Isro has always delivered on the challenges that have been thrown at them. In 2014, India successfully put a satellite into orbit around Mars, becoming the fourth nation or geo-bloc to do so. The mission cost $67m, which, by Western standards, was staggeringly cheap. Earlier, in 2009, the inaugural moon mission Chandrayaan-1 became the first and the most detailed search for water on the Moon using radars. And in 2017, India created history by successfully launching 104 satellites on a single mission, overtaking the previous record of 37 satellites launched by Russia in 2014. ""Failure is not an option,"" says Dr Sivan. ""Team Isro will rise to the challenge to make sure that an Indian is launched into space by 2022.""

Australian Muslims pray for rain at Eid,"Thousands showed up at the Eid event in western Sydney About 30,000 Australian Muslims gathered in Sydney on Tuesday to pray for an end to what's been called the worst drought in living memory. Worshippers from 16 mosques came together ""in a show of solidarity and unity"" with farmers and others affected by the drought. The event took place to mark Eid al-Adha, also known as the Festival of Sacrifice. A fundraising campaign is also being held for affected farmers. Living with the strain of a devastating drought Australia's drought seen from the air The event was organised by the Lebanese Muslim Association (LMA) at the Lakemba Mosque in western Sydney. ""As one Australian family, we all need to do our part and stand in solidarity with those who are in need,"" said Samier Dandan, the president of the LMA. ""It is now our time to be united and extend our hands in friendship to those who are now suffering."" The rain prayers were held at the Lakemba mosque in western Sydney Ahmad Malas, director of the LMA, told the BBC that the atmosphere at the event was ""very positive"". He said rain prayers are often said during times of drought. Eid al-Adha runs from 21-25 August this year andremembers the prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son when God ordered him to. What is Eid al-Adha? Why are there two Eids? Parts of Australia are struggling with extreme drought conditions,with all of New South Wales (NSW) - the most populous state - declared to be drought-affected. Farmers in several states are finding it hard to keep their animals fed More than half of neighbouring Queensland is also in drought while parts of Victoria and South Australia are also experiencing dry conditions. Farmers have been especially badly hit by severe water shortages, leading to crops and them being unable to feed livestock.

Facebook and Twitter expose fake accounts,"Facebook and Twitter say they have removed or suspended hundreds of accounts Facebook and Twitter say they have suspended or removed accounts linked to Iran and Russia over ""inauthentic"" or ""manipulating"" behaviour. More than 650 Facebook pages and groups were said to have been identified as ""misleading"", according to founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Meanwhile Twitter said it suspended 284 accounts with apparent links to Iran. It comes a day after Microsoft said it had thwarted Russian cyber-attacks against US conservative groups. On Tuesday,Facebook said it had discovered multiple accounts that displayed ""inauthentic behaviour"",externallinked to campaigns that originated in Iran and Russia following investigations that spanned ""many months"".

Trump relaxes rules around cyber-attacks US accuses Russia of 'pervasive' meddling Although the investigation was still in progress, the social media network added, the campaign appeared to be targeting people across multiple internet services in the Middle East, Latin America, the UK and the US. The social media companies acted on a tip from cyber security firm FireEye, which revealed what it said were a number of accounts promoting Iranian propaganda. Facebook then reportedly linked the accounts - including 76 Instagram pages - to Iranian state media, according to the company statement. It added that further ""misleading behaviour"" was also traced to Russia, but that the activity did not appear to be linked to the Iranian campaign it had uncovered. Some of the campaigns, which date back to 2011, featured content about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi. The accounts also shared content about politics in the UK and the US in English, Facebook said. Other accounts that linked to sources previously identified by the US government as Russian military intelligence services were also removed from the site. The company added that it had shared the findings of its investigations with the US and UK governments. Twitter, meanwhile, said its analysis of numerous accounts pointed towards ""co-ordinated manipulation"".

Uber to pay $1.9m for harassment claims,"Uber is close to reaching a final settlement relating to several sexual harassment and discrimination claims. The firm will pay $1.9m (Â£1.5m) to 56 current and former workers who claim they were victims of sexual harassment, or about $34,000 each. They will also get nearly $11,000 each as part of a class action involving 485 people who claimed discrimination. The details on claimant numbers were contained in court documentsfirst reported by Bloomberg,external. The payouts will be part of the ride-hailing company's total settlement of $10m agreed in March. The US-based class action case is being led by two Latina engineers who allege they were paid less than their white, Asian and male colleagues. The pair filed their legal claim against Uber in October 2017, claiming they suffered harassment and a hostile work environment due to their gender and ethnicity. However, before the payouts can be made the settlement needs to get court approval and members of the class action have a right to object. Uber investigated over gender discrimination Uber executive resigns after race discrimination probe New York votes to cap Uber and Lyft services No one has objected and only two people have dropped out of the process. Uber said it agreed with the plaintiff's motion, and that the amounts it would have to pay out were ""fair, reasonable, and adequate"". Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer who negotiated the settlement on behalf of the employees, said his legal firm was ""happy that the settlement approval process is progressing as planned"". ""So [once it is approved] we can pay class members for these discrimination and harassment claims and begin the three-year effort to monitor Uber's implementation of the HR improvements,"" he added. In addition to the legal case, Uber is beinginvestigated by US authorities for gender discrimination. Last month,Uber's head of human resources Liane Hornsey resignedfollowing an internal investigation into how she handled racial discrimination claims within the company. A hearing to make final approval of the settlement is due to be heard by a California court in November. The harassment and discrimination claims are among a string of issues that Uber's management has faced in the past year. While some of the company's issues have been resolved, they includelosing its licence to operate in Londonand a lawsuit in the US filed by a woman who accused Uber executives of improperly obtaining her medical records aftershe was raped by a driver in India.

Venezuela 'paralysed' by new currency,"This video can not be played Venezuelans are fleeing political instability and hyper inflation Venezuela came to a standstill on Tuesday as the country tried to deal with its newly introduced currency. Thousands of businesses closed in order to adapt to the ""sovereign bolivar"", and many workers stayed at home. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro launched the new banknotes on Monday, revaluing and renaming the old bolivar currency. The government says this will tackle runaway inflation, but critics say it could make the crisis worse. The notes went into circulation on Tuesday. President Maduro had declared Monday to be a bank holiday. Confusion over Venezuela's economic plan Venezuela crisis: How did we get here? By Will Grant, BBC Latin America correspondent Much of Caracas is eerily empty for a working day. Some in the opposition called for a strike but many people are simply staying at home out of uncertainty, too concerned about what the new currency will mean for the embattled nation to venture out. The result is that Venezuela is, in essence, a paralysed country. Confusion reigns in the oil-rich nation and, historically, such moments in Venezuela can be extremely volatile. As yet, there are no reports of significant protests or violence, but there is an increased deployment of the security forces across the country for the roll out of the new bolivar. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has said the measure will be the saviour of the economy and tackle the spiralling hyper-inflation. Ordinary people however, simply don't believe him and are concerned for the future, putting even greater pressure on neighbouring countries struggling to deal with the exodus of millions of Venezuelans. The new currency lops five zeroes off the old ""strong bolivar"" - meaning a cup of coffee worth 2.5m strong bolivars in the capital Caracas last month now costs 25 sovereign bolivars. However, people in Caracas told the BBC they were restricted to withdrawing only 10 sovereign bolivars on Tuesday from cash machines. The new sovereign bolivar was introduced in a bid to tackle hyperinflation Separately on Tuesday, Venezuela was shaken by a powerful earthquake along its northern coastal region that was felt in Caracas, where many of the city's buildings were evacuated. US seismologists reported a magnitude 7 quake with an epicentre in the east of Venezuela, while the Venezuelan authorities recorded a magnitude 6.3 quake. Eyewitnesses in the coastal town of Cumana described residents rushing into the streets, according to Reuters news agency. No casualties were reported. Earlier, cities across Venezuela were virtually deserted as people struggled to get hold of the country's new banknotes. Venezuela's black market in dollars was even frozen by the currency shift amid confusion and economic uncertainty. The government announced several other key economic changes to accompany the new notes, including raising the minimum wage by 34 times its previous level from 1 September, raising VAT andcutting generous fuel subsidies. President Maduro also said the sovereign bolivar would be tied to the petro, a virtual currency the government says is linked to Venezuela's oil reserves. But the US has banned its citizens from trading in it, and one cryptocurrency site, ICOindex.com, has even labelled the petro ""a scam"". ""Anchoring the bolivar to the petro is anchoring it to nothing,"" economist Luis Vicente LeÃ³n told AFP news agency. Can Venezuela halt hyperinflation?

Salary question blamed for gender pay gap,"The practice of many firms of asking job applicants what they currently earn is partly to blame for trapping women on low pay, a charity has said. The ""salary question"" means women underpaid in their current job are more likely to be underpaid in the next one, the Young Women's Trust charity said. It said including salary details in job adverts instead would help close the gender pay gap between men and women. The CBI warned the move could have ""unintended consequences"". A spokesperson for the employers' organisation said: ""Closing the gender pay gap is complex. Publishing pay bands on job adverts is good practice, but banning conversations about pay isn't the best solution and could have unintended consequences."" The CBI said issues such as the availability of affordable childcare and careers advice were also important factors in closing the gender pay gap. What is the gender pay gap? Nine ways to narrow the gender pay gap Why do some job adverts put women off applying? Asking applicants about previous or current pay has already been banned in New York and California. The Young Women's Trust, a charity that supports young women on low or no pay, says that, other than in exceptional circumstances, UK organisations should follow suit. Large firms had to publish their gender pay gap for the first time this year The government this year introduced a requirement that UK companies with 250 or more employees must publish their gender pay gap data. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Across the UK, men earned 18.4% more than women in April 2017, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS). The Young Women's Trust commissioned a YouGov poll which found that nearly half of advertised jobs did not include any wage details with the practice most common in the private sector. The charity says that making pay more transparent would make it harder for employers to, even unintentionally, pay men and women different amounts for similar roles. The Women's Trust says many employers agree that organisations should publish salary details for all roles to increase transparency, with some saying it is best practice as it encourages more applicants. In the charity's survey 48% of employers were in favour of the measure to bring about gender equality in the workplace. Its chief executive, Carole Easton, said: ""We have to break the cycle that traps women in low pay. Women often start work on a lower salary than men, move to a new job and are paid based on their previous wage, as opposed to what they or the role are worth - so they continue to be paid less."" She said that their research showed women were more likely to disregard jobs if they felt their skills didn't match up to them, whereas men would often apply anyway. Including salary details in job adverts would help women to see that jobs are in fact at their level and give them an idea of where they should be negotiating from to progress their pay, Ms Easton added. The charity's analysis of Office for National Statistics data found that women lose out on nearly Â£140bn a year in total due to the full-time gender pay gap. Well over three-quarters of UK firms pay their male staff more than their female workers. Why do some job adverts put women off applying?

"Bank scam victims 'shouldn't be blamed'Banks have been told it's ""not fair"" to automatically blame customers for money lost through a scam.Business","Banks have been warned that it's ""not fair"" to automatically blame customers for money lost through a scam. Last year, customers transferred nearly Â£240m to fraudsters, only a quarter of which was refunded by financial firms. The Financial Ombudsman service said fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were due to customer carelessness. The service, which resolves customer disputes, said victims who lost money had a good chance of being reimbursed. ""It's not fair to automatically call a customer grossly negligent simply because they've fallen for a scam. ""That's especially true in light of the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems - and convince customers that their money is at risk,"" said Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman and chief executive of the Financial Ombudsman Service. She said when a customer had fallen for a fraud or a scam, typically both they and the bank denied they had done anything wrong. One customer called Brian contacted the Ombudsman service after his bank refused to refund him Â£7,000 in a text message scam. Brian received a message he thought was from his bank and unwittingly gave out his security details and passcodes. As a result, the bank said he had been grossly negligent and refused to refund the money. After reviewing the details, the Ombudsman decided it was a sophisticated fraud, and that the fraudsters had gained Brian's trust and therefore his actions were reasonable. They forced the bank to reimburse Brian's Â£7,000. Another fraud victim called Jas contacted the Ombudsman over several large withdrawals on her monthly statement which she didn't recognise. The bank said she must have made them herself or given someone her pin number. The Ombudsman found her account of what happened and the details about where she kept her card ""consistent and plausible"". The bank was forced to refund the disputed transactions because the Ombudsman said the bank had also failed to show Jas had been grossly negligent. 'Scammers struck as my mum was dying' Ms Wayman said there was ""a very high bar"" for banks to prove customers had been ""grossly negligent"", meaning the banks were not liable for the money their customer had lost. ""If they can't do that, it's likely we'll tell them to cover the money their customer has lost,"" she said. Examples of the tactics used by fraudsters including creating fake websites which look identical to banks' online systems - or text messages which look like they're from someone's bank.

Man posed as ghost of ex-fiancÃÂ©e's mum,"Roy Meadwell was trying to reconnect with his ex-fiancÃ©e A man who posed as his ex-fiancÃ©e's dead mother in a bid to win her back has been sentenced. Roy Meadwell, 51, from Yeovil, broke the terms of a restraining order when he sent Kay Wimbury a letter pretending to be the ghost of her mother. The letter told Ms Wimbury she had made a ""terrible mistake"" in rejecting Meadwell and added ""all you have to do is call him"", Exeter Crown Court heard. He was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for two years. Meadwell had been banned from contacting Ms Wimbury after assaulting her in December 2016. He was also banned from entering Cornwall - where she lived - by the restraining order, but visited the county on four occasions. In July 2017, he went to the Willow Moon psychic shop in Cornwall for a consultation, and took a leaflet which he included in the anonymous letter. The letter did not name Meadwell but spoke of ""the man who sacrificed everything for you"" and urged her ""all you have to do is to call him"". Another anonymous message, supposedly from a well wisher, but sent by Meadwell, said ""OMG, can't you see the greatness in this man"". Ms Wimbury told the jury she knew the letters came from Meadwell because they contained details of their life together that only he knew, including a reference to a Christmas ornament which she had been left by her mother, and fixed by Meadwell. Recorder Martin Meeke, QC, told Meadwell: ""This sentence is suspended for two years and it is designed to have the Sword of Damocles hanging over you for as long as I can. ""The restraining order is still in force and if you contact Kay Wimbury again you will go straight inside.""

Puppy sales at pet shops to be banned,"Pet shops and dealers in England will be banned from selling puppies and kittens under government plans. The proposals,which have gone out to consultation,external, will mean those wanting to buy or adopt a pet less than six months old will have to go to the breeder or a rescue centre. A ban on licensed sellers dealing in dogs and cats less than eight weeks old is already coming in on 1 October. Campaigners welcomed the announcement, but warned of ""potential loopholes"". The ban aims to reduce the health problems associated which emerge when animals are reared in poor conditions. It is a victory for the Lucy's Law campaign, which has been calling for the ban to be implemented. The campaign was named after a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who was badly treated in the puppy farming system. Lucy was rescued in 2013 at five years old from a Welsh puppy farm. She had a series of health problems, including a curved spine as a result of being kept in a cramped cage, and epilepsy. She died in 2016. Allow Facebook content?

TV vet Marc Abraham, who launched the campaign for Lucy's Law, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Lucy's Law will make all breeders and puppy farms ""completely transparent and accountable"" which ""completely raises the stakes for animal welfare"". ""There's nowhere to hide, a pet shop can't blame the breeder and the breeder can't blame the pet shop,"" he said. ""Everyone selling is accountable so this is a very exciting time for animal welfare."" He said Lucy was a ""beautiful little soul"" whose condition when she was rescued was ""so heartbreaking"". ""Lisa Garner, her owner, rehabilitated her and popped her in the hands of various celebrities and got this huge social media following and helped raised awareness about not only puppy farming, but rescue dog adoption,"" he said. ""Then she sadly passed away and succumbed to all her injuries in December 2016. ""We launched Lucy's Law a year after her passing as a tribute to her and all the breeding dogs that are hidden from the public."" The Mayhew Animal Home charity has previously highlighted the case of Luna, a Jack Russell terrier who was sold online despite being ill with a suspected skin disease. At six weeks old, Luna was already under the legal age required for puppies to be sold - but the seller claimed the young dog was 10 weeks old. Jack Russell terrier Luna was illegally sold underage online In another case, the Dogs Trust said a French bulldog called Lola was forced to travel from eastern Europe so her puppies could be born and sold in the UK at a higher price. Two of her puppies later died. Paula Boyden, from the Dogs Trust, welcomed the ban but warned ""potential loopholes"" needed to be closed off for it to be successful. She said there should be additional measures including regulating re-homing organisations. Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club secretary, said the ban would ""stop the suffering of many dogs and send a very strong message to puppy buyers that it is never OK to see a puppy in any environment other than the one it was born and raised in, and with its mum"". Chris Wainwright, deputy chief executive of the RSPCA, told BBC News that a ban was ""overdue"" and said he hoped it would raise welfare standards. ""We've had this explosion in this market with loads of rogue traders, lots of rogue dealers and it's meant the public are often unsuspecting. They think they're buying from a reputable breeder, actually they're buying from a middle person,"" he said. ""It means the breeders aren't getting the scrutiny on their premises because they're passing these dogs off to third parties and it often leaves families with sick animals and the tragedy of that occurs."" Queen guitarist Brian May, who supports the Lucy's Law campaign, said it was ""a day for celebration"". The Pet Industry Federation said puppy farms should be closed down but added there were concerns that an outright ban on third party sales would lead to sales ""going underground"". Other rules already coming into force on 1 October include a requirement for any licensed pet seller to include their licence number in the advert as well as identifying the local authority that issued it and for breeders to show puppies alongside their mother before a sale is made. In Wales,campaigners have also called for Lucy's Lawand the government has said it would ""investigate the potential banning of third party sales"". Legislation it introduced in 2014 requires all dog breeders to apply for a licence. In Scotland, a members' bill to end puppy farmingwas introduced in May.

Venezuela 'paralysed' by new currencyBusinesses close and streets empty as President Maduro's new currency causes uncertainty.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Venezuelans are fleeing political instability and hyper inflation Venezuela came to a standstill on Tuesday as the country tried to deal with its newly introduced currency. Thousands of businesses closed in order to adapt to the ""sovereign bolivar"", and many workers stayed at home. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro launched the new banknotes on Monday, revaluing and renaming the old bolivar currency. The government says this will tackle runaway inflation, but critics say it could make the crisis worse. The notes went into circulation on Tuesday. President Maduro had declared Monday to be a bank holiday. Confusion over Venezuela's economic plan Venezuela crisis: How did we get here? By Will Grant, BBC Latin America correspondent Much of Caracas is eerily empty for a working day. Some in the opposition called for a strike but many people are simply staying at home out of uncertainty, too concerned about what the new currency will mean for the embattled nation to venture out. The result is that Venezuela is, in essence, a paralysed country. Confusion reigns in the oil-rich nation and, historically, such moments in Venezuela can be extremely volatile. As yet, there are no reports of significant protests or violence, but there is an increased deployment of the security forces across the country for the roll out of the new bolivar. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has said the measure will be the saviour of the economy and tackle the spiralling hyper-inflation. Ordinary people however, simply don't believe him and are concerned for the future, putting even greater pressure on neighbouring countries struggling to deal with the exodus of millions of Venezuelans. The new currency lops five zeroes off the old ""strong bolivar"" - meaning a cup of coffee worth 2.5m strong bolivars in the capital Caracas last month now costs 25 sovereign bolivars. However, people in Caracas told the BBC they were restricted to withdrawing only 10 sovereign bolivars on Tuesday from cash machines. The new sovereign bolivar was introduced in a bid to tackle hyperinflation Separately on Tuesday, Venezuela was shaken by a powerful earthquake along its northern coastal region that was felt in Caracas, where many of the city's buildings were evacuated. US seismologists reported a magnitude 7 quake with an epicentre in the east of Venezuela, while the Venezuelan authorities recorded a magnitude 6.3 quake. Eyewitnesses in the coastal town of Cumana described residents rushing into the streets, according to Reuters news agency. No casualties were reported. Earlier, cities across Venezuela were virtually deserted as people struggled to get hold of the country's new banknotes. Venezuela's black market in dollars was even frozen by the currency shift amid confusion and economic uncertainty. The government announced several other key economic changes to accompany the new notes, including raising the minimum wage by 34 times its previous level from 1 September, raising VAT andcutting generous fuel subsidies. President Maduro also said the sovereign bolivar would be tied to the petro, a virtual currency the government says is linked to Venezuela's oil reserves. But the US has banned its citizens from trading in it, and one cryptocurrency site, ICOindex.com, has even labelled the petro ""a scam"". ""Anchoring the bolivar to the petro is anchoring it to nothing,"" economist Luis Vicente LeÃ³n told AFP news agency. Can Venezuela halt hyperinflation?

"EU residents will not be 'turfed out'Dominic Raab says the UK has a ""moral obligation"" to people whether there is a Brexit deal or not.UK Politics","This video can not be played Dominic Raab is asked about what no Brexit deal would mean for EU nationals living in the UK The UK will ""move swiftly"" to safeguard the future of EU citizens in the event of no deal being agreed, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said. After talks in Brussels, he told the BBC the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to people and it was ""inconceivable"" they would be ""turfed out"". The EU, he said, must match the UK's ""ambition and pragmatism"" if the gaps between them were to be overcome. Counterpart Michel Barnier warned of a ""blame game"" over a no deal outcome. Mr Barnier said fundamental disagreements remained on future economic issues and the EU would not abandon its principles when it came to the integrity of the single market. The two sides have agreed that talks will continue without interruption to try to secure a deal in advance of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019. Mr Barnier indicated a deal may be pushed back until early November. Government to publish no-deal Brexit advice NHS 'not prepared' for no-deal Brexit In recent weeks there has been an increasing focus on the possibility of no deal being reached, and on Thursday the government is to publish a series of technical notices aimed at preparing for this scenario. Mr Raab dismissed what he said were ""hair-raising scare stories"", promising Thursday's documents would provide clarity. Asked whether the UK would guarantee the future of EU workers if there was no deal, Mr Raab said in the ""unlikely eventuality"" that this happened, the UK would ""move swiftly to secure their position"". ""We hugely value the contribution of EU citizens here in the UK and I am confident that in the unlikely eventuality that we don't have a deal, we will move swiftly to secure their position,"" he said. Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier will hold more talks next week ""It is inconceivable we would do anything other than make sure that they are legally in a position where they're secure to stay,"" he said, adding that ""we are talking about real people...and we have got a moral obligation"". He added: ""There's no question that we're going to see EU citizens turfed out. We've made that clear in the past. I've made that clear in the past, I'm happy to give that reassurance today."" Mr Raab told the BBC that the two sides needed to ""step up the ante"" and he would be returning to Brussels next week to ensure momentum was not lost. He said a ""workable solution"" was needed to address the concerns of communities on both sides of the Irish border. At a press conference earlier, the EU's negotiator said his goal was to strike a future partnership of ""unprecedented"" scope with the UK. But he warned progress on trade and economic co-operation lagged behind that on security and defence issues and said the EU would not compromise the integrity of the single market. Mr Barnier said the question of the Irish border must be ""de-dramatised"" with the onus on both sides to make clear ""which controls are needed where and how this should be done"". He added: ""Our challenge for the coming weeks is to try and define an ambitious partnership between the UK and the EU - a partnership that has no precedent. ""This partnership has to respect the single market and the foundations of the European project, and if this is well understood we can conclude the negotiations successfully.""

Ryanair compensation cheques 'bounced'Passengers say they have been charged fees by their banks after cheques from airline were unsigned.England,"Ryanair sent unsigned compensation cheques to customers meaning they could not be banked Ryanair passengers who have received compensation for cancelled and delayed flights have been charged extra fees after banks rejected the cheques. The airline said up to 190 customers were sent unsigned cheques, out of a batch of 20,000. One passenger, who waited 11 months for compensation, said she was now worse off after the bank added a fee of 20 euros (Â£17.94). Ryanair has apologised and blamed the problem on an ""administrative error"". Since April, more than one million Ryanair passengers in Europe have had delayed or cancelled flights, according to the airline's own figures. The latest one-day pilots' walk-out on 10 August led to the cancellation of nearly 400 flights. Ryanair, which is Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has blamed other delays on bad weather or air traffic control shortages. Ryanair has experienced a summer of disruption in Europe The Civil Aviation Authority recently stepped into advise passengers caught up in strikes that they should apply for compensation. Known as EU261, compensation is set at 250 euros (Â£224) for flights of up to 1,500km (932 miles), and 400 euros (Â£358) for longer flights in Europe and North Africa. Businessman Gordon Fong received Â£440 after his flight home from Spain in June was first diverted and then landed at a different UK airport, leaving him with a 150-mile taxi journey to his home in Bournemouth. ""But when I received the cheque there was no signature,"" he said. ""I took time off work to drive to the bank but was told by the teller I couldn't use it. I had to go back to the website to try and get them to respond and send a new cheque, but I still haven't had a reply."" The BBC has spoken to 10 other people who said their compensation from Ryanair had been refused by the bank. Karen and John Joyce waited 11 months for compensation from Ryanair Karen Joyce, 50, said she spent 11 months waiting for compensation from Ryanair after her 25th wedding anniversary holiday flight was cancelled in September. Ryanair paid part of her claim but when she went to cash a second cheque it was returned by the bank - along with a 20 euro (Â£17.94) fee ""I was totally dumbstruck. We were loyal Ryanair customers and for them to bounce the cheque as well I just thought was disgusting,"" she said. When Mrs Joyce, from Manchester, contacted Ryanair, she spent 20 minutes on the phone to a customer service representative. ""Then he just put the phone down,"" she said. ""I have not received anything from Ryanair."" In a statement, Ryanair said ""a very small number of cheques"" processed in July were issued without a required signatory ""due to an administrative error"". It said the cheques had been ""re-issued to customers along with a letter of explanation"" on 15 August. ""We apologise again for any inconvenience caused to customers,"" the airline added. Ryanair cancels flights as pilots walk out No compensation for cancelled flights Ryanair passengers may claim compensation Ryanair also said customers whose flights were cancelled ""were either refunded or re-accommodated on to alternative flights and we process all valid EU261 compensation claims within 10 working days"". ""Ryanair complies fully with EU261 legislation, under which no compensation is payable to customers when the (strike) delay/cancellation is beyond the airline's control. ""If these strikes, by a tiny minority of Ryanair pilots, were within Ryanair's control, there would have been no strikes and no cancellations."" A series of summer strikes by Ryanair pilots have caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled Ryanair is in dispute with pilots in five countries. Its financial report shows that in the last year it has paid out 25m euros (Â£22.4m) in EU261 compensation claims arising from the disruption of its timetable last autumn. The report says EU261 costs increased as ""passengers have a higher propensity to claim than in prior years"". Last year, Ryanair made profits of Â£1.3bn after tax. It carried 130 million passengers in 2017.

"Pope's message ahead of Ireland visitPope Francis hopes his visit will ""further the growth of unity and reconciliation"" among all Christians.Europe","The Pope has released a video message ahead of his trip to Ireland Pope Francis has expressed hope his visit to the Republic of Ireland will ""further the growth of unity and reconciliation"" among all Christians. In a video message to mark the start of the World Meeting of Families,external, he said he was ""excited at the thought of returning to Ireland"". Pope Francis' 36-hour visit begins on Saturday and coincides with the global gathering of the Catholic Church. Catholic cathedrals marked the launch by ringing bells on Tuesday evening. The World Meeting of Families,externalis held every three years, with thousands of people from across the world attending. It is the first time the event has been held in Ireland. In his message, the pontiff sent a ""warm word of greeting to all the Irish people"". ""Although the specific reason for my visit to Ireland is the World Meeting of Families, I would like to include all the members of the Irish family,"" he said. ""In a particular way, I pray that it may further the growth of unity and reconciliation among all Christ's followers, as a sign of that lasting peace which is God's dream for our whole human family.""

Loaves to loos: Pope Francis' visit in numbers 'Lollipopes' to bunting: The Papal products flying off the shelves On the bus: Remembering Pope John Paul II's 1979 visit The video was released hours after it was confirmed that the Popewould meet victims of clerical sex abuse during his Irish visit. The Vatican said the meeting would not be announced until after it was over and that it would be up to victims if they wanted to speak afterwards. The head of the Catholic Church has condemned the ""atrocities"" of child sex abuse by clerics and cover-ups in the Church. He publisheda letter to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics on Monday, addressing failures to deal with abuse and calling for an end to the ""culture of death"".

Some of the memorabilia on sale at the RDS Arena in Dublin Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill has said she will no longer be attending an address in Dublin Castle or the Phoenix Park Mass due to her ""broken leg and restricted mobility"". She said the Pope's visit was a ""significant event for all of the Irish people"" and that she would be listening ""with acute interest"" to what he had to say on a range of issues. ""We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover-ups,"" she said. ""The visit of Pope Francis is an opportunity to address these issues, to meet with victims and survivors, to fully acknowledge their suffering and the damage done, to end the cover-ups and to commit to full redress, north and south."" Last week, Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster saidshe would be away with her family on holiday during the papal visit.
