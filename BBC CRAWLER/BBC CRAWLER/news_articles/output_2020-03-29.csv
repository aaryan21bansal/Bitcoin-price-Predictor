"Trump extends virus restrictions beyond EasterThe US president extends measures to 30 April, saying casualties are likely to peak in two weeks.","This video can not be played ""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won"" President Donald Trump has said federal coronavirus guidelines such as social distancing will be extended across the US until at least 30 April. He had previously suggested that they could be relaxedas early as Easter, which falls in mid-April. ""The highest point of the death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,"" Mr Trump said. He appeared to be referring to peak infection rates that experts fear could overwhelm hospitals. White House medical adviserDr Anthony Faucihad earlier warned thatthe virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans. Dr Fauci said that it was ""entirely conceivable"" that millions of Americans could eventually be infected. Live: Our rolling coronavirus coverage Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US now has more than 153,000 confirmed cases. As of Monday afternoon, 2,828 deaths had been recorded in the country in relation to Covid-19, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking during the White House coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump called social distancing measures ""the way you win"", adding that the US ""will be well on our way to recovery"" by June. Suggesting that the ""peak"" of death rates in the US was likely to hit in two weeks, Mr Trump said that ""nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won - that would be the greatest loss of all"". Analysts suggest that when Mr Trump referred to a peak in the ""death rate"", he probably meant the total number of recorded infections. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak He said the decision to extend social distancing was made after he heard that ""2.2 million people could have died if we didn't go through with all of this"", adding that if the death toll could be restricted to less than 100,000 ""we all together have done a very good job"". Mr Trump had previously said that Easter - 10-13 April - would be a ""beautiful time"" to be able to open at least some sections of the country. On Sunday he said that lifting restrictions at Easter was ""just an aspiration"". ""I wish we could have our old life back... but we're working very hard, that's all I know."" He said that ""rapid testing"" had been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes, and that doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers would get them. Earlier tweets, Mr Trump touted a New York Times article which called the president's daily briefings a ""ratings hit"". However, he claimed in his briefing the ratings figures ""don't matter to me"". ""What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible"" he said. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death Nationwide measures mean citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. A field hospital has been built in Central Park as New York City deals with more than 33,000 cases On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were instructed not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (Â£200-Â£400). In California, a ""shelter in place"" order remains. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of ""hoarding"" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. ""We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,"" he said. Hospitals ""can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"", he said, alleging that some were ""stocked up"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues as it attacks the lungs, and ventilators help to keep patients breathing. More than 33,000 people are now confirmed to have died worldwide after being infected with the new coronavirus.

Manufacturers cast doubt on ventilator target,"The UK may not have all the ventilators it needs by the time coronavirus cases in the country reach their peak, engineering firms warned. Health officials expect the UK to experience its highest number of infections in around two weeks' time. The UK has just over 8,000 ventilators, significantly fewer than the 30,000 the government estimates are needed to cope with the fallout from the peak. Manufacturers told the BBC they cannot produce enough to meet that deadline. However, one firm involved in the plans to produce the life-saving machines, said that by early May the country would be ""in a much better position"". There is widespread uncertainty within government and industry about how many ventilators it is possible to produce, which firms can make them and by when. UK 'wasting time' on NHS protective gear orders What are ventilators and why are they important? UK wary of international market for ventilators Dyson has received an order for 10,000 units, pending regulatory approval. The firm, headed by British inventor Sir James Dyson, has drawn up its design from scratch in collaboration with Cambridge-based medical firm The Technology Partnership. Dyson has said it is hopeful its design would be approved within days, which would allow it to begin production within two weeks. However, there has since been doubt cast on whether that timescale for approval was realistic. Another consortium including engineering firms Airbus, GKN, Rolls Royce, Megitt and others are working on ramping up production of a simplified design based on existing technology from medical ventilator specialist firms Penlon and Smiths. As well as asking the consortium for help in sourcing parts, it is thought two new manufacturing facilities will be opened - one in the North and one in the South West. However, with so many different firms involved in the consortium, there is also uncertainty about how quickly approval for the design and accelerated production can happen. Separately, the members of the consortium plan to ramp up supplies to firms Penlon and Smiths which already make ventilators. One company told the BBC: ""We are not racing each other, we are racing against the virus."" The urgency of the situation appears to have exposed cracks in collaboration between government departments. The BBC understands that in one instance the Department of Health was unaware that 10,000 ventilators had been ordered from Dyson, despite the order having been placed in a Cabinet Office-headed letter. There has also been confusion about why the UK did not participate in an EU-wide procurement order for tens of thousands of new ventilators. Some Whitehall sources say the invitation to participate languished in the in-tray of more junior Health Department officials until it was too late. Meanwhile, government sources claimed that the programme would not have made a meaningful difference to available equipment because the UK would have been one of 28 countries vying for the new units. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the UK was capable of producing all the units it needed itself. But manufacturers have said the country may not to be able to do so in the timeframe required to face the peak of UK infections. One thing is clear: there is no such thing as ordering too many, from wherever made by whomever. The UK has the same target of 30,000 as the state of New York which has a third of the population of the UK. Consortium members said there was also demand from countries including Kenya and South Africa. So in the unlikely event the government finds itself with a UK surplus, there will be no shortage of overseas buyers. The BBC has approached the government for comment.

University admissions could see emergency controls,"University applications have been caught up in the uncertainty of the coronavirus outbreak Universities in England could face fixed limits on how many students they each recruit, in a bid to create more stability and reduce financial threats. There are concerns that the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus could leave some universities with too few applicants to stay financially viable. It is understood that emergency controls are being considered to stop a free-for-all in student recruitment. But Universities UK said any ""stability measures"" had not yet been decided. ""Financial support from government for universities is necessary,"" said the university group's chief executive Alistair Jarvis. But he said any response such as controls on student numbers would need ""more detailed consideration"" and so far had not been approved by Universities UK. ""There would need to be a clear case of the benefits, any proposal would have to be sector-led not imposed, strictly time-limited and carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences,"" he said. Universities told to stop unconditional offers in coronavirus confusion Teachers to estimate grades after exams cancelled Universities could scrap use of predicted grades A government source described the idea as ""speculation"". But the vice chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, Sir Chris Husbands, said student number controls were necessary during the current crisis ""to ensure that institutions have a viable first-year-student population"". Sir Chris, in a paper for the Higher Education Policy Institute, says ""radical action is needed on university admissions for the foreseeable future. This means suspending the market in admissions"". The aim would be to encourage more stability in an admissions round caught up in the coronavirus outbreak, which has closed schools and universities and cancelled exams. Universities are divided over whether to back student number controls More students than usual might defer entry and take a gap year - with universities uncertain about whether they will be able to re-open campuses for the autumn. Universities are also expecting a fall in overseas student numbers - making funding from home students even more important. Last week the higher education watchdog intervened to stop universities making unconditional offers, after fears that some were recruiting large numbers of students by promising places regardless of their grades. With A-level exams scrapped and grades set to be based on teachers' assessments, the Office for Students and the universities minister Michelle Donelan were concerned that anxious students might switch to the promise of an unconditional offer. But there were also concerns that the volatility around this year's applications could leave some universities with such a shortage of students that it would threaten their financial stability. Universities are understood to remain divided over a response. Introducing student number controls would mean individual universities would not be allowed to expand. This would ensure that the share of students between universities stayed similar to the current levels, providing them with more security over tuition fee income. But student number controls would also mean a limit on student choice - so that popular universities would not be able to add extra places. It will also raise questions about what will happen if universities have offered more places than they will be allowed to provide. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: ""The crisis is fast becoming the catalyst for the return of student number caps."" He warned that it might bring short-term stability, but at the expense of stopping the expansion of university places and limiting the choices of individual students. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the department would ""continue working closely with the sector to manage the impact of coronavirus"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

What we still don't know about the coronavirus,"It feels like an eternity ago, but the world only became aware of the coronavirus in December. Despite incredible efforts by scientists around the world, there is still much we do not understand, and we are all now part of a planet-wide experiment trying to find answers. Here are some of the big outstanding questions. It is one of the most basic questions, but also one of the most crucial. There have been hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases around the world, but this is only a fraction of the total number of infections. And the figures are further confused by an unknown number of asymptomatic cases - people who have the virus but don't feel ill. Developing an antibody test will allow researchers to see whether anyone has had the virus. Only then will we understand how far or how easily the coronavirus is spreading. Until we know how many cases there have been, it is impossible to be certain of the death rate. At the moment the estimate is thataround 1% of people infected with the virus die.But if there are large numbers of asymptomatic patients, the death rate could be lower. The main symptoms of coronavirus are a fever and a dry cough - these are the ones you should be on the look out for. A sore throat, headache and diarrhoea have also been reported in some cases and there is mounting speculation that a loss of sense of smell may affect some. But the most important question is whether mild, cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose or sneezing, are present in some patients. Studies have suggested this is a possibility and that people could potentially be infectious without knowing they are carrying the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Children can definitely catch coronavirus. However, they mostly develop mild symptoms and there are relatively few deaths among children compared with other age groups. Children are normally super-spreaders of disease, partly because they mix with lots of people (often in the playground), but with this virus, it is not clear to what extent they help spread it. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, where there was a cluster of cases at an animal market. The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, is closely related to viruses that infect bats, however it is thought the virus was passed from bats to a mystery animal species that then passed it on to people. That ""missing link"" remains unknown, and could be a source of further infections. Colds and flu are more common in the winter months than in the summer, but it is not yet known whether the warmer weather will alter the spread of the virus. The UK government's scientific advisers have warned it is unclear whether there will be a seasonal effect. If there is one, they think it is likely to be smaller than that for colds and flu. If there is a major dip in coronavirus over the summer, there is a danger that cases will spike in winter, when hospitals are also having to deal with an influx of patients with the usual winter bugs. Covid-19 is a mild infection for most. However around 20% go on to develop more severe disease, but why? The state of a person's immune system seems to be part of the issue, and there may be some genetic factor too. Understanding this could lead to ways of preventing people from needing intensive care. There has been much speculation but little evidence on how durable any immunity to the virus is. Patients must have built up an immune response, if they successfully fight off the virus. But as the disease has been around for only a few months there is a lack of long-term data. Rumours of patients being infected twice may be down to tests incorrectly saying they were free of the virus. The question of immunity is vital for understanding what will happen in the long term. Viruses mutate all the time, but most alterations to their genetic code do not make a significant difference. As a general rule, you expect viruses to evolve to be less deadly in the long run, but this is not guaranteed. The concern is that if the virus mutates, then the immune system no longer recognises it and a specific vaccine no longer works (as happens with flu).

"Restricted funerals 'heartbreaking' says celebrantJo Brewer has overseen more than 1,000 funerals and said services at the moment were ""so much harder"".","""You know the person that's passed away really deserved a packed house,"" says celebrant, Jo Brewer A celebrant said conducting funerals amid the coronavirus outbreak has been ""heartbreaking"" as restrictions have meant only 10 people could attend. Jo Brewer, from Plymouth in Devon, has conducted more than 1,000 funerals and said she has ""never experienced anything like it"". ""They're desperate to comfort one another and can't. They're sitting 2m (6ft) apart,"" she said. Tighter restrictions werebrought in by the prime ministeron Monday.

HOPE:Five reasons to be positive MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak ""The job of a celebrant or minister is always challenging emotionally,"" Ms Brewer said. ""Conducting a funeral under restrictions is so much harder because you know the person that's passed away really deserved a packed house and a wake where everyone shares happy memories. ""I know how much a funeral means and how much it is a part of the grieving process to be able to share your grief with other people that loved your loved one. ""Not being able to do that is heartbreaking to watch."" Ms Brewer praised the people who were still enabling the process to take place. ""Starting with the nurses and doctors, moving on to coroners, registrars, funeral directors, mortuary staff - everybody is putting themselves at risk to look after other people's loved ones with dignity,"" she said. Funeral services have been banned in Italy as an emergency measure ""We put on a smile, do our job under really tricky circumstances because obviously people aren't enjoying these restrictions - understandably so.

"1968, the year that haunts hundreds of women"," By Ly Truong The man had come in to buy soy sauce. Tran Thi Ngai was working as a midwife and nurse, but that morning she was looking after her parents’ shop in southern Vietnam while they were out. He had grenades hanging from his armour, guns on his belt. It was the summer of 1967, and the Vietnam War - pitting South Vietnamese forces, the US and its allies, against the North Vietnamese Communists - was escalating. As he approached the counter, he held out the money. As Tran reached to take it, he grabbed her arm, then her hair, and dragged her into the back room of the shop. There he raped her. “It felt as if my life was over,” Tran says. All she could do was channel her energies into working harder than ever. When she noticed her stomach swelling she assumed she was just putting on weight. Then one day she felt a kick and realised she was pregnant. Her parents were horrified that she was expecting a baby out of wedlock - a major taboo. The country’s social mores were heavily influenced by Confucianism, and women were expected to remain virgins until they were married. “My parents called me ‘chửa hoang' (pregnant out of wedlock) - they beat me up badly. “I didn’t want to carry on living. I felt completely dead inside.” She tried to kill herself several times but survived - “it felt as if the foetus was fighting for me”. Her parents only stopped beating her once she gave birth - in February 1968. She was overwhelmed by how beautiful her baby girl was, but was soon overtaken by anxiety. “I was worried about my child growing up, worried about money, worried about how I could get back to work to earn a living.” She named the baby Oanh. But, hard as it is to comprehend, she wanted to recognise the baby’s father in some way. The middle name would be Kim. That was the soldier’s surname. Her rapist was neither Vietnamese nor American. He was South Korean. Four years earlier his nation had joined the US in fighting the Communist Vietcong in South Vietnam. Not long after giving birth, Tran woke one night to find that Kim had appeared again, looking for her. “He didn’t say a word, stood there for one or two minutes, then left,” she says. South Korean soldiers (""ROK Tigers"") in Qui Nhon, Vietnam South Korean soldiers (""ROK Tigers"") in Qui Nhon, Vietnam A few days later, another South Korean soldier arrived. He had been sent by Kim to take Tran and the baby to his base - that of the 28th regiment of the South Korean White Horse Division - in a remote mountainous area south of her home town. Ashamed and isolated, she felt she had no other choice. She got into the car and spent the next two years with her rapist. She was terrified the entire time, fearing for her life and that of the child. “It was coercion, rape, no love was there,” she says. Tran had another baby girl with Kim, before being abandoned when he moved to another base. Tran Thi Ngai today She found her way back to her parents in Phu Hiep, trying to work as many hours as possible to feed her children, until Kim once again sent a comrade to her. But this time the soldier - whose name she recalls was Park - was there, at least ostensibly, to help with the children. “He carried them in his arms, fed them, cared for them while I was out working.” And then one day, Park, too, assaulted her. Tran conceived another baby - a boy this time. Her family’s social standing was now irrevocably damaged. “It got to a point when living in the village became too difficult. Villagers shunned me, accused me of having a Korean husband, [luring the Koreans] here to kill the Vietnamese,” she says. She and her parents fled to another part of the province, but her reputation followed her. “If I introduced myself as ‘Ngai’, people would say ‘Oh yes, Ms Ngai. Beautiful, but she doesn’t have a husband.’” They would ask her why she hadn’t aborted her children. She says that as a midwife she couldn’t entertain the idea. “My job was to help other women give birth - I took care of their babies, I carried them, I embraced them, washed them, cut their cords. How could I even think of destroying my own baby?” says Tran, her voice breaking. In the same month Tran was giving birth to her first child, 11-year-old Nguyen Thi Thanh’s life was also changing forever. On the morning of 25 February 1968 Nguyen heard screaming coming from the far side of her village of Ha My - not far from the now-popular tourist town of Hoi An - and saw smoke filling the sky. She ran down the lane to see what was happening. South Korean soldiers were pointing their guns at her. She ran back to the house to tell her mother, Le Thi Tho, that the village was surrounded. “As I finished my sentence they poured into our house.” Later reports were to suggest the soldiers were members of the Blue Dragon Division, a notorious South Korean marine corps. They ordered her entire family, along with another woman and her children, and a friend of her younger brother, into the underground shelter in their front yard. They threw grenades in after them, killing Nguyen’s aunt and her infant cousin instantly. She says her mother tried to shield her and her brother. “‘We are doomed, my baby,’ my mother cried out. “My whole body was burning and then felt numb... I could see other people’s blood all over me,” Nguyen says. Nguyen’s eight-year-old brother lost a leg and eventually died of his injuries in hospital. Only Nguyen and one of her cousins, both badly injured, survived, crawling to a neighbour’s for help. She says that the soldiers then burned her house down. “I could hear the popping and crackling sounds from burning bamboo. I smelt smoke, fire.” More than 135 people in Ha My were killed that day, with just a dozen of the villagers surviving, she says. Although she says South Korean soldiers had regularly visited Ha My before, looking for Vietcong, she has no idea why 25 February 1968 was different. “We don’t know why they were so aggressive that day. They even killed three and four-month-old babies.” Nguyen Thi Thanh, pictured at 16, five years after the massacre Nguyen Thi Thanh, pictured at 16, five years after the massacre What is known is that this period marked a turning point in the Vietnam War. In late January of that year the North Vietnamese and Vietcong launched the infamousTet Offensive- a bloody military campaign against the South Vietnamese, the US and their allies. The retaliations were vicious, the most notorious being theMy Lai massacre- the gang rape and mass murder of Vietnamese civilians by US troops in March 1968. Nguyen Thi Thanh today Nguyen did not witness the immediate aftermath of the killings in Ha My - she was taken to hospital in Da Nang. But her older brother told her he watched as the soldiers returned the next day with tractors to flatten the village, destroying the bodies. Korean soldiers bulldoze a Vietnamese village, north of Bong Sen Korean soldiers bulldoze a Vietnamese village, north of Bong Sen While there has not been an apology for the atrocities perpetrated by the US during the 20-year Vietnam war, there has been an acknowledgement in the form ofreparationsand a damningwar crimes tribunal. But South Korea’s government, which now has close economic ties with Vietnam, appears unwilling to engage in a review of its role in the war. Seoul sent approximately 320,000 troops in a move analysts say was rooted in a fear of a “domino effect” spread of Communism. South Korea’s ministry of defence sent a letter to Nguyen and 102 other survivors last September saying it has no record of any civilian killings carried out by its military in Vietnam and there needs to be a joint investigation by both governments in tandem to check the facts, but that this is currently unachievable. A group of South Korean soldiers with a blindfolded Vietcong suspect  One woman who has made it her life’s mission to discover the truth is South Korean researcher Ku Su-jeong. While doing a PhD in Vietnamese history in the 1990s, she was given a document by an official in Vietnam’s foreign ministry, describing atrocities carried out by the South Koreans. She managed to finally secure an unauthorised copy from a Vietnamese government official for a fee, and has spent the past 20 years visiting Vietnamese villages and talking to survivors. She believes about 9,000 South Vietnamese civilians were killed in about 80 massacres carried out by the South Koreans, although there is no way of independently verifying her research. Ku believes there are still other deaths unaccounted for and often hears from people who want her to investigate alleged extra-judicial killings. “I still receive calls from people who ask me to come to their village,” she says. Her lifetime of research has come at a personal cost. Two months after her findings were published in a South Korean newspaper article in April 1999, about 2,000 veterans in their 50s, all wearing army uniform, gathered in front of the paper’s headquarters in Seoul. The men trashed the building and some also vandalised Ku’s home, she says. She and her mother had to move to a high security apartment. The South Korea Veterans’ Association also attempted to sue her for defamation and fraud, although the case was dropped. It is not possible to prove who was responsible for the massacre that killed Nguyen’s family in Ha My. But one South Korean veteran, Ryu Jin-sung, says his division was responsible for a similar massacre just two weeks before the Ha My killings. Ryu’s company was on patrol when a bullet was fired at them from the direction of Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat, two villages a few miles from Ha My. Attacks began as retaliation - the company dividing into three units to attack the villages from three different directions. Ryu Jin-sung Ryu Jin-sung Ryu’s unit was the first to move out, after his comrade shot dead an unarmed elderly man. That evening he heard his comrades boasting about killing young children and women, and the next day he saw bodies of civilians laid out on the side of the road. “There was a large crowd. When we got there, they yelled and screamed at us. It felt as if they were about to kill me, their eyes fixed on me. “I used the barrel of 	my rifle to make my way through. I saw corpses, I saw bereaved families - their anger. Even today it’s still very vivid.” Ryu says that those who deny a massacre took place in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat are either misinformed or unwilling to admit the truth. The BBC arranged a meeting between Ryu and Nguyen, now 63, in a restaurant in Seoul. Both say, like many Vietnamese traumatised by the war, that they are haunted by ghosts. Ryu by that of the old man he saw being shot in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat; Nguyen by her younger brother. Nguyen and Ryu meet After swapping stories of the war, Ryu finally reads out a simple phrase he has prepared in advance in Vietnamese. “I am sorry,” he says. Nguyen simply nods in acknowledgement. He serves her some food, she smiles, and they continue with the meal. As she leaves the restaurant, Nguyen says she feels a burden has been lifted, but is still holding out hope for an official apology from Seoul. Asked for comment, the South Korean government told the BBC in a statement that since establishing formal diplomatic relations in 1992, the two countries “have made together continuous efforts to develop their bilateral relations in a future-oriented manner on the basis of the shared view that they should put their unfortunate past behind them and move forward to the future”. South Korea is now one of Vietnam’s largest investors, with economic giants like Samsung and LG Electronics pouring billions of dollars into building factories there. South Korean journalist Koh Kyoung-tae, who first published researcher Ku Su-jeong’s controversial findings, says the idea that South Korean soldiers may have carried out atrocities doesn’t fit with the nation’s sense of itself as a victim. Koh Kyoung-tae “We Koreans say that we have 5,000 years of history and we’ve always been the victim. We’ve been colonised by Japan, Mongolia, China… and we endured it. It’s kind of like we’re proud of our victim mindset.” South Korea also spent decades lobbying Japan for a similar apology over the hundreds of thousands of South Korean women forced to work as World War Two sex slaves. Nguyen, who is deaf in one ear and seriously scarred all over her body as a result of her injuries, blames her own country for ignoring the issue. The Vietnamese government turned down two BBC requests to film for an accompanying documentary. “Vietnam is afraid of anything that affects the relationship between the two countries so they don’t want to clarify it,” she says. Back in Phu Hiep, Tran Thi Ngai, now 79, is also still wrestling with the fallout of the war. She says her children have faced a lifetime of abuse and discrimination, mocked for being “lai dai han” (the Vietnamese term for the children of Vietnamese and Korean parents). Her father was tortured and beaten to death under house arrest in 1977 as punishment for allowing his daughter to have relations with a South Korean. Tran herself was put in detention or prison three times between 1975 and 1978. While it has not been possible to verify her specific case, the aftermath of the Vietnam War was an intense period of retribution, the country still riven with division. Vietnamese pressure group Justice for Lai Dai Han is simply pushing for an apology to the victims of rape by South Korean soldiers and those conceived as a result. There are estimated to be about 800 of the victims’ children still alive. One prominent campaigner for the group is Tran Thi Ngai’s son, Tran Van Ty, who was beaten up regularly on his way to school for having a South Korean father. Former UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, the international ambassador for the group, says there is no reason why an apology should adversely affect relations “if handled properly. “Vietnam and South Korea have agreed, ‘Let’s go forward, let’s not look back,’ which I understand, but you’ve got to make exceptions to that sometimes. “In some cases, in order to look forward you’ve got to settle things in the past.” The group is pushing for an inquiry by the UN Human Rights Council. Survivors of the massacres allegedly carried out by the South Korean military also filed a legal case against the South Korean government this month. If the judge finds grounds to pursue it, the first hearing could be heard as early as this summer - though it is expected to take several years to reach a conclusion. “An apology might not be worth much, but it means a lot to us,” says Nguyen Thi Thanh. A bronze sculpture by British artist Rebecca Hawkins is meanwhile touring the UK, inspired by the story of Tran Thi Ngai and her son. “Mother and Child” shows two figures trapped by a strangler fig - a plant native to Vietnam which smothers the trees it wraps around. “We need the South Koreans to acknowledge what happened,” Tran says. “They sent troops to Vietnam - it wasn’t us who went to their country.”  Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child”  Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child” Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child”  This story is part of theCrossing Dividesseason, bringing people together in a fragmented world Author: Ly Truong Illustration: Jilla Dastmalchi Researcher: Hyung Eun Kim Images: Derrick Evans, Getty Images, Alamy Online Producer: James Percy Editor: Sarah Buckley  Published: 27 March 2020 "

Weâre now wrapping up for the evening. Hereâs some of the biggest developments from today.  You can read ourmain story on coronavirus here. President Trump has wrapped up his daily press briefing on
his administrationâs coronavirus response. Here are some of the key points he outlined:  What is the latest in the US? President Trump said ""weâre unleashing every tool in our nationâs vast arsenal"" to combat coronavirus Trump said the state-by-state application of social distancing, depending on how serious their outbreaks levels were, would not happen as his expert advisers ""don't like
that"". Mr Trump had floated the idea earlier this week as a way of getting the US economy up and running again. Taking questions from reporters, Trump says that he ""doesn't want high approval ratings"" for his response to the coronavirus outbreak. ""I see numbers, they donât matter to me,"" he says, adding that ""victory"" over the outbreak is what matters. Earlier on Sunday, Trump issued a series of tweets, quoting an article from the New York Times which called the president's daily briefings a ""ratings hit"" and compared its viewership to that of reality series The Bachelor. Trump says that the national guidelines for social distancing will be extended for an additional month until 30 April. The initial 15-day guidance was set to expire tomorrow, on 30 March. ""Social distancing, that's the way you win,"" he says, adding that the US ""will be well on our way to recovery"" by June. The president had previously said he wanted the US economy to re-open by Easter which falls on 12 April. Trump says the ""peak"" of recorded deaths in the US is likely to hit in two weeks. ""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won,"" he says. ""That would be the greatest loss of all."" Mr Trump alleges that some states and medical groups are ""hoarding"" ventilators and other critical medical supplies. ""Many of the states are stocked up... some of them don't admit it,"" he said. He added that hospitals ""can't hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"". President Trump says that a new test has been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes. ""The deployment of rapid testing... will ultimately defeat the virus,"" he  said from his daily White House briefing. ""We will defeat the virus."" He said an anti-viral drug was being administered to 1,100 patients in New York. âLetâs see how it works, we may have some incredible results,"" he said. Mr Trump then praised a new technology that Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says can sterilise used masks, before he discussed potential treatments. ""The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer,"" he said.

President Donald Trump was due to speak from the White House at 17:00 local time (22:00 BST) to give an update on the current Covid-19 situation in the US. That has reportedly been delayed by approximately 30 minutes. Dr Anthony Fauci has predicted that ""millions"" of Americans will test positive for Covid-19 The face of the US response to the coronavirus outbreak Dr Anthony Fauci said the White House virus task force would be examining its 15-day guidelines for social distancing, announced two weeks ago. The deadline will likely be extended, Dr Fauci told CNN on Sunday, depending on the availability of instant testing kits. ""Itâs going to be a matter of weeks. Itâs not going to be tomorrow and itâs certainly not going to be next week,"" he said. Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted that the US would see ""millions of cases"" and ""between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths"". US President Donald Trump and the Coronavirus Task Force are about to hold a press briefing to discuss their response to the
pandemic. Mr Trump and the team will appear at the White House at 17:00 local

Another delivery of a similar number of Czech medical suits will be made to Italy on Monday. Nato, a transatlantic military alliance,thanked the Czech Republic for its ""generous bilateral aid"",external, describing its contribution as ""solidarity in action"". Spain and Italy are the two worst-affected countries in Europe. Nato said the medical aid would be distributed by Spanish authorities Covid-19 has been characterised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), so you've probably heard that word used a lot.

In the UK there are more than 19,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and at least 1,228 people who have tested positive have died. The virus was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January. Numbers are now increasing rapidly, and Sunday saw daily confirmed cases jump by more than 2,400 compared with the previous day. Most of the deaths in the UK have been in England, primarily in London. The capital has seen more than 400 fatalities so far. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has laughed off the suggestion that his country should try to stem the spread of the coronavirus, because he can't see the virus ""flying around"". Speaking to a TV reporter at an indoor ice hockey match, he also claimed that crowds at the match were fine because the coldness of the stadium would prevent the virus from spreading. There is no evidence that this could be the case and the coronavirus cannot be seen with the naked eye. Unlike most of Europe, Belarus has not placed any restrictions on sports events. ""There are no viruses here,"" Mr Lukashenko said. ""You haven't seen them flying around, have you? I don't see them either! This is a fridge. Sport, particularly the ice, this fridge here, that's the best antiviral cure!"" About 20,000 retired doctors and nurses are set to return to the NHS, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. In a video posted on Twitter, Mr Johnson thanked them for responding to the government's appeal for them to return. Letters weresent to more than 65,000 retired NHS workers in England and Wales last week, asking them to come back. Mr Johnson is currently self-isolating at his home in Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At 112 Bob is older than Selfridges,"Bob Weighton, who was born in Hull, has previously said the secret to his longevity was ""to avoid dying"" Bob Weighton, the world's oldest man, turns 112 today. Born in 1908, he is the same age as Inter Milan football club, and pre-dates Selfridges department store and the beatification of Joan of Arc. As young Robert came into this world, Herbert Asquith was still a week from becoming British prime minister, and King Edward VII had two more years to live. Here we take a look at some of the little-known events that have happened on the birthdays of Mr Weighton, as he enjoys this one at his home in Alton, Hampshire. Herbert Asquith became prime minister in April 1908, Edward VII died in 1910 In 1908, Robert is the 15th most popular boys' name in England and Wales. It is flanked by Frank and Harold, while William, John and George claim the top spots. The favoured girls' names are Mary, Elizabeth, Florence and Annie. In a pleasing coincidence, Joan Hocquard, from Poole in Dorset, is also 112 today and so is the UK's joint-oldest person. Her name is fairly unusual - in 1908 Joan is the 161st most popular and doesn't really break through until the 1930s. Another Robert, Captain Robert Falcon Scott, of the British Antarctic Expedition, dies on Bob's fourth birthday. Scott and four others trudge 850 miles to reach the South Pole. They arrive on 17 January to find the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen has beaten them to it. Captain Robert Scott and his team were disappointed to find they had been beaten to the South Pole Edgar Evans is the first of Scott's team to die, followed a month later by Lawrence Oates. Henry Bowers, Edward Wilson and Scott huddle in a tent and try to sit out a storm while their food supplies dwindle. On 29 March, Scott writes ""it seems a pity but I do not think I can write more"". The men's bodies are found eight months later, just 11 miles from their next food store. Joan of Arc's beatification took place in Rome, in 1909. Pope Pius X is pictured praying in the centre of the choir On Bob's 10th birthday, British forces are struggling in the first Battle of Amman in the Ottoman Empire. Bad weather, boggy underfoot conditions and unrelenting attacks are among the factors that lead to the withdrawal of troops a couple of days later. Closer to home though, and maybe for a little light relief, the Times newspaper that day publishes an extract of the will of a Mr Astley Weston, who left not just money for his children, but advice too. Among other words of wisdom, he urges them to ""not take any intoxicating drinks or narcotics"" and to avoid ""extravagance, self-indulgence and indolence"". Finally, if they should consider marrying, they were to consult their mother and take her advice. Fast-forward now to 29 March 1927. A 19-year-old Bob might have been interested in what is happening on the sands of Florida's Daytona Beach, where the specially built Sunbeam 1000hp is revving its engine. Sir Henry Segrave was the first person to hold both land and water speed records at the same time Henry Segrave is determined to beat the land speed record and finally crack the 200mph mark. For official ratification, he has to complete two runs. Strong winds on the outward leg cause the car to skid violently. Segrave is forced to drive into the sea to slow down. Remarkably, he is able to make the return journey. The speeds clocked on the two runs are 200.668mph and 207.015mph, giving an average speed of 203.792mph. The car is restored 90 years later (when Bob is a youthful 109) and is on display at the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, Hampshire. The Sunbeam 1,000hp was built in Wolverhampton and nicknamed ""The Slug"" We have moved on to 29 March 1938. Bob turns 30 and the country is gearing up for war. In the House of Commons, a debate is raging aboutâ¦ the importation of rubber footwear. MPs are concerned that 2.5 million foreign rubber boots and shoes were shipped to the UK in the first two months of the year, threatening the interests of British shoemakers. The President of the Board of Trade reassures his colleagues that he will help protect the British market. Briton, 111, set to be named world's oldest man France insists world's 'oldest woman' was not fake Lessons of the worldâs most unique supercentenarians A fairly dull discussion, but perhaps worth it for the waggish contribution of the Glaswegian MP JJ Davidson, who pipes up to say: ""Does that mean that the President of the Board of Trade will not support the foreign heels?"" It is not recorded whether his fellow backbenchers find him funny. In 1943, Bob turns 35 on the same day John Major is born. In 1951, now 43, he could have taken the eight-year-old future prime minister to celebrate their birthdays by attending the opening night of The King and I on Broadway, starring Gertrude Lawrence and Yul Brynner. Lawrence is unaware she has liver and abdominal cancer, and faints backstage after a matinee before being admitted to hospital. Just 15 months later, she is dead. Gertrude Lawrence was the original Anna in the stage production of The King and I In 1955, on Bob's 47th birthday, a new world rail speed record is set by SNCF in France. The train reaches 331km/h (206mph), fast enough to damage the track. We're now at the end of the swinging 60s and Bob turns 61 in 1969, the day the Eurovision Song Contest ends in a four-way draw between the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands and France. Lulu Boom-bang-a-banged her way to joint first place for the Royaume-Uni The organisers manage to cobble enough winner's medals together by using the ones they have earmarked for (up to three) songwriters. Other countries are so annoyed by the tie that four withdraw from the following year's competition, and a tiebreak procedure is introduced shortly afterwards. On 29 March 1974, Bob celebrates his 66th birthday. Also on that day, a group of farmers digging a well find a life-sized human head made from clay buried near Xian in China. They call in the experts and a 2,200-year-old terracotta army is discovered. The discovery has been described as the greatest archaeological find of the 20th Century Three pits are found to contain more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots and 520 horses, thought to have been buried in order to help China's first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, in the afterlife. Bob could have marked his 72nd birthday by having a bet on the 134th Grand National, although he would have had to pick carefully. There are only four finishers in the 30-strong field in 1980. The race is won by the American-owned horse Ben Nevis, ridden by Charlie Fenwick at a starting price of 40-1. Ben Nevis lived until 1995 and was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 2009 Bob turns 82 in 1990 - on the same day as the outbreak of the little-known Hyphen War, a conflict over what to call Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Communist government the previous year. Slovak politicians feel ""the Czechoslovak Republic"" does not recognise Slovakia's equal stature, and want the state to be named ""the Czecho-Slovak Republic"". It is resolved when the two agree to split the country (over more substantial issues) and on 1 January 1993 the two states become the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Bob's 101st birthday in 2009 is a difficult one for then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, as the news breaks that she claimed parliamentary expenses for pay-per-view pornographic films. Jacqui Smith resigned from the front benches following the scandal The resulting scandal eventually leads to her resignation from the front benches, and in 2010 she loses her seat. The incident does, however, open up a new avenue for Ms Smith - in 2011 she presents a radio documentary about pornography. It is called Porn Again. In 2014, on Bob's 106th birthday, the first same-sex marriages in England and Wales take place. North Londoners and partners of 17 years Peter McGraith and David Cabreza become husband and husband at one minute past midnight. And finally, in 2020, Bob reaches his 112 birthday - although he has had to cancel his celebrations because of the coronavirus outbreak. He has lived through the reigns of five British monarchs, 22 UK prime ministers - serving a total of 27 terms - and 21 presidents of the USA. He was alive during all three London Olympics, and both world wars, and has weathered the Spanish flu, cholera and smallpox. It's anyone's guess as to what happens next year.

Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine',"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells reporters he is ""considering quarantine"" for some areas US President Donald Trump has said quarantining New York ""will not be necessary"", after the state's governor said doing so would be ""preposterous"". Mr Trump said the latest decision was taken on the recommendation of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The president had earlier said he might impose a quarantine on New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, to slow the spread of Covid-19. There are more than 59,000 cases in New York. The state has about half of the total confirmed Covid-19 cases in the entire US. Mr Trump tweeted that instead of quarantine, a ""strong travel advisory"" would be issued to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Live updates: Trump U-turn and Boris warning to UK The CDC then publisheda statement urging residents of those three states to ""refrain"" from all non-essential domestic travel,externalfor 14 days. The agency said the advisory did not apply to ""critical infrastructure"" service providers, including healthcare professionals and food suppliers. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to reporters earlier on Saturday about the situation in New York, Mr Trump said: ""We'd like to see [it] quarantined because it's a hotspot... I'm thinking about that."" He said it would be aimed at slowing the spread of the virus to other parts of the US. ""They're having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don't want that,"" he said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo responded by saying that quarantining the state of New York would be ""preposterous"" and ""anti-American"". ""If you said we were geographically restricted from leaving, that would be a lockdown."" New York's governor expressed concern at the idea of a quarantine He said New York had already implemented ""quarantine"" measures, such as banning major gatherings and ordering people to remain at home, but that he would oppose any ""lockdown"" efforts. ""Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldn't make any sense,"" he told CNN, adding that this would cause the stock market to crash in a way that would make it impossible for the US economy to ""recover for months, if not years"". ""You would paralyse the financial sector,"" he said. He told a press briefing earlier on Saturday: ""I don't know how that can be legally enforceable. And from a medical point of view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing. ""But I can tell you, I don't even like the sound of it."" Mr Cuomo also said he would sue nearby Rhode Island if the authorities there continued targeting New Yorkers and threatening to punish them for failing to quarantine. Allow Twitter content?

On Friday, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo deployed National Guard troops to stop cars with a New York licence plate, to remind them of their state's advice that they quarantine.

AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The White House has said anyone leaving New York City should self-isolate for 14 days. With more than 2,500 virus-related fatalities, the US death toll remains lower than those in Italy and China. But there are virus hotspots in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and Seattle. Saturday sawthe first death in the US of an infant who had tested positive,externalfor coronavirus. The baby died in Chicago. In his press briefing, Mr Cuomo said New York was postponing its presidential primary by almost two months until 23 June as a result of the outbreak. He also said the apex of the crisis would occur in the next 14 to 21 days. Mr Cuomo said the state would soon require 30,000 respiratory ventilators, which had increased in price to $45,000 (Â£36,000) each due to demand. He added that Mr Trump had approved the construction of four temporary hospitals. Demand for ventilators has also doubled in the southern state of Louisiana. Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would run out of ventilators by 2 April and possibly run out of hospital beds by 7 April if the number of new infections did not subside. ""It's not some flimsy theory. This is what is going to happen,"" he said. President Trump has ordered a car manufacturer in Detroit to produce more ventilators.

More widely, the mayors of most US cities have said they expect massive shortages of critical personal safety equipment in the coming weeks.

It will station itself at a Manhattan pier to deal with the overload of patients that New York expects.

Restricted funerals 'heartbreaking' says celebrant,"""You know the person that's passed away really deserved a packed house,"" says celebrant, Jo Brewer A celebrant said conducting funerals amid the coronavirus outbreak has been ""heartbreaking"" as restrictions have meant only 10 people could attend. Jo Brewer, from Plymouth in Devon, has conducted more than 1,000 funerals and said she has ""never experienced anything like it"". ""They're desperate to comfort one another and can't. They're sitting 2m (6ft) apart,"" she said. Tighter restrictions werebrought in by the prime ministeron Monday. Unlike weddings and baptisms, funerals have still been allowed to go ahead but with immediate family only. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MEASURES:What are countries doing? HOPE:Five reasons to be positive MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak ""The job of a celebrant or minister is always challenging emotionally,"" Ms Brewer said. ""Conducting a funeral under restrictions is so much harder because you know the person that's passed away really deserved a packed house and a wake where everyone shares happy memories. ""I know how much a funeral means and how much it is a part of the grieving process to be able to share your grief with other people that loved your loved one. ""Not being able to do that is heartbreaking to watch."" Ms Brewer praised the people who were still enabling the process to take place. ""Starting with the nurses and doctors, moving on to coroners, registrars, funeral directors, mortuary staff - everybody is putting themselves at risk to look after other people's loved ones with dignity,"" she said. Funeral services have been banned in Italy as an emergency measure ""We put on a smile, do our job under really tricky circumstances because obviously people aren't enjoying these restrictions - understandably so. But we have no choice. ""I'd really like people to be kind to them. It's such a hard time for everybody but we all want to get back to normal."" Dealing with grief during a lockdown Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health Coping with coronavirus anxiety The celebrant, who covers the Devon and Cornwall area, is warning people to stick to the rules or risk funerals being banned, as has happened in someother parts of the world. ""To not have a funeral is unthinkable,"" she said. ""I can't even begin to imagine how awful that would be for a family to not be able to say a proper goodbye. ""But if people flout the rules, it will push it to the next level of non-attended funerals which I cannot even begin to imagine how hard that would be."" Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

"Things to get worse before getting better, PM says","The prime minister chaired Saturday morning's Covid-19 meeting via video-link The prime minister has warned that the coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets better, in a letter being sent to every UK household. Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, says stricter restrictions could be put in place if necessary. Britons will also get a leaflet detailing government rules on leaving the house and health information. It follows criticism over the clarity of government advice to date. The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has now reached 1,019, with a further 260 deaths announced on Saturday. There are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK. In the letter being sent to 30 million households at an anticipated cost of Â£5.8m, Mr Johnson writes: ""From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time. ""We will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do."" Toughmeasures to tackle the spread of coronavirus,,externalincluding a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and the closure of shops selling non-essential goods, were introduced last week. LIVE:Latest updates on the crisis A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health ""It's important for me to level with you - we know things will get worse before they get better,"" the letter reads. ""But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal."" Experts have said they expect the number of coronavirus cases and deaths to continue to rise for the next two to three weeks, before the effects of social distancing measures and restrictions on everyday life begin to have an impact. Responding to reports current measures could be in place until June, Scotland's chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House: ""The modelling that's been done, and that I have seen, has always said that we need at least 13 weeks of some sort of measures in order to really get this virus away from spreading amongst people. ""When you have a shorter period of time, as I understand other countries have done, as soon as you lift the measures the virus comes back again because you haven't stopped it transmitting amongst lots of people."" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove declined to say how long the restrictions might last but said everyone ""has to prepare for a significant period where these measures are still in place"". ""I wish I could predict when this will end,"" he said. The date of the peak of the virus ""depends on all of our behaviour"", he added, saying: ""It's not a fixed point"". This video can not be played How staying at home can stop coronavirus In his letter, Mr Johnson describes the pandemic as a ""moment of national emergency"", and reiterates the government guidance to stay at home to avoid putting pressure on the NHS, so that lives can be saved. The prime minister acknowledges the restrictions will have a financial impact on families. However, writing after ministers unveiled billions of pounds of help for workers and businesses, he says: ""The government will do whatever it takes to help you make ends meet and put food on the table."" Mr Johnson also praises the work of doctors, nurses and other carers as well as well as the hundreds of thousands of people who have volunteered to help the most vulnerable. The leaflet sent alongside the letter includes guidance on hand-washing, an explanation of coronavirus symptoms, the government rules on leaving the house and advice on shielding vulnerable people.

In England and Wales,people ignoring restrictions could be hit with a Â£60 fine initially and another Â£120 for a second offence. Fines in England will rise to a maximum of Â£960 for repeat offences. It comes as former Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested ""mass testing"" was needed to avoid another surge of virus cases when restrictions are finally eased, telling Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""You need a very clear understanding of who has got it and who hasn't."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said,externalthe government was now testing 10,000 people a day, and was ""on track"" to test 25,000 by mid-April.

"1968, the year that haunts hundreds of womenTrump backs away from New York 'quarantine'The US president now says the move is not necessary, after the idea was labelled ""preposterous"".US & Canada"," By Ly Truong The man had come in to buy soy sauce. Tran Thi Ngai was working as a midwife and nurse, but that morning she was looking after her parents’ shop in southern Vietnam while they were out. He had grenades hanging from his armour, guns on his belt. It was the summer of 1967, and the Vietnam War - pitting South Vietnamese forces, the US and its allies, against the North Vietnamese Communists - was escalating. As he approached the counter, he held out the money. As Tran reached to take it, he grabbed her arm, then her hair, and dragged her into the back room of the shop. There he raped her. “It felt as if my life was over,” Tran says. All she could do was channel her energies into working harder than ever. When she noticed her stomach swelling she assumed she was just putting on weight. Then one day she felt a kick and realised she was pregnant. Her parents were horrified that she was expecting a baby out of wedlock - a major taboo. The country’s social mores were heavily influenced by Confucianism, and women were expected to remain virgins until they were married. “My parents called me ‘chửa hoang' (pregnant out of wedlock) - they beat me up badly. “I didn’t want to carry on living. I felt completely dead inside.” She tried to kill herself several times but survived - “it felt as if the foetus was fighting for me”. Her parents only stopped beating her once she gave birth - in February 1968. She was overwhelmed by how beautiful her baby girl was, but was soon overtaken by anxiety. “I was worried about my child growing up, worried about money, worried about how I could get back to work to earn a living.” She named the baby Oanh. But, hard as it is to comprehend, she wanted to recognise the baby’s father in some way. The middle name would be Kim. That was the soldier’s surname. Her rapist was neither Vietnamese nor American. He was South Korean. Four years earlier his nation had joined the US in fighting the Communist Vietcong in South Vietnam. Not long after giving birth, Tran woke one night to find that Kim had appeared again, looking for her. “He didn’t say a word, stood there for one or two minutes, then left,” she says. South Korean soldiers (""ROK Tigers"") in Qui Nhon, Vietnam South Korean soldiers (""ROK Tigers"") in Qui Nhon, Vietnam A few days later, another South Korean soldier arrived. He had been sent by Kim to take Tran and the baby to his base - that of the 28th regiment of the South Korean White Horse Division - in a remote mountainous area south of her home town. Ashamed and isolated, she felt she had no other choice. She got into the car and spent the next two years with her rapist. She was terrified the entire time, fearing for her life and that of the child. “It was coercion, rape, no love was there,” she says. Tran had another baby girl with Kim, before being abandoned when he moved to another base. Tran Thi Ngai today She found her way back to her parents in Phu Hiep, trying to work as many hours as possible to feed her children, until Kim once again sent a comrade to her. But this time the soldier - whose name she recalls was Park - was there, at least ostensibly, to help with the children. “He carried them in his arms, fed them, cared for them while I was out working.” And then one day, Park, too, assaulted her. Tran conceived another baby - a boy this time. Her family’s social standing was now irrevocably damaged. “It got to a point when living in the village became too difficult. Villagers shunned me, accused me of having a Korean husband, [luring the Koreans] here to kill the Vietnamese,” she says. She and her parents fled to another part of the province, but her reputation followed her. “If I introduced myself as ‘Ngai’, people would say ‘Oh yes, Ms Ngai. Beautiful, but she doesn’t have a husband.’” They would ask her why she hadn’t aborted her children. She says that as a midwife she couldn’t entertain the idea. “My job was to help other women give birth - I took care of their babies, I carried them, I embraced them, washed them, cut their cords. How could I even think of destroying my own baby?” says Tran, her voice breaking. In the same month Tran was giving birth to her first child, 11-year-old Nguyen Thi Thanh’s life was also changing forever. On the morning of 25 February 1968 Nguyen heard screaming coming from the far side of her village of Ha My - not far from the now-popular tourist town of Hoi An - and saw smoke filling the sky. She ran down the lane to see what was happening. South Korean soldiers were pointing their guns at her. She ran back to the house to tell her mother, Le Thi Tho, that the village was surrounded. “As I finished my sentence they poured into our house.” Later reports were to suggest the soldiers were members of the Blue Dragon Division, a notorious South Korean marine corps. They ordered her entire family, along with another woman and her children, and a friend of her younger brother, into the underground shelter in their front yard. They threw grenades in after them, killing Nguyen’s aunt and her infant cousin instantly. She says her mother tried to shield her and her brother. “‘We are doomed, my baby,’ my mother cried out. “My whole body was burning and then felt numb... I could see other people’s blood all over me,” Nguyen says. Nguyen’s eight-year-old brother lost a leg and eventually died of his injuries in hospital. Only Nguyen and one of her cousins, both badly injured, survived, crawling to a neighbour’s for help. She says that the soldiers then burned her house down. “I could hear the popping and crackling sounds from burning bamboo. I smelt smoke, fire.” More than 135 people in Ha My were killed that day, with just a dozen of the villagers surviving, she says. Although she says South Korean soldiers had regularly visited Ha My before, looking for Vietcong, she has no idea why 25 February 1968 was different. “We don’t know why they were so aggressive that day. They even killed three and four-month-old babies.” Nguyen Thi Thanh, pictured at 16, five years after the massacre Nguyen Thi Thanh, pictured at 16, five years after the massacre What is known is that this period marked a turning point in the Vietnam War. In late January of that year the North Vietnamese and Vietcong launched the infamousTet Offensive- a bloody military campaign against the South Vietnamese, the US and their allies. The retaliations were vicious, the most notorious being theMy Lai massacre- the gang rape and mass murder of Vietnamese civilians by US troops in March 1968. Nguyen Thi Thanh today Nguyen did not witness the immediate aftermath of the killings in Ha My - she was taken to hospital in Da Nang. But her older brother told her he watched as the soldiers returned the next day with tractors to flatten the village, destroying the bodies. Korean soldiers bulldoze a Vietnamese village, north of Bong Sen Korean soldiers bulldoze a Vietnamese village, north of Bong Sen While there has not been an apology for the atrocities perpetrated by the US during the 20-year Vietnam war, there has been an acknowledgement in the form ofreparationsand a damningwar crimes tribunal. But South Korea’s government, which now has close economic ties with Vietnam, appears unwilling to engage in a review of its role in the war. Seoul sent approximately 320,000 troops in a move analysts say was rooted in a fear of a “domino effect” spread of Communism. South Korea’s ministry of defence sent a letter to Nguyen and 102 other survivors last September saying it has no record of any civilian killings carried out by its military in Vietnam and there needs to be a joint investigation by both governments in tandem to check the facts, but that this is currently unachievable. A group of South Korean soldiers with a blindfolded Vietcong suspect  One woman who has made it her life’s mission to discover the truth is South Korean researcher Ku Su-jeong. While doing a PhD in Vietnamese history in the 1990s, she was given a document by an official in Vietnam’s foreign ministry, describing atrocities carried out by the South Koreans. She managed to finally secure an unauthorised copy from a Vietnamese government official for a fee, and has spent the past 20 years visiting Vietnamese villages and talking to survivors. She believes about 9,000 South Vietnamese civilians were killed in about 80 massacres carried out by the South Koreans, although there is no way of independently verifying her research. Ku believes there are still other deaths unaccounted for and often hears from people who want her to investigate alleged extra-judicial killings. “I still receive calls from people who ask me to come to their village,” she says. Her lifetime of research has come at a personal cost. Two months after her findings were published in a South Korean newspaper article in April 1999, about 2,000 veterans in their 50s, all wearing army uniform, gathered in front of the paper’s headquarters in Seoul. The men trashed the building and some also vandalised Ku’s home, she says. She and her mother had to move to a high security apartment. The South Korea Veterans’ Association also attempted to sue her for defamation and fraud, although the case was dropped. It is not possible to prove who was responsible for the massacre that killed Nguyen’s family in Ha My. But one South Korean veteran, Ryu Jin-sung, says his division was responsible for a similar massacre just two weeks before the Ha My killings. Ryu’s company was on patrol when a bullet was fired at them from the direction of Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat, two villages a few miles from Ha My. Attacks began as retaliation - the company dividing into three units to attack the villages from three different directions. Ryu Jin-sung Ryu Jin-sung Ryu’s unit was the first to move out, after his comrade shot dead an unarmed elderly man. That evening he heard his comrades boasting about killing young children and women, and the next day he saw bodies of civilians laid out on the side of the road. “There was a large crowd. When we got there, they yelled and screamed at us. It felt as if they were about to kill me, their eyes fixed on me. “I used the barrel of 	my rifle to make my way through. I saw corpses, I saw bereaved families - their anger. Even today it’s still very vivid.” Ryu says that those who deny a massacre took place in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat are either misinformed or unwilling to admit the truth. The BBC arranged a meeting between Ryu and Nguyen, now 63, in a restaurant in Seoul. Both say, like many Vietnamese traumatised by the war, that they are haunted by ghosts. Ryu by that of the old man he saw being shot in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat; Nguyen by her younger brother. Nguyen and Ryu meet After swapping stories of the war, Ryu finally reads out a simple phrase he has prepared in advance in Vietnamese. “I am sorry,” he says. Nguyen simply nods in acknowledgement. He serves her some food, she smiles, and they continue with the meal. As she leaves the restaurant, Nguyen says she feels a burden has been lifted, but is still holding out hope for an official apology from Seoul. Asked for comment, the South Korean government told the BBC in a statement that since establishing formal diplomatic relations in 1992, the two countries “have made together continuous efforts to develop their bilateral relations in a future-oriented manner on the basis of the shared view that they should put their unfortunate past behind them and move forward to the future”. South Korea is now one of Vietnam’s largest investors, with economic giants like Samsung and LG Electronics pouring billions of dollars into building factories there. South Korean journalist Koh Kyoung-tae, who first published researcher Ku Su-jeong’s controversial findings, says the idea that South Korean soldiers may have carried out atrocities doesn’t fit with the nation’s sense of itself as a victim. Koh Kyoung-tae “We Koreans say that we have 5,000 years of history and we’ve always been the victim. We’ve been colonised by Japan, Mongolia, China… and we endured it. It’s kind of like we’re proud of our victim mindset.” South Korea also spent decades lobbying Japan for a similar apology over the hundreds of thousands of South Korean women forced to work as World War Two sex slaves. Nguyen, who is deaf in one ear and seriously scarred all over her body as a result of her injuries, blames her own country for ignoring the issue. The Vietnamese government turned down two BBC requests to film for an accompanying documentary. “Vietnam is afraid of anything that affects the relationship between the two countries so they don’t want to clarify it,” she says. Back in Phu Hiep, Tran Thi Ngai, now 79, is also still wrestling with the fallout of the war. She says her children have faced a lifetime of abuse and discrimination, mocked for being “lai dai han” (the Vietnamese term for the children of Vietnamese and Korean parents). Her father was tortured and beaten to death under house arrest in 1977 as punishment for allowing his daughter to have relations with a South Korean. Tran herself was put in detention or prison three times between 1975 and 1978. While it has not been possible to verify her specific case, the aftermath of the Vietnam War was an intense period of retribution, the country still riven with division. Vietnamese pressure group Justice for Lai Dai Han is simply pushing for an apology to the victims of rape by South Korean soldiers and those conceived as a result. There are estimated to be about 800 of the victims’ children still alive. One prominent campaigner for the group is Tran Thi Ngai’s son, Tran Van Ty, who was beaten up regularly on his way to school for having a South Korean father. Former UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, the international ambassador for the group, says there is no reason why an apology should adversely affect relations “if handled properly. “Vietnam and South Korea have agreed, ‘Let’s go forward, let’s not look back,’ which I understand, but you’ve got to make exceptions to that sometimes. “In some cases, in order to look forward you’ve got to settle things in the past.” The group is pushing for an inquiry by the UN Human Rights Council. Survivors of the massacres allegedly carried out by the South Korean military also filed a legal case against the South Korean government this month. If the judge finds grounds to pursue it, the first hearing could be heard as early as this summer - though it is expected to take several years to reach a conclusion. “An apology might not be worth much, but it means a lot to us,” says Nguyen Thi Thanh. A bronze sculpture by British artist Rebecca Hawkins is meanwhile touring the UK, inspired by the story of Tran Thi Ngai and her son. “Mother and Child” shows two figures trapped by a strangler fig - a plant native to Vietnam which smothers the trees it wraps around. “We need the South Koreans to acknowledge what happened,” Tran says. “They sent troops to Vietnam - it wasn’t us who went to their country.”  Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child”  Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child” Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child”  This story is part of theCrossing Dividesseason, bringing people together in a fragmented world Author: Ly Truong Illustration: Jilla Dastmalchi Researcher: Hyung Eun Kim Images: Derrick Evans, Getty Images, Alamy Online Producer: James Percy Editor: Sarah Buckley  Published: 27 March 2020 "
"Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine'The US president now says the move is not necessary, after the idea was labelled ""preposterous"".US & Canada","This video can not be played Donald Trump tells reporters he is ""considering quarantine"" for some areas US President Donald Trump has said quarantining New York ""will not be necessary"", after the state's governor said doing so would be ""preposterous"". Mr Trump said the latest decision was taken on the recommendation of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The president had earlier said he might impose a quarantine on New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, to slow the spread of Covid-19. There are more than 59,000 cases in New York. The state has about half of the total confirmed Covid-19 cases in the entire US. Mr Trump tweeted that instead of quarantine, a ""strong travel advisory"" would be issued to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Live updates: Trump U-turn and Boris warning to UK The CDC then publisheda statement urging residents of those three states to ""refrain"" from all non-essential domestic travel,externalfor 14 days. The agency said the advisory did not apply to ""critical infrastructure"" service providers, including healthcare professionals and food suppliers. Allow Twitter content?

He said it would be aimed at slowing the spread of the virus to other parts of the US. ""They're having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don't want that,"" he said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo responded by saying that quarantining the state of New York would be ""preposterous"" and ""anti-American"". ""If you said we were geographically restricted from leaving, that would be a lockdown."" New York's governor expressed concern at the idea of a quarantine He said New York had already implemented ""quarantine"" measures, such as banning major gatherings and ordering people to remain at home, but that he would oppose any ""lockdown"" efforts. ""Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldn't make any sense,"" he told CNN, adding that this would cause the stock market to crash in a way that would make it impossible for the US economy to ""recover for months, if not years"". ""You would paralyse the financial sector,"" he said. He told a press briefing earlier on Saturday: ""I don't know how that can be legally enforceable. And from a medical point of view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing. ""But I can tell you, I don't even like the sound of it."" Mr Cuomo also said he would sue nearby Rhode Island if the authorities there continued targeting New Yorkers and threatening to punish them for failing to quarantine. Allow Twitter content?

In his press briefing, Mr Cuomo said New York was postponing its presidential primary by almost two months until 23 June as a result of the outbreak. He also said the apex of the crisis would occur in the next 14 to 21 days. Mr Cuomo said the state would soon require 30,000 respiratory ventilators, which had increased in price to $45,000 (Â£36,000) each due to demand. He added that Mr Trump had approved the construction of four temporary hospitals. Demand for ventilators has also doubled in the southern state of Louisiana. Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would run out of ventilators by 2 April and possibly run out of hospital beds by 7 April if the number of new infections did not subside.

They're sitting 2m (6ft) apart,"" she said. Tighter restrictions werebrought in by the prime ministeron Monday. Unlike weddings and baptisms, funerals have still been allowed to go ahead but with immediate family only. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MEASURES:What are countries doing? HOPE:Five reasons to be positive MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak ""The job of a celebrant or minister is always challenging emotionally,"" Ms Brewer said. ""Conducting a funeral under restrictions is so much harder because you know the person that's passed away really deserved a packed house and a wake where everyone shares happy memories. ""I know how much a funeral means and how much it is a part of the grieving process to be able to share your grief with other people that loved your loved one. ""Not being able to do that is heartbreaking to watch."" Ms Brewer praised the people who were still enabling the process to take place. ""Starting with the nurses and doctors, moving on to coroners, registrars, funeral directors, mortuary staff - everybody is putting themselves at risk to look after other people's loved ones with dignity,"" she said. Funeral services have been banned in Italy as an emergency measure ""We put on a smile, do our job under really tricky circumstances because obviously people aren't enjoying these restrictions - understandably so. But we have no choice. ""I'd really like people to be kind to them. It's such a hard time for everybody but we all want to get back to normal."" Dealing with grief during a lockdown Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health Coping with coronavirus anxiety The celebrant, who covers the Devon and Cornwall area, is warning people to stick to the rules or risk funerals being banned, as has happened in someother parts of the world. ""To not have a funeral is unthinkable,"" she said. ""I can't even begin to imagine how awful that would be for a family to not be able to say a proper goodbye. ""But if people flout the rules, it will push it to the next level of non-attended funerals which I cannot even begin to imagine how hard that would be."" Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

Activist Patrick Vernon, who is behind the petition, said he had been fighting for years to get black Britons recognised for their contributions, adding that naming the hospital after Seacole would act as a âbeacon of hope and diversity for the countryâ.  âDespite being rejected by Florence Nightingale to join her band of nurses, she travelled to the front line of the war in Crimea.

SNP urges UK government to 'hit pause' on Brexit,"The SNP is urging the UK government to ""hit pause"" on Brexit negotiations and seek to extend the transition period. It has urged the UK government to focus on the coronavirus pandemic. The party's Brexit spokeswoman, MP Philippa Whitford, said it would be irresponsible to continue ""hurtling"" towards the transition deadline. The UK government said its priority was to ""slow the spread"" of the coronavirus, but it remained ""fully committed"" to the Brexit negotiations. Post-Brexit talks with the European Unionwill continue this week despite the UK and much of the continent being on a coronavirus-enforced lockdown. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will co-chair discussions via video conference as the two sides look at implementing what is in the Withdrawal Agreement once the transition period ends, which is due to happen on 31 December. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? Brexit: Will it be a Canadian or an Australian ending? Dr Whitford called on the UK government to immediately seek an extension to the transition period. She said: ""The Covid-19 outbreak has gripped us all - regardless of politics or borders - and it is vital that governments here in the UK and abroad work collaboratively to combat the pandemic. ""It is impossible for businesses and others to prepare for life outside the EU while coping with the impact of the Covid-19 crisis at the same time, and many might struggle to survive the second blow of a hard Brexit at the end of this year. ""Continuing talks and hurtling towards the transition period deadline would be irresponsible and an act of economic and social self-harm. ""It is now vital that the UK government hits pause on all Brexit negotiations and immediately seeks an extension to the transition period to remove the uncertainty and instability."" Downing Street has continued to insist that the government will not seek to delay the end-of-the-year deadline for a trade deal to be reached. When asked about a possible extension to the transition period on Friday, the prime minister's official spokesman told reporters: ""In terms of the timetable, there is no change from our point of view."" Dr Whitford urged the UK government to mirror the example of the Scottish government which haspostponed planning for an independence referendum in 2020 due to the pandemic. She said: ""The SNP Scottish government made the difficult but responsible decision to pause work on preparing for an independence referendum this year. ""The UK government must now mirror that step so that we can focus on protecting our citizens and delivering financial support to everyone in society."" A UK government spokesman said: ""Our top priority as a government is to slow the spread of the coronavirus, protect the NHS and keep people safe. ""We are working around the clock to do so, with all four nations together providing unprecedented financial support for businesses, workers and the self-employed. ""We remain fully committed to the negotiations. Last week, the UK and EU shared draft legal texts and discussions with the commission are continuing. ""The transition period ends on 31 December 2020, as enshrined in UK law, which the prime minister has made clear he has no intention of changing."" The calls from the SNP follow a similar message from the Liberal Democrats. Earlier this month, the party's acting leader Ed Davey warned that to continue the Brexit negotiations amidst the ""gathering storm"" of the coronavirus outbreak would be a ""recipe for disaster"". Mr Davey said that the PM ""should seek an extension of the Brexit transition period and pause the trade talks"".

Weâre now wrapping up for the evening. Hereâs some of the biggest developments from today.  You can read ourmain story on coronavirus here. President Trump has wrapped up his daily press briefing on
his administrationâs coronavirus response. Here are some of the key points he outlined:  What is the latest in the US? President Trump said ""weâre unleashing every tool in our nationâs vast arsenal"" to combat coronavirus Trump said the state-by-state application of social distancing, depending on how serious their outbreaks levels were, would not happen as his expert advisers ""don't like
that"". Mr Trump had floated the idea earlier this week as a way of getting the US economy up and running again. Taking questions from reporters, Trump says that he ""doesn't want high approval ratings"" for his response to the coronavirus outbreak. ""I see numbers, they donât matter to me,"" he says, adding that ""victory"" over the outbreak is what matters. Earlier on Sunday, Trump issued a series of tweets, quoting an article from the New York Times which called the president's daily briefings a ""ratings hit"" and compared its viewership to that of reality series The Bachelor. Trump says that the national guidelines for social distancing will be extended for an additional month until 30 April. The initial 15-day guidance was set to expire tomorrow, on 30 March. ""Social distancing, that's the way you win,"" he says, adding that the US ""will be well on our way to recovery"" by June. The president had previously said he wanted the US economy to re-open by Easter which falls on 12 April. Trump says the ""peak"" of recorded deaths in the US is likely to hit in two weeks. ""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won,"" he says. ""That would be the greatest loss of all."" Mr Trump alleges that some states and medical groups are ""hoarding"" ventilators and other critical medical supplies. ""Many of the states are stocked up... some of them don't admit it,"" he said. He added that hospitals ""can't hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"". President Trump says that a new test has been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes. ""The deployment of rapid testing... will ultimately defeat the virus,"" he  said from his daily White House briefing. ""We will defeat the virus."" He said an anti-viral drug was being administered to 1,100 patients in New York. âLetâs see how it works, we may have some incredible results,"" he said. Mr Trump then praised a new technology that Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says can sterilise used masks, before he discussed potential treatments. ""The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer,"" he said.

President Donald Trump was due to speak from the White House at 17:00 local time (22:00 BST) to give an update on the current Covid-19 situation in the US. That has reportedly been delayed by approximately 30 minutes. Dr Anthony Fauci has predicted that ""millions"" of Americans will test positive for Covid-19 The face of the US response to the coronavirus outbreak Dr Anthony Fauci said the White House virus task force would be examining its 15-day guidelines for social distancing, announced two weeks ago. The deadline will likely be extended, Dr Fauci told CNN on Sunday, depending on the availability of instant testing kits. ""Itâs going to be a matter of weeks. Itâs not going to be tomorrow and itâs certainly not going to be next week,"" he said. Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted that the US would see ""millions of cases"" and ""between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths"". US President Donald Trump and the Coronavirus Task Force are about to hold a press briefing to discuss their response to the

The food delivery service Deliveroo says it will make half a
million meals available to NHS staff for free during the coronavirus crisis. The London-based company has already received pledges of
350,000 free meals from partner restaurants to provide to frontline workers. Pizza Hut is offering 300,000 meals, while Itsu and Lewis
Hamiltonâs plant-based Neat Burger restaurant have also made donations. Meanwhile, a campaign to provide hospital staff with hot

Â£400,000 ($497,000). A similar campaign called Meals for the NHS has raised
more than Â£250,000. A Spanish Air Force plane carrying medical supplies donated by the Czech Republic has landed in Madrid. The aircraft, which touched down at TorrejÃ³n air base on Sunday, was stocked up with 10,000 protective medical suits and 90 respirators. The delivery was organised by Nato at the request of Spain, which has the second highest death toll from the virus in the world. Another delivery of a similar number of Czech medical suits will be made to Italy on Monday. Nato, a transatlantic military alliance,thanked the Czech Republic for its ""generous bilateral aid"",external, describing its contribution as ""solidarity in action"". Spain and Italy are the two worst-affected countries in Europe. Nato said the medical aid would be distributed by Spanish authorities Covid-19 has been characterised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), so you've probably heard that word used a lot. But how is that different from an epidemic? Dr Rosalind Eggo from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine looks at the difference. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? In the UK there are more than 19,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and at least 1,228 people who have tested positive have died. The virus was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January. Numbers are now increasing rapidly, and Sunday saw daily confirmed cases jump by more than 2,400 compared with the previous day. Most of the deaths in the UK have been in England, primarily in London. The capital has seen more than 400 fatalities so far. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has laughed off the suggestion that his country should try to stem the spread of the coronavirus, because he can't see the virus ""flying around"". Speaking to a TV reporter at an indoor ice hockey match, he also claimed that crowds at the match were fine because the coldness of the stadium would prevent the virus from spreading. There is no evidence that this could be the case and the coronavirus cannot be seen with the naked eye. Unlike most of Europe, Belarus has not placed any restrictions on sports events. ""There are no viruses here,"" Mr Lukashenko said. ""You haven't seen them flying around, have you? I don't see them either! This is a fridge. Sport, particularly the ice, this fridge here, that's the best antiviral cure!"" About 20,000 retired doctors and nurses are set to return to the NHS, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. In a video posted on Twitter, Mr Johnson thanked them for responding to the government's appeal for them to return. Letters weresent to more than 65,000 retired NHS workers in England and Wales last week, asking them to come back.

India defiant as millions struggle under lockdown,"This video can not be played Millions of people in India are struggling for food during the country's coronavirus lockdown The Indian government has defended its handling of the coronavirus outbreak after a strict lockdown - introduced with little warning - left millions stranded and without food. The country's response had been ""pre-emptive, pro-active and graded"", it said in a statement. India's population of 1.3 billion was given less than four hours' notice of the three-week lockdown on Tuesday. Officially about 900 people have coronavirus in India. However, experts worry that the real number of infections could be far higher. India has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, although efforts are under way to ramp up capacity. There are fears that an outbreak in the country - one of the world's most densely populated - could result in a catastrophe. So far 20 people are reported to have died. Migrant workers have been queuing in their thousands as they try to get home to their villages People are banned from leaving their homes under the ""total lockdown"" measures. All non-essential businesses have been closed and almost all public gatherings are banned. But there have been reports of long queues and panic buying as people struggle to get supplies. After the lockdown was announced, people in Delhi and the financial capital, Mumbai, quickly thronged shops and pharmacies amid fears of shortages. It prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to warn that panic buying would only spread the disease. He said the government would ensure there were sufficient supplies. Meanwhile, millions have been left jobless and without money as a result of the shutdown. It has sparked an exodus from major cities such as Delhi, where thousands of migrant workers are setting out on long journeys back to their home villages after transport was stopped. One worker died on Saturday after he attempted to walk a 168 mile (270km) journey back home, a police officials told Reuters news agency. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak On Saturdaythe Information and Broadcasting Ministry hit back against criticism,externalthat the measures were announced without planning. The government had already put in place a ""comprehensive response system"" at its borders before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January, it added. Several state governments have promised cash handouts to migrant workers, but there are concerns about the logistics of delivering the aid. Uttar Pradesh in the north is also putting on buses to help those who have been left stranded. Police are enforcing the 21-day lockdown Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread rapidly in other countries around the world. The city in China where the coronavirus pandemic began,Wuhan, has partially re-opened after more than two months of isolation.  People are being allowed to enter but not leave, according to reports. More than 600,000 infections have been confirmed globally and over 30,000 deaths, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University The death toll in Spain has exceeded 5,000, after it reported 832 more fatalities in the past 24 hours. Spain is the world's worst hit country after Italy The US now has the highest number of confirmed infections at 104,000 South Korea says that for the first time it now has more people who have recovered from the virus than are still infected. It reported 146 new cases on Saturday, taking the total to 9,478 - of whom 4,811 have been released from hospital Russia and Ireland are among the latest countries to bring in new restrictions to try to slow the spread of the virus.In Russia, shopping centres, restaurants and cafes have been ordered to close.

Trump 'considering quarantining New York',"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells reporters he is ""considering quarantine"" for some areas US President Donald Trump has said he is considering imposing a quarantine on New York state in a bid to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. ""We'd like to see [it] quarantined because it's a hotspot,"" he told reporters. ""I'm thinking about that."" He spoke as confirmed cases in the state increased to more than 52,000, about half of the total in the US. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the idea was ""preposterous"", ""anti-American"" and a ""declaration of war"". Mr Cuomo said the state had already implemented ""quarantine"" measures, such as banning major gatherings and ordering people to remain at home, but that he would oppose any ""lockdown"" efforts. ""If you said we were geographically restricted from leaving, that would be a lockdown,"" Mr Cuomo told CNN on Saturday. ""Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldn't make any sense,"" he said, adding that this would cause the stock market to crash in a way that would make it impossible for the US economy to ""recover for months, if not years"". ""You would paralyse the financial sector,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Cuomo earlier told reporters that he had spoken with Mr Trump by phone, but that the president hadn't mentioned a state ""quarantine"". ""I haven't had those conversations,"" he said, adding: ""I don't even know what that means."" Mr Cuomo said he would sue Rhode Island if the authorities there continued targeting New Yorkers and threatening to punish them for failing to quarantine. Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo has also described New York as a ""hot zone"", and has mobilised soldiers to seek out those leaving the state. New York state has the highest number of cases of Covid-19 in the US. Speaking before he left to visit a US Navy hospital ship in Virginia, Mr Trump said that ""New Jersey [and] certain parts of Connecticut"" could also be quarantined under the measures. ""We might not have to do it but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine â short term [for] two weeks,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

But Mr Cuomo, who was holding a daily press briefing at the time of Mr Trump's comments on Saturday, expressed concern at the idea. ""I don't know how that can be legally enforceable,"" he said. ""And from a medical point of view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing. ""But I can tell you I don't even like the sound of it. Not even understanding what it is, I don't like the sound of it."" New York's governor expressed concern at the idea of a quarantine Mr Trump did not provide further details about what quarantining New York or other badly hit US states would look like. But he said it would be aimed at slowing the spread of the virus to other parts of the US. ""They're having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don't want that,"" he said as he left the White House. Similar quarantine measures in other countries have involved widespread closures, bans on public gatherings and major restrictions on travel in and out of the affected area. The White House has said anyone leaving New York City should self-isolate for 14 days. On Friday, the governor of nearby Rhode Island deployed National Guard troops to stop cars with a New York licence plate to remind them of the state's restriction that they quarantine. Soldiers are going door-to-door in coastal vacation communities to ask if any residents have recently visited New York City. Analysis by Peter Bowes, BBC News, Los Angeles The quarantining of entire states would mark a significant and ominous ramping up of the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. There have been rumours for the past two weeks that a mandatory, national quarantine could be implemented, but this is the first time Mr Trump has indicated that state borders could be closed. The initial response of the governor of New York suggests an attempt by the federal government to quarantine the state could be problematic. While the president does have sweeping powers, especially during a national emergency, it is the role of state and local governments to take the lead in preventing the spread of disease. Mr Trump said there would be a decision very soon and that trade between states would not be affected. But if he goes ahead, such an order could be challenged in the courts. With more than 1,800 virus-related fatalities, the US death toll remains lower than those in Italy and China. But there are virus hotspots in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and Seattle. In his press briefing, Mr Cuomo said New York was postponing its presidential primary by almost two months until 23 June as a result of the outbreak. He also said the apex of the crisis would occur in the next 14 to 21 days. Mr Cuomo said the state would soon require 30,000 respiratory ventilators, which had increased in price to $45,000 (Â£36,000) each due to demand. He added that Mr Trump had approved the construction of four temporary hospitals. Demand for ventilators has also doubled in the southern state of Louisiana. Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would run out of ventilators by 2 April and possibly run out of hospital beds by 7 April if the number of new infections did not subside. ""It's not some flimsy theory. This is what is going to happen,"" he said. President Trump has ordered a car manufacturer in Detroit to produce more ventilators.

More widely, the mayors of most US cities have said they expect massive shortages of critical personal safety equipment in the coming weeks. On Saturday, Mr Trump watched as the USNS Comfort, a navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds aboard, left for New York from Virginia.  It will station itself at a Manhattan pier to deal with the overload of patients that New York expects. It came afterMr Trump signed a $2.2 trillion (Â£1.8tr) bailout billpassed by Congress on Friday, the largest fiscal stimulus in US history.

The times and life of the world's oldest man,"Bob Weighton, who was born in Hull, has previously said the secret to his longevity was ""to avoid dying"" Bob Weighton, the world's oldest man, turns 112 today. Born in 1908, he is the same age as Inter Milan football club, and pre-dates Selfridges department store and the beatification of Joan of Arc. As young Robert came into this world, Herbert Asquith was still a week from becoming British prime minister, and King Edward VII had two more years to live. Here we take a look at some of the little-known events that have happened on the birthdays of Mr Weighton, as he enjoys this one at his home in Alton, Hampshire. Herbert Asquith became prime minister in April 1908, Edward VII died in 1910 In 1908, Robert is the 15th most popular boys' name in England and Wales. It is flanked by Frank and Harold, while William, John and George claim the top spots. The favoured girls' names are Mary, Elizabeth, Florence and Annie. In a pleasing coincidence, Joan Hocquard, from Poole in Dorset, is also 112 today and so is the UK's joint-oldest person. Her name is fairly unusual - in 1908 Joan is the 161st most popular and doesn't really break through until the 1930s. Another Robert, Captain Robert Falcon Scott, of the British Antarctic Expedition, dies on Bob's fourth birthday. Scott and four others trudge 850 miles to reach the South Pole. They arrive on 17 January to find the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen has beaten them to it. Captain Robert Scott and his team were disappointed to find they had been beaten to the South Pole Edgar Evans is the first of Scott's team to die, followed a month later by Lawrence Oates. Henry Bowers, Edward Wilson and Scott huddle in a tent and try to sit out a storm while their food supplies dwindle. On 29 March, Scott writes ""it seems a pity but I do not think I can write more"". The men's bodies are found eight months later, just 11 miles from their next food store. Joan of Arc's beatification took place in Rome, in 1909. Pope Pius X is pictured praying in the centre of the choir On Bob's 10th birthday, British forces are struggling in the first Battle of Amman in the Ottoman Empire. Bad weather, boggy underfoot conditions and unrelenting attacks are among the factors that lead to the withdrawal of troops a couple of days later. Closer to home though, and maybe for a little light relief, the Times newspaper that day publishes an extract of the will of a Mr Astley Weston, who left not just money for his children, but advice too. Among other words of wisdom, he urges them to ""not take any intoxicating drinks or narcotics"" and to avoid ""extravagance, self-indulgence and indolence"". Finally, if they should consider marrying, they were to consult their mother and take her advice. Fast-forward now to 29 March 1927. A 19-year-old Bob might have been interested in what is happening on the sands of Florida's Daytona Beach, where the specially built Sunbeam 1000hp is revving its engine. Sir Henry Segrave was the first person to hold both land and water speed records at the same time Henry Segrave is determined to beat the land speed record and finally crack the 200mph mark. For official ratification, he has to complete two runs. Strong winds on the outward leg cause the car to skid violently. Segrave is forced to drive into the sea to slow down. Remarkably, he is able to make the return journey. The speeds clocked on the two runs are 200.668mph and 207.015mph, giving an average speed of 203.792mph. The car is restored 90 years later (when Bob is a youthful 109) and is on display at the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, Hampshire. The Sunbeam 1,000hp was built in Wolverhampton and nicknamed ""The Slug"" We have moved on to 29 March 1938. Bob turns 30 and the country is gearing up for war. In the House of Commons, a debate is raging aboutâ¦ the importation of rubber footwear. MPs are concerned that 2.5 million foreign rubber boots and shoes were shipped to the UK in the first two months of the year, threatening the interests of British shoemakers. The President of the Board of Trade reassures his colleagues that he will help protect the British market. Briton, 111, set to be named world's oldest man France insists world's 'oldest woman' was not fake Lessons of the worldâs most unique supercentenarians A fairly dull discussion, but perhaps worth it for the waggish contribution of the Glaswegian MP JJ Davidson, who pipes up to say: ""Does that mean that the President of the Board of Trade will not support the foreign heels?"" It is not recorded whether his fellow backbenchers find him funny. In 1943, Bob turns 35 on the same day John Major is born. In 1951, now 43, he could have taken the eight-year-old future prime minister to celebrate their birthdays by attending the opening night of The King and I on Broadway, starring Gertrude Lawrence and Yul Brynner. Lawrence is unaware she has liver and abdominal cancer, and faints backstage after a matinee before being admitted to hospital. Just 15 months later, she is dead. Gertrude Lawrence was the original Anna in the stage production of The King and I In 1955, on Bob's 47th birthday, a new world rail speed record is set by SNCF in France. The train reaches 331km/h (206mph), fast enough to damage the track. We're now at the end of the swinging 60s and Bob turns 61 in 1969, the day the Eurovision Song Contest ends in a four-way draw between the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands and France. Lulu Boom-bang-a-banged her way to joint first place for the Royaume-Uni The organisers manage to cobble enough winner's medals together by using the ones they have earmarked for (up to three) songwriters. Other countries are so annoyed by the tie that four withdraw from the following year's competition, and a tiebreak procedure is introduced shortly afterwards. On 29 March 1974, Bob celebrates his 66th birthday. Also on that day, a group of farmers digging a well find a life-sized human head made from clay buried near Xian in China. They call in the experts and a 2,200-year-old terracotta army is discovered. The discovery has been described as the greatest archaeological find of the 20th Century Three pits are found to contain more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots and 520 horses, thought to have been buried in order to help China's first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, in the afterlife. Bob could have marked his 72nd birthday by having a bet on the 134th Grand National, although he would have had to pick carefully. There are only four finishers in the 30-strong field in 1980. The race is won by the American-owned horse Ben Nevis, ridden by Charlie Fenwick at a starting price of 40-1. Ben Nevis lived until 1995 and was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 2009 Bob turns 82 in 1990 - on the same day as the outbreak of the little-known Hyphen War, a conflict over what to call Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Communist government the previous year. Slovak politicians feel ""the Czechoslovak Republic"" does not recognise Slovakia's equal stature, and want the state to be named ""the Czecho-Slovak Republic"". It is resolved when the two agree to split the country (over more substantial issues) and on 1 January 1993 the two states become the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Bob's 101st birthday in 2009 is a difficult one for then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, as the news breaks that she claimed parliamentary expenses for pay-per-view pornographic films. Jacqui Smith resigned from the front benches following the scandal The resulting scandal eventually leads to her resignation from the front benches, and in 2010 she loses her seat. The incident does, however, open up a new avenue for Ms Smith - in 2011 she presents a radio documentary about pornography. It is called Porn Again. In 2014, on Bob's 106th birthday, the first same-sex marriages in England and Wales take place. North Londoners and partners of 17 years Peter McGraith and David Cabreza become husband and husband at one minute past midnight. And finally, in 2020, Bob reaches his 112 birthday - although he has had to cancel his celebrations because of the coronavirus outbreak. He has lived through the reigns of five British monarchs, 22 UK prime ministers - serving a total of 27 terms - and 21 presidents of the USA. He was alive during all three London Olympics, and both world wars, and has weathered the Spanish flu, cholera and smallpox. It's anyone's guess as to what happens next year.

Coronavirus: What we still don't know about the virus,"It feels like an eternity ago, but the world only became aware of the coronavirus in December. Despite incredible efforts by scientists around the world, there is still much we do not understand, and we are all now part of a planet-wide experiment trying to find answers. Here are some of the big outstanding questions. It is one of the most basic questions, but also one of the most crucial. There have been hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases around the world, but this is only a fraction of the total number of infections. And the figures are further confused by an unknown number of asymptomatic cases - people who have the virus but don't feel ill. Developing an antibody test will allow researchers to see whether anyone has had the virus. Only then will we understand how far or how easily the coronavirus is spreading. Until we know how many cases there have been, it is impossible to be certain of the death rate. At the moment the estimate is thataround 1% of people infected with the virus die.But if there are large numbers of asymptomatic patients, the death rate could be lower. The main symptoms of coronavirus are a fever and a dry cough - these are the ones you should be on the look out for. A sore throat, headache and diarrhoea have also been reported in some cases and there is mounting speculation that a loss of sense of smell may affect some. But the most important question is whether mild, cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose or sneezing, are present in some patients. Studies have suggested this is a possibility and that people could potentially be infectious without knowing they are carrying the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Children can definitely catch coronavirus. However, they mostly develop mild symptoms and there are relatively few deaths among children compared with other age groups. Children are normally super-spreaders of disease, partly because they mix with lots of people (often in the playground), but with this virus, it is not clear to what extent they help spread it. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, where there was a cluster of cases at an animal market. The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, is closely related to viruses that infect bats, however it is thought the virus was passed from bats to a mystery animal species that then passed it on to people. That ""missing link"" remains unknown, and could be a source of further infections. Colds and flu are more common in the winter months than in the summer, but it is not yet known whether the warmer weather will alter the spread of the virus. The UK government's scientific advisers have warned it is unclear whether there will be a seasonal effect. If there is one, they think it is likely to be smaller than that for colds and flu. If there is a major dip in coronavirus over the summer, there is a danger that cases will spike in winter, when hospitals are also having to deal with an influx of patients with the usual winter bugs. Covid-19 is a mild infection for most. However around 20% go on to develop more severe disease, but why? The state of a person's immune system seems to be part of the issue, and there may be some genetic factor too. Understanding this could lead to ways of preventing people from needing intensive care. There has been much speculation but little evidence on how durable any immunity to the virus is. Patients must have built up an immune response, if they successfully fight off the virus. But as the disease has been around for only a few months there is a lack of long-term data. Rumours of patients being infected twice may be down to tests incorrectly saying they were free of the virus. The question of immunity is vital for understanding what will happen in the long term. Viruses mutate all the time, but most alterations to their genetic code do not make a significant difference. As a general rule, you expect viruses to evolve to be less deadly in the long run, but this is not guaranteed. The concern is that if the virus mutates, then the immune system no longer recognises it and a specific vaccine no longer works (as happens with flu).

"Things to get worse, PM says in letter to Britons","The prime minister chaired Saturday morning's Covid-19 meeting via video-link The prime minister has warned that the coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets better, in a letter being sent to every UK household. Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, says stricter restrictions could be put in place if necessary. Britons will also get a leaflet detailing government rules on leaving the house and health information. It follows criticism over the clarity of government advice to date. The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has now reached 1,019, with a further 260 deaths announced on Saturday. There are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK. In the letter being sent to 30 million households at an anticipated cost of Â£5.8m, Mr Johnson writes: ""From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time. ""We will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do."" Toughmeasures to tackle the spread of coronavirus,,externalincluding a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and the closure of shops selling non-essential goods, were introduced last week. LIVE:Latest updates on the crisis A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health ""It's important for me to level with you - we know things will get worse before they get better,"" the letter reads. ""But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal."" Experts have said they expect the number of coronavirus cases and deaths to continue to rise for the next two to three weeks, before the effects of social distancing measures and restrictions on everyday life begin to have an impact. Responding to reports current measures could be in place until June, Scotland's chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House: ""The modelling that's been done, and that I have seen, has always said that we need at least 13 weeks of some sort of measures in order to really get this virus away from spreading amongst people. ""When you have a shorter period of time, as I understand other countries have done, as soon as you lift the measures the virus comes back again because you haven't stopped it transmitting amongst lots of people."" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove declined to say how long the restrictions might last but said everyone ""has to prepare for a significant period where these measures are still in place"". ""I wish I could predict when this will end,"" he said. The date of the peak of the virus ""depends on all of our behaviour"", he added, saying: ""It's not a fixed point"". This video can not be played How staying at home can stop coronavirus In his letter, Mr Johnson describes the pandemic as a ""moment of national emergency"", and reiterates the government guidance to stay at home to avoid putting pressure on the NHS, so that lives can be saved. The prime minister acknowledges the restrictions will have a financial impact on families. However, writing after ministers unveiled billions of pounds of help for workers and businesses, he says: ""The government will do whatever it takes to help you make ends meet and put food on the table."" Mr Johnson also praises the work of doctors, nurses and other carers as well as well as the hundreds of thousands of people who have volunteered to help the most vulnerable. The leaflet sent alongside the letter includes guidance on hand-washing, an explanation of coronavirus symptoms, the government rules on leaving the house and advice on shielding vulnerable people.

Meanwhile, new powers, including fines of up to Â£5,000, to enforce guidelines on people staying at home and businesses staying closedcame into force in Northern Irelandon Saturday evening. The maximum fine will be reserved for businesses but individuals could face a fine of up to Â£960 if they do not comply. In England and Wales,people ignoring restrictions could be hit with a Â£60 fine initially and another Â£120 for a second offence. Fines in England will rise to a maximum of Â£960 for repeat offences. It comes as former Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested ""mass testing"" was needed to avoid another surge of virus cases when restrictions are finally eased, telling Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""You need a very clear understanding of who has got it and who hasn't."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said,externalthe government was now testing 10,000 people a day, and was ""on track"" to test 25,000 by mid-April.
