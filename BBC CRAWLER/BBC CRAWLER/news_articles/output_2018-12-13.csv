Here's our basic guide. UK withdrawal deal 'not open for renegotiation' 1. The European Council reconfirms its conclusions of 25 November 2018, in which it endorsed
the Withdrawal Agreement and approved the Political Declaration. The Union stands by this
agreement and intends to proceed with its ratification. It is not open for renegotiation. 2. The European Council reiterates that it wishes to establish as close as possible a partnership
with the United Kingdom in the future. It stands ready to embark on preparations immediately
after signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations can start as soon as
possible after the UKâs withdrawal. 3. The European Council underlines that the backstop is intended as an insurance policy to
prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and ensure the integrity of the Single Market. It
is the Unionâs firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes
by 31 December 2020 alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be
triggered. 4. The European Council also underlines that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered,
it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that
ensures that a hard border is avoided. In such a case, the Union would use its best endeavours
to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the
backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only
be in place for as long as strictly necessary. 5. The European Council calls for work on preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the
United Kingdomâs withdrawal to be intensified, taking into account all possible outcomes. Labour frontbencher Angela Rayner says holding another referendum could ""make us more divided"". The EU27 Brexit talks over dinner have ended, the European Council tweets. Theresa May left before the talks began. EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are to give a press conference now.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor writes: Sources have confirmed that one of the ideas being considered in Brussels to improve the controversial backstop is a start date for the future trade relationship between the UK and the EU beyond Brexit, rather than trying to agree an end date for the Irish border guarantee. Tory MPs have demanded changes to the divorce agreement with the EU over the backstop, to make it clear that it could not last for ever, and the UK could terminate the arrangement on its own. The idea of a start date for the relationship beyond Brexit is only one of the ideas being discussed by the EU and the UK. The Spanish government says it has drawn up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, but for now it is not divulging details, to avoid ""unnecessary alarm"". Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, speaking in Madrid, said ministries were working on the basis that Spain would guarantee the rights that UK citizens living in Spain currently enjoy, ""if the rights of Spaniards in the UK are guaranteed"". In 2017 an estimated 310,000 UK expats were living in Spain,the fact-checking website fullfact.org reported.,external That is the largest group of UK expats in the whole of the EU - the next largest contingents are in Ireland and France. Mr Borrell said UK expats would simply have to register as foreign residents. Spain is also negotiating an accord with the UK to let expats keep their right to vote in local elections, he said. The impact of Brexit on Gibraltar has become a thorny issue between Spain and the UK.It nearly torpedoed the withdrawal dealagreed at the last Brexit summit in November.

Theresa May began her bid to solve the Irish border problem, which MPs say is a roadblock to backing her deal with the EU, on Tuesday. Her efforts started with a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Two days later, she is back in his company again - having survived a confidence vote in her leadership. And he has nothing but praise for her. ""She's a great leader,"" he tells BBC's Newsnight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pictures from Brussels appeared to show a warm reception for Mrs May, as she returned to the EU fold to seek assurances over the Irish border. There were hugs from France's Emmanuel Macron, Luxembourg's Xavier Bettel and a word in the ear from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Earlier, the Irish PM Leo Varadkar, pictured below, said measures to avoid customs checks on the island of Ireland if there's no trade deal - known as the backstop - are not up for negotiation. Theresa May has just left the summit of EU leaders in Brussels. She made no comments to the media, but got straight into her car. The other 27 leaders will now discuss Brexit, the European Council spokesman says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When Sir Graham Brady revealed the outcome of the vote on Theresa May's leadership last night, it wasn't only the result that had TV viewers transfixed. The venue and atmosphere of table banging and roaring approval didn't pass without comment. Our colleagues have been busy finding out more about committee room 14 and what gives it its other-worldly aura. Read about ithere. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor says: ""It feels like there are three people in this relationship: the EU, which doesnât want to budge; two different sides of the Conservative Party; and Theresa May stuck in the middle of all three... ""Sheâll be pleading to be flexible on the trickiest part of the [Brexit] compromise, but the tone from the EU top brass is that there is nothing straightforward about making a change. ""Publicly admitting that she will step down before the next election tells us that for Theresa May her options are running out fast."" EU diplomats have told Reuters news agency that an addendum attached to the EU trade deal with Canada (Ceta) could be a model for appeasing MPs hostile to Theresa May's Brexit deal. Ceta was blocked at the last minute in 2016 by left-wing politicians in Belgium's Wallonia region, who demanded extra safeguards. Reuters recalls that the fix was
a 12-page ""Joint Interpretative Instrument"" - an EU document explaining how the Ceta deal would work. The Ceta dealwas only approved after nearly eight years of negotiations.  Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel says Brexit threatens 70,000 jobs in Belgium ""if there is no good agreement that protects our economic interests and our citizens"". He promised to be vigilant to ensure ""stability and responsibility"". Research by the House of Commons Library shows,externalthat in 2017 the UK's total exports to the rest of the EU were worth Â£274bn. Total imports from the EU were Â£342bn. The EU accounted for 44.5% of the UK's exports and 53% of the UK's imports. UK imports from Belgium were 4.4% of total imports, and exports to Belgium were 3% of the total. Allow Twitter content?

Truce breakthrough in Yemen talksThe UN says it hopes this is the starting point for ending the nation's war and humanitarian crisis.Middle East,"The Houthi (left ) and Yemeni government delegates shake hands in Stockholm Warring parties in Yemen have agreed to a ceasefire for the port city of Hudaydah, principal lifeline for two-thirds of the country. They reached agreement at talks in Sweden brokered by the United Nations. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he hoped this would be the starting point to bring nearly four years of civil war to a close. Fighting has killed thousands, while the world's worst humanitarian crisis in recent times has afflicted millions. Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Why is there a war in Yemen? Leaders of the delegations from the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, who control much of the country, shook hands after the ceasefire was agreed on Thursday. Hudaydah is one of the areas controlled by the rebels. All forces from the Houthi rebels will withdraw from Hudaydah in the coming days, as will those from the Yemeni government alliance fighting them there. Yemen war: Billions in aid, but where's it going? They will be replaced by what the UN called local forces. Houthi forces would also withdraw from the ports of Saleef and Ras Isa. Mr Guterres said the ceasefire would then take place for the whole of the Hudaydah governorate. The UN would then play a ""leading role"" in monitoring the ports and would help distribute aid to civilians, he added. Thursday's agreements could ""be a starting point for peace and for ending [the] humanitarian crisis in Yemen"", Mr Guterres said. A ""mutual understanding"" was announced on the nation's third city of Taiz, where these has been intense fighting, although few details were released. This video can not be played About two-thirds of Yemen's population is reliant on food aid There is no agreement yet on a truce for the rest of the country, including the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis. Mr Guterres said he hoped for a deal within a week on reopening Sanaa airport. He said a new round of talks would take place at the end of January on other issues. The Stockholm talks were the first in two years between the Houthis and the Yemeni government, which has had the backing of a Saudi-led coalition since 2015. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The World Health Organization warned in October that about 10,000 new suspected cases of cholera were now being reported every week. Why Hudaydah matters Yemen crisis: The battle for Hudaydah.

May: I won't lead Tories into election,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I think it is right that the party feels the party would prefer to go into that election with a new leader"" Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not lead the Conservative Party into the next general election. She said the party would prefer to ""to go into that election with another leader"", as she arrived in Brussels for an EU summit. It confirms what she told MPs ahead of a confidence vote triggered by MPs angry at her Brexit policy. Mrs May won the vote but has vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her. The next scheduled general election is in 2022. Live updates: Fallout from May's confidence vote Kuenssberg: May goes public with end-date pledge Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? Runners and riders: Who could replace Theresa May? May vote leaves Europe media unimpressed Mrs May said: ""I've said that in my heart I would love to be able to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election but I think it is right that the party feels that they would prefer to go into that election with another leader."" Asked whether she would quit after Brexit, she declined to discuss dates but added: ""What I'm clear about is the next general election is in 2022 and I think it's right that another party leader take us into that general election."" The prime minister said she hoped to ""assuage"" the concerns of Tory MPs who voted against her by seeking legal ""assurances"" from EU leaders that the backstop plan to prevent the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland would be temporary. Mrs May has left the summit for the evening after addressing EU leaders over Brexit Critics say Mrs May's backstop plan will keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. The EU says it will not renegotiate the backstop, but may agree to give greater assurances on its temporary nature. It seems unlikely that would win over enough support for her Brexit plan to have a realistic chance of getting through the House of Commons, with tensions heightened in the Conservative Party in the wake of Wednesday evening's confidence vote. Downing Street confirmed on Thursday that the MPs' ""meaningful vote"" on the deal will not now take place before Christmas - it was abandoned this week when Mrs May admitted it would have been ""rejected by a significant margin"". The PM's spokeswoman said it would happen ""as soon as possible in January"". The prime minister's admission that she'll leave office before the next election fended off yesterday's clamour from a chunk of her party to go. But it hardly makes things easier from today onwards. Just as she is desperate to get a time limit on the controversial ""backstop"", she now has a limit on her time in office. Now it is public, in her own words, questions won't just be about her impossible Brexit agreement but also about how, and when, she will finally go. Read more from Laura here Earlier this week, the prime minister travelled to meet EU leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, to raise the issues surrounding the withdrawal agreement at Westminster one-on-one. But a trip to meet the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had to be cancelled because of the leadership vote. At Thursday's summit, Mrs May has the opportunity to spell out face-to-face the problems she faces to leaders of all the other 27 member states. The EU leaders will then consider what could be done - without Mrs May in the room. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: A really simple guide Theresa May said she had listened to the concerns of the MPs who had voted against her, adding that she knew what was needed to get her deal ""over the line"". ""I've already met [Irish Premier] Leo Varadkar, I'm going to be addressing the European Council later and I'll be showing the legal and political assurances that I believe we need to assuage the concerns that MPs have on this issue."" She added: ""I don't expect an immediate breakthrough but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary."" Sebastian Kurz: 'Additional explanations' might be needed Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the European Council, said: ""I believe that Theresa May knows that there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement."" But he said that it might be possible to ""provide a little better explanation or definition or go into detail"" on the provisions of the agreement. ""Hopefully that will allow Theresa May to bring a vote in January and obtain a majority,"" he said. ""If the British prime minister thinks one or another additional explanation can be helpful before she brings it to a vote, then we should do that."" Asked what concessions might succeed in winning over Mrs May's domestic critics, Mr Kurz said: ""It is difficult to judge, because many of the sceptics do not argue in a way that is really rational."" Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader and a Brexiteer who voted against Mrs May in Wednesday's vote, said he wanted to ""send a strong message"" to the PM. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We cannot go on just with the idea that a fiddle here and a fiddle there is what the problem is."" Instead, he said Mrs May should say that the Â£39bn the UK has agreed to pay the EU as part of the divorce deal is ""at risk"". ""They have got to say to the EU... we are not committed to this Â£39bn unless we get some resolution."" How long can Theresa May survive as PM? What does Ireland do if thereâs no deal? How did we get here? Listen: Emergency Brexitcast podcast on May vote For or against? How Tory MPs said they would vote Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is against Brexit, told BBC Breakfast: ""We are still back with the problem that the government has a proposal that we can't get through Parliament and we have got to try and break that gridlock."" He called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""come off the fence"" and back another public vote on Brexit. Labour has said that it will table a no-confidence motion in Theresa May's government that all MPs - not just Conservatives - will be able to vote in - but only when they felt they had a chance of winning it, and forcing a general election. But the DUP - which props up Mrs May's government - said it would not support such a motion at this stage. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell urged Theresa May to work with Labour on getting a deal with the EU that ""will protect jobs and the economy"". He said there was an ""overwhelming majority"" in the Commons against a no-deal Brexit but the prime minister should now hold a series of votes to establish what other options MPs were willing to accept. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, announces May survive confidence vote The prime minister won the confidence vote with a majority of 83 - 63% of Conservative MPs backing her and 37% voting against her. A split was still clear in the Tory party after the result. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for the confidence vote, said losing the support of a third of her MPs was a ""terrible result for the prime minister"" and he urged her to resign. But Nicholas Soames urged Brexiteers to ""throw their weight"" behind the PM as she sought to address the ""grave concerns"" many MPs had about aspects of the EU deal. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said his party was also still concerned about the Irish backstop plan, telling BBC News: ""I don't think this vote really changes anything very much in terms of the arithmetic.""

Kuenssberg: It's official,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I think it is right that the party feels the party would prefer to go into that election with a new leader"" It's official. Theresa May has justconfirmed publiclywhat she told her MPs last night - she will step down before the next general election. Not surprisingly she had no desire to get drawn into a conversation about a date of departure, telling us that her focus was getting an improved Brexit agreement and getting the deal ""over the line"". But despite obvious demands at home from her MPs to change tack in the negotiations, No 10 seems to have little expectation of anything happening fast here, warning against an ""immediate breakthrough"". But few in her party at home believe she has a genuine chance of getting a fundamentally different version of the deal - at least not at this summit. May asking for EU 'backstop assurances' How long can May survive as PM? And minds are starting to focus on who, or what, might work instead. The prime minister's admission that she'll leave office before the next election fended off yesterday's clamour from a chunk of her party to go. But it hardly makes things easier from today onwards. Just as she is desperate to get a time limit on the controversial""backstop"", she now has a limit on her time in office. Now it is public, in her own words, questions won't just be about her impossible Brexit agreement but also about how, and when, she will finally go. As wediscussed here earlier, it's one thing for prime ministers to tell their colleagues in private that they will get out of the way, as part of some kind of political trade. To say it in public is an entirely different event - a message to the public that can't be taken back. PS: Don't all shout at once - of course, this is the same prime minister who said, time and time again, that she would not have a snap election and then, lo, and behold, she changed her mind completely. She seemed powerful then though - she and the rest of Westminster is living in a different reality now, although... never, say never.

Who could succeed May?,"Theresa May won a vote of confidence on Wednesday evening, which was called after the required 48 letters demanding a contest were submitted. But despite winning, her future looks far from certain. Here - based on the latest odds at the bookmakers - are the fancied runners tipped to be vying for the top job, if and when Mrs May's tenure as prime ministers comes to an end. None has so far declared their intention to stand. Boris Johnson, 54, was the face of the campaign to get Britain out of the EU and did little to disguise his disappointment with Mrs May's Brexit plan, eventuallyresigning as foreign secretary over it. The former London mayor has long harboured leadership ambitions and isa big favourite with Conservative Party members,externalbut he would first have to get the backing of enough MPs to make into the ballot of members - no easy task. His first bid for the leadership, following the 2016 referendum, ended in disaster after fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the 11th hour and put himself forward instead, prompting Mr Johnson to withdraw from the race. Dominic Raab, 44, had already been a long-standing Eurosceptic when he became part of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. The former Brexit secretary resigned in Novemberover what he described as ""fatal flaws"" in the prime ministers draft Brexit agreement. The former lawyer has refused to rule out standing in a leadership contest and is said to be ""relaxed"" about a no-deal scenario, which will appeal to Brexiteer MPs. He warned on Thursday that if Mrs May continues as prime minister, there is a ""greater risk of a Jeremy Corbyn government"". He added: ""We will have to back her as best we can but the problem is that both in relation to Brexit and the wider sustainability of the government, given the likelihood of any changes to the deal, given the likely scale of opposition, it looks very difficult to see how this prime minister can lead us forward."" A former protege of George Osborne, 49-year-old Sajid Javid became the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background in April, following Amber Rudd's resignation. Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the 2016 referendum. An MP since 2010, he has previously served as business secretary and then culture secretary, and was part of a short-lived ""joint ticket"" leadership bid in 2016, hoping to become chancellor with Stephen Crabb as PM. After the vote, he tweeted: ""Right, vote over. Time to come together, deliver Brexit and so much more."" Michael Gove, 51, made a dramatic comeback in June 2017 when he returned to the cabinet as environment secretary, just a year after he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle following Mrs May's leadership victory. The former justice and education secretary came third in the last leadership contest, after withdrawing his support from fellow Leave campaigner Boris Johnson and deciding to stand himself. Mr Gove has not ruled himself out to succeed Mrs May but played down speculation, saying it was ""extremely unlikely"" he would stand and tweeting on Wednesday that he was ""backing the Prime Minister 100%"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, 52, had always been seen as a Eurosceptic but was one of the figures supporting the David Cameron Remain position during the 2016 referendum. Mr Hunt, who was the longest serving health secretary in the history of the NHS before being promoted to foreign secretary, is considered a close ally of Theresa May. However he has faced a number of controversies during his career, including a battle over a new contract for junior doctors in 2015. Mr Hunt tweeted his congratulations to Mrs May after the vote, saying her ""stamina, resilience and decency has again won the day"". The former Brexit secretary was the first minister to quit over Mrs May's Chequers plan in July, saying he couldn't back a policy he didn't believe in. An MP since 1987, Mr Davis, 69, first stood to be Conservative leader in 2001 and was an overwhelming favourite to replace Michael Howard in 2005 but lost out to David Cameron. He went on to serve as shadow home secretary under Mr Cameron but dramatically resigned his seat and frontbench role in protest at plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge. He successfully fought a by-election and returned to the backbenches before unexpectedly being propelled back into frontline politics as Brexit secretary after the 2016 referendum. Amber Rudd only returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary in November afterresigning as home secretary over the Windrush scandal. She was a leading Remain campaigner in the 2016 referendum and although being a vocal supporter of the PM's Brexit plan, she has also proposed an alternative, which would see the UK being more closely tied to the EU. The 55-year-old MP has a slim majority of 346 in her Hastings constituency and the risk of losing her seat could hinder her chances. On Thursday, she said the vote has put an end to the leadership question. She said Mrs May has ""got the support of the party behind her"" and that she hopes the government can now get on with delivering a successful exit from the EU.

Primary school tables - check your school here,"As new primary school data is released, BBC analysis suggests it will take 50 years to close the achievement gap between England's rich and poor pupils. If the pace of change remains the same as it has done since 2011, poor pupils will not catch up until 2070, it shows. This year, 51% of the poorest pupils reached the expected level in their national end-of-primary school tests. This compares with 70% of their better-off peers, leaving a gap of 19 percentage points.

What's in the school league tables? League tables are the shop window of every school, and parents often use them to help choose schools for their children. They are based on the performance of pupils in each school in their end-of-primary national curriculum tests, known as Sats. This year was the third time children sat the government's tougher tests, introduced in 2016. The tables give a snapshot of how each school is performing in results and pupil progress but they also provide a huge amount of data on education at a national level. The government has said the attainment of disadvantaged pupils is a key aim of its education policies. The achievement gap has shrunk every year since 2011 but at a slow pace. If this pace continues, the gap in attainment at this early age will not close until at least 2070, BBC analysis reveals. To assess this gap, the government uses pupils' results in reading and maths tests. These are ranked from best to worst as if they were the results of a race. On average, poorer pupils rank worse. This difference in average ranking between poorer and better-off children is the disadvantage gap. The current gap shows that poorer children would sit 2.9 places further back on average in a ranking of 20 poorer and 20 better-off children. This video can not be played Explaining the disadvantage gap in primary school test results School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said: ""Standards are rising in our schools, with 86% of schools now rated good or outstanding as of August 2018, compared to 68% in 2010 and these statistics show that the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has closed by 13% since 2011."" In 2011, the disadvantage gap was 3.3 places, it is now 2.9 places, having closed by 13% or 0.4 places. Mr Gibb added: ""Every child, regardless of their background, deserves a high quality education and opportunity to fulfil their potential."" This video can not be played The BBC's Education Editor Branwen Jeffreys explains primary league tables Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""Schools make incredible efforts to guarantee that every child gets the best possible start in life. ""For their troubles, each year they find themselves propelled to the top or condemned to the bottom of a league table based solely on a few short tests of young children in a small number of subjects. This entirely wrong, so we shouldn't celebrate too loudly, or berate too strongly. He added: ""Successive governments have raised the stakes when it comes to Sats and league tables. Whilst the results have always carried a high level of importance, over time the pressure surrounding them has increased. ""One year's dodgy data can make an effective school leader suddenly feel very vulnerable. A system built on this sort of fear is not a healthy one."" Children are counted as disadvantaged if they are eligible for the pupil premium, that is if they have been eligible for free school meals at any point during the past six years or have been in care continuously for at least six months. Data published in July revealed 64% of pupils met the expected standard across all tests: reading, writing and mathematics - up from 61% the previous year. What's in the school league tables?

How to watch the Geminid meteor shower,"The Geminid meteor shower is considered to be one of the best displays in the night sky, and this year will peak during the early hours of Friday. Long, glowing arcs of white, yellow, blue, red and green will streak across the Northern Hemisphere sky. You should be able to catch as many as 120 shooting stars an hour over the next night or so. Most meteor showers are caused by comets - huge clumps of ice -but the Geminids are different. The Geminid meteors originate from a rocky asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon. Each year, the Earth passes through a trail of debris left by the asteroid as it orbits around the Sun. When the debris hits our planet's atmosphere - at speeds of up to 70 kilometres per second - they burn up, producing streaks of light. The streaks in the sky, known as meteors, can be caused by particles as small as a grain of sand. If you trace the paths that the meteors take, they seem to originate from the Gemini constellation. Around the world, the shower will peak on 13 December or 14 December, depending on your time zone. In the UK, the best time to see them will be between midnight and dawn on 14 December, but you can start looking any time after sunset. Allow Twitter content?

Branson's Virgin reaches edge of space,"Virgin Galactic's plane will be carried to a height of 12,000m before its rocket ignites The latest test flight by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic successfully rocketed to the edge of space and back. The firm's SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship reached a height of 82.7km, beyond the altitude at which US agencies have awarded astronaut wings. It marked the plane's fourth test flight and followed earlier setbacks in the firm's space programme. Sir Richard is in a race with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to send the first fee-paying passengers into space. He founded the commercial spaceflight company in 2004, shortly after Mr Musk started SpaceX and Jeff Bezos established Blue Origin. Champagne for space tourists takes flight The billionaires fuelling a space race In 2008, Virgin Galactic first promised sub-orbital spaceflight trips for tourists would be taking place ""within 18 months"". It has since regularly made similar promises to have space flights airborne in the near future. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But delays and a fatal crash in 2014 prevented Sir Richard's original ambitions. On Thursday, the SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship took off from the Mojave Desert in California. The company said the space ship's motor burned for 60 seconds, travelling at 2.9 times the speed of sound as it gained height. The rocket carried two pilots and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger, as well as four research experiments for NASA.

The US government has awarded astronaut wings to pilots who ventured farther than roughly 80km beyond earth's surface. But Thursday's flight did not breach the 100km Karman Line, which many organisations use to resolve debates about where space begins. While the trip marked a milestone for Virgin Galactic, the firm's rivals have already ventured farther - albeit without humans on board. SpaceX, in partnership with NASA, is planning crewed missions for early next year. Mr Bezos has also said Blue Origin plans to send its first crew to space in 2019. Virgin Galactic, which is charging $250,000 for a 90-minute flight, has said more than 600 people have bought tickets or put down deposits for an eventual voyage.

Senate defies Trump with Saudi war vote,"This video can not be played Senators slam Saudi crown prince as 'crazy' and a 'wrecking ball' The US Senate has voted to withdraw US military aid for Saudi Arabia's war on Yemen and to blame the kingdom's crown prince for the murder of a journalist. The historic vote is the first time any chamber of US Congress has agreed to pull US forces from a military conflict under the 1973 War Powers Act. Some of President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans defied him to pass the measure with Democrats by 56-41. But the resolution is seen as largely symbolic and unlikely to become law. Senators rebuke Trump with Yemen vote Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far The non-binding ""war powers resolution"" calls upon President Trump to remove all American forces engaging in hostilities in Yemen, except for those combating Islamist extremists. The Senate then unanimously passed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi's murder in October, and insisting that the kingdom hold accountable those responsible. The US chose to cease refuelling Saudi war planes last month, and Thursday's resolution - if it were ultimately passed into law - would prohibit that practice from resuming. President Trump has consistently defended US business and military ties with Saudi Arabia Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who co-sponsored the measure with Republican Mike Lee of Utah, hailed the vote. ""Today we tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventures,"" he said. He described the outcome as a signal to ""the world that the United States of America will not continue to be part of the worst humanitarian disaster on the face of the earth"". Republican Senator Bob Corker told MSNBC: ""If he was before a jury, the crown prince, he would be convicted in my opinion in 30 minutes."" Analysis by Barbara Plett, BBC State Department Correspondent The two resolutions send a strong message that for a majority of senators, the status quo with Saudi Arabia is no longer acceptable. They value the strategic relationship but are deeply uneasy about the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They have viewed his foreign interventions with growing concern, especially the human cost of the war in Yemen. But it was the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi that tipped the scales: it dramatically increased support for the resolution to withdraw US military support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, something that failed to pass earlier in the year. Many senators saw the Khashoggi killing as the blatantly egregious act of an ally that felt immune from rebuke. And they were dismayed when the administration stood staunchly by the prince without censure, even though the CIA concluded he probably ordered the killing. Senators want to see the administration shape the alliance as the senior partner, and enforce red lines. Senior Republican Senator Bob Corker noted recently that much of the bipartisan activism in the Senate had been fuelled by a perception that there is no balance between values and interests in the administration's policies. President Trump has vowed to veto the measure, and it is unlikely right now to pass the House of Representatives, which on Wednesday blocked a vote on the matter. But Senator Sanders said he expects the resolution to succeed once Democrats formally take over control of the House in January following their mid-term elections victory. The Trump administration had argued the bill would undercut US support for the Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. White House officials have emphasised US economic ties to the kingdom. Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has continued to cultivate ties with the prince, according to the US media. Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Why is there a war in Yemen? A ceasefire agreed by the warring parties on Thursday has come into effect in the country's main port, Hudaydah. Afterthe deal was reached in Sweden, negotiators for both parties shook hands to applause, though they later expressed scepticism. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he hoped this would be the starting point to bring nearly four years of civil strife to a close. Since hostilities began in 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed, and around 14 million people have been pushed to the brink of starvation, according to the UN. Saudi Arabia buys the bulk of its weapons from the US, Britain and France. Truce breakthrough in Yemen talks Senators rebuke Trump with Yemen vote Billions raised but where's it all going?

Ashley: Debenhams snubbed my ÃÂ£40m lifeline,"Sports Direct's owner Mike Ashley has written a bluntly worded letter to the boss of Debenhams discussing his offer of a Â£40m investment in the struggling department store chain. The letter, addressed to Sergio Bucher, suggests without the money the company ""has zero chance of survival"". Mr Ashley writes he is frustrated Debenhams doesn't want his ""help"". In the letter,published by the Daily Telegraph,external, he adds he wasn't surprised ""by the predictable negative response"". Sports Direct already owns 30% of Debenhams, which is closing up to 50 of its stores and seeking new finance following a downturn in its business. Allow Twitter content?

Debenhams issued a statement saying it welcomed Sports Direct's proposal ""as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company"". ""However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process."" Sports Direct denies it wants Debenhams to fail Mike Ashley, the saviour of the High Street? Debenhams closure plan threatens 4,000 jobs Mr Ashley, who is the majority owner of Sports Direct, said he was concerned that Debenhams didn't appreciate the position it was in and urged Mr Bucher to accept his offer. He wrote ""the market"" was saying that Debenhams had no credit insurance and that banks were advising clients to be wary about being in credit to Debenhams. In the context of a very difficult climate for retailers Mr Ashley added he couldn't see how the proposal to inject money into the department store chain could be ""seen or portrayed as a negative"". ""If I'm sounding extremely frustrated - well I am. We've seen this before, with Blacks and HoF [House of Fraser]. They didn't want any help either. ""We don't want to see Debenhams fail. It's not in our interest to see it fail, but without something changing rapidly all of the shareholders risk getting wiped out."" However, some observers have suggested that Mr Ashley may have motives  other than reinvigorating Debenhams' fortunes. They argue the offer of a cash injection may be designed to place Sports Direct in a better position to accrue assets, should Debenhams go into administration next year. Shares in Sports Direct dropped sharply on Thursday, by more than 10%, after the firm held a conference call with analysts to discuss the firm's half-yearly results. The purchase of House of Fraser had led to a 27% fall in profits, but investors also focused on a response that Mr Ashley gave to a question about current trading in his core sports retail business. His response that November's trading was ""unbelievably bad"" was taken as an indication that Sports Direct was feeling the squeeze affecting many High Street retailers. However, Sports Direct later issued a clarification stating that Mr Ashley was not issuing a further profit warning. The firm said that while the House of Fraser acquisition would result in a drop in earnings for the full year, as indicated in the half-yearly report, otherwise their forecast for full year profits to grow 5-15% had not changed.

Russian in US spy case pleads guilty,"Maria Butina has been held in an adult detention centre in Virginia since July A Russian woman accused in the US of acting as an agent for the Kremlin to infiltrate political groups has pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors. Gun rights activist Maria Butina, 30, admitted a single count of conspiracy at a court in Washington DC. She allegedly tried to infiltrate the National Rifle Association (NRA) in an effort to influence US policies in favour of Moscow. Butina initially pleaded not guilty. She has been in custody since July. She has also agreed to co-operate with investigators. Prosecutors expect the deal will give them information about Russia's efforts to interfere in US politics. The gun activist at the centre of conspiracy case Her lawyer, Robert Driscoll, estimates that she could face up to six months in prison, Reuters news agency reports. She is being held at an adult detention centre in Virginia, and a sentencing hearing has been set for 12 February. The case has no connection with the Mueller inquiry into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election in an attempt to secure victory for Donald Trump. Born in the southern Siberian city of Barnaul in 1988, according to her Facebook page, she has enjoyed using weapons ever since she was a child, picking up a gun for the first time at the age of 10. In 2011, she set up the Right to Bear Arms group and called for the sale of short-barrelled firearms to civilians to be made legal. Butina began travelling to the US for NRA conventions. In 2015 she attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas, asking the presidential candidate about his views on US sanctions against Russia. By 2016 she had a student visa to study for a master's degree at American University in Washington DC. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher in Washington In some ways, Maria Butina was like any other young, ambitious, aspiring political player in Washington DC trying to network their way to power and status. The difference, of course, is that she was a Russian national in communication with, and taking actions to advance the interest of, influential Russian officials. To do so without registering with the US government is a federal crime - and now she faces a prison sentence and deportation. The details outlined in the plea agreement are not exactly the stuff of spy novels. She arranged a Russian delegation to a prestigious Washington prayer event, hobnobbed at the National Rifle Association convention and organised a visit by US gun rights advocates to Moscow. Taken in isolation, these ""informal channels of communication"" with American conservatives could have helped improve US-Russia relations but were hardly nefarious. Viewed in the context of other Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election presented by Robert Mueller's investigation - including hacking Democratic Party communications, waging an illicit social media campaign, and funding and organising on-the ground political rallies and protests - and the Butina plea seems more like a small but potentially meaningful piece of a much larger puzzle. Federal prosecutors said Butina was directed by a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative political groups, including an unnamed pro-gun lobbying organisation presumed to be the NRA, which is close to Mr Trump's Republican party. In a statement read in court, one of the federal prosecutors said Butina had drafted, in March 2015, a document called ""Diplomacy Project"" that called for unofficial communication lines between high-ranking US officials and Russia. She acknowledged that she worked with two Americans and a Russian official. Maria Butina pleaded guilty after reaching a deal with prosecutors CNN identified the Russian citizen as Alexander Torshin, a former deputy governor of Russia's central bank who was targeted with US sanctions. One of the US citizens has been identified in US media as Paul Erickson, a South Dakota-based conservative political activist who was in a relationship with Butina. He is listed in public records as being 56 years old. His lawyer has not commented. Last week, government lawyers dropped what the judge said was a ""salacious"" allegation that Butina had offered sex in exchange for a position in a special interest group. Prosecutors told the court that they had been been ""mistaken"" when they read a text conversation between two friends. Analysts say this and other errors by prosecutors may have given Butina more leverage in reaching a plea deal. The Russian government has previously described the case as ""fabricated"". In an interview with CNN,foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Butina had been ""tortured"" in detention - without providing any evidence,external- and that the Russian government considered her a ""political prisoner"".

Cardinal denies sex abuse 'cover-up',"Cardinal Vincent Nichols denied a cover up over sex abuse allegations involving a priest The leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales was accused of covering up child sex abuse allegations against a priest, an inquiry heard. Cardinal Vincent Nichols - Birmingham's archbishop between 2000 and 2009 - was asked if he suppressed a note about an incident in 1968, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard. It related to an alleged incident involving Father John Tolkien, son of novelist JRR Tolkien. The cardinal denied a cover-up. The alleged abuse happened in the 1950s, when Father Tolkien was based in Sparkhill, Birmingham, the hearing in London was told. The inquiry was told the note came to light in legal advice to Cardinal Nichols while considering a civil claim by an alleged victim of Father Tolkien's. Former boy scout Christopher Carrie, who claimed Father Tolkien abused him in two incidents in the 1950s, received compensation after reaching a settlement with the archdiocese in 2003. Cardinal Nichols, now Archbishop of Westminster, was giving evidence at the inquiry, which is examining possible failings across a string of organisations, including the Catholic Church. Asked about allegations he failed to disclose the existence of the note to the complainant, the cardinal said: ""In the context of the claim and the discussions with the solicitors, my priority was to get that settled and when that was settled I simply didn't give the matter any further thought. ""For which I apologise."" The note was drafted by Maurice Couve de Murville who was Birmingham's Archbishop between 1982 and 1999, as part of a 1993 investigation, suggesting he had known about the 1968 allegation, the hearing in London was told. Cardinal Vincent Nichols told the inquiry that the child abuse at the Archdiocese ""will forever mark"" his ministry as a priest No action was taken against Father Tolkien in the 1990s, and he retired from the priesthood some six months after Archbishop Couve de Murville was told of the allegation, the hearing heard. Father Tolkien, who died in 2003, was believed to have denied claimshe made a group of scouts strip naked. But evidence which investigators believed suggested the priest may have admitted abuse emerged in the note, which came to light at a series of hearings by the inquiry. Latest and updates from the West Midlands The inquiry panel has been examining the Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham's response to allegations made against four priests, including Father Tolkien. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is looking at allegations in Birmingham's Roman Catholic Archdiocese In February 2002, it was decided not to proceed with a prosecution against Father Tolkien on the grounds of ill health, and he died the following year. The lawyers uncovered allegations by six complainants against Father Tolkien, and concluded: ""Carrie is likely to satisfy the [civil] court, Father Tolkien abused him in the manner he alleges."" Cardinal Nichols said allegations of child abuse made against his peers ""poisons the very wells of our salvation"". ""It is indeed something that breaks my heart and will forever mark my ministry as a priest,"" he said.

Anger as accused MPs get whip restored,"Both MPs were able to vote after having the whip restored A decision to let two suspended Conservative MPs take part in a vote of confidence in Theresa May has been criticised by Labour MPs. Burton MP Andrew Griffiths and Dover's Charlie Elphicke had the whip restored but both face claims of inappropriate sexual behaviour which they deny. Labour MP Jess Phillips said it showed votes were ""all that mattered"". In response, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom defended the move and said she was determined to keep staff safe. ""I am absolutely committed to changing the culture of this place and to seeing that everybody here is treated with dignity and respect,"" she said. The move prompted fury from female Labour MPs including shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler and Jess Phillips. This video can not be played Jess Phillips reads out Andrew Griffiths 'beating' text to MPs Describing it as ""a betrayal of women"", Ms Butler said: ""How can Theresa May call herself a feminist when she lets an MP who was suspended back into the Conservative Party to vote for her in the leadership challenge?"" Ms Phillips said: ""They said we won't let patronage and power change our minds where wrongdoing occurred. They said we won't protect our mates."" Mr Elphicke said he was pleased to have the whip restored but declined to say which way he voted. Burton and Uttoxeter MP Mr Griffiths said he was backing the Prime Minister. On Twitter, Mr Elphicke wrote: ""Important for my constituents to know that, 13 months after having it withdrawn, I have been given back the Conservative whip. ""I remain as confident as I always have been of clearing my name and will continue to work as hard for Dover & Deal as I always have done."" Allow Twitter content?

'Young homeless blocked from renting',"As the temperature drops, Sam can no longer cope with sleeping rough ""It's very, very tough, very cold,"" says Sam, 20, who has just walked into the lobby of a centre for young homeless people in Manchester. As the temperature dips towards freezing, he needs a bed for the night. On and off, he says, he's been homeless for three years, after a family breakdown, between hostels, friends' sofas and, too often, the streets. It's increasingly hard for young people like Sam to find places to rent, according to the charity Centrepoint. Research for the charity suggests that only one in five private landlords is willing to let to a young person who has been homeless and only one in 10 said they let shared properties, the type of housing most affordable for this age group. Just over 1,000 private landlords from England, Scotland and Wales were questioned by YouGov for Centrepoint in August. In the lobby, a display board shows no hostel spaces available in the whole of Manchester - it takes hours, until well into the evening, before the team finds him somewhere to stay. The next day he will be back, hoping for longer-term accommodation, hoping to avoid more winter nights sleeping rough. ""The best thing to do is to keep warm, wear as many layers as you can and to remember to stay somewhere hidden, not in a doorway where you can get easily targeted by people. ""I don't go in a doorway myself. I go somewhere out of the way and then get up early."" Sam spends his days walking around central Manchester, on cold days the Arndale Shopping Centre is a good place to keep warm. His passions are music and football, but there is little chance of him pursuing any career while his accommodation is so unstable. Hidden homeless: Young people can struggle to find accommodation A flat would be ""a big stepping stone to another big stepping stone to help me sort my life out"", he says. Centrepoint's report shows fierce competition for shared housing, with students and young professionals able to pay far more in rent than people like Sam. Homelessness could end in a decade, says charity Sofa surfers: The young hidden homeless Kicked out of home on Christmas Day Meet the housemates with a 68-year age gap On top of that, landlords want deposits and a month's rent in advance and then there are agency fees. Young homeless people who are on benefits or low pay and who lack savings or financial support from parents, simply can't afford these upfront costs, says the charity. Pressure on housing is so great that the charity has noticed it is getting tougher for the young people it supports to move out of its hostels and live independently. Not many landlords are prepared to rent to DSS claimants Currently, one in five young people in Centrepoint hostels is ready to move on but they are effectively ""bed-blocking"", because there is nowhere else for them to go. Aidan, 24, says he has been ready to leave his Centrepoint hostel in London for more than a year, but cannot find a landlord to take him. Too many refuse to take tenants on benefits, as  Aidan says: ""You'll find properties but as soon as you look at the information, they say, 'no DSS accepted'."" He became homeless four years ago, after having to flee the family home because of domestic violence when he refused an arranged marriage to someone from Pakistan. Since then he has stayed in a series of hostels and refuges. ""You learn to put up this wall so that people can't see you being vulnerable,"" he says. This video can not be played Aidan says he cannot afford to pay rent and has been homeless for four years. Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin says the charity is urging private landlords to look beyond the ""caricature"" of young people as unreliable tenants. ""Actually most young people are not like that at all. Young people can be great tenants. ""So we need landlords not to succumb to this narrative that young people are somehow a difficult bunch of people."" The report's other recommendations are for the government, including: targeted spending on social rented housing for young people new regulations to stop landlords discriminating against benefit claimants allowing benefit claimants to have rent paid direct to landlords improving lower benefit rates for under-25s unable to live at home A government spokesman said the UK spends Â£24bn a year on housing benefits, proportionally more than any other developed country. ""We are investing Â£1.2bn to tackle homelessness and we have delivered over 293,000 affordable rental homes since 2010. ""With Universal Credit, rent can be paid directly to landlords and we support vulnerable claimants to make housing payments,"" said the spokesman.

"Our Brexit deal is at risk, May warns EU","This video can not be played A quiet word in your ear...but what did Theresa May say to EU's Juncker? Theresa May's bid to make her Brexit deal more acceptable to MPs has suffered a blow after EU leaders said it was ""not open for renegotiation"". She wanted legal assurances on the Irish backstop and had warned the deal itself was ""at risk"" over the issue. But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said there could be clarifications but no renegotiation. Labour says MPs must vote on the deal next week and it was ""unacceptable"" for it to be pushed back to January. ""This is becoming a farce,"" said Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer. ""The prime minister pulled this important vote last week on the basis that she was going to get meaningful changes to her Brexit deal, She has obviously not."" On Thursday evening, Mr Juncker urged the UK to set out more clearly what it wants, adding that the European Commission will publish information on 19 December on its preparations, should the UK leave the EU without a deal in place. Live: EU summit reaction Brexit: Does Brussels blink? UK travellers to pay â¬7 to visit EU after Brexit Stand up to EU, Foster urges May New Brexit poll logical outcome - Blair ""Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want, and so we would like within a few weeks our UK friends to set out their expectations for us, because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarifications,"" he said. Pooled video footage from the summit on Friday showed Mrs May and Mr Juncker engaged in what appeared to be a tense exchange, following his comments. The Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, said the EU's response was unsurprising and Mrs May must not ""roll over as has happened previously"". ""The EU are doing what they always do,"" said the party's leader Arlene Foster. ""The key question is whether the prime minister will stand up to them."" Allow Twitter content?

But Cabinet minister David Lidington described the meeting as a ""welcome first step"" in showing that the EU was committed ""to negotiate a trade deal with the UK speedily"". Mrs May travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders after delaying Tuesday's Commons vote on the deal, in anticipation of a heavy defeat. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK May: I won't lead Conservatives into next election Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? She then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her and was hoping to address their concerns about the controversial ""backstop"" plan in the withdrawal agreement. Critics say the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. Conservative MPs have demanded changes to make it clear that it could not last forever, and the UK could terminate the arrangement on its own. If this meeting was meant to provide Theresa May with the beginnings of an escape route from her Brexit conundrum, the signs are nothing less than awful. At one of her most vulnerable political moments, Number 10 was hopeful at least of an indication of a potential solution to the most intense of a long list of Brexit problems - the controversial so-called backstop, designed to guarantee there would be no hard Irish border. But right now, that's simply not on offer. EU leaders made it plain that their warnings - that their divorce deal with Britain was not up for negotiation - were real. Read more from Laura In comments released by Downing Street on Thursday, Mrs May urged EU leaders to help her ""get this deal over the line"" and said she firmly believed it could get through the Commons, saying: ""There is a majority in my Parliament who want to leave with a deal so with the right assurances this deal can be passed. Indeed, it is the only deal capable of getting through my Parliament,"" she said. Mrs May urged EU leaders to work with her to ""change the perception"" of the controversial backstop plan. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: A really simple guide But European Council president Donald Tusk said the withdrawal agreement was ""not open for renegotiation"" although he stressed the backstop was ""an insurance policy"", saying it was the EU's ""firm determination"" to work ""speedily"" on alternative arrangements. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the fact that the EU said it would use its ""best endeavours"" to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials who said it meant the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they felt the EU was dragging its feet. But he said Ireland had requested that the European Council conclusions be toughened up and a paragraph which suggested further work would be done to reassure the UK was removed because ""there was no support"" for it. Downing Street has confirmed MPs will not now vote on Mrs May's deal before Christmas, and said the vote would happen ""as soon as possible in January"". Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois told the BBC: ""It is as plain as a pikestaff that this will never get through the House of Commons... the prime minister, I'm afraid, is completely boxed in."" The Labour former PM Tony Blair told the BBC he believed a majority of MPs in the Commons would back another referendum on Brexit, if Parliament could not agree on another way forward: ""I think that will happen if it is clear that there is no majority for any one form of Brexit,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""We have had 30 months of negotiation and let's be clear - we are in crisis mode on this.""

"Jump in far-right extremism referralsMore than 1,300 people were referred to the authorities for extreme right-wing activity in 2017/18.UK","This video can not be played 'John' joined far-right groups aged 15, but now works to prevent extremism The number of people referred to the UK's terrorism-prevention programme over concerns related to extreme right-wing activity jumped by 36% in 2017/18. Prevent, which aims to stop people being radicalised, received 7,318 last year, of which 1,312 were for far-right extremism, up from 968 the year before. Referrals for concerns related to radical Islamism decreased by 14%. Security minister Ben Wallace said the programme tackled radicalisation ""wherever it is found"". BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said a ""rise in extreme right-wing activity, particularly online"", was behind the increase in referrals. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, meanwhile, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of people referred to Prevent ""do not require any anti-terrorism procedures at all"". Thelatest figures,externalshow that, of those referred to Prevent in 2017/18: 3,096 (42%) left the process requiring no further action 2,902 (40%) left the process and were signposted to alternative services 1,314 (18%) were discussed by Channel, the programme that provides support to people who might be vulnerable to radicalisation Of the cases examined by Channel, 394 subsequently received support through the scheme, including 114 aged under 15. Engagement in the scheme is voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The controversial Prevent scheme is essentially a system which aims to  identify vulnerable people and intervene in their lives before something bad happens. The local panels - which include police, social workers and other experts - look at reports coming in from teachers, the public, the NHS and others. A huge proportion of these referrals are false alarms - in fact the number of cases which experts immediately dismissed rose 16% in the year to March 2018. The proportion of individuals who cause such concern that they need concerted help to de-radicalise, through the ""Channel"" mentoring programme, remains consistently low at about 5%. That's not to say that mistakes aren't made. This latest data covers the summer of 2017 when Surrey County Council's botched attempt to help turn around the life of Ahmed Hassan,the young man who later tried to bomb a London Underground train. The latest figures also showed thousands of children and teenagers have been flagged up over terror concerns. In the year to March, 2,009 under-15s were referred, including 297 girls. The number in the youngest age group increased by a fifth on the previous year, while more than half of those reported for possible de-radicalisation interventions in 2017/18 were 20 or under. Referrals over Islamist extremism concerns fell from 3,704 to 3,197. Reality Check: What is the Prevent strategy? Prevent criticism 'stems from ignorance' Greens say Prevent strategy 'toxic' The Home Office said that, of those who have left the Channel process, more than four in five did so with ""no further terrorism-related concerns"".

Amazon uses dummy parcels to catch thievesThe online retailer has teamed up with police in New Jersey to fight parcel theft with dummy packages.Technology,"Amazon delivers millions of packages every day Amazon has teamed up with police in the US in an effort to stop thieves who steal parcels left outside homes. Officers in New Jersey are planting dummy boxes fitted with GPS trackers, coupled with hidden doorbell cameras, at homes around the city of Jersey. The homes selected for the experiment were chosen using the city's own crime statistics combined with mapping data of theft locations supplied by Amazon. One box was stolen three minutes after it was ""delivered"". Having parcels left outside is convenient for many but is also a risk Amazon told AP: ""We appreciate the increased effort by local law enforcement to tackle package theft and remain committed to assisting however we can."" The US Postal Service expects to deliver about 900 million packages in the run-up to Christmas. Last year, Amazon launched a service called Amazon Key that allowed homeowners with smart locks to let couriers open their doors via an app and leave parcels inside. While that may be a step too far for many, there are other ways to protect deliveries: Have them delivered to a workplace or a friend who is home during the day Insist that deliveries must be signed for Install cameras that will give police some video evidence Use a service that provides a storage box drivers can unlock by entering a code on a keypad Amazon also provides lockers for people to pick up parcels in locations such as shopping centres, convenience stores, airports, train stations and universities.

Government pledges extra ÃÂ£300m for police,"Police forces in England and Wales are set to receive an extra Â£300m to help pay for pension expenses and other costs, ministers have announced. Since 2010, central government funding to police forces has been cut by almost a third, in real terms, leading the number of officers to fall by 21,000. Police and Crime Commissioners, who represent the public, say the stretched service is struggling to cope. Police Minister Nick Hurd accepted the deal came at a ""time of real pressure"". He added that forces needed ""additional support to help them do their job"" and said officers were ""bearing down on the worst spike in serious violence and knife crime that we have seen in a decade"". The funding breaks down as: An extra Â£161m next year for England and Wales' 43 police forces, which the Home Office says will protect police budgets in ""real terms"". This brings the total to  Â£7.8bn next year A Â£153m grant to help plug a shortfall in funding because of changes to pensions contributions Police and Crime Commissioners will also be able to increase the policing element of council tax. This means households could pay an extra Â£24 a year for a Band D property, although local residents must be consulted first. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the various funding announcements, as well as money for serious and organised crime units and counter-terrorism, could mean a total increase in funding for the police system of ""up to Â£970m"" - the biggest since 2010. Ministers have listened. The settlement won't be anywhere near enough to reverse the 30% real-terms cut in central government funding to forces since 2010, but it provides them with a measure of financial stability and will enable some constabularies to go ahead with plans to recruit extra officers. Crucially, it'll largely plug a Â£165m pensions gap in 2019-20 which PCCs hadn't budgeted for. However, the overall police workforce remains shrunken: there are 44,000 fewer officers, staff and community support officers than in 2010: demand on the service is rising; and serious violence is at levels not seen for a decade. The next spending review, which is expected to cover a five-year period from 2020, will be crucial in determining whether those issues are addressed. Roger Hirst, of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, welcomed the extra funding, saying it would help them to deal with cost pressures from inflation and pensions, and invest in technology. He said the ability to raise council tax levels would allow for investment in local policing priorities, an area the public wants more investment in. But David Jamieson, Labour PCC for the West Midlands - the second largest force in England and Wales - said the payments fell a ""long way short"". He said West Midlands Police has faced cuts of Â£175m since 2010, leading to a fall in officer numbers by more than 2,000. ""Despite warm words over the last few months, this is once again a disappointing settlement that falls a long way short of what West Midlands Police needed from the government. ""Government grants to West Midlands Police are falling in real terms and the government is piling the pressure on council taxpayers. ""Crime is rising and we require a significant boost in police officer numbers to tackle the problem. ""At a time when living standards are being squeezed and our economic future is increasingly uncertain, the government has made it clear it expects PCCs to increase council tax."" The National Police Chiefs' Council - which represents the country's most senior officers - said the government had been right to recognise the serious pressures on policing. The Police Federation, which represents police constables, sergeants and inspectors, accused the government of ""passing the buck"" of funding to local communities. Labour's shadow policing minister Louise Haigh said the settlement represented a ninth consecutive year of real-terms cuts to the police by central government.

Truce breakthrough in Yemen talks,"The Houthi (left ) and Yemeni government delegates shake hands in Stockholm Warring parties in Yemen have agreed to a ceasefire for the port city of Hudaydah, principal lifeline for two-thirds of the country. They reached agreement at talks in Sweden brokered by the United Nations. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he hoped this would be the starting point to bring nearly four years of civil war to a close. Fighting has killed thousands, while the world's worst humanitarian crisis in recent times has afflicted millions. Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Why is there a war in Yemen? Leaders of the delegations from the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, who control much of the country, shook hands after the ceasefire was agreed on Thursday. Hudaydah is one of the areas controlled by the rebels. All forces from the Houthi rebels will withdraw from Hudaydah in the coming days, as will those from the Yemeni government alliance fighting them there. Yemen war: Billions in aid, but where's it going? They will be replaced by what the UN called local forces. Houthi forces would also withdraw from the ports of Saleef and Ras Isa. Mr Guterres said the ceasefire would then take place for the whole of the Hudaydah governorate. The UN would then play a ""leading role"" in monitoring the ports and would help distribute aid to civilians, he added. Thursday's agreements could ""be a starting point for peace and for ending [the] humanitarian crisis in Yemen"", Mr Guterres said. A ""mutual understanding"" was announced on the nation's third city of Taiz, where these has been intense fighting, although few details were released. This video can not be played About two-thirds of Yemen's population is reliant on food aid There is no agreement yet on a truce for the rest of the country, including the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis. Mr Guterres said he hoped for a deal within a week on reopening Sanaa airport. He said a new round of talks would take place at the end of January on other issues. The Stockholm talks were the first in two years between the Houthis and the Yemeni government, which has had the backing of a Saudi-led coalition since 2015. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The World Health Organization warned in October that about 10,000 new suspected cases of cholera were now being reported every week. Why Hudaydah matters Yemen crisis: The battle for Hudaydah.

New EastEnders set goes ÃÂ£27m over budget,"This video can not be played Aerial pictures show work on the new EastEnders set in Elstree, as filming takes place on the existing set. The BBC's project to build a brand new, HD-ready Albert Square and expand the external EastEnders set will now cost Â£27m more than originally planned. The original 2015 forecast for the scheme was Â£59.7m, but the revised budget is now Â£86.7m, the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed. The new set was originally due to open in 2018, but won't be ready until 2023. The BBC said the project was ""large"" and ""complex"", adding that there had been ""challenges on the way"". A brand new Queen Vic pub is being built as part of the new set The corporation is building a new Albert Square near the existing set at the BBC's Elstree studios in Hertfordshire. It will have actual brick buildings - unlike the current one, which only uses facades. The external EastEnders set dates back to the soap's birth in 1984 and was only supposed to be used for two years, but has lasted for 34. The soap cannot currently be filmed in high definition, and the BBC said the poor condition of the current set is increasingly causing delays to filming. The building project - titled E20 - was announced in 2015 and was meant to finish by August 2018. The original set was only supposed to be used for two years In its report, the NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament, said the extra costs mean ""the BBC will not be able to deliver value for money... in the way that it envisaged in 2015"". The body took aim at the early planning stage, which ""resulted in the BBC underestimating aspects of complexity, cost and risks of its approach"". However, the NAO also acknowledged that the BBC had faced issues such as asbestos and obstructions in the ground, which could not have been foreseen when the project was first planned. Inflation has also risen faster than expected in the construction industry - although the NAO said inflation ""had a greater impact than it would have done had the programme been completed without any delays"". Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""We believe that the planned benefits are still broadly achievable, but given the high risk nature of E20 it will need close scrutiny until it's finished."" The NAO said ""some of the reasons for the delays and cost increases could have been addressed earlier by the BBC"", adding that the corporation ""had made many improvements to the programme"" in the last 18 months. The funeral of Peggy Mitchell was a big Walford event ""The show remains one of the BBC's flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London. ""It's a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre but like any building work of this scale there have been challenges on the way, including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site. ""As the NAO recognises we've already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny."" The BBC added that it would ""continue to capture... lessons learned on the programme"". EastEnders is currently watched by around six million people per episode, compared with about 7.5 million for its ITV rival Coronation Street. The Manchester-based soap opened a new set in 2013, but the cost of that was never made public. At EastEnders, the so-called ""front lot"", which is the replacement for the existing set, will now be finished by 2021 - but work on the ""back lot"", which will include new Walford outdoor locations, will go on until May 2023. Work that has already taken place on E20 includes new boiler heating and edit suites, additional stage capacity and a new site entrance.

Branson's Virgin Galactic reaches space,"Virgin Galactic's plane will be carried to a height of 12,000m before its rocket ignites The latest test flight by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic successfully rocketed to the edge of space and back. The firm's SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship reached a height of 82.7km, beyond the altitude at which US agencies have awarded astronaut wings. It marked the plane's fourth test flight and followed earlier setbacks in the firm's space programme. Sir Richard is in a race with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to send the first fee-paying passengers into space. He founded the commercial spaceflight company in 2004, shortly after Mr Musk started SpaceX and Jeff Bezos established Blue Origin. Champagne for space tourists takes flight The billionaires fuelling a space race In 2008, Virgin Galactic first promised sub-orbital spaceflight trips for tourists would be taking place ""within 18 months"". It has since regularly made similar promises to have space flights airborne in the near future. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But delays and a fatal crash in 2014 prevented Sir Richard's original ambitions. On Thursday, the SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship took off from the Mojave Desert in California. The company said the space ship's motor burned for 60 seconds, travelling at 2.9 times the speed of sound as it gained height. The rocket carried two pilots and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger, as well as four research experiments for NASA. ""Today we have shown Virgin Galactic can open space to the world,"" Sir Richard said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US government has awarded astronaut wings to pilots who ventured farther than roughly 80km beyond earth's surface. But Thursday's flight did not breach the 100km Karman Line, which many organisations use to resolve debates about where space begins. While the trip marked a milestone for Virgin Galactic, the firm's rivals have already ventured farther - albeit without humans on board. SpaceX, in partnership with NASA, is planning crewed missions for early next year. Mr Bezos has also said Blue Origin plans to send its first crew to space in 2019. Virgin Galactic, which is charging $250,000 for a 90-minute flight, has said more than 600 people have bought tickets or put down deposits for an eventual voyage.

Ashley: Debenhams snubbed my Â£40m lifeline,"Sports Direct's owner Mike Ashley has written a bluntly worded letter to the boss of Debenhams discussing his offer of a Â£40m investment in the struggling department store chain. The letter, addressed to Sergio Bucher, suggests without the money the company ""has zero chance of survival"". Mr Ashley writes he is frustrated Debenhams doesn't want his ""help"". In the letter,published by the Daily Telegraph,external, he adds he wasn't surprised ""by the predictable negative response"". Sports Direct already owns 30% of Debenhams, which is closing up to 50 of its stores and seeking new finance following a downturn in its business. Allow Twitter content?

Debenhams issued a statement saying it welcomed Sports Direct's proposal ""as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company"". ""However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process."" Sports Direct denies it wants Debenhams to fail Mike Ashley, the saviour of the High Street? Debenhams closure plan threatens 4,000 jobs Mr Ashley, who is the majority owner of Sports Direct, said he was concerned that Debenhams didn't appreciate the position it was in and urged Mr Bucher to accept his offer. He wrote ""the market"" was saying that Debenhams had no credit insurance and that banks were advising clients to be wary about being in credit to Debenhams. In the context of a very difficult climate for retailers Mr Ashley added he couldn't see how the proposal to inject money into the department store chain could be ""seen or portrayed as a negative"". ""If I'm sounding extremely frustrated - well I am. We've seen this before, with Blacks and HoF [House of Fraser]. They didn't want any help either. ""We don't want to see Debenhams fail. It's not in our interest to see it fail, but without something changing rapidly all of the shareholders risk getting wiped out."" However, some observers have suggested that Mr Ashley may have motives  other than reinvigorating Debenhams' fortunes. They argue the offer of a cash injection may be designed to place Sports Direct in a better position to accrue assets, should Debenhams go into administration next year. Shares in Sports Direct dropped sharply on Thursday, by more than 10%, after the firm held a conference call with analysts to discuss the firm's half-yearly results. The purchase of House of Fraser had led to a 27% fall in profits, but investors also focused on a response that Mr Ashley gave to a question about current trading in his core sports retail business. His response that November's trading was ""unbelievably bad"" was taken as an indication that Sports Direct was feeling the squeeze affecting many High Street retailers. However, Sports Direct later issued a clarification stating that Mr Ashley was not issuing a further profit warning. The firm said that while the House of Fraser acquisition would result in a drop in earnings for the full year, as indicated in the half-yearly report, otherwise their forecast for full year profits to grow 5-15% had not changed.

PC jailed for raping 13-year-old girl,"Ian Naude was being investigated for sex offences when he became a student officer A police officer who only joined the force ""to gain the keys to a sweetshop"" has been jailed for raping a girl. Cheshire Constabulary PC Ian Naude, 30, met the 13-year-old after being called to her house over a domestic incident. He contacted her over social media and eventually raped her in his car, while filming it on his mobile phone. The ""committed paedophile"" was found guilty at Liverpool Crown Court of raping the teenager and jailed for 25 years. Naude, of Market Drayton in Shropshire, was also convicted of four charges of attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence and one charge of arranging a child sex offence, relating to five complainants aged between 12 and 15. The father-of-one, originally from South Africa, previously admitted 31 offences including charges related to grooming underage girls via a fake Facebook and Snapchat profile. How a predatory paedophile became a PC Sentencing him, Judge Clement Goldstone QC said his rape victim had been just three weeks past her 13th birthday. ""In order to impose your will on a young girl and to commit offences of rape and sexual assault against her, you used and abused your position as a Cheshire Police officer, thereby enabling you to satisfy your lust and perversion,"" he added. He said Naude was ""out of control"" with an ""insatiable appetite"" for young girls and described a selfie he took after raping his victim as showing his ""smug self satisfaction and total lack of shame"". Naude used names including ""Bruce Wayne"" and ""King of the North"" on fake profiles During his two-week trial, Naude denied rape and sexual assault as he claimed the sex with the girl was consensual and that she ""seemed to be enjoying it"". Prosecutor Owen Edwards described Naude as a ""committed paedophile"" and said he joined the police ""with the intention of exploiting the access he would gain to vulnerable young girls"". ""In essence, he was hoping to gain the keys to a sweet shop,"" he added. Naude met the girl after he was called to her house over an incident in October last year, the court heard. After looking her up on Facebook and exchanging sexual messages and photos, he returned to her home three days later to pick her up while her mother was out. He then drove her to a country lane where he attacked her. Naude raped the girl after being called to her home to attend a domestic incident In a statement read in court, the girl's mother said the victim would no longer leave the house without close family and friends and that she will no longer walk past the local police station and hides when a police car goes past. Other parents said their daughters had gone on to self-harm after being groomed online by Naude, who would blackmail and threaten his victims, persuade them to send pictures of themselves undressed, tell them to call him ""daddy"" and send them videos of himself masturbating. PC convicted of raping 13-year-old girl Rape accused PC said girl 'enjoyed it' Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The 31 offences that Naude pleaded guilty to included inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, misconduct in a public office and possessing 1,443 indecent images of children, including pictures of girls aged as young as 18 months. The court heard he would gain the trust of the young girls by posing on social media as a 15-year-old boy called Jake Green. Naude messaged girls posing as a teenage boy It has since emerged that Naude, who previously served in Afghanistan as a machine gunner with the Royal Irish Regiment, was already being investigated for sex offences when he became a student officer in April last year. Cheshire Constabulary said his appointment was delayed from January 2017 to April that year because he was alleged to have raped a woman in Staffordshire. No further action was taken in the case and Naude was allowed to join - but reports of child grooming in Staffordshire and West Mercia which named him as a suspect in January and February 2017 were not picked up by the Cheshire force until after his arrest in November that year.

Second Canadian held as China row deepens,"Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig have been put under ""compulsory measures"" A second Canadian has been detained in China on accusations of harming national security, as tension continues between the two countries. It was confirmed on Thursday that Michael Spavor, a businessman, had been detained in addition to former diplomat Michael Kovrig. Canada drew Chinese protests after it arrested an executive at telecoms giant Huawei at the request of the US. Meng Wanzhou has been bailed but may face extradition for fraud. She denies violating US sanctions on Iran through Huawei's business dealings. China has threatened unspecified consequences if she is not released. Who is detained Canadian Michael Spavor? The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple So high-profile is the case that US PresidentDonald Trump said he could intervene if it helped to avoid a further decline in relations between the US and China, which are locked in a trade war. However, Mr Trump's own officials frowned on the idea, with US Assistant Attorney General John Demers remarking: ""What we do at the justice department is law enforcement. We don't do trade."" Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang addressed the matter on Thursday, saying the pair were ""suspected of engaging in activities that threatened China's national security"" and had been put under ""compulsory measures"", a usual reference to custody. Mr Lu said the ""legal rights and interests of these two Canadians have been safeguarded"" and that the two cases were being investigated separately. Asked if the detentions were in response to Ms Meng's arrest, he said they were part of an ""operation taken by China's relevant national security authorities in accordance with the laws"". Mr Lu said Ms Meng's arrest was ""wrong practice"", adding: ""I can point out that, since the Canadian government took the wrong action at the request of the US and took Meng Wanzhou into custody, many Chinese are wondering if their trips to Canada are safe."" Some China analysts were in little doubt about the reason for the detentions. Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's former ambassador to China,told Canadian broadcaster CBC:,external""In China there are no coincidences... If they want to send you a message, they will send you a message."" One Western diplomat in China told Reuters news agency: ""This is a political kidnapping."" Michael Spavor (left) helped arrange the trip of ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman (R) to North Korea in 2013 Michael Spavor,arrested on 12 December, is a businessman based in Dandong, near the Chinese border with North Korea. He has ties to the North Korean government and has met its leader Kim Jong-un many times. Canadian foreign ministry spokesman Guillaume BÃ©rubÃ© confirmed that Mr Spavor had contacted it earlier in the week because ""he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities"". One of his most recent Facebook posts, on Sunday, said he was about to travel to Seoul in South Korea but he did not arrive on Monday as planned. Allow Facebook content?

Mr Spavor runs an organisation called the Paektu Cultural Exchange, which organises business, cultural and tourism trips to North Korea. He is a regular visitor to North Korea and regularly comments in the media on Korean issues. He is particularly well known for helping to arrange the visit by former NBA star Dennis Rodman to North Korea in 2013. Rodman is a personal friend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Ex-diplomatMichael Kovrigcurrently works for a think-tank, the International Crisis Group (ICG), which has said it is concerned for his health and safety. He was arrested on 10 December. Mr Lu said the ICG had not been registered as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in China and therefore it was unlawful for its staff to work there. Checks by Reuters news agency did not turn up a registration for ICG on government databases for NGOs or social enterprises. Asked about Mr Kovrig, Canada said there was no ""explicit indication"" of any link to the Meng case. It said his case had been raised directly with Chinese officials. The former Canadian resident was detained on 1 December in Vancouver, where she has family and property connections. She was granted bail of C$10m(Â£6m; $7.4m) on Tuesday but could still be extradited to the US. Sketch of Meng Wanzhou in court in Canada The US has been investigating Huawei, one of the world's largest smartphone makers, since 2016, believing that it used a subsidiary, Skycom, to bring US manufacturing equipment and millions of dollars in transactions to Iran in violation of sanctions. Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what? Who does business with Iran? The Supreme Court of British Columbia was told that Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, carried this out between 2009 and 2014. She allegedly tricked US banks into clearing transactions for Huawei which were in reality for Skycom. The banks thus became ""victim institutions"" of fraud. Lawyers for Ms Meng told the court that Huawei had already separated itself from Skycom. Ms Meng faces up to 30 years in prison in the US if found guilty of the charges, the Canadian court heard.

Jump in far-right extremism referrals,"This video can not be played 'John' joined far-right groups aged 15, but now works to prevent extremism The number of people referred to the UK's terrorism-prevention programme over concerns related to extreme right-wing activity jumped by 36% in 2017/18. Prevent, which aims to stop people being radicalised, received 7,318 last year, of which 1,312 were for far-right extremism, up from 968 the year before. Referrals for concerns related to radical Islamism decreased by 14%. Security minister Ben Wallace said the programme tackled radicalisation ""wherever it is found"". BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said a ""rise in extreme right-wing activity, particularly online"", was behind the increase in referrals. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, meanwhile, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of people referred to Prevent ""do not require any anti-terrorism procedures at all"". Thelatest figures,externalshow that, of those referred to Prevent in 2017/18: 3,096 (42%) left the process requiring no further action 2,902 (40%) left the process and were signposted to alternative services 1,314 (18%) were discussed by Channel, the programme that provides support to people who might be vulnerable to radicalisation Of the cases examined by Channel, 394 subsequently received support through the scheme, including 114 aged under 15. Engagement in the scheme is voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The controversial Prevent scheme is essentially a system which aims to  identify vulnerable people and intervene in their lives before something bad happens. The local panels - which include police, social workers and other experts - look at reports coming in from teachers, the public, the NHS and others. A huge proportion of these referrals are false alarms - in fact the number of cases which experts immediately dismissed rose 16% in the year to March 2018. The proportion of individuals who cause such concern that they need concerted help to de-radicalise, through the ""Channel"" mentoring programme, remains consistently low at about 5%. That's not to say that mistakes aren't made. This latest data covers the summer of 2017 when Surrey County Council's botched attempt to help turn around the life of Ahmed Hassan,the young man who later tried to bomb a London Underground train. The latest figures also showed thousands of children and teenagers have been flagged up over terror concerns. In the year to March, 2,009 under-15s were referred, including 297 girls. The number in the youngest age group increased by a fifth on the previous year, while more than half of those reported for possible de-radicalisation interventions in 2017/18 were 20 or under. Referrals over Islamist extremism concerns fell from 3,704 to 3,197. Reality Check: What is the Prevent strategy? Prevent criticism 'stems from ignorance' Greens say Prevent strategy 'toxic' The Home Office said that, of those who have left the Channel process, more than four in five did so with ""no further terrorism-related concerns"".

More rail strikes planned for Christmas,"Strikes over guard roles on South Western Railway began in November 2017 Staff at South Western Railway (SWR) are to hold two more strikes in Christmas week on 27 and 31 December. The 24-hour walkouts are part of the long-running dispute about the future role of guards. A strike has already been announced for 22 December. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said its action was ""a result of the company's intransigence"" over the issue. SWR said the strikes were ""totally unnecessary"". RMT members on South Western Railway are holding three strikes over the festive period In a statement, the firm said it had already offered to meet the union for talks before the latest strikes were announced. ""By announcing further strike dates, the RMT has shown it has no intention of finding a solution and is only interested in inflicting more misery on passengers as they try to enjoy the festive season,"" it said. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said SWR had ""stubbornly refused"" to ensure that trains would not run without guards. He said: ""South Western Railway are looking for a green light to throw the guard off their trains as and when they see fit in the name of profit."" South Western Railway workers announce 22 December strike FirstGroup boss departs after Â£327m loss WATCH: What is driver-only operation? The company has previously said guards would be rostered but trains could still operate without them. A series of strikes about driver-only trains began on Southern railway in April 2016. RMT members on Arriva Rail North are striking on every Saturday for the rest of the year in the same dispute. The union previously said it had negotiated ""guard guarantees"" in Wales and Scotland as well as on a number of English franchises.

Trump 'never directed Cohen to break law',"This video can not be played Cohen walked free from court - but will have to report to jail in March US President Donald Trump has said he never directed his former private lawyer to break the law, a day after he was sentenced to prison. ""He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law."" Mr Trump tweeted of Michael Cohen, adding that he  pleaded guilty ""to embarrass the president"". His comments came a day after Cohen received a three-year jail sentence for campaign finance and fraud crimes. Cohen had blamed Mr Trump's influence and ""dirty deeds"" at his sentencing. In a series of tweets on Thursday, Mr Trump also insisted that he ""did nothing wrong"" in regards to campaign finance laws. He said Cohen ""probably was not guilty"" of those campaign violations but pleaded guilty to benefit himself. ""As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!"" Allow Twitter content?

Cohen, 52, was sentenced on Wednesday and must report to prison by 6 March. He had admitted to lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In addition to the jail term, he was also ordered to forfeit nearly $2m (Â£1.6m). He is the first of Mr Trump's inner circle to be jailed over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The attorney, who once said he would take a bullet for the president, told Judge William Pauley that Mr Trump had caused him to ""follow a path of darkness rather than light"". Cohen said it was his ""blind loyalty"" to the president that led him to ignore his own ""moral compass"" and ""cover up [Mr Trump's] dirty deeds"". Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? Mr Trump, who calls Mr Mueller's inquiry a ""witch hunt"", has repeatedly criticised his former ally since he began co-operating with investigators. This video can not be played Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a ""weak person"" and a liar He told reporters last month that Cohen was ""weak"" and ""not a very smart person"". In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Mr Trump said that ""in retrospect I made a mistake"" by hiring Cohen. The sentencing was related to two separate cases brought by the Southern District of New York and Special Counsel Mueller's Russia investigation. Mr Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Mr Trump. One of those payments was made by American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer, to suppress a woman's allegations of an affair with Mr Trump. The Department of Justice announced on Wednesday it had reached a deal with AMI to forego prosecution as long as the company admitted it made the $150,000 payment ""in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign, and in order to ensure that the woman did not publicise damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 election"". The tabloid publisher has agreed to continue co-operating with investigators. The president has acknowledged the payments despite denying the affairs, and called them a private transaction unrelated to his campaign. Cohen's other convictions for tax evasion and bank fraud charges are unrelated to the president. The special counsel had charged Cohen on one count of lying to Congress after a plea deal given his co-operation with the Russia inquiry. The ex-Trump ally admitted to making false statements to Congress about a Trump property deal in Moscow during the 2016 election.

Last week, the special counsel's teamannounced that they would not be pursuing jail time for Flynnas he provided ""substantial"" details regarding the Trump campaign team and Russian officials.

Why is Labour not trying to topple May now?,"With Theresa May on the ropes, Jeremy Corbyn is coming under pressure from other opposition parties - and some of his own MPs - to finish her off with the knockout blow of a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons. Unlike the vote she has just survived this would give all 650 MPs - not just 317 Conservatives - a say over whether she should remain in power. A no-confidence vote - won by a single vote - was how Margaret Thatcher removed Labour from power in 1979, triggering a general election that she won. The rules have changed since then. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act,  if a majority of MPs backed a no-confidence motion, it would start a countdown which would lead to an early election, if no successor government was able to win a vote of confidence within 14 days. PM joining EU summit after surviving vote Corbyn urged to call no-confidence vote Kuenssberg: Tories at war over Brexit More than one way to sack a government The Labour leadership's main aim has always been to force an election, which it believes Mr Corbyn will win. ""We're fully prepared to bring a no-confidence vote when we know we can win,"" said Labour chairman Ian Lavery ina video message on Facebook,external, but, he added, doing so too soon would ""serve only to strengthen Theresa May"". The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs the Tories rely on for a majority, have promised to support the government in a confidence motion. They want to give her time to seek changes to her EU withdrawal deal. But their support is not tied to Mrs May personally and they would not back her if she sought to press ahead with her deal without ditching the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" clause, which they object to. The People's Vote campaign is urging Jeremy Corbyn to back a referendum Mr Corbyn has been accused of ""cowardice"" and of failing to provide proper opposition by the SNP, the Lib Dems and others, for apparently sitting on the sidelines as the Conservative Party tears itself to pieces over Brexit. But Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, has warned that the Labour leader should not be ""bounced"" into holding a no-confidence vote by ""those who have little or no interest in seeing Labour elected"". Mr Corbyn has said he has no confidence in the government but will wait for an ""appropriate"" time to strike. Those pushing for a no-confidence vote as soon as possible are mostly advocates of a further EU referendum - and their best, possibly their only, hope of getting one is if Labour gets behind it. They include the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, a small group of Conservatives and MPs from Labour's pro-EU ""moderate"" wing like Chuka Umunna and Margaret Beckett, who are not natural allies of Mr Corbyn. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and deputy leader Tom Watson are alsoreported to be in the ""just get on with it"" camp,external. Mr Corbyn bowed to pressure from his own party members at this year's Labour conference - the majority of whom, polls suggest, want another referendum. The party leadership said it would consider supporting another referendum if it fails in its bid to get a general election. So the strategy of those pushing Mr Corbyn for a no-confidence vote depends, to some extent, on that vote failing. They are threatening to do this - but it would be largely symbolic, without Labour's backing. Any MP can table a motion of no confidence but it is unlikely to be given Parliamentary time without the support of a major party - and it would stand very little chance of success without the backing of the main opposition party. Some are arguing for a vote next Monday, when Mrs May makes a statement to the Commons on Thursday's EU summit. But it is more likely to be in the New Year when MPs finally get a vote on Mrs May's deal with the EU, which she is widely expected to lose. Some in the pro-referendum camp fear this will be too late to get a referendum together. And some - such as Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts - have suggested this would suit Mr Corbyn, who, she said, might be ""comfortable"" with a no-deal Brexit. John McDonnell: No majority for a no-deal Brexit They are adamant that this is the last thing they want. They say they want to win an election and then delay Brexit so they can go to Brussels and get a better deal that would see the UK being part of a customs union with the EU. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said Labour is ready to work with Theresa May on alternatives to prevent a no-deal Brexit. ""The easiest thing for any opposition to do in these circumstances is to warm your hands as the Conservatives self-immolate,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""But you can't do that, not when the issues are so big for the future of the country."" He urged the prime minister to hold a series of votes in Parliament on different scenarios, including no-deal, to establish what MPs were willing to accept. ""I think there's an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons against no-deal,"" he said. ""Let's establish that once and for all and use parliamentary mechanisms to narrow that option away. Then let's get a proper debate going.""

Reality Check: Does Brussels blink?,"One of the more memorable quotes of the Brexit saga was ascribed to an anonymous source within the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in Northern Ireland. ""This is a battle of who blinks first - and we've cut off our eyelids."" Since thehistoric defeat of her Brexit deal, which was rejected by 230 votes in the Commons, Theresa May has come under pressure to alter it. She said she would ask Brussels for ""legally binding changes"" to the most controversial part of the Withdrawal Agreement -the backstop- the insurance policy which aims to stop the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, after Brexit. At the moment the EU is saying that the deal on the table, painstakingly negotiated for more than 18 months, is as good as it gets. So what form does the EU have on renegotiation? Has it blinked in the past? There are no exact comparisons, because Brexit is a unique situation. But here are a few examples: Denmark narrowly rejected the EU's Maastricht treaty in 1992 and subsequently negotiated four optouts from Maastricht on: joining the euro EU citizenship justice and home affairs a common defence policy The optouts were contained in a legally binding protocol to the treaty but the main body of the text was not changed. In a second referendum, in 1993, Denmark voted in favour. Ireland has lived through two referendums on the same issue on two separate occasions. In 2001, the country voted against the EU's Nice Treaty, mainly because voters were concerned that Irish military forces would have to take part in Nato-led peacekeeping operations. The text of the treaty was not changed but the Irish government issued a national declaration reaffirming its military neutrality. In a second referendum in 2002, the Nice Treaty was approved by an overwhelming margin. Again, in 2008, Irish voters rejected the Lisbon Treaty, citing concerns about tax, abortion and military neutrality. A second referendum, in 2009, approved Lisbon after promises were made to address these concerns. They eventually formeda protocol that was approved in 2012,externalbut the text of the Lisbon Treaty itself was not changed. In 2016 an advisory referendum in the Netherlands rejected an EU trade and cooperation agreement with Ukraine. The Dutch government needed legally binding assurances from the rest of the EU before it could get the deal approved in parliament, and it got them. They came in the form of a declaration spelling out the fact that the agreement did not make any guarantee to Ukraine of future EU membership, nor did it oblige the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with military assistance. But the agreement with Ukraine was not changed in any way, and an equivalent outcome for the Brexit deal would fail to satisfy many Eurosceptic MPs in Westminster. A draft EU constitution was signed by all member states in October 2004 and ratified by 18 countries before being rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. After licking a few wounds, the EU came up with the Lisbon Treaty, which kept many of the main provisions of the draft constitution, including a new president of the European Council and a clause on withdrawal from the EU (Article 50). But it dropped the name ""constitution"" itself and it didn't include references to EU symbols, such as the flag and the anthem, that would normally be associated with a state. The rejection of the constitution led to what were probably the biggest changes the EU has ever made in treaty negotiations but critics say Lisbon was still as close to the proposed constitution as it could get. Before Brexit, the EU was dealing for years with theeurozone crisisand withGreece in particular. Greece was pushed into a financial bailout programme in 2010, accepting huge loans from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return for drastic austerity measures, including tax rises and sweeping cuts in spending and pay. After a new government led by the radical left-wing party Syriza took office in 2015, it held a referendum in which it campaigned for an end to EU-imposed austerity. Despite substantial backing from Greek voters, Brussels (and Berlin) didn't blink. Austerity continued and the government had to apply for another bailout loan in order to stay in the eurozone. In the run-up to the Brexit referendum in the UK, the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, tried to renegotiate aspects of the UK's membership of the European Union, in order to show voters that reform was possible. He won recognition that the UK could opt out of the EU's founding ambition to forge an ""ever closer union"" and he was given guarantees about the rights of EU countries outside the eurozone and vague promises to cut red tape. But even though he also negotiated some limits on the ability of EU migrants to claim benefits, he failed in his push for more far-reaching changes to EU freedom of movement rules. Mr Cameron's renegotiation was largely ignored during the referendum campaign, even though EU officials argued that they had pushed EU law to the limit in an effort to accommodate him. As has often been the case in negotiations between the EU and the UK, the maximum the EU was prepared to offer was less than the minimum than many supporters of Brexit were prepared to accept. Is history about to repeat itself? This piece was updated on 29 January to reflect Theresa May's statement to the House of Commons. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

What will Ireland do if thereÃ¢ÂÂs no deal?,"The Irish government has been consistent that whatever happens in the Brexit process there will be no hardening of the Irish border. Asked earlier this year,Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said: ""That will just never happen - ever."" But how can that promise be kept in the event that the UK leaves the EU without a deal? If there is no deal, there is no transition period or backstop. It would mean the UK becomes a country with which the EU has no trade deal of any description. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Irish 'upping no deal contingency plans' Has NI hit peak Brexit? Reality Check: A plan to unlock the Irish border problem The border checks already in place For countries like that, the EU normally imposes a range of checks at its borders. There are customs checks, like those on the Norway-Sweden border, and regulatory checks particularly in regard to food products. These involve hard borders of the sort the Irish government says it will never accept. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The EU says these border checks are necessary to protect what it refers to as the ""integrity"" of its single market and customs union. Essentially, it means that the EU wants to prevent products entering its market which could be unsafe or represent unfair competition. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has consistently emphasised this. In July he said: ""The single market is our main economic public good. We will not damage it."" So if there is no deal, what will the Irish government be expected to do to protect the integrity of the single market at the frontier with the UK? If no deal is as much of a disaster as forecast then the EU may calculate that the UK will be back at the negotiating table within weeks. So would it be feasible, for a very temporary period, to have no new checks on products crossing the Irish border? Leo Varadkar says the Irish government is committed that a hard border will not be implemented Arguably there would be little risk to the integrity of the single market, as on Brexit day the UK would be aligned with EU product standards. It is possible that if EU authorities decide not to check UK goods at the Irish border, but do check them at Calais or Dunkirk, it would provoke a complaint to the WTO. However, if this is only a very short-term arrangement, such a complaint is unlikely to go anywhere. Daniel Keohane, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, says such a crisis response would probably be feasible and seems to be the main hope in Dublin. But he doubts such an arrangement could last more than a few weeks. ""If, for example, large quantities of prohibited goods were proven to have circulated in the EU single market during that period because of the open Irish border, there would be huge pressure on Dublin from EU partners to have checks at or near the border,"" he said. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? If the UK finds itself able to cope with a no deal there will inevitably be a difficult conversation between Brussels and Dublin about what to do next. Could there be checks close to the border rather than at the border? Back in May 2017 the head of Ireland's customs authorities raised the prospect of what he called ""trade facilitation posts"". Revenue Commissioner Liam Irwin said these could be facilities which were not at the border but ""10 or 15 kilometres back"". He suggested up to 8% of cross border freight could be checked there, complemented by some form of risk-based, customs checks carried out by mobile units. He also emphasised that customs declarations would happen electronically, and most transactions would be immediately approved. The Irish border has been one of the biggest sticking points during Brexit negotiations This sounds a lot like the ""maximum facilitation"" proposals floated by the UK government in 2017 and rejected by the EU. This sort of arrangement would also be a hard border by the Irish government's current definition. Mr Keohane said that if checks had to be carried out, they would ""probably look like what the Revenue Commissioners suggest, which is not that dissimilar to current customs posts at the Swiss-EU border, even if not directly on the border"". He says in such a scenario Ireland could expect financial help and perhaps political cover from the EU. ""Dublin does not have to - nor in any way wants to - legitimise it (a hard border) as a permanent feature - so the EU could politically agree that this is a crisis measure, similar to the 2001 foot and mouth crisis,"" Mr Keohane adds. The pro-Brexit economist Andrew Lilico has suggested what he calls a ""Celtic Sea border"". That would mean that the Irish land border would remain soft with no new checks and controls but goods leaving the island of Ireland would be subject to checks if they were going to the EU. Mr Lilico says such checks should be less problematic, in sovereignty or market integrity terms, than new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He points to the movement of people as a precedent. Ireland is not a member of the EU's Schengen arrangement but instead forms a Common Travel Area with the UK. ""There are already border checks at the Celtic Sea border in respect of persons (and hence of services) because Ireland is not in Schengen,"" said Mr Lilico. ""Yet I put it to you that no-one thinks those make Ireland a 'semi-detached part of the single market'."" Ireland is not a member of the EU's Schengen arrangement but forms a Common Travel Area with the UK He also proposes that the NI Assembly would have the power to align regulation, in various areas, with Ireland's, thereby having the choice to shift some checks to the Irish Sea border. Mr Keohane agrees that such an arrangement is technically feasible in the short term but sees much greater political difficulties. ""It is not politically acceptable for Ireland, as a remaining EU member, since it would diminish its membership rights,"" he adds. ""The rest of the EU would also unlikely want to set such a precedent, that one of its members could have its membership rights diminished because of the action of a third country (as the UK would be at that stage).""

May vote leaves Europe media unimpressed,"British Prime Minister Theresa May's relief at winning the Conservative Party confidence vote is only momentary as nothing substantial about the withdrawal agreement is likely to change, many European newspapers say. The difficulty of resolving the key issue of the Irish border means Europe continues to plan for a likely no-deal Brexit, several papers point out. ""Theresa May has saved her skin,"" says France'scentre-right daily Le Figaro,external. But ""the relief of having preserved the confidence of a majority of her MPs does not change the arithmetic of hostility towards the agreement"". ""With more than a third of MPs having disavowed her, the battle to pass the despised text in parliament promises to be fierce,"" notes theweekly magazine L'Obs,external. ""Her small majority is also a slap in the face."" She will come to the EU summit today ""without the credit of trust to re-negotiate the agreement"", saysSpain's centre-left daily El Pais,external. Germany'spopular tabloid Bild,externalÂ dismisses the vote of confidence as ""political spectacle"".Â ""May's victory was foreseeable,"" the paper says, adding that it also does not change the ""simple reality - there is NO parliamentary majority for any of the Brexit variants on the table"". ""Among Brussels diplomats' anger is growing over the wannabe captains of Westminster, who are steering the whole country into a reality iceberg,"" it adds.Â Belgianfinancial daily De Tijd,externalalso criticises the confidence vote, calling it ""the umpteenth distraction"". ""One of the miscalculations made by most of the British political class in the Brexit saga was to underestimate the solidarity with Irish concerns by the rest of the EU,""says commentator Stephen Collins in The Irish Times,external. ""There was an expectation in London that EU unity would begin to fracture during the Brexit talks as major states eyed their own interests."" Anothercommentary in The Irish Independent,external, however, warns that those who came up with the backstop stipulated in the current withdrawal agreement ""misread British politics and the British"". The demand ""increased hostility towards Ireland in Britain"" and ""could end up bringing about that which it was designed to prevent"", Dan O'Brien argues. ""The Irish question has become a key issue,"" agrees Germany'scentre-left daily Suddeutsche Zeitung.,external""Everything stands or falls with it."" ""As the danger of a no-deal scenario approaches, the memory of the once-hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland becomes stronger,"" it adds. ""The deal on the table would be a pragmatic solution, but May has brought it to absurdity with her demands for renegotiation. The EU will not allow substantial changes, so Europe has to prepare for anything,"" Suddeutsche Zeitung says. Meanwhile Belgium'scentre-right daily De Standaard,externalsays: ""The probability that May's deal will eventually be rejected, and Brexit ends in a no deal, remains high. That is why preparations for this catastrophic scenario continue unabated in Europe."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is quoted in thecentre-left Volkskrant newspaper,externalsuggesting that the EU might allow the UK to postpone Brexit. ""I cannot speak for 27 member states, but if such a question were to come up, this will in itself be looked upon sympathetically.

What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal?,"The Irish government has been consistent that whatever happens in the Brexit process there will be no hardening of the Irish border. Asked earlier this year,Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said: ""That will just never happen - ever."" But how can that promise be kept in the event that the UK leaves the EU without a deal? If there is no deal, there is no transition period or backstop. It would mean the UK becomes a country with which the EU has no trade deal of any description. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Irish 'upping no deal contingency plans' Has NI hit peak Brexit? Reality Check: A plan to unlock the Irish border problem The border checks already in place For countries like that, the EU normally imposes a range of checks at its borders. There are customs checks, like those on the Norway-Sweden border, and regulatory checks particularly in regard to food products. These involve hard borders of the sort the Irish government says it will never accept. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The EU says these border checks are necessary to protect what it refers to as the ""integrity"" of its single market and customs union. Essentially, it means that the EU wants to prevent products entering its market which could be unsafe or represent unfair competition. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has consistently emphasised this. In July he said: ""The single market is our main economic public good. We will not damage it."" So if there is no deal, what will the Irish government be expected to do to protect the integrity of the single market at the frontier with the UK? If no deal is as much of a disaster as forecast then the EU may calculate that the UK will be back at the negotiating table within weeks. So would it be feasible, for a very temporary period, to have no new checks on products crossing the Irish border? Leo Varadkar says the Irish government is committed that a hard border will not be implemented Arguably there would be little risk to the integrity of the single market, as on Brexit day the UK would be aligned with EU product standards. It is possible that if EU authorities decide not to check UK goods at the Irish border, but do check them at Calais or Dunkirk, it would provoke a complaint to the WTO. However, if this is only a very short-term arrangement, such a complaint is unlikely to go anywhere. Daniel Keohane, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, says such a crisis response would probably be feasible and seems to be the main hope in Dublin. But he doubts such an arrangement could last more than a few weeks. ""If, for example, large quantities of prohibited goods were proven to have circulated in the EU single market during that period because of the open Irish border, there would be huge pressure on Dublin from EU partners to have checks at or near the border,"" he said. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? If the UK finds itself able to cope with a no deal there will inevitably be a difficult conversation between Brussels and Dublin about what to do next. Could there be checks close to the border rather than at the border? Back in May 2017 the head of Ireland's customs authorities raised the prospect of what he called ""trade facilitation posts"". Revenue Commissioner Liam Irwin said these could be facilities which were not at the border but ""10 or 15 kilometres back"". He suggested up to 8% of cross border freight could be checked there, complemented by some form of risk-based, customs checks carried out by mobile units. He also emphasised that customs declarations would happen electronically, and most transactions would be immediately approved. The Irish border has been one of the biggest sticking points during Brexit negotiations This sounds a lot like the ""maximum facilitation"" proposals floated by the UK government in 2017 and rejected by the EU. This sort of arrangement would also be a hard border by the Irish government's current definition. Mr Keohane said that if checks had to be carried out, they would ""probably look like what the Revenue Commissioners suggest, which is not that dissimilar to current customs posts at the Swiss-EU border, even if not directly on the border"".

Hospitals 'overcrowding risk' ahead of Christmas,"Hospitals in England are so overcrowded ahead of Christmas care is being put at risk, experts say, with some places having to turn away ambulances because they cannot accept any more patients. NHS England's first weekly report of the winter shows nearly 95% of beds are occupied. Anything above 85% is unsafe. Experts warned hospitals were in the ""red zone"" and it was a risk to care. The data for last week showed eight A&Es had diverted ambulance crews elsewhere because they were so busy. And even when ambulances were able to drop patients off, significant numbers were facing delays. Ambulance crews are meant to be able to handover patients to A&E staff within 15 minutes of arrival - but in one in nine cases it took over 30 minutes. An NHS England official said staff were ""working hard"" to keep up with demand.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. ""As the colder weather begins to set in, it's vital that the NHS and local authorities continue to work together to help people stay well and out of hospital wherever possible. ""The public can also help NHS staff by making sure they have their free flu jab if eligible and by using NHS 111 as their first port of call for non-emergencies."" It is more than a year since any part of the UK has hit one of its three key targets - for: A&E waits cancer care hospital operations The extra money announced by the government in the summer will not start reaching the front line until next year. Siva Anandaciva, of the  King's Fund think tank, said the figures showed the NHS was ""already under tremendous strain"". ""Despite a mild start to winter and low flu levels, targets are still being badly missed. ""These figures show little slack in a system, which is operating consistently in the red zone. ""Hospital bed occupancy levels are already higher than recommended levels, the point at which hospitals are so full that good patient care is put at risk."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Winter is only just beginning for our NHS and these are hugely concerning figures that don't bode well for the difficult weeks ahead.""

"Police operation amid Strasbourg manhuntSuspected gunman Cherif Chekatt, who killed three at a Christmas market, is still on the run.Europe","Police special forces were seen in the Neudorf neighbourhood on Thursday afternoon Police in the French city of Strasbourg have carried out a security operation in the district of Neudorf as they continue their hunt for the gunman who attacked a Christmas market on Tuesday. Cherif Chekatt, 29, has been on the run since the attack, which left three people dead and many more injured. He was dropped off in Neudorf by a taxi which he commandeered to leave the city centre. Hundreds of police are hunting for him in France and Germany. The suspect was wounded in an exchange of fire with soldiers during the attack. Strasbourg shooting: What we know so far Face to face with the gunman It is not known whether the armed officers in Neudorf were searching directly for Chekatt, a convicted criminal who became a radical Islamist while in prison. French media reported that members of police special forces had sealed off several streets in the area. No arrests were made. Earlier on Thursday, French officials confirmed that a third person had died of their injuries following the attack. A fourth person is described as brain-dead, and 12 more are injured, several of them seriously. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner has told parliament that 720 police officers and other members of the security forces were searching for the gunman. German authorities are also hunting for Chekatt, amid fears he may have fled over the nearby border. Strasbourg's Christmas market - usually a major draw for tourists - remained closed on Thursday. French officials urged ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters to call off demonstrations planned for Saturday to enable authorities to maintain security in the run-up to Christmas. Meanwhile, a fifth person has been taken into custody by investigators. The suspect's parents and two of his brothers had already been detained for questioning. The fifth person is not related to Chekatt, officials said. According to police, Cherif Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat. He was the subject of a ""fiche S"", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result. Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home. A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition. The death of Kamal Naghchband, originally from Afghanistan, was announced on Thursday. The father of three died in hospital. His mosque announced that his funeral will take place after Friday prayers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lockerbie: The town scarred by terror," Marjory McQueen was in the living room of her home in Lockerbie watching television with her teenage daughter Victoria. It was the shortest day of the year and there were just four more days until Christmas. Marjory McQueen saw the sky turn orange For the McQueen family, like millions of others in the UK, the must-see midweek show was This is Your Life. Children’s entertainer Harry Corbett was the celebrity being surprised by presenter Michael Aspel who was dressed as Sooty, one of Corbett’s glove puppet creations. As the programme got into its rhythm, Marjory became unsettled by a noise – “I think I hear thunder,” she said to 14-year-old Victoria. But instead of rumbling away, the thunder kept getting louder. “Oh, I wonder if the boiler’s about to explode,” the 42-year-old thought. The whole sky turned orange and there were flames hundreds of feet up into the air Marjory, whose doctor husband Ken was out with friends, was so baffled by this sound she ventured into the cold wintry night. She recalls: “When I went outside, I was aware of something just going past the house. “And then, within five seconds, there was this enormous - it wasn’t an explosion, I would never call it an explosion - it was a ‘crump’. That was all I heard. “And then there was a whoosh, and suddenly the whole sky turned orange, and there were flames hundreds of feet up into the air. I had no idea what had happened.” A few hundred yards away from her home in this small town in south-west Scotland, a scene of unimaginable devastation was unfolding. Canon Patrick Keegans had recently been appointed parish priest and was looking forward to spending his first Christmas in Lockerbie, where he lived at 1 Sherwood Crescent. The clergyman had made new friends in the street and that evening he was due to meet up with two of them, Dora and Maurice Henry. Fr Keegans had recently moved to Lockerbie He planned to take his visiting mother to the Henrys’ after watching the evening news on television. Before they left, he went upstairs to make sure he had hidden his mother’s Christmas present. Suddenly he heard what he thought was a military plane overhead. To Fr Keegans, it sounded like it was going to crash into a nearby field. “Immediately after that, there was an enormous explosion,” he says. The shaking stopped and to his surprise he was uninjured. Downstairs, Fr Keegans found his mother safe, having been shielded from the blast by a fridge freezer. Houses in Sherwood Crescent were destroyed in the explosion The pair stumbled out of the house into a scene of destruction. Sherwood Crescent was on fire and most of the houses were destroyed. The bodies of the Henrys were never found. They were among 11 residents of Sherwood Crescent who died that night. Peter Giesecke lived in Park Place in the Rosebank area of Lockerbie - a quiet neighbourhood of neat former council houses, arranged around play parks on the eastern edge of town. The 35-year-old’s three children were in bed when, just after 7pm, he heard a deep rumbling sound. Peter Giesecke heard a huge crash at his back door From his front window, he saw a bright light fall from the sky and explode on the ground close to nearby Sherwood Crescent. Within moments there was a huge crash at the back door. The lights went out and the family were in darkness. “The children had come down the stairs, they were screaming, there was glass and debris all over the place,” he says. “So I got a torch and I shone the torch outside.” There was a strong smell of aviation fuel and debris was scattered across his garden. But worse than that were the bodies. “There were bodies over my hedge, they were lying outside the front windows. They were all over the place.” Forever in his mind is the girl lying on his garden hedge. “I shall always remember that girl - she was wearing a blue top, a sweater.” The remains of more than 60 people were eventually removed from this small corner of the town. Just over 35 minutes before the explosion, Pan Am flight 103 took off from Heathrow Airport and headed almost directly north. After crossing the border with Scotland, the pilot guided the plane slightly to the west. It was due to head out over the Atlantic, bound for New York’s John F Kennedy airport. But shortly after 7pm, PA103 disappeared from radar screens. Multiple signals were seen fanning out and downwards from its last radar position. There was no distress call. Afterwards there was radio silence. There were 259 passengers and crew on board. The cockpit and the forward section of the plane, along with the crew and passengers inside, fell 31,000ft to the ground. It landed in a field near Tundergarth Church, two-and-a-half miles east of Lockerbie. The rest of the 747 went into a steep, gliding dive, from 31,000ft to 19,000ft. By now almost directly above Lockerbie, the entire wing section broke off. The wings and the fuel tanks dropped down in a straight line, landing on Sherwood Crescent, close to the home of Fr Keegans. More than 1,500 tonnes of material was blown into the air, leaving a crater 143ft long. The back end of the plane, which contained most of the flight’s passengers, fell on Rosebank - the area around Peter Giesecke’s family home. Just over the fence from Peter’s garden, houses in Rosebank Crescent bore the brunt of the crash. A huge slice was taken out of the side of one home, exposing bedrooms to the open air. George Stobbs was a police inspector at Lockerbie. A former miner, he was a “rural bobby”, just a few years away from retirement. That night, his wife heard the explosion from their home in Lochmaben, four miles to the west of Lockerbie. George Stobbs witnessed the immediate aftermath of the crash When he learned that a plane had crashed, he went straight back on duty. George was keen to understand the scale of the devastation. “I went to Rosebank and there was this part of the fuselage which was buried in the garden, it had clipped the side of a house,” he says. “And there was a lot of people still inside. No bodies had been removed by that time. Eventually they took 60 people out of that part of the plane.” Military personnel were brought in to help emergency service workers From there, he went to Tundergarth where the nose cone was lying in a field. With its windows still intact, from one angle the wreckage looked “not too bad”. “But obviously when you went round to the other side of the aircraft, it was just miles of wires and people strapped in seats. It was a gruesome mess inside.” Just a few hours after the explosion, Josephine Donaldson and her husband Robert went back to their house. There was a rumour that looters were already in the area, and they wanted to make sure their home in Carlisle Road was secure. The town was full of fires, debris, ambulances, firefighters, and police. The area around their house was cleared amid fears a nearby petrol station could catch fire. Josephine Donaldson found a girl's handbag in her garden The Donaldsons crept home along the fields behind their home. Once inside, Josephine looked out into her garden and spotted a handbag lying on the ground. “I opened it up, and there was this girl’s 21st birthday cards,” she says. “Her name was Nicole Boulanger, and she had been 21 on the 28th October that year.” When she switched the news on, Josephine saw Nicole’s mother waiting at the airport in New York. Nicole Boulanger was one of 35 students from Syracuse University “I just felt so, so sad,” she says. “She was there to meet her daughter at the airport and then discovered that the Pan Am 103 had been blown up, and I just felt how strange having her daughter’s handbag. “And that’s when I decided right away, I would look after that girl and always put a flower down at the memorial garden for her.” Nicole Boulanger was a talented singer, dancer, and musician. She was studying for a degree in musical theatre, and her coming-of-age had coincided with the trip of a lifetime. Nicole celebrated her 21st birthday in London, where she was one of 35 students from New York State’s Syracuse University who had just completed a term studying in the capital. They all lost their lives in the Lockerbie bombing. Thursday 22 December 1988 was the first day of a changed Lockerbie. Across the town, across Scotland, across the world, the scale of the tragedy was becoming clear. Rescue workers and media flooded in. In the surrounding hills, police and rescue teams were finding and tagging the bodies of the victims. Soldiers searched the streets for parts of the wrecked passenger plane They brought them back to the makeshift mortuaries which were set up in Lockerbie town hall, and later the local ice rink. Meanwhile, David and Steven Flannigan, whose parents and sister were killed in Sherwood Crescent the previous night, visited Marjory McQueen at her home. Steven, 14, witnessed the plane crash from a neighbour’s home; his 19-year-old brother had been living in Blackpool. Thomas and Kathleen Flannigan died with their daughter, Joanne. She didn’t know what to say to them and for a while they sat in silence. “And then David said to me, ‘Can I show you something?’ “And I said, ‘Yeah, sure’. And he took me out to the car, and he opened the boot, and he took out a tiny watering can. “Something that you pick up in Woolworths for 50p. And he said, ‘That’s all I can find of my family’. “And I think it was then that we just realised, just how awful this was. And that’s something I will never, ever forget. Never.” Despite the horror of the crash, Fr Keegans was keen to keep Christmas as normal as possible for the children of Lockerbie. The Christmas lights remained lit but he told his bishop he would only be able to say one short prayer during midnight mass. “Well, I managed to get out about 10 words, and that was it. I just cracked up.” Many of the town’s residents were keen to help the families of the bereaved. A group of local women set up a “laundry” to sort, wash and iron clothes recovered from the wreckage. They matched them to their owners, packed them up and sent them to the victims’ families. Josephine Donaldson – who found Nicole Boulanger’s handbag in her garden – was among the volunteers. Amy Elizabeth Shapiro was among the passengers on Flight 103 “Some of the boxes the police would give you, you just did it on autopilot, others you maybe had a wee look through,” she says. “And this particular day, it was a portfolio I was interested in, and obviously she was one of the students, and she had these lovely photographs, and inside her portfolio was her 21st birthday cards, and she had the same birthday as Nicole Boulanger. “She’d celebrated her birthday on the 28th October. Her name was Amy Beth Shapiro. So I always referred to these two girls as my two girls.” During the weeks that followed the bombing, relatives of the Pan Am passengers arrived in Lockerbie. They sought comfort and answers about the deaths of their loved ones. Peter Giesecke learned that the girl whose body he found in his back garden was Anne Lindsey Otenasek. The 21-year-old social work student was a native of Baltimore and one of the 35 Syracuse students. Sometime later, her parents came to Peter’s front door. He recalls that the student’s mother said “I believe my daughter was found in your garden”. Peter showed her exactly where he found the body and they talked about it all night. “We actually went out for tea that night and they were a very, very, nice couple,” he says. “And we still keep in contact at Christmas time and send cards and send flowers.” Twelve years after Pan Am 103 fell on Lockerbie, Libyan intelligence agent Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted of mass murder. The trial took place in a Scottish court specially set up at Camp Zeist in The Netherlands. He was sentenced in 2001 to 27 years in a Scottish prison but was released on compassionate grounds eight years later after being diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. He died in 2012. But the story did not die with him. Megrahi was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds Doubts about the safety of his conviction and the part played by the CIA in gathering evidence against Megrahi persist to this day. Megrahi’s family is currently making a third attempt to appeal against his conviction. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission is now considering whether there are grounds to refer his case to the appeal court. There is no one view on this in Lockerbie. For Peter Giesecke, Megrahi was “guilty all the way” and he was against his early release. But he does not think Megrahi was the sole murderer. “It hasn’t come completely out and I don’t think it will. We’ll never get to the root of it. I don’t think so. Megrahi was the main man but there’s other men out there as well.” Dr Jim Swire lost his daughter, Flora, in the Pan Am bombing Marjory McQueen has little interest in the legal and political fallout from the bombing. “I really, really felt that what Lockerbie was about, was about looking after the people who so tragically lost their lives here,” she says. “And that’s what we want to be remembered for.” Fr Keegans, who is now retired, joined the Justice for Megrahi campaign after meeting Megrahi and his family. The group, which was set up by Dr Jim Swire, the father of one of the British victims of the bombing, is backing the push for an appeal. Lockerbie lives with us, we’re part of Lockerbie and Lockerbie’s part of us “I can’t live with myself being silent, when I’m truly convinced that this man has been unjustly convicted,” Fr Keegans says. “Lockerbie is an unfinished story from the point of view of the legal aspects. “But for those of us who experienced Lockerbie, Lockerbie’s story will never come to an end. Lockerbie lives with us, we’re part of Lockerbie and Lockerbie’s part of us.” “All aspects of Lockerbie stay with us. The horror, the tragedy, the sadness, the grief, the support and love that was shown. All of that stays with us.” Today Lockerbie is a neat, handsome town which appears to be doing rather well. It stands beside the motorway linking Glasgow and Carlisle, and it is a market town for the surrounding farms. Home to 4,000 residents, it was never a remote, isolated village - but it never expected to be the centre of global terrorism and tragedy. It has changed a lot in three decades, with new factories and housing estates contributing to a slight population increase. I’m very proud to say that I live in Lockerbie, and that the town reacted the way it did Where families were wiped out, lives cut short and homes destroyed, there are memorials - but there is also new life. In Sherwood Crescent - the epicentre of the devastation - houses have been rebuilt alongside a modest stone of remembrance. To the west of the town is Dryfesdale Cemetery, where a visitor centre tells the story of Pan Am 103 and the Lockerbie Air Disaster Memorial stands in silent testimony to the 270 dead. Street sculptures celebrate Lockerbie's connection with agriculture The other lasting memorial is the scholarship which every year gives two students from Lockerbie Academy the chance to study at Syracuse University. The university’s motto is “Look Back, Act Forward”. It could speak for the whole town and all those whose lives were touched by the murders. Marjory McQueen says the scholarship proves that good can come out of terrible tragedy. “I’m very proud to say that I live in Lockerbie, and that the town reacted the way it did,” she says. “I think, in a way, when something like this happens, it’s a terrible tragedy. It’s dreadful. But if you wait long enough, good comes out of it. “And anyone who comes to Lockerbie, I’m very pleased to say that they are met and are shown round. And Lockerbie will never, never forget their relatives, and how they died here.” Visitors to the town pay tribute to the victims of flight 103 Josephine Donaldson is typical of the people in Lockerbie - proud of the way they came together, but reluctant to take credit for the part she played. Twice a year, she visits the memorial in a small act of remembrance for Nicole and Amy Elizabeth, two young women she never met but still refers to as “my girls”. “I always put the flowers on there for their birthday and the 21 December. I never told anyone, I never signed the card, I just put ‘JD’. “I just felt I had to do it. I had a son, and if that had happened in America and I never got him home, I would have hoped someone would have done the same.” Built with Shorthand"
Police operation amid Strasbourg manhunt,"Police special forces were seen in the Neudorf neighbourhood on Thursday afternoon Police in the French city of Strasbourg have carried out a security operation in the district of Neudorf as they continue their hunt for the gunman who attacked a Christmas market on Tuesday. Cherif Chekatt, 29, has been on the run since the attack, which left three people dead and many more injured. He was dropped off in Neudorf by a taxi which he commandeered to leave the city centre. Hundreds of police are hunting for him in France and Germany. The suspect was wounded in an exchange of fire with soldiers during the attack. Strasbourg shooting: What we know so far Face to face with the gunman It is not known whether the armed officers in Neudorf were searching directly for Chekatt, a convicted criminal who became a radical Islamist while in prison. French media reported that members of police special forces had sealed off several streets in the area. No arrests were made. Earlier on Thursday, French officials confirmed that a third person had died of their injuries following the attack. A fourth person is described as brain-dead, and 12 more are injured, several of them seriously. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner has told parliament that 720 police officers and other members of the security forces were searching for the gunman. German authorities are also hunting for Chekatt, amid fears he may have fled over the nearby border. Strasbourg's Christmas market - usually a major draw for tourists - remained closed on Thursday. French officials urged ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters to call off demonstrations planned for Saturday to enable authorities to maintain security in the run-up to Christmas. Meanwhile, a fifth person has been taken into custody by investigators. The suspect's parents and two of his brothers had already been detained for questioning. The fifth person is not related to Chekatt, officials said. According to police, Cherif Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat. He was the subject of a ""fiche S"", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result. Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home. A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition. The death of Kamal Naghchband, originally from Afghanistan, was announced on Thursday. The father of three died in hospital. His mosque announced that his funeral will take place after Friday prayers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New EastEnders set goes Â£27m over budget,"This video can not be played Aerial pictures show work on the new EastEnders set in Elstree, as filming takes place on the existing set. The BBC's project to build a brand new, HD-ready Albert Square and expand the external EastEnders set will now cost Â£27m more than originally planned. The original 2015 forecast for the scheme was Â£59.7m, but the revised budget is now Â£86.7m, the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed. The new set was originally due to open in 2018, but won't be ready until 2023. The BBC said the project was ""large"" and ""complex"", adding that there had been ""challenges on the way"". A brand new Queen Vic pub is being built as part of the new set The corporation is building a new Albert Square near the existing set at the BBC's Elstree studios in Hertfordshire. It will have actual brick buildings - unlike the current one, which only uses facades. The external EastEnders set dates back to the soap's birth in 1984 and was only supposed to be used for two years, but has lasted for 34. The soap cannot currently be filmed in high definition, and the BBC said the poor condition of the current set is increasingly causing delays to filming. The building project - titled E20 - was announced in 2015 and was meant to finish by August 2018. The original set was only supposed to be used for two years In its report, the NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament, said the extra costs mean ""the BBC will not be able to deliver value for money... in the way that it envisaged in 2015"". The body took aim at the early planning stage, which ""resulted in the BBC underestimating aspects of complexity, cost and risks of its approach"". However, the NAO also acknowledged that the BBC had faced issues such as asbestos and obstructions in the ground, which could not have been foreseen when the project was first planned. Inflation has also risen faster than expected in the construction industry - although the NAO said inflation ""had a greater impact than it would have done had the programme been completed without any delays"". Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""We believe that the planned benefits are still broadly achievable, but given the high risk nature of E20 it will need close scrutiny until it's finished."" The NAO said ""some of the reasons for the delays and cost increases could have been addressed earlier by the BBC"", adding that the corporation ""had made many improvements to the programme"" in the last 18 months. The funeral of Peggy Mitchell was a big Walford event ""The show remains one of the BBC's flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London. ""It's a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre but like any building work of this scale there have been challenges on the way, including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site. ""As the NAO recognises we've already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny."" The BBC added that it would ""continue to capture... lessons learned on the programme"". EastEnders is currently watched by around six million people per episode, compared with about 7.5 million for its ITV rival Coronation Street. The Manchester-based soap opened a new set in 2013, but the cost of that was never made public. At EastEnders, the so-called ""front lot"", which is the replacement for the existing set, will now be finished by 2021 - but work on the ""back lot"", which will include new Walford outdoor locations, will go on until May 2023. Work that has already taken place on E20 includes new boiler heating and edit suites, additional stage capacity and a new site entrance.

Government pledges extra Â£300m for police,"Police forces in England and Wales are set to receive an extra Â£300m to help pay for pension expenses and other costs, ministers have announced. Since 2010, central government funding to police forces has been cut by almost a third, in real terms, leading the number of officers to fall by 21,000. Police and Crime Commissioners, who represent the public, say the stretched service is struggling to cope. Police Minister Nick Hurd accepted the deal came at a ""time of real pressure"". He added that forces needed ""additional support to help them do their job"" and said officers were ""bearing down on the worst spike in serious violence and knife crime that we have seen in a decade"". The funding breaks down as: An extra Â£161m next year for England and Wales' 43 police forces, which the Home Office says will protect police budgets in ""real terms"". This brings the total to  Â£7.8bn next year A Â£153m grant to help plug a shortfall in funding because of changes to pensions contributions Police and Crime Commissioners will also be able to increase the policing element of council tax. This means households could pay an extra Â£24 a year for a Band D property, although local residents must be consulted first. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the various funding announcements, as well as money for serious and organised crime units and counter-terrorism, could mean a total increase in funding for the police system of ""up to Â£970m"" - the biggest since 2010. Ministers have listened. The settlement won't be anywhere near enough to reverse the 30% real-terms cut in central government funding to forces since 2010, but it provides them with a measure of financial stability and will enable some constabularies to go ahead with plans to recruit extra officers. Crucially, it'll largely plug a Â£165m pensions gap in 2019-20 which PCCs hadn't budgeted for. However, the overall police workforce remains shrunken: there are 44,000 fewer officers, staff and community support officers than in 2010: demand on the service is rising; and serious violence is at levels not seen for a decade. The next spending review, which is expected to cover a five-year period from 2020, will be crucial in determining whether those issues are addressed. Roger Hirst, of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, welcomed the extra funding, saying it would help them to deal with cost pressures from inflation and pensions, and invest in technology. He said the ability to raise council tax levels would allow for investment in local policing priorities, an area the public wants more investment in. But David Jamieson, Labour PCC for the West Midlands - the second largest force in England and Wales - said the payments fell a ""long way short"". He said West Midlands Police has faced cuts of Â£175m since 2010, leading to a fall in officer numbers by more than 2,000. ""Despite warm words over the last few months, this is once again a disappointing settlement that falls a long way short of what West Midlands Police needed from the government. ""Government grants to West Midlands Police are falling in real terms and the government is piling the pressure on council taxpayers. ""Crime is rising and we require a significant boost in police officer numbers to tackle the problem. ""At a time when living standards are being squeezed and our economic future is increasingly uncertain, the government has made it clear it expects PCCs to increase council tax."" The National Police Chiefs' Council - which represents the country's most senior officers - said the government had been right to recognise the serious pressures on policing. The Police Federation, which represents police constables, sergeants and inspectors, accused the government of ""passing the buck"" of funding to local communities. Labour's shadow policing minister Louise Haigh said the settlement represented a ninth consecutive year of real-terms cuts to the police by central government. She said plans to raise income from council tax payers were ""perverse"" and accused Mr Hurd of trying to dress up ""cuts from central government funding"" as good news.

Final $5m verdict in Blurred Lines trial,"Blurred Lines made more than $15m for Pharrell Williams (left) and Robin Thicke The long-running copyright case over hit song Blurred Lines has finally ended, with Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams told to pay $5m (Â£4m). The ruling concludes a legal battle that began in 2013, when Marvin Gaye's family claimed Blurred Lines copied Gaye's 1977 hit Got to Give It Up. Gaye's family initiallywon the casein 2015, but Thicke and Williams appealed. A California courtupheld the verdictin March this year, and the new amended judgement confirms the settlement. Thicke, Williams and Williams' publishing company More Water From Nazareth are jointly required to pay Gaye's family damages of $2.8m (Â£2.2m). Meanwhile, Thicke has been ordered to pay an additional $1.7m (Â£1.3m), while Williams and his publishing company will pay another $357,630 (Â£282,296). In addition, Gaye's family will be entitled to 50% of all future royalties earned by Blurred Lines. The total payable is $4.98m (Â£3.9m) - a fraction of the $16.6m (Â£13m) Williams and Thicke were revealed to have made from the song during the initial trial. Ed Sheeran has been hit by similar claims of plagiarism The five-year legal battle has been watched closely by the music industry, where copyright cases have multiplied in recent years. Many felt the original verdict was mistaken, as it punished Thicke's song for copying the ""feel"" of Gaye's classic - an intangible quality - rather than directly plagiarising musical phrases or lyrics. The appeal court was also split on this issue, and one of the three judges dissented from the ruling when it was delivered earlier this year. Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen said the two songs ""differed in melody, harmony and rhythm"" and wrote that the verdict ""strikes a devastating blow to future musicians and composers everywhere"". However, two of Gaye's children, Frankie and Nona, called the decision ""a victory for the rights of all musicians"". Their mother Jan added it was a ""wonderful recognition of Marvin's creativity and the lasting value of one of his greatest songs"". Since the Blurred Lines trial, there have been a number of similar cases against such artists as Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Mark Ronson, Madonna and Miley Cyrus. Others have sought to pre-empt any copyright claims - including Taylor Swift, who gifted Right Said Fred a writing credit on her single Look What You Made Me Do after noticing a passing similarity to their hit I'm Too Sexy; and Ed Sheeran, who added the writers of TLC's No Scrubs to his single Shape Of You shortly after its release.

Kuenssberg: Tories at war,"Theresa May will front up in Brussels later - still the prime minister, still officially in charge. One cabinet minister last night told me the whole challenge to her had been ""futile"", suggesting it hadn't really changed much. But it really has. Mrs May has a temporary shield from another direct call for her departure from her own MPs. Angry Brexiteers can't try to move her out for another year in the same way. That on its own is a sigh of relief certainly for her supporters, who were claiming a ""good result"" last night. But that does not remotely protect her from the brutal reality that she, right now, has no workable Brexit policy that can make it through the Commons. Those who were pushing to force her out on Wednesday simply won't give up. Just watch their resistance as, and when, a modified compromise with the EU actually makes it to a Commons vote. Right now there's no chance they will back her. And some of them might, just might, be willing to contemplate the nuclear option - to join with opposition MPs if they call for a vote of no confidence of the whole House of Commons. Political fallout after May wins vote PM to join EU summit in Brussels War, not peace, has broken out. One government minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""They never, ever, stop. Votes against them, letters going in late - nothing matters to the ERG. After the apocalypse, all that will be left will be ants and Tory MPs complaining about Europe and their leader."" And in order to survive, the prime minister had to give up the possibility of taking her party into the next election. When prime ministers do that - whether it was Tony Blair after the failed curry plot to get rid of him, or David Cameron's kitchen confessional where he stunned his colleagues by admitting he wouldn't seek a third term - what power they have starts to drain away. With Mrs May's authority already at a low ebb, what one of her loyal colleagues said would be a ""little more time"", got even harder. She'll face the EU today to plead for more meaningful concessions. But there's no sign of the kind of transformation in her Brexit compromise that could transform her fortunes at home. The expectation right now is that at some point she will have to change tack on Brexit. But how? When? Cabinet ministers were already privately pointing in two different directions on Wednesday - some talking of an increase in the chances of no deal, others hoping this could be a moment to pivot to a softer compromise that could attract Labour MPs. Of course if we've learnt one thing about the prime minister in these two years, it's that she is not to be underestimated. Her chances have been written off so many times, then assumption and expectation proved to be wrong. But don't mistake the fact that she's still in her job this morning for meaningful security for the government. Because just when the prime minister truly needs to get her party together, its rival tribes might be now set on a course to pull her - and themselves - apart. As has so often been the pattern for this premiership, Number 10 scales one summit only to find it's false, with a meaner one behind.

Deadly high-speed train crash in Turkey,"This video can not be played Emergency workers pulled survivors from the wreckage A crash involving a high-speed train at a station in the Turkish capital Ankara has killed at least nine people and injured 47, Turkey's transport minister has said. Images from the scene showed emergency services working to rescue people from badly damaged carriages. Reports quoting local officials said the high-speed train had collided with another train, then an overpass. The accident occurred at about 06:30 local time (03:30 GMT). Rescue workers search the wreckage for survivors The crash happened at the Marsandiz railway station, around 8km (5 miles) from Ankara's main station. At a news conference, Ankara governor Vasip Sahin said the train was travelling from Ankara to the southern city of Konya when it collided with a locomotive inspecting tracks at the station. Three train drivers were among nine people killed in the crash, according to Turkish Transport Minister Cahit Turhan. Turkey's state-funded Anadolu Agency reports that 206 passengers were on board the train. Three of the injured are said to be in a serious condition. Rescue workers evacuate injured passengers after crash A large number of emergency workers arrived at the scene shortly after the collision, which occurred in snowy conditions. Search and rescue efforts are still under way. The Ankara state prosecutor's office says it has launched an official investigation into the cause of the crash.

Sit-down meals 'less healthy than fast food',"Only one in 10 restaurant meals analysed was classed as healthy or fewer than 600kcal The calorie content of meals in UK restaurants is ""excessive"" and sit-down restaurants are unhealthier than fast-food chains,BMJ research suggests.,external Health experts say meals should not exceed 600 calories, but in this study they averaged 1,033 in restaurants and 751 in fast-food chains. University of Liverpool researchers analysed thousands of meals from places like Hungry Horse and McDonald's. They said their findings were a cause for concern. The research team looked at more than 13,500 meals on the menus of 21 sit-down restaurants and six fast-food chains. By using online company information on calorie content, only one in 10 meals was classed as healthy or fewer than 600kcal,as recommended by Public Health England. And nearly half of the meals contained 1,000kcal or more. Are you getting the right type of calorie? How many calories do I need? Third of adults 'underestimate calories' Checkout sweets targeted in obesity fight Sit-down restaurants were five times more likely to offer high-calorie meals of 1,000kcal or more than fast-food restaurants, the research found. Dr Eric Robinson, lead researcher from Liverpool's department of psychological science, said the results were ""shocking"" but probably underestimated the calories consumed in restaurants. ""We don't know about energy intake but 'plate clearing' is a common behaviour. ""Our analysis did not include drinks, starters, desserts or side orders."" Hungry Horse restaurants had the highest average meal calorie content of 1,358kcal. To take away or not to take away? Chains including Flaming Grill, Stone House and Sizzling Pubs were not far behind, with an average of 1,200kcal per meal. KFC topped the fast-food list with an average of 987 calories per meal offered. Burger King, McDonald's and Subway were around 700kcal. Even when the study compared similar meals, the energy content in restaurant meals was greater. Burger meals in restaurants contained an average of 414kcal more than burger meals in fast-food chains, while salad meals in restaurants were slightly higher in calories on average than fast food salads. Dr Robinson said portion size, the ingredients used and cooking methods could explain the difference, but he said the food industry had to make changes. ""It's really clear what the food industry need to do. They need to act more responsibly and reduce the number of calories that they're serving."" Food prepared and eaten at home is generally lower in calories, research shows Hungry Horse said it offered something for everyone at good value. A spokesperson for the chain said: ""We have been working hard to increase the range of lower calorie options, including recently launching a dedicated Live Well range with dishes under 600 calories, and we are committed to further changes."" The government is currently consulting on a planto introduce mandatory calorie labelling in restaurants, takeaways and cafes, which is likely to finish in the new year. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade association UKHospitality, said restaurants, pubs and other hospitality businesses were already taking action to reduce calories and offer healthier dishes - but there were costs to consider too. ""Proposals to shrink the size of dishes or cap calories would be yet another burden for hard-pressed operators to absorb, resulting in prices going up and investment in businesses going down; inevitably negatively impacting the overall customer experience."" Dr Robinson said research showed that meals eaten out of the home contained more calories and with more people having restaurant food delivered to their homes using online services, the problem could be getting worse. The study relied on information provided online by restaurant chains on calorie content. Very few provided calorie labelling on their menus. The researchers said it was possible the fast-food sector was now offering more lower-energy meals and healthier options, after pressure from campaigners to do so.

Eardley: Tory MPs' mood,"Let's start with what we know. Wednesday's confidence vote means the prime minister is staying in the job for now and the Conservatives can't force another confidence vote for a year. In terms of certainty, that's about it, because the result - 200 backing the PM, 117 opposing her - illustrates how deep divisions in the Conservative Party are. Theresa May's supporters insist that the issue has now been put to bed - it's time for the party to fall in line. But the tally was not as comfortable as the PM's supporters wanted. Her allies admitted before the declaration anything over a hundred would be a bad result. Some spoke of a big win to ""lance the boil"" of internal dissent. That did not happen. Live updates: Fallout from May's confidence vote May vote leaves Europe media unimpressed Instead, one-third of Tory MPs said they do not have confidence in Mrs May. A source from the backbench group of Conservative Eurosceptics, the European Research Group (ERG), described it as ""the mother of all wake-up calls"". Others predict the result would have been a lot closer if the PM hadn't said she would stand down before the 2022 election. Some say she can't go on. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'We now need to get on with the job of delivering Brexit' Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab says it's hard to see how Mrs May can lead the party forward. ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg says she should resign. Even her backers admit things look shaky. One MP who backed Mrs May describes her as ""limping"". Another predicts a ""bumpy and messy"" period ahead. Strong and stable seems a distant memory. Others, however, think Mrs May now has a month to turn things around; to change her Brexit plan and win over her party. The key issue (though not the only one) remains the backstop - designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland at all costs after Brexit. The PM has told her MPs she wants legally binding assurances to help address their concerns. Can Theresa May get the DUP back on side? Many now say Mrs May's future relies on what she secures in the next three or four weeks. Several MPs believe a barometer of success will be whether she can win the DUP back on side - no small task given their anger at what is currently on the table. This helps explain why the PM spent 45 minutes with Arlene Foster on Wednesday afternoon when she could have been lobbying her own MPs in the run up to the confidence vote. The big question is how she achieves this. Europe has shown no desire to reopen the withdrawal agreement which has caused so much anger. Would a note of clarification be enough? For many Conservatives the answer is a simple no. One Brexiteer says the relationship in the party ""is not going to be repaired unless the withdrawal agreement is abandoned - we're not going to give up on that"". Mrs May has Remain-backing critics too. They say the party is in gridlock and that the only way to end the logjam is another referendum. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: A really simple guide So getting a majority in Parliament for a Brexit deal is still a mammoth task. Even if Mrs May can win over a number of those who said last night they have no confidence in her, it might not be enough. At present there's a familiar feeling around Westminster; many Tories remain unhappy with the prime minister. As one veteran puts it: ""We're exactly where we were before."" A weary-sounding minister concludes: ""Same old, same old.""

FA chief executive Glenn to leave in 2019,"Glenn oversaw the FA at a time when Gareth Southgate guided the men's team to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn will step down at the end of the 2018-19 season after four years in the role. The FA said he was leaving having ""delivered much of what he came to do"". In a statement the FA credited him with creating the ""culture around St George's Park and the England teams which has led to an unprecedented period of success"". Glenn said it had been a ""huge honour and a privilege"" to lead the FA. ""I will leave feeling proud of the success of the performance of all the England teams,"" he added. ""I am confident that we have established in St George's Park a world-class centre which will ensure that the teams will continue to build on their current successes."" Since Glenn took charge of the FA in 2015, England's men's and women's teams have both reached a World Cup semi-final while the men's Under-17 and Under-20 teams both won their age-group World Cups. Glenn also oversaw a revamp of the English football fixture schedule with a winter break to be introduced from next season and has led the FA's attempts to increase diversity, both at the organisation and in wider football, including adopting the 'Rooney Rule' for roles in the England set-up. During his four years in charge the FA's revenue has increased by 40%, which allowed the organisation to invest a record Â£127m into the game for the financial year ending 31 July 2017. However, Glenn has also attracted criticism for comments during his tenure and has had to deal with various controversies. In March, he was forced to apologise aftercomparing the Star of David with symbols such as the Nazi swastika. He had to manage the fallout from Mark Sampson's dismissal as England women's manager in 2017, after evidence of ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" behaviour with female players in a previous role, and also oversawSam Allardyce's departure as England men's managerafter one game in charge. Glenn supported thefailed sale of Wembley Stadium,which fell through when businessman Shahid Khan withdrew his offer. FA chairman Greg Clarke said Glenn leaves an organisation that is ""fit for purpose, more diverse, internationally respected and ready to progress to the next level"". ""On behalf of the board of the FA I would like to thank Martin for building and leading a senior management team that has transformed our organisation,"" Clarke said. ""His integrity, commitment, energy and passion for football has underpinned the improvements on and off the pitch. The resulting commercial success has funded hugely significant change in the women's game, St George's Park, the FA Cup and the national teams. ""I and the organisation will miss his effective, principled and compassionate leadership and wish him well."" The Premier League said: ""[We] would like to pay tribute to his excellent work leading the organisation. ""During his four-year tenure, the England men's and women's teams reached World Cup semi-finals, England age group teams achieved unprecedented success and the women's game has continued to thrive."" Glenn said he hoped the FA would build on his legacy by ""accelerating the breakthrough of English-qualified players into the first teams"". ""Running the FA has been a huge honour and a privilege but I have only been able to achieve what I have been able to thanks to everyone who works here,"" he added. May 2015: Glenn is appointed FA chief executive, leaving his role as CEO of United Biscuits. July 2015:England's women's team reach the World Cup semi-final. June 2016: England's men's team are knocked out of Euro 2016 by Iceland and manager Roy Hodgson resigns. July 2016: The FA appoints Sam Allardyce as Hodgson's successor buthe leaves the role after one game in chargefollowing a newspaper investigation claiming he offered advice on how to ""get around"" rules on player transfers. July 2017:England win the Under-20 World Cup, the start of unprecedented success for the nation's youth teams. TheU17 side win their World Cupin October 2017. September 2017:Mark Sampson is sacked as England women's managerfollowing evidence of ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" behaviour with female players in a previous role. Glenn is criticised after it emerges he knew about a safeguarding investigation into Sampson two years earlier. October 2017: Glenn appears before a parliamentary inquiry where heapologises to England women's players Eniola Aluko and Drew Spencefor racially discriminatory remarks by Sampson England women's strikerEni Aluko criticises Glenn and the FA in a parliamentary inquiry. January 2018: Glenn has to clarify a comment where he suggestedwomen are less tolerant of ""banter"" than men. January 2018:FA introduces 'Rooney Rule', meaning it will interview at least one applicant from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background for future roles in the England set-up. A furtherthree-year action plan is introduced in Augustto increase diversity in football. March 2018: FA announces latest financial results including record investment in the game of Â£127m, alongside increased profits and a decrease of FA debts. March 2018:Glenn apologises ""for any offence""after comparing the Star of David with symbols such as the Nazi swastika. June 2018: FA works to introduce awinter break in English football, which will be first implemented in the 2019-20 season. July 2018: England's men's team reach the World Cup semi-final under Gareth Southgate. October 2018: Glenn backs plans to sell Wembley Stadium but the deal eventuallyfalls through after the plan becomes ""divisive"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Martin Glenn seems to be a popular and respected figure among FA staff at Wembley, but history will judge his tenure in one of British sport's toughest roles as a mixed one, with no shortage of controversy alongside some important achievements. He will always be remembered for his rather notorious admission that he was ""not a football expert"" in the wake of England's Euro 2016 debacle. He also had to apologise after comparing the Star of David with symbols such as the Nazi swastika. His judgement was also called into question by his subsequent decision to hire Sam Allardyce, who then stepped down after just one match in charge after a newspaper sting. He faced further criticism for failing to be more curious when he was made aware of a safeguarding investigation into former England women's coach Mark Sampson in October 2015 - but did not ask to see the full report until almost two years later. However, he deserves praise too. Glenn leaves the FA's finances in a much healthier position that he found them. And in terms of elite performance, he can be truly proud of overseeing an unprecedented period of success in which England's senior men and women's teams reached World Cup semi-finals and their Under-17 and Under-20 teams became world champions. His diplomatic skills were important in securing a winter break for the Premier League, which will come in next season. But those skills failed to secure the support of FA councillors when he tried to sell the controversial idea of selling Wembley earlier this year. The FA deny this disappointment was why he resigned, but it would be a surprise if it did not play a role.

"PC jailed for raping 13-year-old girlIan Naude's trial heard he joined Cheshire Constabulary ""to gain the keys to a sweetshop"".Shropshire","Ian Naude was being investigated for sex offences when he became a student officer A police officer who only joined the force ""to gain the keys to a sweetshop"" has been jailed for raping a girl. Cheshire Constabulary PC Ian Naude, 30, met the 13-year-old after being called to her house over a domestic incident. He contacted her over social media and eventually raped her in his car, while filming it on his mobile phone. The ""committed paedophile"" was found guilty at Liverpool Crown Court of raping the teenager and jailed for 25 years. Naude, of Market Drayton in Shropshire, was also convicted of four charges of attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence and one charge of arranging a child sex offence, relating to five complainants aged between 12 and 15. The father-of-one, originally from South Africa, previously admitted 31 offences including charges related to grooming underage girls via a fake Facebook and Snapchat profile. How a predatory paedophile became a PC Sentencing him, Judge Clement Goldstone QC said his rape victim had been just three weeks past her 13th birthday. ""In order to impose your will on a young girl and to commit offences of rape and sexual assault against her, you used and abused your position as a Cheshire Police officer, thereby enabling you to satisfy your lust and perversion,"" he added. He said Naude was ""out of control"" with an ""insatiable appetite"" for young girls and described a selfie he took after raping his victim as showing his ""smug self satisfaction and total lack of shame"". Naude used names including ""Bruce Wayne"" and ""King of the North"" on fake profiles During his two-week trial, Naude denied rape and sexual assault as he claimed the sex with the girl was consensual and that she ""seemed to be enjoying it"". Prosecutor Owen Edwards described Naude as a ""committed paedophile"" and said he joined the police ""with the intention of exploiting the access he would gain to vulnerable young girls"". ""In essence, he was hoping to gain the keys to a sweet shop,"" he added. Naude met the girl after he was called to her house over an incident in October last year, the court heard. After looking her up on Facebook and exchanging sexual messages and photos, he returned to her home three days later to pick her up while her mother was out. He then drove her to a country lane where he attacked her. Naude raped the girl after being called to her home to attend a domestic incident In a statement read in court, the girl's mother said the victim would no longer leave the house without close family and friends and that she will no longer walk past the local police station and hides when a police car goes past. Other parents said their daughters had gone on to self-harm after being groomed online by Naude, who would blackmail and threaten his victims, persuade them to send pictures of themselves undressed, tell them to call him ""daddy"" and send them videos of himself masturbating. PC convicted of raping 13-year-old girl Rape accused PC said girl 'enjoyed it' Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The 31 offences that Naude pleaded guilty to included inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, misconduct in a public office and possessing 1,443 indecent images of children, including pictures of girls aged as young as 18 months. The court heard he would gain the trust of the young girls by posing on social media as a 15-year-old boy called Jake Green. Naude messaged girls posing as a teenage boy It has since emerged that Naude, who previously served in Afghanistan as a machine gunner with the Royal Irish Regiment, was already being investigated for sex offences when he became a student officer in April last year. Cheshire Constabulary said his appointment was delayed from January 2017 to April that year because he was alleged to have raped a woman in Staffordshire. No further action was taken in the case and Naude was allowed to join - but reports of child grooming in Staffordshire and West Mercia which named him as a suspect in January and February 2017 were not picked up by the Cheshire force until after his arrest in November that year.

Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal'UN secretary general tells climate negotiators in Poland that failure to make progress would be a desperate blow for the planet.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Some observers believe that the return of Mr Guterres to these talks is a sign that significant progress is not being made The UN secretary-general has warned negotiators at a major meeting that failing to increase efforts on climate change would be ""not only immoral but suicidal"" for the planet. Antonio Guterres has flown back to Poland to try and push COP24 to a successful conclusion. At the UN talks, a group of countries have said they will enhance their climate plans before 2020. The EU and others say they are responding to the urgency of science. Some observers believe that the return of Mr Guterres to these talks is a sign that significant progress is not being made. In his remarks to the conference, he underlined that fact, imploring the delegates to speed up the pace of negotiations and to be open to compromise. He said that key political issues here in Poland remain unresolved. ""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,"" Mr Guterres said. ""It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" What is climate change? Five things 1.5C report taught us Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What's worrying many delegates and observers here is the complexity of the task of delivering a strong rulebook on the Paris pact. There is a fear among some delegates that ministers who are here to make the final political decisions on the outstanding issues may oversimplify the situation. There are still outstanding questions over how to have a single set of rules for every country that is flexible enough to not overwhelm poorer nations with huge amounts of red tape. As well as an effective rulebook, the negotiators here are also pushing for countries to increase the level of their ambition, their plans to cut carbon emissions. To that end the EU in an alliance with Canada, the UK, Norway, many small island states as well as the least developed countries group, is to push for greater efforts in their enhanced national plans to be submitted by 2020. The ""high ambition coalition"" says that this has to be done to ensure an adequate response to the risks and impacts of climate change that were highlighted in the IPCC special report on 1.5C issued in October. Climate change is 'shrinking winter' East Antarctica's glaciers are stirring How do you stop green taxes hurting the poor? Arctic reindeer numbers crash by half ""For the EU it is unacceptable not to have any decision taken that acknowledges positively the special report on 1.5C,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete. ""We represent both developed and developing countries from all the continents and the EU is committed to an ambitious outcome in Katowice but the texts in front of us are not bold enough,"" While the atmosphere at the talks is generally positive, a lingering row over climate science also rumbles on. Over the weekend the US and Saudi Arabia, back by Russia and Kuwait, refused to welcome the IPCC report on how a temperature rise of 1.5C would impact the world. Saudi officials, perhaps stung by the widespread criticism of their stance, have spoken out to defend their position. ""We have accepted a welcome for all other IPCC reports in the past because they are done right, within the rule and procedures of the IPCC,"" a member of the Saudi delegation told journalists. ""We never had reservations on other reports, so we know that there are some things that are not as good as the other reports we have used. It does not, in our view, stand up to the same level as the others."" Other senior figures at these talks have defended the IPCC and said that by the end of the discussions here, the key role of the research needs to be recognised. ""Let me make this perfectly clear,"" said Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's conference of the parties. ""Fiji welcomes the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees. We must all accept the science, which is irrefutable. We accept science in virtually every single other form of human endeavour. So simple logic dictates that we must do it."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions.

""I am confident that we have established in St George's Park a world-class centre which will ensure that the teams will continue to build on their current successes."" Since Glenn took charge of the FA in 2015, England's men's and women's teams have both reached a World Cup semi-final while the men's Under-17 and Under-20 teams both won their age-group World Cups. Glenn also oversaw a revamp of the English football fixture schedule with a winter break to be introduced from next season and has led the FA's attempts to increase diversity, both at the organisation and in wider football, including adopting the 'Rooney Rule' for roles in the England set-up. During his four years in charge the FA's revenue has increased by 40%, which allowed the organisation to invest a record Â£127m into the game for the financial year ending 31 July 2017. However, Glenn has also attracted criticism for comments during his tenure and has had to deal with various controversies. In March, he was forced to apologise aftercomparing the Star of David with symbols such as the Nazi swastika. He had to manage the fallout from Mark Sampson's dismissal as England women's manager in 2017, after evidence of ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" behaviour with female players in a previous role, and also oversawSam Allardyce's departure as England men's managerafter one game in charge. Glenn supported thefailed sale of Wembley Stadium,which fell through when businessman Shahid Khan withdrew his offer. FA chairman Greg Clarke said Glenn leaves an organisation that is ""fit for purpose, more diverse, internationally respected and ready to progress to the next level"". ""On behalf of the board of the FA I would like to thank Martin for building and leading a senior management team that has transformed our organisation,"" Clarke said. ""His integrity, commitment, energy and passion for football has underpinned the improvements on and off the pitch. The resulting commercial success has funded hugely significant change in the women's game, St George's Park, the FA Cup and the national teams. ""I and the organisation will miss his effective, principled and compassionate leadership and wish him well."" The Premier League said: ""[We] would like to pay tribute to his excellent work leading the organisation. ""During his four-year tenure, the England men's and women's teams reached World Cup semi-finals, England age group teams achieved unprecedented success and the women's game has continued to thrive."" Glenn said he hoped the FA would build on his legacy by ""accelerating the breakthrough of English-qualified players into the first teams"". ""Running the FA has been a huge honour and a privilege but I have only been able to achieve what I have been able to thanks to everyone who works here,"" he added. May 2015: Glenn is appointed FA chief executive, leaving his role as CEO of United Biscuits. July 2015:England's women's team reach the World Cup semi-final. June 2016: England's men's team are knocked out of Euro 2016 by Iceland and manager Roy Hodgson resigns. July 2016: The FA appoints Sam Allardyce as Hodgson's successor buthe leaves the role after one game in chargefollowing a newspaper investigation claiming he offered advice on how to ""get around"" rules on player transfers. July 2017:England win the Under-20 World Cup, the start of unprecedented success for the nation's youth teams. TheU17 side win their World Cupin October 2017. September 2017:Mark Sampson is sacked as England women's managerfollowing evidence of ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" behaviour with female players in a previous role. Glenn is criticised after it emerges he knew about a safeguarding investigation into Sampson two years earlier. October 2017: Glenn appears before a parliamentary inquiry where heapologises to England women's players Eniola Aluko and Drew Spencefor racially discriminatory remarks by Sampson England women's strikerEni Aluko criticises Glenn and the FA in a parliamentary inquiry. January 2018: Glenn has to clarify a comment where he suggestedwomen are less tolerant of ""banter"" than men. January 2018:FA introduces 'Rooney Rule', meaning it will interview at least one applicant from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background for future roles in the England set-up. A furtherthree-year action plan is introduced in Augustto increase diversity in football. March 2018: FA announces latest financial results including record investment in the game of Â£127m, alongside increased profits and a decrease of FA debts. March 2018:Glenn apologises ""for any offence""after comparing the Star of David with symbols such as the Nazi swastika. June 2018: FA works to introduce awinter break in English football, which will be first implemented in the 2019-20 season. July 2018: England's men's team reach the World Cup semi-final under Gareth Southgate. October 2018: Glenn backs plans to sell Wembley Stadium but the deal eventuallyfalls through after the plan becomes ""divisive"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Martin Glenn seems to be a popular and respected figure among FA staff at Wembley, but history will judge his tenure in one of British sport's toughest roles as a mixed one, with no shortage of controversy alongside some important achievements. He will always be remembered for his rather notorious admission that he was ""not a football expert"" in the wake of England's Euro 2016 debacle. He also had to apologise after comparing the Star of David with symbols such as the Nazi swastika. His judgement was also called into question by his subsequent decision to hire Sam Allardyce, who then stepped down after just one match in charge after a newspaper sting. He faced further criticism for failing to be more curious when he was made aware of a safeguarding investigation into former England women's coach Mark Sampson in October 2015 - but did not ask to see the full report until almost two years later. However, he deserves praise too. Glenn leaves the FA's finances in a much healthier position that he found them. And in terms of elite performance, he can be truly proud of overseeing an unprecedented period of success in which England's senior men and women's teams reached World Cup semi-finals and their Under-17 and Under-20 teams became world champions. His diplomatic skills were important in securing a winter break for the Premier League, which will come in next season. But those skills failed to secure the support of FA councillors when he tried to sell the controversial idea of selling Wembley earlier this year. The FA deny this disappointment was why he resigned, but it would be a surprise if it did not play a role.

Man trapped for two days in grease ventFire crews free the 29-year-old from a small duct at a vacant Chinese restaurant in California.US & Canada,"The 29-year-old man was said to have been physically exhausted when he was rescued A man has been rescued after spending two days trapped in a grease vent at a vacant Chinese restaurant in California, police say. Emergency crews responded to reports of ""a faint voice calling for help"" from the building in the San Francisco area. The man was said to have been exhausted and suffering from dehydration, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Police say he may have been trespassing, but it is unclear whether the incident was a burglary attempt. Police and fire crews arriving at the scene in San Lorenzo near Oakland at about 09:30 local time (17:30 GMT) heard a voice and discovered that it was coming from a rooftop vent belonging to the restaurant.

Hospitals 'overcrowded' ahead of Christmas,"Hospitals in England are so overcrowded ahead of Christmas care is being put at risk, experts say, with some places having to turn away ambulances because they cannot accept any more patients. NHS England's first weekly report of the winter shows nearly 95% of beds are occupied. Anything above 85% is unsafe. Experts warned hospitals were in the ""red zone"" and it was a risk to care. The data for last week showed eight A&Es had diverted ambulance crews elsewhere because they were so busy. And even when ambulances were able to drop patients off, significant numbers were facing delays. Ambulance crews are meant to be able to handover patients to A&E staff within 15 minutes of arrival - but in one in nine cases it took over 30 minutes. An NHS England official said staff were ""working hard"" to keep up with demand.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. ""As the colder weather begins to set in, it's vital that the NHS and local authorities continue to work together to help people stay well and out of hospital wherever possible. ""The public can also help NHS staff by making sure they have their free flu jab if eligible and by using NHS 111 as their first port of call for non-emergencies."" It is more than a year since any part of the UK has hit one of its three key targets - for: A&E waits cancer care hospital operations The extra money announced by the government in the summer will not start reaching the front line until next year. Siva Anandaciva, of the  King's Fund think tank, said the figures showed the NHS was ""already under tremendous strain"". ""Despite a mild start to winter and low flu levels, targets are still being badly missed. ""These figures show little slack in a system, which is operating consistently in the red zone. ""Hospital bed occupancy levels are already higher than recommended levels, the point at which hospitals are so full that good patient care is put at risk."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Winter is only just beginning for our NHS and these are hugely concerning figures that don't bode well for the difficult weeks ahead.""

Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal',"Some observers believe that the return of Mr Guterres to these talks is a sign that significant progress is not being made The UN secretary-general has warned negotiators at a major meeting that failing to increase efforts on climate change would be ""not only immoral but suicidal"" for the planet. Antonio Guterres has flown back to Poland to try and push COP24 to a successful conclusion. At the UN talks, a group of countries have said they will enhance their climate plans before 2020. The EU and others say they are responding to the urgency of science. Some observers believe that the return of Mr Guterres to these talks is a sign that significant progress is not being made. In his remarks to the conference, he underlined that fact, imploring the delegates to speed up the pace of negotiations and to be open to compromise. He said that key political issues here in Poland remain unresolved. ""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,"" Mr Guterres said. ""It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" What is climate change? Five things 1.5C report taught us Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What's worrying many delegates and observers here is the complexity of the task of delivering a strong rulebook on the Paris pact. There is a fear among some delegates that ministers who are here to make the final political decisions on the outstanding issues may oversimplify the situation. There are still outstanding questions over how to have a single set of rules for every country that is flexible enough to not overwhelm poorer nations with huge amounts of red tape. As well as an effective rulebook, the negotiators here are also pushing for countries to increase the level of their ambition, their plans to cut carbon emissions. To that end the EU in an alliance with Canada, the UK, Norway, many small island states as well as the least developed countries group, is to push for greater efforts in their enhanced national plans to be submitted by 2020. The ""high ambition coalition"" says that this has to be done to ensure an adequate response to the risks and impacts of climate change that were highlighted in the IPCC special report on 1.5C issued in October. Climate change is 'shrinking winter' East Antarctica's glaciers are stirring How do you stop green taxes hurting the poor? Arctic reindeer numbers crash by half ""For the EU it is unacceptable not to have any decision taken that acknowledges positively the special report on 1.5C,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete. ""We represent both developed and developing countries from all the continents and the EU is committed to an ambitious outcome in Katowice but the texts in front of us are not bold enough,"" While the atmosphere at the talks is generally positive, a lingering row over climate science also rumbles on. Over the weekend the US and Saudi Arabia, back by Russia and Kuwait, refused to welcome the IPCC report on how a temperature rise of 1.5C would impact the world. Saudi officials, perhaps stung by the widespread criticism of their stance, have spoken out to defend their position. ""We have accepted a welcome for all other IPCC reports in the past because they are done right, within the rule and procedures of the IPCC,"" a member of the Saudi delegation told journalists. ""We never had reservations on other reports, so we know that there are some things that are not as good as the other reports we have used. It does not, in our view, stand up to the same level as the others."" Other senior figures at these talks have defended the IPCC and said that by the end of the discussions here, the key role of the research needs to be recognised. ""Let me make this perfectly clear,"" said Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's conference of the parties. ""Fiji welcomes the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees. We must all accept the science, which is irrefutable. We accept science in virtually every single other form of human endeavour. So simple logic dictates that we must do it."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

Strasbourg manhunt police appeal for help,"French police have appealed for help in finding a man suspected of a Christmas market gun attack in Strasbourg that killed three people, and left a fourth brain dead and 12 others wounded. Hundreds of security personnel are searching for Cherif Chekatt, 29, on both sides of the Franco-German border. The suspect had a string of criminal convictions and had become a radical Islamist while in prison. Police say he is highly dangerous and should not be approached. French officials announced on Thursday that a third person had died in the aftermath of the Strasbourg attack. Five people were seriously wounded, they said, including a man described as brain dead. Strasbourg shooting: What we know so far Face to face with the gunman Chekatt has been in jail in Germany as well as France, and German reports suggested he may have received a call from Germany shortly before the Strasbourg attack. He did not answer the call, but investigators were trying to establish who was behind it, RBB Inforadio reported. Border checks on drivers near Strasbourg brought traffic to a near standstill on Thursday The French government and police union urged ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters to call off demonstrations planned for Saturday to enable authorities to maintain security in the run-up to Christmas. A 23-year-old protester was struck by a lorry and killed at a roundabout in Avignon on Wednesday night. The lights of Paris' Eiffel Tower were turned off overnight,externalin tribute to the victims of the Strasbourg attack. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the gesture was to show the city's support to the families affected and ""all of Strasbourg"". The Eiffel Tower in Paris goes dark in tribute to the victims and ""all of Strasbourg"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the parliament that 720 police officers and other members of the security forces were searching for the gunman, who was injured in an exchange of fire with soldiers who were patrolling the Christmas market in Strasbourg when the attack occurred. Across the nearby border, German police were conducting searches after France's Deputy Interior Minister, Laurent NuÃ±ez, acknowledged that the gunman might no longer be in France. Border agents were checking vehicles crossing the Rhine river, which marks the Franco-German frontier, leading to long lines of traffic in both directions. This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and helping a victim of the Strasbourg shooting Mr Castaner said the country had moved to the highest level of alert, expanding police powers and increasing vigilance. He added that security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up. The mayor of Strasbourg, Roland Ries, has said the Christmas market there will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, with flags lowered to half-mast at the local town hall. At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday, a man opened fire close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market near one of the central squares, Place KlÃ©ber, which attracts thousands of visitors. France's anti-terror prosecutor, RÃ©my Heitz, said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. As well as the fatalities, 12 people were wounded, six of them seriously, he added. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after commandeering a taxi, Mr Heitz said. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker boasted to the taxi driver that he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him in the vicinity of the police station in the Neudorf area. When he got out the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping into the night. Four people connected to the suspect had been detained overnight in Strasbourg, Mr Heitz said. Sources close to the investigation quoted by Reuters news agency said they were the suspect's mother, father and two brothers. According to police, Cherif Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat. He was the subject of a ""fiche S"", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result. Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home. A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition. By Damian Grammaticas, Strasbourg Strasbourg's famous Christmas market is now a gloomy place. The lines of wooden huts are all shuttered. The owner of one told us how he had to flee when he heard the gunshots and take shelter in a local bar. ""We're all shaken up,"" he said. At this time of year, the place should be thronged with people who come from far and wide to sightsee and shop, buying everything from hot sausages to souvenirs. Now there's a weary, deflated feeling. Police stand guard at cordoned off alleyways. ""Everyone was shouting, everyone was running, running, afraid,"" said one eyewitness who'd seen the gunman shooting randomly. Strasbourg has been a target for failed terror attacks before. But now it's happened, people here are hurt and outraged. As one said: ""It's shameful."" Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, a tourist from Thailand, has been named by Thai media as one of the dead. He is believed to have been on holiday with his wife. The Italian foreign ministry has said one of the injured is an Italian journalist who was covering the European parliament, but declined to confirm media reports  that he was in a serious condition. One soldier was slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet during an exchange of fire with the gunman. Strasbourg has been the target of jihadist plots in the past. Not only does it have one of France's oldest Christmas markets, but it is the official seat of the European Parliament. That parliament was in session at the time of Tuesday evening's attack. In 2000, the Christmas market was at the centre of a failed al-Qaeda plot.Ten Islamist militants were jailed four years later,externalfor their part in the planned New Year's Eve attack. However, MEPs were determined to carry on the morning after the attack, with German MEP Jo Leinen posting a picture of singing and Christmas lights in the European Parliament. Allow Twitter content?

Ambulances attacked with bins and scooters,"This video can not be played Ambulances have been targeted with fireworks, bottles, wheelie bins and scooters Fireworks, wheelie bins, knives and scooters have all been used to attack ambulances and rapid response vehicles in the past three years, a BBC freedom of information request has found. More than 200 acts of vandalism were reported between 2015 and October, some also featuring metal poles and bricks. NHS trusts have had to pay thousands of pounds to repair damage and take ambulances off the road for repairs. Unison has called for bigger sentences for anyone convicted of such vandalism. The BBC approached the UK's 14 NHS ambulance trusts and received responses from all of them except Northern Ireland. The replies revealed there were 204 instances of vandalism, including people head-butting ambulance bonnets, blue lights being stolen and windows being smashed. In the North East a patient with a metal pole caused damage that cost Â£3,500 to repair, while in London a microwave was thrown at an ambulance. Student paramedic Tony Traynor was left bruised and scratched On 2 November 2017 a crew from the North East Ambulance Service was taking a patient up to Scotland when a bottle was thrown through the passenger window. Student paramedic Tony Traynor was driving the ambulance, and ended up with scratches and a bruise under his eye. He said: ""It's the shock more than anything; I'm normally quite robust, I've been in the Army, but you're not expecting something like that to happen to you in that sort of environment. ""I've never been upset in this job but this has really affected me, it's had a greater impact on me than I thought it would. ""It's really sad and sickening that someone could do something like this. We were on blue lights and sirens so it was obvious we were travelling on an emergency."" At present, vandalism causing up to Â£5,000 of damage carries a maximum sentence of three months in prison. The government recently increased the maximum jail term for anyone assaulting ambulance staff from six to 12 months. Sexism row over men-only awards dinner Upside-down cat rescued after loft fall Ex-steelworks station 'least used' in UK Colm Porter from the Unison union said the two offences should carry ""similar penalties"". ""We have crews in the back of ambulances treating poorly patients and they are seeing bricks, glass and stones, in some cases chairs and tables, thrown at them,"" he said. ""You can repair ambulances but it can take a lot longer for staff to get over what they have been through."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""It's absolutely unacceptable for anyone to deliberately damage emergency service vehicles or other essential kit. ""They are consciously inhibiting the ability of our enormously hardworking and dedicated paramedics to do their jobs, and it risks taking ambulances off the road."" Association of Ambulance Chief Executives managing director Martin Flaherty said vandalism ""takes valuable resources off the road that could be out responding to sick and injured patients"". ""We would always press for all perpetrators found guilty of such acts to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" he added.

Hamleys pulls slime toy amid safety fears,"Hamleys has stopped selling Frootiputti slime Hamleys has stopped selling a children's slime toy after the product failed a safety test for boron, a chemical that can impair fertility. Tests by consumer group Which? found that Frootiputti slime, made by Goobands and sold at Hamleys, had four times the EU limit for boron in toys. The retailer said it was a ""precautionary measure"" while it investigated further. Which? said it had tested 13 slimes and found six broke the rules on boron. These included slimes bought from Smyths Toys Superstores and Amazon, as well as a product classified as a putty from Argos. Slime became one of 2017's biggest crazes, with millions of people sharing pictures on Instagram and watching DIY slime-making videos on YouTube. How to make sure your slime is safe Is your slime eco friendly? But many of the toys use the mineral borax, which contains boron, to help create their stickiness. Over-exposure to boron can cause skin irritation, diarrhoea, vomiting and cramps. At very high levels it may also affect fertility or cause harm to unborn children in pregnant women. H Grossman's Ghostbusters slime had more than three times the limit The DIY Slime Kit, made by Essenson and available from Amazon, contained a purple slime that had four-and-half times the legal level of boron. H Grossman's Ghostbusters slime, which can be bought in Smyths Toys Superstores, had more than three times the limit. Fun foam, made by Zuru Oosh and sold by Argos also broke EU rules on boron Which? said all of the products carried CE certification, suggesting manufacturers were labelling unsafe products as safe. It also warned some slimes were being marketed as putties, allowing them to pass safety tests more easily. The EU safety limit is 300mg/kg for slime and 1200mg/kg for putty. Responding to the results one manufacturer, Jexybox, said it would take all of its slime products off Ebay. H Grossman and Goobands argued that their products were actually putty, not slime, and met EU safety standards. ""Consumers can see the reports from several independent accredited laboratories which confirm that this product is technically a 'putty' and that the levels of all elements are well within safety standards. It is regrettable that a consumer magazine has made an entirely untrue allegation without producing scientific support,"" said a spokeswoman for H Grossman. Like Hamleys, Amazon said it had stopped selling the products flagged by Which? while Argos said it was investigating the findings. Smyths said it followed the ""highest safety standards"". Nikki Stopford, director of research and publishing at Which?, said: ""Parents should have confidence that the products that they buy for their children will be safe, but our latest investigation has uncovered harmful products being sold even by big retailers. ""Again, we're calling on manufacturers to stop making unsafe products, and for the government and retailers to step up and do a much better job of ensuring only safe products get into people's homes and into the hands of children.""

What does Ireland do if thereÃ¢ÂÂs no deal?,"The Irish government has been consistent that whatever happens in the Brexit process there will be no hardening of the Irish border. Asked earlier this year,Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said: ""That will just never happen - ever."" But how can that promise be kept in the event that the UK leaves the EU without a deal? If there is no deal, there is no transition period or backstop. It would mean the UK becomes a country with which the EU has no trade deal of any description. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Irish 'upping no deal contingency plans' Has NI hit peak Brexit? Reality Check: A plan to unlock the Irish border problem The border checks already in place For countries like that, the EU normally imposes a range of checks at its borders. There are customs checks, like those on the Norway-Sweden border, and regulatory checks particularly in regard to food products. These involve hard borders of the sort the Irish government says it will never accept. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The EU says these border checks are necessary to protect what it refers to as the ""integrity"" of its single market and customs union. Essentially, it means that the EU wants to prevent products entering its market which could be unsafe or represent unfair competition. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has consistently emphasised this. In July he said: ""The single market is our main economic public good. We will not damage it."" So if there is no deal, what will the Irish government be expected to do to protect the integrity of the single market at the frontier with the UK? If no deal is as much of a disaster as forecast then the EU may calculate that the UK will be back at the negotiating table within weeks. So would it be feasible, for a very temporary period, to have no new checks on products crossing the Irish border? Leo Varadkar says the Irish government is committed that a hard border will not be implemented Arguably there would be little risk to the integrity of the single market, as on Brexit day the UK would be aligned with EU product standards. It is possible that if EU authorities decide not to check UK goods at the Irish border, but do check them at Calais or Dunkirk, it would provoke a complaint to the WTO. However, if this is only a very short-term arrangement, such a complaint is unlikely to go anywhere. Daniel Keohane, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, says such a crisis response would probably be feasible and seems to be the main hope in Dublin. But he doubts such an arrangement could last more than a few weeks. ""If, for example, large quantities of prohibited goods were proven to have circulated in the EU single market during that period because of the open Irish border, there would be huge pressure on Dublin from EU partners to have checks at or near the border,"" he said. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? If the UK finds itself able to cope with a no deal there will inevitably be a difficult conversation between Brussels and Dublin about what to do next. Could there be checks close to the border rather than at the border? Back in May 2017 the head of Ireland's customs authorities raised the prospect of what he called ""trade facilitation posts"". Revenue Commissioner Liam Irwin said these could be facilities which were not at the border but ""10 or 15 kilometres back"". He suggested up to 8% of cross border freight could be checked there, complemented by some form of risk-based, customs checks carried out by mobile units. He also emphasised that customs declarations would happen electronically, and most transactions would be immediately approved. The Irish border has been one of the biggest sticking points during Brexit negotiations This sounds a lot like the ""maximum facilitation"" proposals floated by the UK government in 2017 and rejected by the EU. This sort of arrangement would also be a hard border by the Irish government's current definition. Mr Keohane said that if checks had to be carried out, they would ""probably look like what the Revenue Commissioners suggest, which is not that dissimilar to current customs posts at the Swiss-EU border, even if not directly on the border"". He says in such a scenario Ireland could expect financial help and perhaps political cover from the EU. ""Dublin does not have to - nor in any way wants to - legitimise it (a hard border) as a permanent feature - so the EU could politically agree that this is a crisis measure, similar to the 2001 foot and mouth crisis,"" Mr Keohane adds. The pro-Brexit economist Andrew Lilico has suggested what he calls a ""Celtic Sea border"". That would mean that the Irish land border would remain soft with no new checks and controls but goods leaving the island of Ireland would be subject to checks if they were going to the EU. Mr Lilico says such checks should be less problematic, in sovereignty or market integrity terms, than new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He points to the movement of people as a precedent. Ireland is not a member of the EU's Schengen arrangement but instead forms a Common Travel Area with the UK. ""There are already border checks at the Celtic Sea border in respect of persons (and hence of services) because Ireland is not in Schengen,"" said Mr Lilico. ""Yet I put it to you that no-one thinks those make Ireland a 'semi-detached part of the single market'."" Ireland is not a member of the EU's Schengen arrangement but forms a Common Travel Area with the UK He also proposes that the NI Assembly would have the power to align regulation, in various areas, with Ireland's, thereby having the choice to shift some checks to the Irish Sea border. Mr Keohane agrees that such an arrangement is technically feasible in the short term but sees much greater political difficulties. ""It is not politically acceptable for Ireland, as a remaining EU member, since it would diminish its membership rights,"" he adds. ""The rest of the EU would also unlikely want to set such a precedent, that one of its members could have its membership rights diminished because of the action of a third country (as the UK would be at that stage).""

Second Canadian missing in China,"Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig have been put under ""compulsory measures"" A second Canadian has been detained in China on accusations of harming national security, as tension continues between the two countries. It was confirmed on Thursday that Michael Spavor, a businessman, had been detained in addition to former diplomat Michael Kovrig. Canada drew Chinese protests after it arrested an executive at telecoms giant Huawei at the request of the US. Meng Wanzhou has been bailed but may face extradition for fraud. She denies violating US sanctions on Iran through Huawei's business dealings. China has threatened unspecified consequences if she is not released. Who is detained Canadian Michael Spavor? The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple So high-profile is the case that US PresidentDonald Trump said he could intervene if it helped to avoid a further decline in relations between the US and China, which are locked in a trade war. However, Mr Trump's own officials frowned on the idea, with US Assistant Attorney General John Demers remarking: ""What we do at the justice department is law enforcement. We don't do trade."" Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang addressed the matter on Thursday, saying the pair were ""suspected of engaging in activities that threatened China's national security"" and had been put under ""compulsory measures"", a usual reference to custody. Mr Lu said the ""legal rights and interests of these two Canadians have been safeguarded"" and that the two cases were being investigated separately. Asked if the detentions were in response to Ms Meng's arrest, he said they were part of an ""operation taken by China's relevant national security authorities in accordance with the laws"". Mr Lu said Ms Meng's arrest was ""wrong practice"", adding: ""I can point out that, since the Canadian government took the wrong action at the request of the US and took Meng Wanzhou into custody, many Chinese are wondering if their trips to Canada are safe."" Some China analysts were in little doubt about the reason for the detentions. Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's former ambassador to China,told Canadian broadcaster CBC:,external""In China there are no coincidences... If they want to send you a message, they will send you a message."" One Western diplomat in China told Reuters news agency: ""This is a political kidnapping."" Michael Spavor (left) helped arrange the trip of ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman (R) to North Korea in 2013 Michael Spavor,arrested on 12 December, is a businessman based in Dandong, near the Chinese border with North Korea. He has ties to the North Korean government and has met its leader Kim Jong-un many times. Canadian foreign ministry spokesman Guillaume BÃ©rubÃ© confirmed that Mr Spavor had contacted it earlier in the week because ""he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities"". One of his most recent Facebook posts, on Sunday, said he was about to travel to Seoul in South Korea but he did not arrive on Monday as planned. Allow Facebook content?

Mr Spavor runs an organisation called the Paektu Cultural Exchange, which organises business, cultural and tourism trips to North Korea. He is a regular visitor to North Korea and regularly comments in the media on Korean issues. He is particularly well known for helping to arrange the visit by former NBA star Dennis Rodman to North Korea in 2013. Rodman is a personal friend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Ex-diplomatMichael Kovrigcurrently works for a think-tank, the International Crisis Group (ICG), which has said it is concerned for his health and safety. He was arrested on 10 December. Mr Lu said the ICG had not been registered as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in China and therefore it was unlawful for its staff to work there. Checks by Reuters news agency did not turn up a registration for ICG on government databases for NGOs or social enterprises. Asked about Mr Kovrig, Canada said there was no ""explicit indication"" of any link to the Meng case. It said his case had been raised directly with Chinese officials. The former Canadian resident was detained on 1 December in Vancouver, where she has family and property connections. She was granted bail of C$10m(Â£6m; $7.4m) on Tuesday but could still be extradited to the US. Sketch of Meng Wanzhou in court in Canada The US has been investigating Huawei, one of the world's largest smartphone makers, since 2016, believing that it used a subsidiary, Skycom, to bring US manufacturing equipment and millions of dollars in transactions to Iran in violation of sanctions. Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what? Who does business with Iran? The Supreme Court of British Columbia was told that Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, carried this out between 2009 and 2014. She allegedly tricked US banks into clearing transactions for Huawei which were in reality for Skycom. The banks thus became ""victim institutions"" of fraud. Lawyers for Ms Meng told the court that Huawei had already separated itself from Skycom. Ms Meng faces up to 30 years in prison in the US if found guilty of the charges, the Canadian court heard.

EastEnders set goes ÃÂ£27m over budget,"This video can not be played Aerial pictures show work on the new EastEnders set in Elstree, as filming takes place on the existing set. The BBC's project to build a brand new, HD-ready Albert Square and expand the external EastEnders set will now cost Â£27m more than originally planned. The original 2015 forecast for the scheme was Â£59.7m, but the revised budget is now Â£86.7m, the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed. The new set was originally due to open in 2018, but won't be ready until 2023. The BBC said the project was ""large"" and ""complex"", adding that there had been ""challenges on the way"". A brand new Queen Vic pub is being built as part of the new set The corporation is building a new Albert Square near the existing set at the BBC's Elstree studios in Hertfordshire. It will have actual brick buildings - unlike the current one, which only uses facades. The external EastEnders set dates back to the soap's birth in 1984 and was only supposed to be used for two years, but has lasted for 34. The soap cannot currently be filmed in high definition, and the BBC said the poor condition of the current set is increasingly causing delays to filming. The building project - titled E20 - was announced in 2015 and was meant to finish by August 2018. The original set was only supposed to be used for two years In its report, the NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament, said the extra costs mean ""the BBC will not be able to deliver value for money... in the way that it envisaged in 2015"". The body took aim at the early planning stage, which ""resulted in the BBC underestimating aspects of complexity, cost and risks of its approach"". However, the NAO also acknowledged that the BBC had faced issues such as asbestos and obstructions in the ground, which could not have been foreseen when the project was first planned. Inflation has also risen faster than expected in the construction industry - although the NAO said inflation ""had a greater impact than it would have done had the programme been completed without any delays"". Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""We believe that the planned benefits are still broadly achievable, but given the high risk nature of E20 it will need close scrutiny until it's finished."" The NAO said ""some of the reasons for the delays and cost increases could have been addressed earlier by the BBC"", adding that the corporation ""had made many improvements to the programme"" in the last 18 months. The funeral of Peggy Mitchell was a big Walford event ""The show remains one of the BBC's flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London. ""It's a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre but like any building work of this scale there have been challenges on the way, including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site. ""As the NAO recognises we've already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny."" The BBC added that it would ""continue to capture... lessons learned on the programme"". EastEnders is currently watched by around six million people per episode, compared with about 7.5 million for its ITV rival Coronation Street. The Manchester-based soap opened a new set in 2013, but the cost of that was never made public. At EastEnders, the so-called ""front lot"", which is the replacement for the existing set, will now be finished by 2021 - but work on the ""back lot"", which will include new Walford outdoor locations, will go on until May 2023. Work that has already taken place on E20 includes new boiler heating and edit suites, additional stage capacity and a new site entrance.

The funeral of Peggy Mitchell was a big Walford event ""The show remains one of the BBC's flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London. ""It's a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre but like any building work of this scale there have been challenges on the way, including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site. ""As the NAO recognises we've already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny."" The BBC added that it would ""continue to capture... lessons learned on the programme"". EastEnders is currently watched by around six million people per episode, compared with about 7.5 million for its ITV rival Coronation Street. The Manchester-based soap opened a new set in 2013, but the cost of that was never made public. At EastEnders, the so-called ""front lot"", which is the replacement for the existing set, will now be finished by 2021 - but work on the ""back lot"", which will include new Walford outdoor locations, will go on until May 2023. Work that has already taken place on E20 includes new boiler heating and edit suites, additional stage capacity and a new site entrance.

Donors to be asked if they are religious,"People who join the NHS's UK organ donation register are to be asked if they want their religious beliefs to be considered in the donation process. The question aims to reassure people that donation can take place in line with their faith or beliefs. It is hoped the measure can help to boost the low proportion of donors from black and Asian backgrounds. Research has found religious and cultural beliefs are the main barrier to organ donation in these communities. Education 'key to end BAME donor crisis' Reality Check: Does organ donation without consent save lives? Last year, 42% of black and Asian families agreed to donate their relative's organs, compared with 66% of families from the overall population. More than a third of patients waiting for a kidney transplant are from black, Asian and other minority ethnic communities and often their best chance of a match will come from someone of the same ethnic background. A part of the shortage of donors is caused by people from these backgrounds choosing not to donate. But even if a person does choose to donate by signing up to the register, families have the final say on whether their organs should be used. Bimla Parmar became an organ donor after she died Bimla Parmar, a Sikh who lived in Hayes, west London, became a lifesaving organ donor when she died of a brain haemorrhage, aged 68, after collapsing at home. Her daughter, Gurpreet Parmar, 39, said: ""My mum was not on the NHS organ donation register but my siblings and I were fine with it as we believed someone else should be helped by our loss. ""I personally had registered to be a donor a long time ago as I want to help someone else once I am gone. ""Mum was religious and loved by everyone. She was able to donate her lungs, kidneys and liver to four people. ""I hope more of my generation and younger people educate the elders to sign up to donate and explain what their gift can mean to a family seeing their loved one struggle on a daily basis."" People signing up to the register will now be asked whether or not they want their faith or beliefs to be discussed with their family or anyone else they consider appropriate, such as a faith leader. NHS Blood and Transplant, the organisation that runs the NHS organ donation register, said this would enable nurses to discuss concerns about the process with families, such as whether a burial would be delayed. Jackie Doyle-Price, Minister for Inequalities, said: ""Organ donation is a priceless gift but thousands of people are still waiting for a transplant and we must do all we can to remove the barriers that prevent people from signing up as a donor. ""This important update will give people the confidence that when they register a decision to donate their organs, their beliefs will always be considered."" The new question will be added to the register on Thursday. BBC News is exploring the experience of families of deceased organ donors. Have you ever been asked to make the decision about organ donation on behalf of a family member in hospital and felt unable to agree to donate? Maybe because you did not know their wishes, maybe the organ retrieval operation took too long.

What does Ireland do if thereâs no deal?Brexit: A really simple guideQ&A: The Irish border Brexit backstopVideoVideoBrexit: Let's go back to the basics,"The Irish government has been consistent that whatever happens in the Brexit process there will be no hardening of the Irish border. Asked earlier this year,Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said: ""That will just never happen - ever."" But how can that promise be kept in the event that the UK leaves the EU without a deal? If there is no deal, there is no transition period or backstop. It would mean the UK becomes a country with which the EU has no trade deal of any description. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Irish 'upping no deal contingency plans' Has NI hit peak Brexit? Reality Check: A plan to unlock the Irish border problem The border checks already in place For countries like that, the EU normally imposes a range of checks at its borders. There are customs checks, like those on the Norway-Sweden border, and regulatory checks particularly in regard to food products. These involve hard borders of the sort the Irish government says it will never accept. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The EU says these border checks are necessary to protect what it refers to as the ""integrity"" of its single market and customs union. Essentially, it means that the EU wants to prevent products entering its market which could be unsafe or represent unfair competition. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has consistently emphasised this. In July he said: ""The single market is our main economic public good. We will not damage it."" So if there is no deal, what will the Irish government be expected to do to protect the integrity of the single market at the frontier with the UK? If no deal is as much of a disaster as forecast then the EU may calculate that the UK will be back at the negotiating table within weeks. So would it be feasible, for a very temporary period, to have no new checks on products crossing the Irish border? Leo Varadkar says the Irish government is committed that a hard border will not be implemented Arguably there would be little risk to the integrity of the single market, as on Brexit day the UK would be aligned with EU product standards. It is possible that if EU authorities decide not to check UK goods at the Irish border, but do check them at Calais or Dunkirk, it would provoke a complaint to the WTO. However, if this is only a very short-term arrangement, such a complaint is unlikely to go anywhere. Daniel Keohane, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, says such a crisis response would probably be feasible and seems to be the main hope in Dublin. But he doubts such an arrangement could last more than a few weeks. ""If, for example, large quantities of prohibited goods were proven to have circulated in the EU single market during that period because of the open Irish border, there would be huge pressure on Dublin from EU partners to have checks at or near the border,"" he said. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? If the UK finds itself able to cope with a no deal there will inevitably be a difficult conversation between Brussels and Dublin about what to do next. Could there be checks close to the border rather than at the border? Back in May 2017 the head of Ireland's customs authorities raised the prospect of what he called ""trade facilitation posts"". Revenue Commissioner Liam Irwin said these could be facilities which were not at the border but ""10 or 15 kilometres back"". He suggested up to 8% of cross border freight could be checked there, complemented by some form of risk-based, customs checks carried out by mobile units. He also emphasised that customs declarations would happen electronically, and most transactions would be immediately approved. The Irish border has been one of the biggest sticking points during Brexit negotiations This sounds a lot like the ""maximum facilitation"" proposals floated by the UK government in 2017 and rejected by the EU. This sort of arrangement would also be a hard border by the Irish government's current definition. Mr Keohane said that if checks had to be carried out, they would ""probably look like what the Revenue Commissioners suggest, which is not that dissimilar to current customs posts at the Swiss-EU border, even if not directly on the border"". He says in such a scenario Ireland could expect financial help and perhaps political cover from the EU. ""Dublin does not have to - nor in any way wants to - legitimise it (a hard border) as a permanent feature - so the EU could politically agree that this is a crisis measure, similar to the 2001 foot and mouth crisis,"" Mr Keohane adds. The pro-Brexit economist Andrew Lilico has suggested what he calls a ""Celtic Sea border"". That would mean that the Irish land border would remain soft with no new checks and controls but goods leaving the island of Ireland would be subject to checks if they were going to the EU. Mr Lilico says such checks should be less problematic, in sovereignty or market integrity terms, than new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He points to the movement of people as a precedent. Ireland is not a member of the EU's Schengen arrangement but instead forms a Common Travel Area with the UK. ""There are already border checks at the Celtic Sea border in respect of persons (and hence of services) because Ireland is not in Schengen,"" said Mr Lilico. ""Yet I put it to you that no-one thinks those make Ireland a 'semi-detached part of the single market'."" Ireland is not a member of the EU's Schengen arrangement but forms a Common Travel Area with the UK He also proposes that the NI Assembly would have the power to align regulation, in various areas, with Ireland's, thereby having the choice to shift some checks to the Irish Sea border. Mr Keohane agrees that such an arrangement is technically feasible in the short term but sees much greater political difficulties. ""It is not politically acceptable for Ireland, as a remaining EU member, since it would diminish its membership rights,"" he adds. ""The rest of the EU would also unlikely want to set such a precedent, that one of its members could have its membership rights diminished because of the action of a third country (as the UK would be at that stage).""

Brexit: A really simple guideQ&A: The Irish border Brexit backstopVideoVideoBrexit: Let's go back to the basics,"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstopVideoVideoBrexit: Let's go back to the basics,"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

Climate change is 'shrinking winter',"Satellite images from 2002 (left) compared with 2017 (right) highlight the decreasing snowpack Snowy mountain winters are being ""squeezed"" by climate change, according to scientists in California. Researchers who studied the winter snowfall in the mountains there revealed that rising temperatures are reducing the period during which snow is on the ground in the mountains - snow that millions rely on for their fresh water. They presented their findings at the American Geophysical Union meeting - the world's largest gathering of Earth and space scientists. ""Our winters are getting sick and we know why,"" said Prof Amato Evan, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, who carried out the investigation. ""It's climate change; it's rising temperatures."" Reindeer numbers shrink by half Space laser makes height maps of Earth Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' Prof Evan studied the annual cycle of snow and melt in the western US from the early 1980s to 2018. California relies on snowmelt for its fresh water supply He found that the length of time snow is on the ground there is continually ""being squeezed"" into a shorter period. And the early arrival of summer, he explained, is a driving force behind sometimes devastating wildfires. ""Particularly in a place like California where we get all of our precipitation during the winter time, that means that our summers are growing longer,"" he told BBC News. ""And really what that means is our fire seasons are growing longer. ""We've got less snow, we've got a longer fire season, we've got infestations [of pests that thrive in warmer temperatures] - these ecological issues; it's a kind of perfect storm of really bad outcomes, which then result in - in some cases - these massively dramatic fires."" There is a link between snowpack decline and wildfires, say the researchers Donal O'Leary from the University of Maryland, who presented his research on what he called the ""significant relationship"" between snow and wildfire, agreed. Earlier snowmelt, he said, ""is leading to more wildfires, particularly in places like the Sierra Nevada in California"". Mountain snow is also what millions of people rely on for fresh water supplies - in California, particularly, the reservoirs are refilled by annual snowmelt. Other scientists who have looked at global climate models have seen similar results across much of the Northern Hemisphere. And researchers say this signal from the snowpack is clear evidence that the impacts of climate change are now playing out in the mountains.

Sit-down meals 'less healthy than fast-food',"Only one in 10 restaurant meals analysed was classed as healthy or fewer than 600kcal The calorie content of meals in UK restaurants is ""excessive"" and sit-down restaurants are unhealthier than fast-food chains,BMJ research suggests.,external Health experts say meals should not exceed 600 calories, but in this study they averaged 1,033 in restaurants and 751 in fast-food chains. University of Liverpool researchers analysed thousands of meals from places like Hungry Horse and McDonald's. They said their findings were a cause for concern. The research team looked at more than 13,500 meals on the menus of 21 sit-down restaurants and six fast-food chains. By using online company information on calorie content, only one in 10 meals was classed as healthy or fewer than 600kcal,as recommended by Public Health England. And nearly half of the meals contained 1,000kcal or more. Are you getting the right type of calorie? How many calories do I need? Third of adults 'underestimate calories' Checkout sweets targeted in obesity fight Sit-down restaurants were five times more likely to offer high-calorie meals of 1,000kcal or more than fast-food restaurants, the research found. Dr Eric Robinson, lead researcher from Liverpool's department of psychological science, said the results were ""shocking"" but probably underestimated the calories consumed in restaurants. ""We don't know about energy intake but 'plate clearing' is a common behaviour. ""Our analysis did not include drinks, starters, desserts or side orders."" Hungry Horse restaurants had the highest average meal calorie content of 1,358kcal. To take away or not to take away? Chains including Flaming Grill, Stone House and Sizzling Pubs were not far behind, with an average of 1,200kcal per meal. KFC topped the fast-food list with an average of 987 calories per meal offered. Burger King, McDonald's and Subway were around 700kcal. Even when the study compared similar meals, the energy content in restaurant meals was greater. Burger meals in restaurants contained an average of 414kcal more than burger meals in fast-food chains, while salad meals in restaurants were slightly higher in calories on average than fast food salads. Dr Robinson said portion size, the ingredients used and cooking methods could explain the difference, but he said the food industry had to make changes. ""It's really clear what the food industry need to do. They need to act more responsibly and reduce the number of calories that they're serving."" Food prepared and eaten at home is generally lower in calories, research shows Hungry Horse said it offered something for everyone at good value. A spokesperson for the chain said: ""We have been working hard to increase the range of lower calorie options, including recently launching a dedicated Live Well range with dishes under 600 calories, and we are committed to further changes."" The government is currently consulting on a planto introduce mandatory calorie labelling in restaurants, takeaways and cafes, which is likely to finish in the new year. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade association UKHospitality, said restaurants, pubs and other hospitality businesses were already taking action to reduce calories and offer healthier dishes - but there were costs to consider too. ""Proposals to shrink the size of dishes or cap calories would be yet another burden for hard-pressed operators to absorb, resulting in prices going up and investment in businesses going down; inevitably negatively impacting the overall customer experience."" Dr Robinson said research showed that meals eaten out of the home contained more calories and with more people having restaurant food delivered to their homes using online services, the problem could be getting worse. The study relied on information provided online by restaurant chains on calorie content. Very few provided calorie labelling on their menus. The researchers said it was possible the fast-food sector was now offering more lower-energy meals and healthier options, after pressure from campaigners to do so.

LiveMay heads to Brussels after winning vote5 minutes ago5 minutes ago What next for Theresa May?What next for Theresa May?7 minutes ago May heads to BrusselsMay heads to Brussels5 hours ago Explaining the no confidence vote in 140 secondsExplaining the no confidence vote in 140 secondsLive May heads to Brussels after winning vote  5 minutes ago,"Theresa May has been back in Brussels to seek changes to the Brexit withdrawal deal She met the Irish PM and the president of the European Council, before an EU summit EU leaders insist the withdrawal deal can't be renegotiated - but say some points can be clarified The PM has confirmed she will not fight the next general election Mrs May remains Tory leader after surviving a confidence vote on Wednesday night She won 200 votes, but 117 MPs voted against her Marie Jackson and Laurence Peter Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. UK withdrawal deal 'not open for renegotiation' 1. The European Council reconfirms its conclusions of 25 November 2018, in which it endorsed
the Withdrawal Agreement and approved the Political Declaration. The Union stands by this
agreement and intends to proceed with its ratification. It is not open for renegotiation. 2. The European Council reiterates that it wishes to establish as close as possible a partnership
with the United Kingdom in the future. It stands ready to embark on preparations immediately
after signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations can start as soon as
possible after the UKâs withdrawal. 3. The European Council underlines that the backstop is intended as an insurance policy to
prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and ensure the integrity of the Single Market. It
is the Unionâs firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes
by 31 December 2020 alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be
triggered. 4. The European Council also underlines that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered,
it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that
ensures that a hard border is avoided. In such a case, the Union would use its best endeavours
to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the
backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only
be in place for as long as strictly necessary. 5. The European Council calls for work on preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the
United Kingdomâs withdrawal to be intensified, taking into account all possible outcomes. Labour frontbencher Angela Rayner says holding another referendum could ""make us more divided"". The EU27 Brexit talks over dinner have ended, the European Council tweets. Theresa May left before the talks began. EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are to give a press conference now.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor writes: Sources have confirmed that one of the ideas being considered in Brussels to improve the controversial backstop is a start date for the future trade relationship between the UK and the EU beyond Brexit, rather than trying to agree an end date for the Irish border guarantee. Tory MPs have demanded changes to the divorce agreement with the EU over the backstop, to make it clear that it could not last for ever, and the UK could terminate the arrangement on its own. The idea of a start date for the relationship beyond Brexit is only one of the ideas being discussed by the EU and the UK. The Spanish government says it has drawn up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, but for now it is not divulging details, to avoid ""unnecessary alarm"". Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, speaking in Madrid, said ministries were working on the basis that Spain would guarantee the rights that UK citizens living in Spain currently enjoy, ""if the rights of Spaniards in the UK are guaranteed"". In 2017 an estimated 310,000 UK expats were living in Spain,the fact-checking website fullfact.org reported.,external That is the largest group of UK expats in the whole of the EU - the next largest contingents are in Ireland and France. Mr Borrell said UK expats would simply have to register as foreign residents. Spain is also negotiating an accord with the UK to let expats keep their right to vote in local elections, he said. The impact of Brexit on Gibraltar has become a thorny issue between Spain and the UK.It nearly torpedoed the withdrawal dealagreed at the last Brexit summit in November.

Theresa May began her bid to solve the Irish border problem, which MPs say is a roadblock to backing her deal with the EU, on Tuesday. Her efforts started with a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Two days later, she is back in his company again - having survived a confidence vote in her leadership. And he has nothing but praise for her. ""She's a great leader,"" he tells BBC's Newsnight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor says: ""It feels like there are three people in this relationship: the EU, which doesnât want to budge; two different sides of the Conservative Party; and Theresa May stuck in the middle of all three... ""Sheâll be pleading to be flexible on the trickiest part of the [Brexit] compromise, but the tone from the EU top brass is that there is nothing straightforward about making a change. ""Publicly admitting that she will step down before the next election tells us that for Theresa May her options are running out fast."" EU diplomats have told Reuters news agency that an addendum attached to the EU trade deal with Canada (Ceta) could be a model for appeasing MPs hostile to Theresa May's Brexit deal. Ceta was blocked at the last minute in 2016 by left-wing politicians in Belgium's Wallonia region, who demanded extra safeguards. Reuters recalls that the fix was
a 12-page ""Joint Interpretative Instrument"" - an EU document explaining how the Ceta deal would work. The Ceta dealwas only approved after nearly eight years of negotiations.

Dead man's mum blames police for 'torment',"Josh Clayton disappeared from a party organised by the son of Robert Dorrien-Smith who leases Tresco from the Duchy of Cornwall The mother of a barman who died on a private holiday island has filed a complaint against police, claiming they ""botched"" the investigation into his death. Josh Clayton disappeared while working on the Isles of Scilly in 2015. The 23-year-old's body was found 10 days later but not examined for another 15 days after that. During the initial search officers clashed with the family and used a ""diviner"" to try to trace Mr Clayton. An inquest that concluded on Wednesday ruled his death was an accident. His mother Tracey Clayton said: ""We can't let it go."" Mr Clayton, from Taunton, had been working on Tresco for six months when he attended a staff party and vanished in the early hours of 13 September. This video can not be played Tracey Clayton: ""The outcome of the inquest is meaningless"" Two Devon and Cornwall Police investigations have failed to find out what happened to him. Documents seen by the BBC show that within hours of Mr Clayton failing to turn up for work, police had categorised him as an ""alcohol or substance misuse"" missing person. Tests showed there was no trace of drugs in Mr Clayton's body and witnesses said though he had been drinking he was anxious to get home as he had to work early. More news from Devon and Cornwall Mrs Clayton said officers assumed her son was a ""drugged-up drunk who had just fallen into the sea"". ""It is bad enough losing your youngest but the thing is, nobody gives a damn,"" she said. ""Nobody cares enough."" Mrs Clayton said she almost wished she and her son were not so close because ""now it wouldn't hurt so much"" Mrs Clayton's complaint listed 22 specific concerns including: A 15-day delay between the body being found and the post-mortem examination His body being transported between three hospitals and over 200 miles before the autopsy The destruction of Mr Clayton's blood-stained T-shirt before any forensic tests Mr Clayton's room being left insecure and not forensically examined for two years A bike believed to have been ridden by Mr Clayton on the night, found damaged as if it had crashed, never being forensically examined A van damaged on the night Mr Clayton went missing not being examined until 19 October 2017, after it had been repaired Golf buggies damaged on the same evening never being examined Police using a ""water diviner"" during the initial search Mr Clayton's family has spent Â£73,000 on legal fees and on hiring a private investigator An initialinquest into the death was halted in January 2017 after another partygoer, Leroy Thomas, changed his storyand claimed Mr Clayton had been involved in a row. Police reinvestigated but this weekon Wednesday an inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death- but the family said they were no closer to knowing what happened. Uncle Simon Clayton said: ""We have got our suspicions because there's so much unexplained strange behaviourâ¦ the thing is they have trashed the evidence and we will never get closure. ""They just botched it and missed every forensic check that they could have taken."" The family have also complained about the conduct of police officers - including a detective who phoned Mrs Clayton to say her son had died, despite requests to deliver the news in person. Mrs Clayton has tried to conduct her own investigation by contacting and questioning potential witnesses Mrs Clayton has also claimed that during the initial search she complained to the police about their efforts, prompting one of the officers to confront the family in a pub where they were having a evening meal. ""We're just fighting all the timeâ¦ I feel that we have been unfairly treated,"" she said. ""I think that people have been so engrossed in their own self-preservation that they didn't want to know the truth. ""I think Josh - as much as he meant the world to us - he is nothing to them, he is just a thorn in their side."" Sexism row over men-only awards dinner 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Police win Barrymore payout appeal During the inquest, pathologist Dr Russell Delaney, who carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr Clayton, said he did not think the 15-day delay made a difference to his finding of the cause of death being unascertained; however an expert has told the BBC such a time gap was ""unheard of"". Professor of forensic medical sciences at Queen Mary University of London, Nikolas Lemos, said delay was ""shocking"" and ""unforgivable"". He said the examination should typically take place within 72 hours and ideally within 24 hours. ""The body is already decomposing... and so you bring that body out of the water and then you let it rot for another 15 days? Now that's unheard of,"" he said. ""It is absolutely no surprise to me that after they subjected this poor man to these ridiculous delays and transfers in vans and morgues that they couldn't come up with a cause of death."" The Clayton family said the officers and volunteers involved in the search were ""amazing"" Prof Lemos said it appeared the police had approached the evidence believing there was no foul play. ""When you go and look at something forensically it is not because you expect the world to be a nice place, it is because you expect criminal activity. ""You assume something bad happened and you hope that all of the evidence will point to the other reason - that nothing bad happened to Josh."" Det Ch Supt Steve Parker, who led the second investigation, said Devon and Cornwall Police acknowledged questions had been raised about the initial investigation. But he said he was satisfied that there had been a comprehensive investigation. ""We kept an open mind throughout the investigation,"" he said. ""There was no evidence of any suspicious activity or indeed any evidence of third party involvement in his death, and therefore no suspects were identified."" In relation to Mrs Clayton's complaint, he added: ""The investigation into these matters is ongoing and to comment on these matters further at this stage would be inappropriate and unfair to those involved."" Three years on Mrs Clayton believes someone knows how her son died. ""We desperately need to know what happened to our Josh,"" she said. ""I can't go to my death bed without knowing. I just can't.""

Jailed Cohen blames Trump's 'dirty deeds',"This video can not be played Cohen walked free from court - but will have to report to jail in March US President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who once said heâd take a bullet for him, has lashed out at his ex-boss' ""dirty deeds"" as he was given a 36-month prison sentence. Cohen is the first member of Mr Trump's inner circle to be jailed over the special counsel's inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In a New York court Cohen, 52, blamed his crimes on Mr Trump. The disgraced attorney told Judge William Pauley on Wednesday that Mr Trump had caused him to ""follow a path of darkness rather than light"". He told the court his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" and that he ""felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds"". Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? Cohen will serve his term concurrently with a two-month sentence he was given for lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow, a charge levelled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The judge gave Cohen until 6 March to report to Otisville prison in upstate New York. In addition to the jail term, he was also ordered to forfeit nearly $2m (Â£1.6m). As he left the court, Cohen did not pause to speak to journalists. Mr Trump ignored reporters as they asked for his reaction later at the White House. If there's a lesson to be learned from the tale of the two Michaels, it's that deals with federal prosecutors are best done quickly. Former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, when confronted by the special counsel's office, was quick to co-operate. He may end up with a sentence that includes no jail time. Michael Cohen, on the other hand, initially put up a legal fight. Prosecutors say he never fully co-operated. Now the 52-year-old is facing three years in prison. Another message from the fate of the two Trump associates is that Mr Trump's business dealings, not Russian election meddling, could present a greater legal threat to the president. According to Mr Cohen's lawyer, his client had the ""misfortune"" of being the president's personal lawyer, business partner and all-around fixer for more than a decade. When investigators began digging into his actions, they uncovered a variety of chargeable crimes. By all accounts, Mr Trump's larger business empire is getting similar scrutiny. His long-time accountant is co-operating with investigators. There's no telling where Mr Mueller's Russia investigation will end up, but one thing is clear - it's not the only shark circling the White House. The sentencing was related to two separate cases brought by the Southern District of New York and Special Counsel Mueller's Russia investigation. Mr Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Mr Trump. One of those payments was made by American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer, to suppress a woman's allegations of an affair with Mr Trump. On Wednesday the Department of Justice also announced it had reached a deal with AMI to forego prosecution as long as the company admitted it made the $150,000 payment ""in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign, and in order to ensure that the woman did not publicise damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 election"". The tabloid publisher also agreed to continue co-operating with investigators. Mr Trump has acknowledged the payments despite denying the affairs, and called them a private transaction unrelated to his campaign. The special counsel reached a plea deal with Cohen on one count of lying to Congress given his co-operation with the Russia inquiry. The president's former lawyer admitted to making false statements to Congress about a Trump property deal in Moscow during the 2016 election. During Wednesday's sentencing, Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, said the special counsel probe ""is of utmost national significance, no less than seen 40 years ago in Watergate"", referring to the scandal that brought down Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974. Cohen's other convictions for tax evasion and bank fraud charges are unrelated to the president. In exchange for a more lenient sentence, he had offered information regarding his campaign finance violations, including payingadult film star Stormy Danielshush money at the behest of ""the candidate"", in what is understood to be a reference to Mr Trump. This video can not be played Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a ""weak person"" and a liar Relations between Cohen, once considered Mr Trump's right-hand man, and the president have soured over the course of Cohen's criminal trials. Mr Trump, who calls Mr Mueller's inquiry a ""witch hunt"", has repeatedly criticised his former ally since he began co-operating with investigators. He told reporters last month that Cohen was ""weak"" and ""not a very smart person"". All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Michael Cohen arrived for his sentencing with members of his family In other Russia investigation developments, former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying to the FBI about his talks with the Russian ambassador, has asked for leniency. Flynn's attorneys requested he serve no prison time as he has co-operated with the special counsel's investigation from the start. Last week, the special counsel's teamannounced that they would not be pursuing jail time for Flynnas he provided ""substantial"" details regarding the Trump campaign team and Russian officials. Cohen, Flynn and ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort are among a number of the president's aides being investigated by Mr Mueller's team. Mr Manafort - who has been convicted of fraud - had been co-operating with the special counsel's inquiry. But last Friday, Mr Mueller's team released a memo alleging he had breached a plea agreement by lying to investigators. Cohen leaves court.

Police appeal over Strasbourg suspect,"French police have appealed for help in finding a man suspected of a Christmas market gun attack in Strasbourg that killed three people, and left a fourth brain dead and 12 others wounded. Hundreds of security personnel are searching for Cherif Chekatt, 29, on both sides of the Franco-German border. The suspect had a string of criminal convictions and had become a radical Islamist while in prison. Police say he is highly dangerous and should not be approached. French officials announced on Thursday that a third person had died in the aftermath of the Strasbourg attack. Five people were seriously wounded, they said, including a man described as brain dead. Strasbourg shooting: What we know so far Face to face with the gunman Chekatt has been in jail in Germany as well as France, and German reports suggested he may have received a call from Germany shortly before the Strasbourg attack. He did not answer the call, but investigators were trying to establish who was behind it, RBB Inforadio reported. Border checks on drivers near Strasbourg brought traffic to a near standstill on Thursday The French government and police union urged ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters to call off demonstrations planned for Saturday to enable authorities to maintain security in the run-up to Christmas. A 23-year-old protester was struck by a lorry and killed at a roundabout in Avignon on Wednesday night. The lights of Paris' Eiffel Tower were turned off overnight,externalin tribute to the victims of the Strasbourg attack. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the gesture was to show the city's support to the families affected and ""all of Strasbourg"". The Eiffel Tower in Paris goes dark in tribute to the victims and ""all of Strasbourg"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the parliament that 720 police officers and other members of the security forces were searching for the gunman, who was injured in an exchange of fire with soldiers who were patrolling the Christmas market in Strasbourg when the attack occurred. Across the nearby border, German police were conducting searches after France's Deputy Interior Minister, Laurent NuÃ±ez, acknowledged that the gunman might no longer be in France. Border agents were checking vehicles crossing the Rhine river, which marks the Franco-German frontier, leading to long lines of traffic in both directions. This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and helping a victim of the Strasbourg shooting Mr Castaner said the country had moved to the highest level of alert, expanding police powers and increasing vigilance. He added that security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up. The mayor of Strasbourg, Roland Ries, has said the Christmas market there will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, with flags lowered to half-mast at the local town hall. At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday, a man opened fire close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market near one of the central squares, Place KlÃ©ber, which attracts thousands of visitors. France's anti-terror prosecutor, RÃ©my Heitz, said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. As well as the fatalities, 12 people were wounded, six of them seriously, he added. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after commandeering a taxi, Mr Heitz said. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker boasted to the taxi driver that he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him in the vicinity of the police station in the Neudorf area. When he got out the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping into the night. Four people connected to the suspect had been detained overnight in Strasbourg, Mr Heitz said. Sources close to the investigation quoted by Reuters news agency said they were the suspect's mother, father and two brothers. According to police, Cherif Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat. He was the subject of a ""fiche S"", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result. Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home. A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition. By Damian Grammaticas, Strasbourg Strasbourg's famous Christmas market is now a gloomy place. The lines of wooden huts are all shuttered. The owner of one told us how he had to flee when he heard the gunshots and take shelter in a local bar. ""We're all shaken up,"" he said. At this time of year, the place should be thronged with people who come from far and wide to sightsee and shop, buying everything from hot sausages to souvenirs. Now there's a weary, deflated feeling. Police stand guard at cordoned off alleyways. ""Everyone was shouting, everyone was running, running, afraid,"" said one eyewitness who'd seen the gunman shooting randomly. Strasbourg has been a target for failed terror attacks before. But now it's happened, people here are hurt and outraged. As one said: ""It's shameful."" Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, a tourist from Thailand, has been named by Thai media as one of the dead. He is believed to have been on holiday with his wife. The Italian foreign ministry has said one of the injured is an Italian journalist who was covering the European parliament, but declined to confirm media reports  that he was in a serious condition. One soldier was slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet during an exchange of fire with the gunman. Strasbourg has been the target of jihadist plots in the past. Not only does it have one of France's oldest Christmas markets, but it is the official seat of the European Parliament. That parliament was in session at the time of Tuesday evening's attack. In 2000, the Christmas market was at the centre of a failed al-Qaeda plot.Ten Islamist militants were jailed four years later,externalfor their part in the planned New Year's Eve attack. However, MEPs were determined to carry on the morning after the attack, with German MEP Jo Leinen posting a picture of singing and Christmas lights in the European Parliament. Allow Twitter content?

Second Canadian 'missing' in China,"Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig have been put under ""compulsory measures"" A second Canadian has been detained in China on accusations of harming national security, as tension continues between the two countries. It was confirmed on Thursday that Michael Spavor, a businessman, had been detained in addition to former diplomat Michael Kovrig. Canada drew Chinese protests after it arrested an executive at telecoms giant Huawei at the request of the US. Meng Wanzhou has been bailed but may face extradition for fraud. She denies violating US sanctions on Iran through Huawei's business dealings. China has threatened unspecified consequences if she is not released. Who is detained Canadian Michael Spavor? The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple So high-profile is the case that US PresidentDonald Trump said he could intervene if it helped to avoid a further decline in relations between the US and China, which are locked in a trade war. However, Mr Trump's own officials frowned on the idea, with US Assistant Attorney General John Demers remarking: ""What we do at the justice department is law enforcement. We don't do trade."" Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang addressed the matter on Thursday, saying the pair were ""suspected of engaging in activities that threatened China's national security"" and had been put under ""compulsory measures"", a usual reference to custody. Mr Lu said the ""legal rights and interests of these two Canadians have been safeguarded"" and that the two cases were being investigated separately. Asked if the detentions were in response to Ms Meng's arrest, he said they were part of an ""operation taken by China's relevant national security authorities in accordance with the laws"". Mr Lu said Ms Meng's arrest was ""wrong practice"", adding: ""I can point out that, since the Canadian government took the wrong action at the request of the US and took Meng Wanzhou into custody, many Chinese are wondering if their trips to Canada are safe."" Some China analysts were in little doubt about the reason for the detentions. Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's former ambassador to China,told Canadian broadcaster CBC:,external""In China there are no coincidences... If they want to send you a message, they will send you a message."" One Western diplomat in China told Reuters news agency: ""This is a political kidnapping."" Michael Spavor (left) helped arrange the trip of ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman (R) to North Korea in 2013 Michael Spavor,arrested on 12 December, is a businessman based in Dandong, near the Chinese border with North Korea. He has ties to the North Korean government and has met its leader Kim Jong-un many times. Canadian foreign ministry spokesman Guillaume BÃ©rubÃ© confirmed that Mr Spavor had contacted it earlier in the week because ""he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities"". One of his most recent Facebook posts, on Sunday, said he was about to travel to Seoul in South Korea but he did not arrive on Monday as planned. Allow Facebook content?

Mr Spavor runs an organisation called the Paektu Cultural Exchange, which organises business, cultural and tourism trips to North Korea. He is a regular visitor to North Korea and regularly comments in the media on Korean issues. He is particularly well known for helping to arrange the visit by former NBA star Dennis Rodman to North Korea in 2013. Rodman is a personal friend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Ex-diplomatMichael Kovrigcurrently works for a think-tank, the International Crisis Group (ICG), which has said it is concerned for his health and safety. He was arrested on 10 December. Mr Lu said the ICG had not been registered as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in China and therefore it was unlawful for its staff to work there. Checks by Reuters news agency did not turn up a registration for ICG on government databases for NGOs or social enterprises. Asked about Mr Kovrig, Canada said there was no ""explicit indication"" of any link to the Meng case. It said his case had been raised directly with Chinese officials. The former Canadian resident was detained on 1 December in Vancouver, where she has family and property connections. She was granted bail of C$10m(Â£6m; $7.4m) on Tuesday but could still be extradited to the US. Sketch of Meng Wanzhou in court in Canada The US has been investigating Huawei, one of the world's largest smartphone makers, since 2016, believing that it used a subsidiary, Skycom, to bring US manufacturing equipment and millions of dollars in transactions to Iran in violation of sanctions. Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what? Who does business with Iran? The Supreme Court of British Columbia was told that Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, carried this out between 2009 and 2014. She allegedly tricked US banks into clearing transactions for Huawei which were in reality for Skycom. The banks thus became ""victim institutions"" of fraud. Lawyers for Ms Meng told the court that Huawei had already separated itself from Skycom. Ms Meng faces up to 30 years in prison in the US if found guilty of the charges, the Canadian court heard.

Jailed Iran activist dies on hunger strike,"The activist was protesting against his conditions in prison An Iranian political activist jailed for his messages on social media has died after spending 60 days on hunger strike, his family says. Vahid Sayadi Nasiri had been accused of insulting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other offences. He was released last March after serving two-and-a-half years in prison but detained again five months later. The activist demanded his transfer from a high-security unit of a prison in the city of Qom to a different location. Vahid Sayadi Nasiri was initially arrested in September 2015,externaland sentenced to eight years in prison for ""insulting the supreme leader"" and ""propaganda against the state,"" according to the advocacy group Iran Human Rights Monitor. The charges were related to posts he had made on his Facebook page. He was later pardoned and released early. The 'Rosa Parks' of Iran? Iran country profile However he was arrested again in August, just months after his release, reportedly on similar charges. He began his hunger strike in October in protest at the conditions of his imprisonment and his lack of access to a lawyer, according to Iran Human Rights Monitor. He also said the principle of separation of prisoners' crimes was being violated as he was being held with ordinary criminals and was being attacked and harassed, the group said. Conditions in the Qom prison are described as harsh, correspondents say. The activist had reportedly been taken to hospital in the wake of his hunger strike. His sister, Elaheh, said the family had been informed by authorities of his death. No other details were immediately available.

Theresa May survives confidence vote,"This video can not be played Theresa May: 'We now need to get on with the job of delivering Brexit' Prime Minister Theresa May has won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party by 200 to 117. After securing 63% of the total vote, she is now immune from a leadership challenge for a year. Speaking in Downing Street, she vowed to deliver the Brexit ""people voted for"" but said she had listened to the concerns of MPs who voted against her. Her supporters urged the party to move on but critics said losing the support of a third of MPs was ""devastating"". The prime minister won the confidence vote with a majority of 83, with 63% of Conservative MPs backing her and 37% voting against her. The secret ballot was triggered by 48 of her MPs angry at her Brexit policy, which they say betrays the 2016 referendum result. What next for Theresa May? For or against? How Tory MPs said they would vote Brexit: A really simple guide The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the level of opposition was ""not at all comfortable"" for the prime minister and a ""real blow"" to her authority.

Speaking shortly after the result was announced, Mrs May said she would be fighting for changes to her Brexit deal at an EU summit on Thursday. ""I am pleased to have received the backing of my colleagues in tonight's ballot,"" she said. ""Whilst I am grateful for that support, a significant number of colleagues did cast a vote against me and I have listened to what they said."" She spoke of a ""renewed mission - delivering the Brexit people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that really works for everyone"". Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for the confidence vote, said losing the support of a third of her MPs was a ""terrible result for the prime minister"" and called on her to resign. Brexit-backing Tory MP Mark Francois told the BBC it was ""devastating"" that more than half of backbenchers not serving in the government had abandoned the prime minister. ""In the cold light of day when people reflect on that number - 117 - it's a massive number, far more than anyone was predicting. I think that will be very sobering for the prime minister. I think she needs to think very carefully about what she does now."" This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, announces May survive confidence vote Transport Secretary Chris Grayling conceded there were ""lessons"" for the prime minister and the party in the result but former cabinet minister Damian Green said it was a ""decisive"" victory for the prime minister, which should allow her to ""move on and get on with the job in hand"". Conservative grandee Nicholas Soames urged Brexiteers to ""throw their weight"" behind the PM as she sought to address the ""grave concerns"" many MPs had about aspects of the EU deal. The result was greeted by cheers and applause from Tory MPs as it was announced by backbench Tory chairman Sir Graham Brady. The prime minister still faces a battle to get the Brexit deal she agreed with the EU through the UK Parliament, with all opposition parties and, clearly, dozens of her own MPs against it. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the vote had ""changed nothing"". ""Theresa May has lost her majority in Parliament, her government is in chaos and she's unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country."" This video can not be played Theresa May: How the PM fought through Brexit battles Labour has said it will table a no-confidence motion that all MPs - not just Conservatives - will be able to vote in when they felt they had a chance of winning it, and forcing a general election. The SNP's Stephen Gethins urged Labour to ""step up to the plate"" and call a vote of no confidence in Mrs May, accusing the government of ""playing games with people's lives"". DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said his party, which helps keep Mrs May in power, was still concerned about the Irish backstop plan, which most MPs were against. ""I don't think this vote really changes anything very much in terms of the arithmetic,"" he told BBC News. But he said the DUP would not support a no-confidence motion in Parliament at this stage. Mrs May earlier vowed to fight on to deliver her Brexit deal, which she argues is the only option for leaving the EU in an orderly way on 29 March. But in a last-minute pitch to her MPs before the vote she promised to stand down as leader before the next scheduled election in 2022. While ""in her heart"" she wanted to fight another election as leader, she realised her party did not want her to. However, she resisted calls to name a firm date for her departure. If she had lost the confidence vote Mrs May would have been forced to stand down as Conservative Party leader, and then as prime minister. But she is now expected to travel to a summit in Brussels on Thursday to continue trying to persuade EU leaders to change the deal - they have previously said it cannot be renegotiated. The outcome of the vote was welcomed by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who said avoiding a no-deal exit from the EU was their ""shared goal"".

PM to join EU summit after surviving vote,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I think it is right that the party feels the party would prefer to go into that election with a new leader"" Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not lead the Conservative Party into the next general election. She said the party would prefer to ""to go into that election with another leader"", as she arrived in Brussels for an EU summit. It confirms what she told MPs ahead of a confidence vote triggered by MPs angry at her Brexit policy. Mrs May won the vote but has vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her. The next scheduled general election is in 2022. Live updates: Fallout from May's confidence vote Kuenssberg: May goes public with end-date pledge Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? Runners and riders: Who could replace Theresa May? May vote leaves Europe media unimpressed Mrs May said: ""I've said that in my heart I would love to be able to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election but I think it is right that the party feels that they would prefer to go into that election with another leader."" Asked whether she would quit after Brexit, she declined to discuss dates but added: ""What I'm clear about is the next general election is in 2022 and I think it's right that another party leader take us into that general election."" The prime minister said she hoped to ""assuage"" the concerns of Tory MPs who voted against her by seeking legal ""assurances"" from EU leaders that the backstop plan to prevent the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland would be temporary. Mrs May has left the summit for the evening after addressing EU leaders over Brexit Critics say Mrs May's backstop plan will keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. The EU says it will not renegotiate the backstop, but may agree to give greater assurances on its temporary nature. It seems unlikely that would win over enough support for her Brexit plan to have a realistic chance of getting through the House of Commons, with tensions heightened in the Conservative Party in the wake of Wednesday evening's confidence vote. Downing Street confirmed on Thursday that the MPs' ""meaningful vote"" on the deal will not now take place before Christmas - it was abandoned this week when Mrs May admitted it would have been ""rejected by a significant margin"". The PM's spokeswoman said it would happen ""as soon as possible in January"". The prime minister's admission that she'll leave office before the next election fended off yesterday's clamour from a chunk of her party to go. But it hardly makes things easier from today onwards. Just as she is desperate to get a time limit on the controversial ""backstop"", she now has a limit on her time in office. Now it is public, in her own words, questions won't just be about her impossible Brexit agreement but also about how, and when, she will finally go. Read more from Laura here Earlier this week, the prime minister travelled to meet EU leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, to raise the issues surrounding the withdrawal agreement at Westminster one-on-one. But a trip to meet the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had to be cancelled because of the leadership vote. At Thursday's summit, Mrs May has the opportunity to spell out face-to-face the problems she faces to leaders of all the other 27 member states. The EU leaders will then consider what could be done - without Mrs May in the room. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: A really simple guide Theresa May said she had listened to the concerns of the MPs who had voted against her, adding that she knew what was needed to get her deal ""over the line"". ""I've already met [Irish Premier] Leo Varadkar, I'm going to be addressing the European Council later and I'll be showing the legal and political assurances that I believe we need to assuage the concerns that MPs have on this issue."" She added: ""I don't expect an immediate breakthrough but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary."" Sebastian Kurz: 'Additional explanations' might be needed Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the European Council, said: ""I believe that Theresa May knows that there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement."" But he said that it might be possible to ""provide a little better explanation or definition or go into detail"" on the provisions of the agreement. ""Hopefully that will allow Theresa May to bring a vote in January and obtain a majority,"" he said. ""If the British prime minister thinks one or another additional explanation can be helpful before she brings it to a vote, then we should do that."" Asked what concessions might succeed in winning over Mrs May's domestic critics, Mr Kurz said: ""It is difficult to judge, because many of the sceptics do not argue in a way that is really rational."" Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader and a Brexiteer who voted against Mrs May in Wednesday's vote, said he wanted to ""send a strong message"" to the PM. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We cannot go on just with the idea that a fiddle here and a fiddle there is what the problem is."" Instead, he said Mrs May should say that the Â£39bn the UK has agreed to pay the EU as part of the divorce deal is ""at risk"". ""They have got to say to the EU... we are not committed to this Â£39bn unless we get some resolution."" How long can Theresa May survive as PM? What does Ireland do if thereâs no deal? How did we get here? Listen: Emergency Brexitcast podcast on May vote For or against? How Tory MPs said they would vote Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is against Brexit, told BBC Breakfast: ""We are still back with the problem that the government has a proposal that we can't get through Parliament and we have got to try and break that gridlock."" He called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""come off the fence"" and back another public vote on Brexit. Labour has said that it will table a no-confidence motion in Theresa May's government that all MPs - not just Conservatives - will be able to vote in - but only when they felt they had a chance of winning it, and forcing a general election. But the DUP - which props up Mrs May's government - said it would not support such a motion at this stage. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell urged Theresa May to work with Labour on getting a deal with the EU that ""will protect jobs and the economy"". He said there was an ""overwhelming majority"" in the Commons against a no-deal Brexit but the prime minister should now hold a series of votes to establish what other options MPs were willing to accept.

Canada seeks access to China-held citizen,"The International Crisis Group says it is working for Mr Kovrig's release Canada says it is seeking consular access as soon as possible to a former Canadian diplomat who has been detained in China. Michael Kovrig was held on Monday by the Beijing National Security Bureau. His current employers, the International Crisis Group (ICG), say they are concerned for his health and safety. Canadian officials say the reason for his detention remains unclear. They do not know where he is being held. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Wednesday the case has been raised directly with Chinese officials. News of Mr Kovrig's detention came days after Canada arrested Chinese telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou. Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, was released in Vancouver, Canada on Tuesday on C$10m (Â£6m; $7.4m) bail. She was arrested on 1 December and could be extradited to the US to face fraud charges linked to the alleged violation of sanctions on Iran. China has demanded that Canada release Ms Meng or face consequences. Ms Freeland says that Chinese authorities did not describe the situation with Mr Kovrig as a reprisal. She also confirmed during a news conference that her department is aware of a second Canadian who recently reached out to Canadian officials because ""he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities"". ""We have not been able to make contact with him since he let us know about this,"" she said. ""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we have also raised this case with the Chinese authorities."" Canadian ex-diplomat 'held in China' Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple Mr Kovrig has been working since February 2017 as a senior advisor for ICG, a Brussels-based think tank that focuses on conflict reduction research. He is on special leave from Canada's ministry of foreign affairs and does not benefit from diplomatic privileges.  He was posted as a diplomat in Hong Kong and Beijing between 2012-16. The state-run Beijing News newspaper has reported he is being held ""on suspicion of engaging in activities that harm China's state security"". A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that he had ""no information to offer"" on Mr Kovrig's case. He also claimed that ICG ""has not legally registered nor submitted documents for the record in the mainland of China"". ICG said in a statement that Mr Kovrig is known for ""his rigorous and impartial reporting"" and is a ""noted and sought after contributor on security issues in North East Asia, particularly relating to China, Japan and the Korean peninsula"". An ICG spokesman said that the organisation has had a presence in China since 2007 but closed their Beijing office in 2016 due to changes in Chinese laws around NGOs. Mr Kovrig is based in Hong Kong, but ICG says he regularly visits Beijing to meet with officials and to attend conferences at the invitation of Chinese organisations, and has made frequent appearances on Chinese media.

"EastEnders set goes ÃÂ£27m over budgetThe National Audit Office says the BBC soap's new set ""will not be able to deliver value for money"".Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Aerial pictures show work on the new EastEnders set in Elstree, as filming takes place on the existing set. The BBC's project to build a brand new, HD-ready Albert Square and expand the external EastEnders set will now cost Â£27m more than originally planned. The original 2015 forecast for the scheme was Â£59.7m, but the revised budget is now Â£86.7m, the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed. The new set was originally due to open in 2018, but won't be ready until 2023. The BBC said the project was ""large"" and ""complex"", adding that there had been ""challenges on the way"". A brand new Queen Vic pub is being built as part of the new set The corporation is building a new Albert Square near the existing set at the BBC's Elstree studios in Hertfordshire. It will have actual brick buildings - unlike the current one, which only uses facades. The external EastEnders set dates back to the soap's birth in 1984 and was only supposed to be used for two years, but has lasted for 34. The soap cannot currently be filmed in high definition, and the BBC said the poor condition of the current set is increasingly causing delays to filming. The building project - titled E20 - was announced in 2015 and was meant to finish by August 2018. The original set was only supposed to be used for two years In its report, the NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament, said the extra costs mean ""the BBC will not be able to deliver value for money... in the way that it envisaged in 2015"". The body took aim at the early planning stage, which ""resulted in the BBC underestimating aspects of complexity, cost and risks of its approach"". However, the NAO also acknowledged that the BBC had faced issues such as asbestos and obstructions in the ground, which could not have been foreseen when the project was first planned. Inflation has also risen faster than expected in the construction industry - although the NAO said inflation ""had a greater impact than it would have done had the programme been completed without any delays"". Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""We believe that the planned benefits are still broadly achievable, but given the high risk nature of E20 it will need close scrutiny until it's finished."" The NAO said ""some of the reasons for the delays and cost increases could have been addressed earlier by the BBC"", adding that the corporation ""had made many improvements to the programme"" in the last 18 months. The funeral of Peggy Mitchell was a big Walford event ""The show remains one of the BBC's flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London. ""It's a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre but like any building work of this scale there have been challenges on the way, including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site. ""As the NAO recognises we've already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny."" The BBC added that it would ""continue to capture... lessons learned on the programme"". EastEnders is currently watched by around six million people per episode, compared with about 7.5 million for its ITV rival Coronation Street. The Manchester-based soap opened a new set in 2013, but the cost of that was never made public. At EastEnders, the so-called ""front lot"", which is the replacement for the existing set, will now be finished by 2021 - but work on the ""back lot"", which will include new Walford outdoor locations, will go on until May 2023. Work that has already taken place on E20 includes new boiler heating and edit suites, additional stage capacity and a new site entrance.

LiveMPs cheer as May wins leadership vote26 minutes ago26 minutes ago 'EU could commit to working on further assurances for UK''EU could commit to working on further assurances for UK'1 hour ago Brokenshire on Hammond 'extremist' commentsBrokenshire on Hammond 'extremist' comments,"Theresa May has been back in Brussels to seek changes to the Brexit withdrawal deal She met the Irish PM and the president of the European Council, before an EU summit EU leaders insist the withdrawal deal can't be renegotiated - but say some points can be clarified The PM has confirmed she will not fight the next general election Mrs May remains Tory leader after surviving a confidence vote on Wednesday night She won 200 votes, but 117 MPs voted against her Marie Jackson and Laurence Peter Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. UK withdrawal deal 'not open for renegotiation' 1. The European Council reconfirms its conclusions of 25 November 2018, in which it endorsed
the Withdrawal Agreement and approved the Political Declaration. The Union stands by this
agreement and intends to proceed with its ratification. It is not open for renegotiation. 2. The European Council reiterates that it wishes to establish as close as possible a partnership
with the United Kingdom in the future. It stands ready to embark on preparations immediately
after signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations can start as soon as
possible after the UKâs withdrawal. 3. The European Council underlines that the backstop is intended as an insurance policy to
prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and ensure the integrity of the Single Market. It
is the Unionâs firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes
by 31 December 2020 alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be
triggered. 4. The European Council also underlines that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered,
it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that
ensures that a hard border is avoided. In such a case, the Union would use its best endeavours
to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the
backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only
be in place for as long as strictly necessary. 5. The European Council calls for work on preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the
United Kingdomâs withdrawal to be intensified, taking into account all possible outcomes. Labour frontbencher Angela Rayner says holding another referendum could ""make us more divided"". The EU27 Brexit talks over dinner have ended, the European Council tweets. Theresa May left before the talks began. EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are to give a press conference now.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor writes: Sources have confirmed that one of the ideas being considered in Brussels to improve the controversial backstop is a start date for the future trade relationship between the UK and the EU beyond Brexit, rather than trying to agree an end date for the Irish border guarantee. Tory MPs have demanded changes to the divorce agreement with the EU over the backstop, to make it clear that it could not last for ever, and the UK could terminate the arrangement on its own. The idea of a start date for the relationship beyond Brexit is only one of the ideas being discussed by the EU and the UK. The Spanish government says it has drawn up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, but for now it is not divulging details, to avoid ""unnecessary alarm"". Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, speaking in Madrid, said ministries were working on the basis that Spain would guarantee the rights that UK citizens living in Spain currently enjoy, ""if the rights of Spaniards in the UK are guaranteed"". In 2017 an estimated 310,000 UK expats were living in Spain,the fact-checking website fullfact.org reported.,external That is the largest group of UK expats in the whole of the EU - the next largest contingents are in Ireland and France. Mr Borrell said UK expats would simply have to register as foreign residents. Spain is also negotiating an accord with the UK to let expats keep their right to vote in local elections, he said. The impact of Brexit on Gibraltar has become a thorny issue between Spain and the UK.It nearly torpedoed the withdrawal dealagreed at the last Brexit summit in November.

Theresa May began her bid to solve the Irish border problem, which MPs say is a roadblock to backing her deal with the EU, on Tuesday. Her efforts started with a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Two days later, she is back in his company again - having survived a confidence vote in her leadership. And he has nothing but praise for her. ""She's a great leader,"" he tells BBC's Newsnight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When Sir Graham Brady revealed the outcome of the vote on Theresa May's leadership last night, it wasn't only the result that had TV viewers transfixed. The venue and atmosphere of table banging and roaring approval didn't pass without comment. Our colleagues have been busy finding out more about committee room 14 and what gives it its other-worldly aura. Read about ithere. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Our political editor says: ""It feels like there are three people in this relationship: the EU, which doesnât want to budge; two different sides of the Conservative Party; and Theresa May stuck in the middle of all three... ""Sheâll be pleading to be flexible on the trickiest part of the [Brexit] compromise, but the tone from the EU top brass is that there is nothing straightforward about making a change. ""Publicly admitting that she will step down before the next election tells us that for Theresa May her options are running out fast."" EU diplomats have told Reuters news agency that an addendum attached to the EU trade deal with Canada (Ceta) could be a model for appeasing MPs hostile to Theresa May's Brexit deal. Ceta was blocked at the last minute in 2016 by left-wing politicians in Belgium's Wallonia region, who demanded extra safeguards. Reuters recalls that the fix was
a 12-page ""Joint Interpretative Instrument"" - an EU document explaining how the Ceta deal would work. The Ceta dealwas only approved after nearly eight years of negotiations.  Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel says Brexit threatens 70,000 jobs in Belgium ""if there is no good agreement that protects our economic interests and our citizens"". He promised to be vigilant to ensure ""stability and responsibility"". Research by the House of Commons Library shows,externalthat in 2017 the UK's total exports to the rest of the EU were worth Â£274bn. Total imports from the EU were Â£342bn. The EU accounted for 44.5% of the UK's exports and 53% of the UK's imports. UK imports from Belgium were 4.4% of total imports, and exports to Belgium were 3% of the total. Allow Twitter content?
