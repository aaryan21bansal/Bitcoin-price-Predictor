Body found during search for missing Brit,"Policia Nacional said Amy Louise Gerard was last seen outside Molly Malone's Irish bar A body has been found by search teams looking for a missing British woman in Tenerife. Amy Louise Gerard, 28, originally from Cleethorpes, was last seen outside Irish bar, Molly Malone's in Puerto de la Cruz in the early hours of Friday. Ms Gerard works at the Spanish island's Loro Parque marine theme park. Her mother and sister had flown out to help with the search. Policia Nacional confirmed a body had been found but not yet identified. The coastguard searched the coast off the city of Puerto de la Cruz According to her Facebook profile, University of Lincoln graduate Ms Gerard trains killer whales at the theme park on the island, where she has been living and working since May 2016. Triple child killer cleared for release School caps teacher presents at Â£50 More stories from around Yorkshire The Foreign and Commonwealth Office earlier confirmed it was assisting the family of a British woman in Tenerife. Onlookers watched on as a helicopter and a coastguard boat searched the water This is a resort that's been hoping Amy will be found safe and well - missing posters are on walls and doors, people tell me the whole resort has had their fingers crossed. Late this morning a civil guard helicopter made a number of low passes over the Puerto de la Cruz coastline. It seemed to focus on one area and it became apparent that there was something in the water. A rescue boat which has been involved in the search for Amy was soon on the scene, while the helicopter hovered above. Shortly afterwards, I watched as what appeared to be a body was recovered from the water and taken to a nearby harbour at about 11:30 GMT.

Former leader Nigel Farage quits UKIP,"Nigel Farage has quit UKIP, saying the party's leader Gerard Batten seems to be obsessed with Islam and ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson. Speaking on LBC radio, the former leader of the Eurosceptic party said he made the decision with a ""heavy heart"". But he said he did not ""recognise"" the party anymore and it was turning a blind eye to extremist politics. Mr Batten survived a vote of no confidence on Monday, after he appointed Mr Robinson as an adviser. However, the party's ruling body said it did not endorse Mr Robinson's appointment and he was barred from membership ""through his associations"". UKIP row over admitting Tommy Robinson UKIP leader survives no-confidence vote The Nigel Farage story Mr Farage - who joined the party's forerunner, the Anti-Federalist League, in 1992 - said he had worked ""tirelessly"" for UKIP with the aim of forcing a vote to ""get us back our independence"" from the EU. But he said under Mr Batten's leadership ""a lot has changed"". ""[Mr Batten] seems to be pretty obsessed with the issue of Islam, not just Islamic extremism, but Islam, and UKIP wasn't founded to be a party fighting a religious crusade,"" he said. ""[He is] also obsessed with this figure Tommy Robinson..."" Mr Farage said the association of the former EDL leader brought ""scuffles"" and ""violence"" to the party, adding: ""Many have criminal records, some pretty serious, and all of it has been dragging UKIP away from being an electoral party into a party of street activism."" This video can not be played In October, Mr Batten called Tommy Robinson is a ""tremendously brave man"" Mr Batten and Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, are due to appear together at a pro-Brexit march this weekend. Mr Farage said the ""image"" that will give Brexit is ""something that our enemies will use against us for perhaps many years to come"". ""Damaging UKIP is one thing, damaging the Brexit cause is even worse,"" he added. ""The brand has now been so damaged, so tarnished, that it is not able to pick up and won't be able to pick up the political opportunity that is there staring it in the face."" After Mr Farage quit the party, Mr Batten said he gave ""full credit"" to him for the part he played in winning the 2016 EU referendum for the Leave side, but said Mr Farage had ""left the party in spirit"" after the vote. Mr Batten also said: ""[UKIP] stood on the edge of destruction in February 2018 and Nigel chose to play no part in rescuing it. I am pleased that I was able to do precisely that. ""Under my leadership, the party has been saved financially, recruited thousands of more members, and we have risen in the polls. We are going from strength to strength."" He added: ""I am not going to return like with like in this instance and instead wish Nigel well in his media career. I doubt he will be asking me to go on his show.""

"Saudi crown prince crazy, US senator says","This video can not be played Senators slam Saudi crown prince as 'crazy' and a 'wrecking ball' US senators say they are more certain than ever after a private CIA briefing that the Saudi crown prince had a role in the murder of a journalist. In a blistering attack, Senator Lindsey Graham said he had ""high confidence"" Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. The South Carolina Republican described the Saudi royal as ""a wrecking ball"", ""crazy"" and ""dangerous"". The Saudis have charged 11 people but deny the crown prince was involved. Where the Saudi prince stands revealed Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Members of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations did not mince words after the briefing by CIA Director Gina Haspel on Tuesday. ""There is not a smoking gun - there is a smoking saw,"" Mr Graham said, referring to Khashoggi's alleged dismemberment in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. The senator said he could not support Saudi Arabia's involvement in the war in Yemen or arms sales to the Saudi government as long as the crown prince remained in power. Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, echoed those views. He said the US must ""send a clear and unequivocal message that such actions are not acceptable in the world's stage"". This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS Another senator, Bob Corker, told reporters, using the crown prince's initials: ""I have zero question on my mind that the crown prince MBS ordered the killing."" The Tennessee Republican added: ""If he was in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes. Guilty."" Mr Corker suggested that President Donald Trump had condoned the murder of a journalist by refusing to condemn the Saudi crown prince. Fellow Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama said: ""Now the question is, how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation?"" The Senate is planning to vote on a proposal to end US military support to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, after members of both parties advanced the resolution last week. Senator Chris Murphy, who was not privy to Tuesday's briefing, criticised the Trump administration. ""Not everything needs to be secret,"" the Connecticut Democrat tweeted. ""If our government knows that Saudi leaders were involved in the murder of a US resident, why shouldn't the public know this?"" Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington Senators are trying to pressure the White House into condemning the Saudi crown prince. Failing that they are exploring ways to send a message of their own that the US will not tolerate the blatant violation of international norms. Options include blocking or suspending arms sales and imposing tougher sanctions. In a significant rebuke to the Trump administration, senators have already voted to advance a measure that would withdraw US military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. But it won't be easy to get the numbers to actually pass the resolution, at least not in its current form. One difficulty is that while there is a lot of anger over the Khashoggi affair, there isn't agreement on the best way to respond. And any measures that senators might pass would almost certainly be blocked by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. So they would have to start over again when Democrats take control of the House next year, which they may well do. Given the legislative obstacles, and with full White House backing, Mohammed bin Salman doesn't have too much to worry about, at least for now. But the Saudis won't like being the ongoing object of Senate wrath, especially after paying millions and millions of public relations dollars to improve their image in Washington. The CIA has concluded Mohammed bin Salman ""probably ordered"" the killing of Khashoggi. The spy agency has evidence he exchanged messages with Saud al-Qahtani, who allegedly oversaw the Saudi reporter's murder. The CIA director - who has reportedly heard an audio recording of the murder - did not attend a recent congressional briefing by cabinet members, dismaying lawmakers. The White House denied having a hand in Ms Haspel's conspicuous absence, and the CIA said no one had told Ms Haspel not to attend. At last week's hearing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary James Mattis told senators there was no direct evidence of the crown prince's involvement in Khashoggi's death. President Trump has said the CIA findings on the crown prince were not conclusive. On 20 November he said: ""It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Journalist who stepped into a consulate and vanished Jamal Khashoggi in his own words As a prominent journalist, he covered major stories including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of Osama Bin Laden for various Saudi news organisations. Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document For decades the US resident was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year.

Chanel sheds exotics skins in luxury first,"Chanel has become the first luxury fashion house in the world to stop using exotic animal skins, like snake, crocodile, lizard and stingray. The company's head of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said it had become harder to source such pelts ethically. He also included fur in the list, of which Chanel uses little. Although Chanel's designer Karl Lagerfeld insisted the move was made independently, animals rights groups hailed the decision.

Russia breaching missile treaty - Nato,"Russia denies building missiles that violate the accord Western military alliance Nato has formally accused Russia of breaching the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which banned land-based nuclear missiles in Europe. Following a meeting,Nato foreign ministers issued a statement supporting US accusations of Russian violations,external. The US has threatened to withdraw from the treaty because of Russian actions. Russia denied being in breach of the INF deal, saying it ""strictly abides"" by its conditions. The deal banned ground-launched medium-range missiles with a range of 500-5,500km (310-3,400 miles). ""Allies have concluded that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security,"" the Nato foreign ministers' statement reads. ""We strongly support the finding of the United States that Russia is in material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty. ""We call on Russia to return urgently to full and verifiable compliance. It is now up to Russia to preserve the INF Treaty."" Nato 'not planning more missiles in Europe' Russia denies breaking missile treaty Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles The new medium-range missile that the US - and now Nato - accuse Russian of deploying would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice. Analysts say Russia sees such weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces. Speaking after the Nato statement was issued, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russia had 60 days to return to compliance with the treaty, after which time the US would suspend its own compliance. ""During this 60 days we will still not test or produce or deploy any systems, and we'll see what happens during this 60-day period,"" he said. ""We've talked to the Russians a great deal. We're hopeful they'll change course, but there's been no indication to date that they have any intention of doing so."" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted by Interfax news agency as responding: ""Russia strictly abides by the provisions of the [INF] treaty, and the American side knows this."" By defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus, at Nato HQ in Brussels The INF Treaty was a high-point for Cold War arms control in that it abolished a whole category of land-based missiles. But for several years now the US has been increasingly concerned at what it says are Russian efforts to breach the agreement. Russia, the Americans claim, has now deployed multiple battalions of new missiles threatening targets in Europe. And they have now decided enough is enough, giving Moscow a clear deadline of 60 days to come back into compliance or the US will itself cease to honour its terms. Nato allies here share Washington's concerns and have backed the US position, thankful perhaps that it includes this short grace period during which Russia might change its mind. But the chances of that are slim. And the fear is that the collapse of the INF agreement could help to unravel the whole system of arms control treaties, which have been so important in maintaining strategic stability. In 2014,then US President Barack Obama accused Russia of breaching the INF Treatyafter it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile. He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race. The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles. His administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF Treaty in 1987 Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed Both countries were allowed to inspect the other's installations In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 Nato 'not planning more missiles in Europe' Putin warns Europe on hosting US missiles Gorbachev warns on US nuclear treaty plan US to leave nuclear treaty with Russia Russia denies breaking missile treaty US: Russia 'violated missile treaty' Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"iPhone artist Prodger wins Turner PrizeCharlotte Prodger wins the Â£25,000 art award for a highly personal film shot entirely on her phone.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Turner prize winner Charlotte Prodger: 'I wouldn't be in this room without public funding' A highly personal film shot by artist Charlotte Prodger on her iPhone, which recalls her experiences of coming out as gay in rural Scotland, has won her the prestigious Â£25,000 Turner Prize. The Glasgow-based artist, known for exploring queer identity, won the annual art award for two of her videos. One of those, titled Bridgit, was filmed entirely on her phone and features her reading from her diaries. Prodger said she was ""quite overwhelmed"" and ""very touched"" to win. ""The stories that I'm telling, although they're mine and they're personal, are stories that a lot of people - I guess queer people - have experienced,"" she told BBC News. This video can not be played iPhones, identity and independence: Why Charlotte Prodger won the Turner Prize The award caps a good year for the 44-year-old, who has also been chosen to represent Scotland at the 2019 Venice Biennale. The judges said they ""admired the painterly quality of Bridgit and the attention it paid to art history"". Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the jury, said the winning artwork ""seems to make a lot of points for a younger generation"". He said: ""It deals with gender as unfixed, as something fluid, as something not always conforming to society's norms."" Charlotte Prodger's film Bridgit captures many of the themes of contemporary life. In her thoughtful, poetic meditation, she explores identity, gender, nationhood and how our subjective views can change. All of which is encapsulated in one film, shot rough and ready in fragments on an iPhone. It would have been impossible to make when the Turner Prize was first awarded in 1984. But it's now within the grasp of anybody with a smartphone and a story to tell. Bridgit is named after the Neolithic deity, while the other video in Prodger's winning exhibition is titled Stoneymollan Trail and traces a history of recent video formats and the artist's personal history. For the first time in the prize's history, all four artists were nominated for films, and the shortlist was also regarded as the most political ever. That political theme continued at the award ceremony itself, where Tate director Maria Balshaw used her speech to bemoan the pressures on students and schools that have led to a ""steady decline in the number of students who are enrolling for arts subjects"". She told the audience: ""It is not good enough - not good enough for young people, and not good enough for the future that we should wish for, for this country and the world"". Prodger worked on her film Bridgit over the course of a year The number of students taking GCSEs in subjects covering arts, design, media and performance have declined by around a quarter over the past five years. In her acceptance speech, Prodger also spoke in support of arts education and funding. ""I wouldn't be in this room were it not for the public funding that I received from Scotland for free higher education, and then later in the form of artist bursaries and grants to support not only the production of work but also living costs,"" she said. Turner Prize tries to make sense of our mad world Balshaw also talked about the recent arrest of artists in Cuba including Tania Bruguera, whocreated Tate Modern's current Turbine Hall commission. She said they were ""detained by Cuban authorities,externalwhile defending their right to creative freedom"".

Grindr cheat pharmacist guilty of murder,"Jessica Patel was found dead in the living room of the couple's home A pharmacist who strangled his wife with a Tesco bag so he could start a new life with his boyfriend has been found guilty of murder. Mitesh Patel, 37, denied killing Jessica, 34, and staging a burglary at the couple's home in Middlesbrough. Teesside Crown Court heard he had planned to claim a Â£2m life insurance payout and move to Australia with lover Dr Amit Patel. Jurors returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for three hours. He will be sentenced on Wednesday. Latest news and stories from the North East The two-week trial heard Patel had a series of affairs with men he met via the dating app Grindr. Patel had claimed he had returned home to find the couple's house burgled and his wife's wrists bound with duct tape. Mitesh Patel had claimed his wife was his ""best mate"" and he would not have harmed her But prosecutors said he had tied her up after injecting her with insulin. Nicholas Campbell QC said: ""The prosecution case was that a plastic shopping bag, ironically a Tesco Bag For Life, was used both as a ligature and to suffocate her."" Patel was secretly in a relationship with his ""soulmate"", a doctor who had emigrated to Sydney and with whom he hoped to bring up his and Jessica's IVF baby after her death. The jury heard Patel had made internet searches dating back years, including ""I need to kill my wife"", ""insulin overdose"", ""plot to kill my wife, do I need a co-conspirator?"", ""hiring hitman UK"" and ""how much methadone will kill you?"". Detectives used Patel's iPhone health app to help convict him, in what is thought to be a legal first in the UK. Motion processors in the phone keep track of a user's steps and when the device is taken upstairs. Grindr cheat 'lied' to murder police Pharmacist claims wife was 'best mate' Murder accused 'killed wife with Tesco bag' Data on the app showed Patel went upstairs to ransack rooms in an attempt to stage a break-in after he had strangled his wife in the living room. It also showed that after he returned from a shopping trip that night, he went upstairs after pretending to find his wife's body in order to hide a CCTV hard drive in a clothes-filled suitcase. Mr Justice Goss told the jury a life sentence was mandatory and he would determine Patel's minimum term behind bars. In a statement, Mrs Patel's family said they had been ""devastated"" by her death. They said: ""She had simple dreams, all she ever wanted was to fall in love, have a family of her own and live happily ever after. ""The man we welcomed into our family, who promised to look after and protect her, betrayed her in every sense of the word, cheating her of her dreams, robbing her of her life and robbing us of her."" The house was ransacked to make it look as if there had been a burglary Following the verdict, Det Ch Insp Matt Murphy-King said evidence had emerged to show Patel ""had researched and planned Jess's death for a number of years"". Staging the burglary was ""one of the many lies which Mitesh spun to conceal his guilt and devious lifestyle"", he said. ""Whilst nothing can be done to bring Jess back or lessen the pain and suffering caused to Jess's family, I sincerely hope that by bringing Mitesh Patel to justice for his despicable crime it at least brings some solace to them.""

"Rare white reindeer spotted in NorwayPhotographer Mads Nordsvee describes the sighting as a ""fairytale moment"".Europe","The rare animal's appearance is caused by a genetic mutation A Norwegian photographer has shared images of a rare white reindeer calf he encountered while hiking with friends. Mads Nordsveen, 24, from Oslo, said he spotted the animal in the snow on a walk in northern Norway. The images, where the animal almost fades into the landscape, has now been liked almost 20,000 times since they were posted on Monday. Sharing the images on Instagram, the photographer commented: ""He almost disappeared into the snow!"" White reindeers are considered very rare. In 2016a white stag was spotted on a road side in Mala, in northern Sweden,external. Their unusual appearance is caused by a genetic condition that strips the pigment from their fur, but not albinism. According to some Scandinavian traditions, spotting a white reindeer is considered a sign of good luck. Mr Nordsveen said it was almost like the animal ""posed"" for him and his friends Mr Nordsveen told the Caters news agency he spotted the ""small, wonderful creature"" while walking out in the mountains. ""He came to me very close and we looked into each other's eyes. He was very calm when he saw that I did not have bad intentions,"" the photographer said. ""He behaved as if he was posing for my photos... he was very curious and funny, like a little explorer"" The animal reportedly left him and his friends after a few minutes, when he returned to his mother at the edge of the forest. Mr Nordsveen has described the encounter as ""very magical"" and a ""fairytale moment"".

He said: ""My wife had thought long and hard about having this procedure done. ""It was not a decision made lightly by either of us, but it was her dream and I supported her in it.

Einstein's 'God letter' sells for $2.9m,"The letter is regarded as a clear statement of Einstein's religious beliefs A handwritten letter by Albert Einstein in which he grapples with the concept of religion has smashed predictions and sold for nearly $2.9m (Â£2.3m). The so-called ""God letter"" was written in 1954 and was expected to fetch $1.5m (Â£1.2m) at auction in New York. The Nobel Prize-winning scientist, then 74, wrote the one-and-a-half page note to German philosopher Eric Gutkind in response to one of his works. It is seen as a key statement in the debate between science and religion. ""This remarkably candid, private letter was written a year before Einstein's death and remains the most fully articulated expression of his religious and philosophical views,"" a statement from Christie's says. It fetched almost double the auction house's predicted price of between $1m-1.5m. What you may not know about Einstein In the letter, written in his native German, Einstein takes issue with the belief in God. ""The word God is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weaknesses,"" he writes. ""The Bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends."" It continues: ""No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can [for me] change anything about this."" Albert Einstein pictured around the time he wrote the so-called ""God letter"" The physicist also muses on his own Jewish identity, writing that it is ""like all other religions, an incarnation of primitive superstition"". ""The Jewish people to whom I gladly belong, and in whose mentality I feel profoundly anchored, still for me does not have any different kind of dignity from all other peoples,"" he writes. Einstein's quirky habits The strange afterlife of Einstein's brain It is not the first time Einstein's letters have been put up for auction. Last year,a note written to an Italian chemistry student who had refused to meet him sold for $6,100. It was sold alongside a number of other letters from Einstein, including a 1928 note that went for $103,000, in which he set out his thoughts for his third stage of the theory of relativity. In 2017, a note in which he gave advice on happy living sold for $1.56m in Jerusalem.

Kuenssberg: MPs take control,"As MPs begin five days of debate on Theresa May's Brexit deal it looks like the prime minister faces the exact situation she called an election last year to try and avoid. Whether it is the decision on whether the government is in contempt of Parliament (in other words, in lots of embarrassing trouble for ignoring the demand to publish the full Brexit legal advice), or MPs asking for the right to tell ministers what to do if there is a second attempt by the government to get Theresa May's Brexit compromise deal through the Commons (the attempt by Dominic Grieve today, that could take 'no deal' off the table for good), or what seems now, the likely rejection of  Theresa May's agreement with the EU next week, those manoeuvres, those sub-plots in the Brexit drama, amount to one central thing - slowly but surely, Parliament grasping the levers of power - one might even say, taking back control. To use the posh term, it is the legislature trying to take over the executive, and this is what chills some spines in No 10. With MPs on the Tory benches as well as the opposition looking for ever more arcane ways of tying ministers up in knots, there is a sense whatever happens next Tuesday, what we are seeing is the gumming up of the government, maybe for good. For many MPs of course, this is a moment, if not to hang out the bunting, to take heart from Parliament's influence, to be reassured about its role, its ability not just to scrutinise legislation, but to make things happen, or more pertinently, to stop them taking place. Parliament Live: Rolling updates May prepares to open crunch Brexit debate Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? But remember, as one government insider put it this morning, ""there are no numbers FOR anything"" - in essence the idea that the Commons would be able to come together to agree anything quickly on behalf of the country seems optimistic in the extreme. They'd be able to agree that they should prevent a disorderly 'no deal' exit. The prominent Labour MP, Hilary Benn, is making a formal attempt to guarantee just that. But beyond that? If the government's plan falls, some MPs will certainly push for another referendum - but a majority for that seems out of reach for now. Some, and there is cross-party support, would try to argue for a Norway-style deal with close economic ties to the EU. There might, just about, be a majority for that. But that model would not see the UK have total control of its immigration policy. For many, but of course not all, Leave voters, that was the priority in the referendum. It's potentially therefore deeply problematic to go for such an arrangement. If voters partly voted Leave to demand more say over immigration, what message does Westminster send back to the electorate if they carve up a deal that simply does not do that? Of course MPs absolutely ought to be voting for what they believe is best, at this huge moment. Some of them may be spooked by the idea of turmoil, or at least on-going confusion. Many more are poised to make their objections count. But don't kid yourself that if Parliament takes charge of the process that the situation will become any clearer fast. By calling the election last year, this kind of Parliamentary mess was exactly what the prime minister was trying to avoid. She had a tiny majority then, and this would have been a hard fight in any case. But that historic gamble, that she tried and failed, has made this perhaps harder than she could have imagined. With no majority, even tiny numbers of MPs can make a huge amount of noise. PM seeks to reassure world leaders on Brexit What happens if MPs reject deal?

Mafia 'godfather' held in Sicily raid,"Settimo Mineo has been a senior mafioso for decades, authorities say Italian police have arrested the man said to be the new head of the Sicilian Mafia, along with 45 associates. The dawn raid in Palermo netted 80-year-old jeweller Settimo Mineo. He was reportedly elected Cosa Nostra godfather at a Mafia meeting in May. Italian media describe him as the successor to Toto Riina, who died in jail a year ago. The Mafia suspects are accused of extortion, firearms offences, arson and other crimes. The Sicilian Mafia - the Cosa Nostra - managed to rebuild its leadership, known as the Cupola, after it had not met for years, reports say. The godfather is also known as the ""capo dei capi"" - or boss of bosses. Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini tweeted that it was ""an extraordinary intervention"" by the Carabinieri (the paramilitary police), ""who have dismantled the new 'cupola' of Cosa Nostra"". Italian mafia: How crime families went global Rome police seize mafia luxury villas However, another of Mr Salvini's tweets this morning - discussingthe alleged arrest of 15 members of the ""Nigerian mafia"" in Turin,external- has drawn criticism. Turin magistrate Armando Spataro reportedly said thatMr Salvini's message threatened to disrupt the ongoing operation,externalin the city. Moreover, not all those arrested have links to organised crime, and 15 was not the correct number of people arrested, he said in a statement. The Sicilian Mafia raid is seen as a major success for Italy's police In recent years police have hit the Cosa Nostra network hard. It was long handicapped by the fact that Toto Riina was in jail, but when he died the Mafia moved to rebuild the cupola without taking orders from a ""godfather"". Mafia murders that brought down a European government Riina was notorious for his brutality. In 1992 two leading prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, were blown up in Mafia hits. Six months later Riina was arrested. Mineo allegedly ran Mafia operations in Pagliarelli, a central district in Palermo. Italian media report that he avoided using a mobile phone and preferred to walk rather than travel by car. Valued by Riina, he survived an ambush back in 1982 in which his brother Giuseppe died. Another brother, Antonino, was shot dead later. Mineo was arrested in 1984 on the orders of leading prosecutor Giovanni Falcone. Italian daily La Repubblica says he told his interrogators: ""I don't know who you're talking about, I fell from the clouds."" Mineo was jailed for five years in a big Mafia trial based on the Falcone investigation. In 1992, Falcone and another top prosecutor - Paolo Borsellino - were blown up in Mafia hits. Riina was arrested six months later. This video can not be played Riina is believed to have ordered more than 150 murders Mineo was rearrested in 2006 and spent another 11 years in jail. A well-known ""pentito"" (police informer), Tommaso Buscetta, is reported to have provided intelligence about him.

'I didn't know whitening teeth was illegal',"This video can not be played Brenda McFadyen says she didn't know she was breaking the law A woman convicted of illegally whitening people's teeth has told BBC Scotland she did not know what she was doing was against the law. The General Dental Council (GDC) says only registered dentists should carry out teeth whitening. But private companies offer training in how to oversee the procedure. Brenda McFadyen, from Clydebank, was fined Â£1,000 after she pled guilty to the illegal practice of dentistry at Glasgow Sheriff Court last month. The 63-year-old said she was angry that she had been prosecuted and she now wants to warn others not to get involved in offering teeth whitening products and services. Figures suggest one in eight Scots have had it done Celebrity culture and reality shows such as The Only Way is Essex have contributed to a big growth in the popularity of teeth whitening treatments. The procedure involves bleaching your teeth using a whitening product usually containing hydrogen peroxide. Figures suggest one in eight Scots have had their teeth whitened but it is against the law for anyone who is not registered with the GDC, which regulates the UK dental industry, to practise dentistry. It involves bleaching teeth using a whitening product But Ms McFadyen said she did not know she was doing something illegal until the police knocked on her door in Clydebank on a Saturday night earlier this year. ""I had been teeth whitening for three or four years. In my eyes I wasn't doing anything illegal but I had to go to court and plead guilty and I was hit with a Â£1,000 fine,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""It was just a bit of extra income. We are both retired, you're trying your best to get on in life. And at my age, this is what I've had to go through. ""They've taken my name and they've ruined it."" Ms McFadyen was prosecuted under the Dentists Act 1984 after the GDC employed private detectives to gather evidence that she was whitening teeth. The GDC told BBC Scotland it was protecting public safety. Head of criminal enforcement, Katie Spears, praised the fine handed to Ms McFadyen and said it reflected the ""seriousness"" of the offence. The GDC says the law in relation to teeth whitening is very clear Dentists use custom-made trays to apply the whitening product Dentists regularly carry out teeth whitening but private companies also train people in how to oversee the procedure. The GDC has not brought any cases against training companies but it has prosecuted 31 individuals across the UK this year. Ms Spears added: ""There are big training providers who try to mislead members of the public into signing up to their training courses and buying their equipment and they make claims which are simply not true. ""The law in relation to tooth whitening is very clear and the only way you can have it safely done is through a registered dentist."" Dentist Jaspal Purba says he has treated patients who have come to him with complications after having their teeth whitened It is unclear how many people are injured as a result of illegal teeth whitening and there is no suggestion that any of Ms McFadyen's clients were harmed. BBC Scotland spoke to the dental hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee where the most serious cases would be treated. None of them had any referrals in relation to teeth whitening in the past year. But dentist Jaspal Purba, from Bupa Dental Care, has treated patients who have come to him with complications. ""Allergies alone can be quite serious and can be life threatening if they begin to affect your airways,"" he said. ""I have seen a few cases of allergic reaction and swelling of the lips and the tongue. ""But the most common complications I have seen, if someone has not had a custom-made tray, is burns of the lining of the mouth and the gums."" Ms McFadyen said she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened and she wants to warn others against getting involved in teeth whitening. ""Nobody should be out doing this,"" she said. ""There will be someone out there who will come for them and they (the GDC) will come sooner rather than later.""

Rare white reindeer spotted in Norway,"The rare animal's appearance is caused by a genetic mutation A Norwegian photographer has shared images of a rare white reindeer calf he encountered while hiking with friends. Mads Nordsveen, 24, from Oslo, said he spotted the animal in the snow on a walk in northern Norway. The images, where the animal almost fades into the landscape, has now been liked almost 20,000 times since they were posted on Monday. Sharing the images on Instagram, the photographer commented: ""He almost disappeared into the snow!"" White reindeers are considered very rare. In 2016a white stag was spotted on a road side in Mala, in northern Sweden,external. Their unusual appearance is caused by a genetic condition that strips the pigment from their fur, but not albinism. According to some Scandinavian traditions, spotting a white reindeer is considered a sign of good luck. Mr Nordsveen said it was almost like the animal ""posed"" for him and his friends Mr Nordsveen told the Caters news agency he spotted the ""small, wonderful creature"" while walking out in the mountains. ""He came to me very close and we looked into each other's eyes. He was very calm when he saw that I did not have bad intentions,"" the photographer said. ""He behaved as if he was posing for my photos... he was very curious and funny, like a little explorer"" The animal reportedly left him and his friends after a few minutes, when he returned to his mother at the edge of the forest. Mr Nordsveen has described the encounter as ""very magical"" and a ""fairytale moment"".

Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit,"The case was heard by the full court of European judges last week The UK should be able to unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU, according to a top European law officer. The non-binding opinion was delivered by an advocate general of the European Court of Justice. A group of Scottish politicians has asked the court whether the UK can call off Brexit without the consent of other member states. The Court of Justice (ECJ) will deliver its final ruling at a later date. The advice from advocate general Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona,externalcomes as the House of Commons begins five days of debates on Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal, with a vote due to be held next Tuesday. In a written statement, the ECJ said Mr Campos Sanchez-Bordona's opinion was that if a country decided to leave the EU, it should also have the power to change its mind during the two-year exit process specified in Article 50 of the EU treaty. And it should be able to do so without needing the consent of the other 27 member states - contrary to what the EU itself has argued. May prepares to open crunch Brexit debate What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: A really simple guide While the advocate general's opinions are not binding, the court tends to follow them in the majority of its final rulings. The anti-Brexit politicians and campaigners who have brought the case hope it will give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve Mrs May's draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off Brexit - potentially through another referendum. The ECJ statement said the advocate general had proposed that the Court of Justice should ""declare that Article 50 allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU"". It added: ""That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March next year, but the deal negotiated with the EU has to be backed by a majority MPs if it is to come into force. Welcoming the advocate general's opinion, SNP MEP Alyn Smith, one of those who brought the case, said it showed that ""we now have a roadmap out of the Brexit shambles"". He said parliament was not necessarily facing a choice between accepting Mrs May's deal or leaving the EU with no deal, and that ""there are other options, and we can stop the clock."" A group of politicians brought the case including (from top left) Catherine Stihler MEP; Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP A cross-party group of politicians and campaigners including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler brought the case together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project. They initially took it to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which ultimately agreed to pass it to the ECJ. Two attempts by the UK government to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected, and the case was opposed by the government and the EU institutions in ahearing before all 27 ECJ judges last week. Can the UK parliament block Brexit? Hubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could create ""endless uncertainty"" by allowing countries to announce they are leaving the EU in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal. The UK government's lawyers argued that the case was purely hypothetical as ""the UK does not intend to revoke its notification"", and ECJ judges should therefore refuse to rule on it. They added that the politicians behind the case wanted to use it as ""political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK parliament"". The advocate general's opinion that the UK has the right to unilaterally withdraw Article 50 notification of its intention to leave the EU flies in the face of what the UK government and the EU want. Although the Advocate General's opinion is non-binding, the ECJ follow his opinions in the majority of cases. The whole issue of revocation remains hypothetical at present because the government has made it clear there is no possibility of seeking to revoke the notice to leave the EU. However, the statement raises the question of how the UK might revoke notification. It would almost certainly need to be done by an act of parliament. If it was done by ministers alone using prerogative powers it would frustrate the will of parliament as expressed in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. It should be noted that the statement and the case concerns revocation of notice to leave, and not a delay or extension of the two-year period provided for under Article 50. That period can be extended, but only with the agreement of all of the other 27 EU states. Whereas extension of the Article 50 period could become a political necessity, revocation of Article 50 remains something of an academic point at present. However, that would change if there was a second referendum in which the British people voted to remain in the EU.

BBC drop plans for Brexit TV debate,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn could debate the Brexit withdrawal agreement on TV this Sunday The BBC has dropped plans to hold a Brexit debate between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, saying it ""could not reach an agreement"" on its proposal. Both it and ITV offered to air a debate between the leaders on Sunday - two days before Parliament votes on Brexit. But Labour had said the BBC's proposed format was a ""mish-mash, with a lopsided panel of other politicians and public figures"" taking part. No 10 said Labour's objections were ""false and flimsy"". The BBC had wanted to include ""a range of voices"" in the programme, including members of other political parties, as well as a head-to-head between the leaders. The Downing Street spokesman said: ""We remain committed to holding a debate and will continue to press for a format that ensures a range of voices are heard alongside a substantial head to head."" Clash over who screens Brexit TV debate Ministers facing Brexit 'contempt' claims Laura Kuenssberg: Parliament 'taking back control' Several other parties had said they should be included in the debate -including the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens. ITV says ""invitations remain open"" to both leaders to hold a debate on the channel this Sunday. The news about the BBC debate came as MPs geared up to begin five days of debate in Parliament over the Brexit withdrawal agreement. The BBC said last Thursday that the prime minister had accepted its offer to take part in a debate on Sunday night and it was waiting to hear from the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn then told ITV's This Morning that he preferred ITV's offer - partly because it would not clash with the final of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! on the same evening. On Saturday, the BBC released a further statement, saying its proposal included both a head-to-head debate and ""an opportunity to hear from a wider range of voices"". And in a statement on Monday night, ITV said ""invitations remained open"" to both leaders for its straight head-to-head debate - it confirmed this was still the case after the BBC said it was pulling out. In a statement on Tuesday, the BBC said its proposed format had included: A head-to-head debate between the leaders A discussion between eight panellists with a wide range of views on Brexit - including other politicians A further head-to-head debate Closing statements from each leader ""We have been clear throughout the whole of this process that, as well as a substantive head-to-head debate, any programme we broadcast would need to include other voices, including other political parties, to reflect the wide range of views the public and parliamentarians hold about Brexit,"" it said. ""We believe ours was a fair and appropriate format for those taking part and, crucially, for our audiences around the country, and it is a shame we will not be able to bring them this programme."" Earlier on Tuesday, Labour criticised Mrs May and her team for choosing their ""preferred broadcaster"" for the debate. The party's spokesman said she ""running away from the scrutiny"" of a head-to-head with Mr Corbyn by accepting the format over ITV's. But a Downing Street spokesman in turn accused Mr Corbyn of ""running scared of proper scrutiny"". ""The prime minister issued the original challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for a head-to-head debate, and despite her flexibility on timing and format, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have done nothing but raise false and flimsy objections to the BBC's proposal.""

Triple child killer cleared for release,"David McGreavy was ""compliant and co-operative with authority"", a Parole Board report said A babysitter who killed three children and impaled their bodies on garden railings has been cleared for release. David McGreavy was sentenced to life in 1973 for killing Paul Ralph, four, and his sisters Dawn, two, and nine-month-old Samantha in their Worcester home. Their mother Elsie Urrytold The Sun,externalshe had ""begged"" that McGreavy, who is now in his late 60s, stay locked up. A Parole Board report said he ""changed considerably"" over 45 years in jail. The board confirmed a panel had directed his release following an oral hearing. McGreavy, who was dubbed the ""Monster of Worcester"", was the family's lodger and claimed he killed the children because one of them would not stop crying. He strangled Paul at the home in Gillam Street, Rainbow Hill, while Dawn was found with her throat cut. Samantha died from a compound fracture to the skull. McGreavy killed Paul Ralph, four, and his sisters Dawn, two, and nine-month-old Samantha Ms Urry, who has also been known as Dorothy,previously said he should never be released. She told the BBC two years agoshe regularly visited her children's graves in Worcester from her Hampshire home. Ms Urry said McGreavy, who was 21 when he was jailed, had been her husband's friend and stayed with them because he had fallen out with his parents. On the night of the killings he had babysat the children for up to an hour so she could work in a pub. Ms Urry said she needed to earn money as they were trying to buy a home. ""I just feel that people blame me for what happened because I was working that evening,"" she added. The children's mother, now called Elsie Urry, said McGreavy babysat for about an hour Ms Urry told The Sun after news he had been cleared for release: ""What this animal did to my children was every bit as bad as what the Moors Murderers did. ""He put my babies on spikes for God's sake - he mutilated them and they died in agony."" She was reassured after his trial ""his crime was so terrible he would never walk free again"" and now felt ""betrayed"". David McGreavy killed the three children in their Worcester home in 1973 A board document referred to a victim personal statement from Ms Urry ""setting out the devastating effect that these deaths had on her and still do have"". But it said McGreavy now had ""a considerable understanding of the problems that he has had and what caused them"". It added: ""The psychologist identified a number of factors which make it less likely that Mr McGreavy will reoffend in future. ""These included his improved self-control and the fact that Mr McGreavy has learnt to remain calm in stressful situations. ""A network of supportive friends in the community was also identified as a protective factor."" The possible release of McGreavy has been discussed by authorities for at least 10 years. 'Zombie warzone' at troubled jail Midwife murderer jailed for 17 years News and updates from the West Midlands Ian Kelcey, co-chair of the Law Society's criminal law committee, said he thought the parole board would have been ""extremely cautious in current climate post the John Worboys case to ensure this man [McGreavy] is safe to release"". He said the decision would likely have been made by a High Court judge or retired High Court judge, and added: ""My feeling is, I think we have to rely upon a trust on the parole board."" Rose Dixon, chief executive of the Support After Murder and Manslaughter charity, said the decision of the parole board would be taking the family back to ""the day of the murder"". ""It is a very traumatic experience to lose somebody through murder, and we have difficulty storing traumatic memories in the brain, so when an event like the parole board comes up or someone is coming up for release, it literally throws the family back.""

Moped takedown officer could be charged,"This video can not be played The Met say the drivers are specially trained and aim to end pursuits before riders or members of the public are injured A Met Police officer who knocked a teenager off a moped while employing a new ramming tactic could face criminal charges. The officer carried out the so-called tactical contact to stop the 17-year-old from riding dangerously. The boy, who was not wearing a helmet, was admitted to hospital with serious head injuries but later discharged. A decision is due over whether evidence gathered by the police watchdog should be passed to prosecutors. If he is prosecuted, the officer could be charged with actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm. The Met could also decide if there is a case to answer for misconduct, which could result in dismissal. The tactic of police officers using their vehicles to knock moped thieves off their bikes - even during high-speed pursuits - has proved controversial An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was launched after the crash in Eastern Way, Erith, at about 02:15 GMT on 7 November last year. The boy later pleaded guilty to five offences at youth court, including theft, dangerous driving, and driving without a licence. An IOPC spokesman said: ""Ultimately no police tactic can ever be used with impunity in a country where we police by consent - be that tactical contact, the use of firearms or the use of restraint. ""It is always a matter of whether it's reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances. ""But it would be wrong to offer guarantees in every case. Independent scrutiny is a vital part of public confidence in the way policing is done."" The Met has said it was ""actively targeting moped criminals"" The watchdog also confirmed it was investigating a second tactical contact case involving another Met officer where an adult was taken off his moped in Ealing, west London, last March. The tactic has been used 60 times since January by the Met in its fight against moped crime. The force said there had been three injuries following pursuits by officers but not all were due to tactical contact. The Met said it had self-referred all instances to the IOPC. Moped crime: How can you protect yourself? My life behind the wheel, by police pursuit driver London moped crime hotspots: check your area Senior officers have defended the use of tactical contact, saying it was needed to stop dangerous chases and has helped reduce moped crime in London by more than a third. The manoeuvre has also been backed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who said a ""robust"" response was needed from police to what she described as a growing problem of people using mopeds to commit crimes such as bag and phone-snatching. But Labour has raised concerns about the approach, which shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said was ""potentially very dangerous"".

Rail firm forced to spend ÃÂ£15m after chaos,"Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) must contribute Â£15m towards improvements in services for rail passengers and will make no profit in 2018, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. The company has already spent a similar amount in passenger compensation after chaos following May's new timetables. The DfT said: ""Performance after the May timetable change was unacceptable."" MPs also said that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling should have been more proactive in preventing the problems. In a scathing report on May's timetable changes, the Transport Committee said ""genuine change"" was needed to restore trust in the railways. Although Mr Grayling had not been fully informed, this could not absolve him of all responsibility, the MPs said. It was extraordinary that no-one took charge of the situation, they said. Mr Grayling admitted mistakes had been made, tellingthe BBC's Today programme:""I accept responsibility for myself and my department not asking tough enough questions."" But he added: ""At no point did I get the information that I would have needed to intervene."" Northern trains axed amid timetable 'carnage' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes Trains chaos: What's really going on? 'Nobody took charge' in timetable chaos The DfT decided not to strip GTR - which is 65%-owned by UK transport company Go-Ahead - of the franchise, because it said that would ""cause further and undue disruption for passengers, and is not an appropriate course of action"". But its sanctions on the company mean it will make a reduced profit for the rest of its time in charge. The DfT said it would continue to monitor the performance of GTR, ""particularly during the upcoming December timetable change"". ""These measures do not make GTR immune from further sanctions in the event of any subsequent failure to perform."" In the middle of May, passengers suffered delays and cancellations after the biggest timetable change in a generation. The upgrade - which involved changes to 46% of train times - mainly affected Northern trains and GTR routes into London. Over several weeks, GTR and Northern cancelled up to 470 and 310 scheduled trains respectively each weekday. And in July, it was announced that a timetable overhaul planned for December had been scaled back. Labour MP for Middlesbrough, Andy McDonald, and Tim Farron, Lib Dem MP for South Lakes, have both called for Northern to be stripped of its franchise. Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent And so the punishment lands, although the ""p-word"" in this context is a touch misleading. In reality, GTR and the government have been locked in long protracted negotiations. Yes, GTR was largely to blame for the chaos inflicted on thousands of its passengers. But Chris Grayling's government department is partly culpable too. The other caveat is the fact that GTR's franchising agreement was set up to be fundamentally different to most others as its ticket revenue goes to the government, not to itself. GTR is paid a ""management fee"" for running the franchise and can earn above and beyond that if its trains run on time and passengers are happy. As passengers were, understandably, hopping mad, the announcement the company will make no profit this year feels slightly hollow. Their profits being capped in subsequent years is more significant. The government calls the action ""robust"", but in reality this is the best it could achieve given the complexities of the contracts and rail system itself. And the timing of the announcement, on the day Chris Grayling faces criticism from MPs, is more than convenient. Changes to the national rail timetable happen each May and December and are often relatively minor tweaks. But last May, after major infrastructure works, a far bigger timetable overhaul was introduced, involving 43,200 individual changes and affecting 46% of passenger services. MPs said its implementation was chaotic and resulted in inconvenient, costly and potentially dangerous disruption for passengers. The chaos was partly caused by the ""astonishing complexity"" of a fragmented railway in which inter-related private train companies, operating on publicly-owned and managed infrastructure, have competing commercial interests, the report said. It concluded that no-one took charge. Mr Grayling had the ultimate authority to judge trade-offs between competing commercial interests and he should have been more proactive, the report said. ""There was extraordinary complacency about protecting the interests of passengers, who were very badly let down,"" said committee chairwoman Lilian Greenwood. MPs say the rail timetabling process requires genuinely independent oversight Last week's announcement thatrail fares will increase by an average of 3.1% next yearadded ""insult to passengers' injury"", said Ms Greenwood. Mr Grayling has announced a year-long independent rail review, chaired by Keith Williams, deputy chairman of John Lewis Partnership and former chief executive of British Airways. But MPs said passengers cannot wait that long for lessons to be learned and reforms implemented.

LiveMPs Brexit debate,"MPs continued debating the government's Brexit deal, ahead of vote next Tuesday Thursday's debate focused on the economic impact of the agreement Commons business began with questions to Brexit ministers House of Lords also debated the Brexit deal this afternoon Sophie Morris, Ryan Brown and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. Sir Graham Brady ""would welcome"" a delay in the Brexit vote if it would help resolve MPs' concerns. House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage today, as MPs complete their third day of debate on the withdrawal agreement. Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire is now introducing his adjournment debate on the illegal trade in seahorses in the UK. MPs are due to continue their debate on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament International Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the ""status quo has never been on offer"" as the EU ""wants an ever closer union"". ""We have to find a compromise that makes this workable,"" he says, adding: ""the withdrawal agreement achieves just that, and is the only deal on the table"". DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes to says the ""gallows are being built"" for the deal ahead of Tuesday's planned vote - and asks if there have been discussions about delaying it. Liam Fox replies says ministers will ""continue to make the case"" for the deal, but adds: ""the government will want to talk to members, of course it will want to look to ways to give a reassurance"". He says ""I understand why MPs have concerns about the backstop, but it is clear that it is there to be a temporary measure"". Liam Fox says Labour is ""playing politics at a time of great national decision-making"", and their Brexit policy is ""ill-researched and delusional"". He says that by agreeing to hold to the referendum, Parliament ""sub-contracted its sovereignty"" to voters, and MPs must now ""live up to our side of the bargain"".  Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up the debate for Labour, shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner says the government has ""tried to exclude Parliament from the process at all stages"". ""This is a deal that members on all sides now believe is not in the best interest of the country,"" he says. Mr Gardiner says the UK will be ""much poorer than we otherwise would be"" under the government's agreement. He calls on Liam Fox to be ""yet more flexible still"" on the next steps for Brexit, and ""recall his own words"" given to a Sunday newspaper in 2012. Back then, he says, Mr Fox called for the UK to renegotiate a ""new relationship"" with the EU, based on ""an economic partnership involving a customs union and the single market in goods and services"". ""The secretary of state may not like it, but it sounds an awful lot like Labour party policy to me"", he adds. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Like other MPs today, the DUP's Jim Shannon picks up on the proposed 'backstop' plan for the Irish border in the government's deal. He says there is ""no legal form for leaving this international treaty without consent"", adding that this is ""not acceptable"". He says the people of Northern Ireland must stand up for themselves and he has ""a mistrust for the government at this time"". ""The government have voted for Northern Ireland to become a voiceless victim of the UK,"" he concludes. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Next up this evening is Labour MP Karen Lee - who was a Remainer in 2016 but her constituency of Lincoln voted to leave. She ""sincerely believes"" there is a Brexit deal that will benefit her constituents, she says. ""But this deal will not protect jobs, workplace rights or environmental standards, and it will inhibit business by failing to ensure frictionless trade"", she adds. ""We can renegotiate with the EU - or better still, hold a general election"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Vicky Ford - who used to be member of the European Parliament and voted Remain - says MPs need to respect the vote to leave. ""A second referendum would be even more divisive and no more decisive,"" she adds. Ms Ford says leaving the EU with no deal poses ""a huge risk"" and the withdrawal agreement helps real businesses remain secure and offers time to develop a future framework. She calls Labour's plan of ""a close relationship with the single market without being in it"" a ""fantasy land"". Ms Ford says the backstop plan is not a ""practical risk"", as remaining in the arrangement permanently ""is not in the EU's interest"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Andrew Bowie says many of his colleagues on the Conservative benches are still ""struggling to come to a conclusion"" on which way they will vote. He adds that he voted to leave the EU ""and supports the deal"". Mr Bowie says he backs the agreement ""as it is the best for business, his constituents and Scotland"". ""I believe this deal is better than what we have now,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman says the deal provides no certainty and there is no guarantee that a better one could be negotiated. Leaving without a deal on the other hand is not an option, she adds. The only other option is that MPs go back to the people and tell them the truth that ""we cannot leave the club and expect to keep all the benefits"". ""That is mission impossible"", she says. ""It is time for a people's vote"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Lee Rowley says ""we are arguing over commas in this deal, when whole paragraphs of it do not work"", and for this reason he will not be backing the deal. ""I did not come to this place to make people poorer,"" he says. ""I cannot go back to my constituents and say this deal gives them Brexit - it does not"". He says he disagrees with the deal as it is ""a failure of nerve and ambition"", and calls for it to be stopped. Mr Rowley calls on the government ""to move the UK out of its shadow"" and ""get Brexit back on track"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says the Brexitlegal advicepublished this week shows Northern Ireland ""has been sold out"". The Brexit process has been ""blurred, botched and bungled from the very start"", he adds. Mr Singh Dhesi says the prime minister is ""not up to the task"" and ""has created division and discord"". The Conservatives must ""stand aside"" to allow a general election, he concludes. House of LordsParliament The debate on the government's Brexit deal has ended - and business in the House of Lords for today comes to an end. Peers will resume the debate on Monday. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of LordsParliament Wrapping up the Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Horam says the referendum result was ""a wake up call"". He says the withdrawal agreement is ""surprisingly good in the circumstances"", but Brexit is not the answer to the ""fundamental social problems"" that triggered the vote to leave. He does not expect the agreement to win Parliament's approval, he says, warning that if the decision is to be returned to the people the Remain side must do better. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative MP Maggie Throup says she will be supporting the government's Brexit deal next week ""if it stays the same"". She says another referendum would be ""undemocratic"". She calls for MPs to ""end the political games, and reflect on what the consequences of rejecting this deal will be"". ""This deal is in the public interest,"" she says. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Giles Watling, who voted Remain, says he was re-elected in his leave-voting constituency because his party pledged to ""deliver on their wishes"". The government's Brexit deal ""does tick so many of the boxes"", he says - but he adds that he still has ""serious concerns"" about the backstop. ""What has been the point of the last two years of uncertainty and pain"" he asks, if the UK is ""still under the dominion the European Court of Justice"". ""Best endeavours"" to negotiate a future relationship deal are ""not cast iron"", he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

Most adults living unhealthy lifestylesA survey in England suggests nearly 9 in 10 have at least one unhealthy trait such as smoking or drinking.HealthComments,"The overwhelming majority of adults in England are so unhealthy they put their lives at risk, a survey suggests. The data from the Health Survey for England showed nearly nine in 10 had at least one unhealthy trait. That was classed as those who smoke, drink more than 14 units of alcohol, eat fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables, are obese or have low rates of physical activity. Half of adults have two or more of these risk factors. Although there are signs some people are giving up some of the unhealthy traits. Parents give children alcohol 'too young' The cost of being unhealthy Britain 'needs to go on a diet' The survey,externalfrom NHS Digital has been published as the Office for National Statistics revealed the latest death rates linked to alcohol. In 2017, nearly 7,700 people died in the UK from alcohol-specific causes - where the death was wholly attributable. That is the equivalent to 12.2 deaths per 100,000 people - the highest rate since 2008. Of the four UK nations, Scotland had the highest rate. The annual survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles. For the first time, it has compared the lifestyles of children with their parents. It suggested children who have obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. Some 28% of children of an obese mother were also obese, compared with 8% of children whose mother was a healthy weight. Meanwhile, 24% of children of an obese father were also obese, compared with 9% of children where the father was not overweight or obese. Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the findings highlighted the need to tackle the ""increasingly obesogenic environments"". ""Children today are bombarded by promotions for unhealthy food and drinks in stores and on the high street and exposed to countless junk food adverts online and during the TV programmes they watch most."" Yes. Cigarette use is falling. In 1993 27% of adults were smokers, last year it was down to 17% with growing numbers turning to vaping. Drinking alcohol to excess is also down. It means the most common unhealthy lifestyle trait is low fruit and vegetable consumption. Although there are high levels of unhealthy lifestyles, around four in 10 adults have no signs of ill-health developing yet. This was classed as conditions such as high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels. There are also strong signs that children are becoming healthier - or at least demonstrating less risky behaviours. Last year just 5% of eight to 15-year-olds had tried smoking, down from 19% in 1997. The numbers trying alcohol have dropped from 45% in 2003 to 14% in 2017.

Odeon defends Â£40 cinema pricesOdeon is re-opening a famous London cinema but fans are angry at the prices it plans to charge.Technology,"The newly refurbished Odeon Leicester Square opens later this month Odeon has responded to criticism over the prices it is charging for seats at its new hi-tech cinema in London, where tickets will cost up to Â£40. It told the BBC the prices were similar to tickets for theatre or live sports. The newly refurbished Odeon Leicester Square will re-open later this month, showing Mary Poppins Returns. It has had a multi-million pound facelift in partnership with Dolby, which is providing cutting-edge audio-visual technology. ""With tickets starting at just Â£10 for every show... it offers fantastic value compared to tickets for other popular destinations like the theatre, concerts or live sports,"" Odeon said in a statement. ""Price choices vary and flex depending on a number of factors including seat type and location in the auditorium, what we're showing, time of day, and the number of people booking at one time. ""The first week of the biggest film of the year during the festive season is obviously peak, and guests can expect prices will flex throughout the year."" Cinema-goers were less than impressed with many taking to Twitter to express anger over the inflated prices. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Einstein's 'God letter' to be auctioned,"The letter is regarded as a clear statement of Einstein's religious beliefs A handwritten letter by Albert Einstein in which he grapples with the concept of religion has smashed predictions and sold for nearly $2.9m (Â£2.3m). The so-called ""God letter"" was written in 1954 and was expected to fetch $1.5m (Â£1.2m) at auction in New York. The Nobel Prize-winning scientist, then 74, wrote the one-and-a-half page note to German philosopher Eric Gutkind in response to one of his works. It is seen as a key statement in the debate between science and religion. ""This remarkably candid, private letter was written a year before Einstein's death and remains the most fully articulated expression of his religious and philosophical views,"" a statement from Christie's says. It fetched almost double the auction house's predicted price of between $1m-1.5m. What you may not know about Einstein In the letter, written in his native German, Einstein takes issue with the belief in God. ""The word God is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weaknesses,"" he writes. ""The Bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends."" It continues: ""No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can [for me] change anything about this."" Albert Einstein pictured around the time he wrote the so-called ""God letter"" The physicist also muses on his own Jewish identity, writing that it is ""like all other religions, an incarnation of primitive superstition"". ""The Jewish people to whom I gladly belong, and in whose mentality I feel profoundly anchored, still for me does not have any different kind of dignity from all other peoples,"" he writes. Einstein's quirky habits The strange afterlife of Einstein's brain It is not the first time Einstein's letters have been put up for auction. Last year,a note written to an Italian chemistry student who had refused to meet him sold for $6,100. It was sold alongside a number of other letters from Einstein, including a 1928 note that went for $103,000, in which he set out his thoughts for his third stage of the theory of relativity. In 2017, a note in which he gave advice on happy living sold for $1.56m in Jerusalem. A single sentence, it reads: ""A calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it."" Einstein - but not the one you think.

BBC pulls out of Brexit TV debate,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn could debate the Brexit withdrawal agreement on TV this Sunday The BBC has dropped plans to hold a Brexit debate between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, saying it ""could not reach an agreement"" on its proposal. Both it and ITV offered to air a debate between the leaders on Sunday - two days before Parliament votes on Brexit. But Labour had said the BBC's proposed format was a ""mish-mash, with a lopsided panel of other politicians and public figures"" taking part. No 10 said Labour's objections were ""false and flimsy"". The BBC had wanted to include ""a range of voices"" in the programme, including members of other political parties, as well as a head-to-head between the leaders. The Downing Street spokesman said: ""We remain committed to holding a debate and will continue to press for a format that ensures a range of voices are heard alongside a substantial head to head."" Clash over who screens Brexit TV debate Ministers facing Brexit 'contempt' claims Laura Kuenssberg: Parliament 'taking back control' Several other parties had said they should be included in the debate -including the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens. ITV says ""invitations remain open"" to both leaders to hold a debate on the channel this Sunday. The news about the BBC debate came as MPs geared up to begin five days of debate in Parliament over the Brexit withdrawal agreement. The BBC said last Thursday that the prime minister had accepted its offer to take part in a debate on Sunday night and it was waiting to hear from the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn then told ITV's This Morning that he preferred ITV's offer - partly because it would not clash with the final of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! on the same evening. On Saturday, the BBC released a further statement, saying its proposal included both a head-to-head debate and ""an opportunity to hear from a wider range of voices"". And in a statement on Monday night, ITV said ""invitations remained open"" to both leaders for its straight head-to-head debate - it confirmed this was still the case after the BBC said it was pulling out. In a statement on Tuesday, the BBC said its proposed format had included: A head-to-head debate between the leaders A discussion between eight panellists with a wide range of views on Brexit - including other politicians A further head-to-head debate Closing statements from each leader ""We have been clear throughout the whole of this process that, as well as a substantive head-to-head debate, any programme we broadcast would need to include other voices, including other political parties, to reflect the wide range of views the public and parliamentarians hold about Brexit,"" it said. ""We believe ours was a fair and appropriate format for those taking part and, crucially, for our audiences around the country, and it is a shame we will not be able to bring them this programme."" Earlier on Tuesday, Labour criticised Mrs May and her team for choosing their ""preferred broadcaster"" for the debate. The party's spokesman said she ""running away from the scrutiny"" of a head-to-head with Mr Corbyn by accepting the format over ITV's. But a Downing Street spokesman in turn accused Mr Corbyn of ""running scared of proper scrutiny"". ""The prime minister issued the original challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for a head-to-head debate, and despite her flexibility on timing and format, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have done nothing but raise false and flimsy objections to the BBC's proposal.""

Kuenssberg: MPs taking control?,"As MPs begin five days of debate on Theresa May's Brexit deal it looks like the prime minister faces the exact situation she called an election last year to try and avoid. Whether it is the decision on whether the government is in contempt of Parliament (in other words, in lots of embarrassing trouble for ignoring the demand to publish the full Brexit legal advice), or MPs asking for the right to tell ministers what to do if there is a second attempt by the government to get Theresa May's Brexit compromise deal through the Commons (the attempt by Dominic Grieve today, that could take 'no deal' off the table for good), or what seems now, the likely rejection of  Theresa May's agreement with the EU next week, those manoeuvres, those sub-plots in the Brexit drama, amount to one central thing - slowly but surely, Parliament grasping the levers of power - one might even say, taking back control. To use the posh term, it is the legislature trying to take over the executive, and this is what chills some spines in No 10. With MPs on the Tory benches as well as the opposition looking for ever more arcane ways of tying ministers up in knots, there is a sense whatever happens next Tuesday, what we are seeing is the gumming up of the government, maybe for good. For many MPs of course, this is a moment, if not to hang out the bunting, to take heart from Parliament's influence, to be reassured about its role, its ability not just to scrutinise legislation, but to make things happen, or more pertinently, to stop them taking place. Parliament Live: Rolling updates May prepares to open crunch Brexit debate Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? But remember, as one government insider put it this morning, ""there are no numbers FOR anything"" - in essence the idea that the Commons would be able to come together to agree anything quickly on behalf of the country seems optimistic in the extreme. They'd be able to agree that they should prevent a disorderly 'no deal' exit. The prominent Labour MP, Hilary Benn, is making a formal attempt to guarantee just that. But beyond that? If the government's plan falls, some MPs will certainly push for another referendum - but a majority for that seems out of reach for now. Some, and there is cross-party support, would try to argue for a Norway-style deal with close economic ties to the EU. There might, just about, be a majority for that. But that model would not see the UK have total control of its immigration policy. For many, but of course not all, Leave voters, that was the priority in the referendum. It's potentially therefore deeply problematic to go for such an arrangement. If voters partly voted Leave to demand more say over immigration, what message does Westminster send back to the electorate if they carve up a deal that simply does not do that? Of course MPs absolutely ought to be voting for what they believe is best, at this huge moment. Some of them may be spooked by the idea of turmoil, or at least on-going confusion. Many more are poised to make their objections count. But don't kid yourself that if Parliament takes charge of the process that the situation will become any clearer fast. By calling the election last year, this kind of Parliamentary mess was exactly what the prime minister was trying to avoid. She had a tiny majority then, and this would have been a hard fight in any case. But that historic gamble, that she tried and failed, has made this perhaps harder than she could have imagined. With no majority, even tiny numbers of MPs can make a huge amount of noise. PM seeks to reassure world leaders on Brexit What happens if MPs reject deal?

Rail firm forced to spend Â£15m after chaos,"Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) must contribute Â£15m towards improvements in services for rail passengers and will make no profit in 2018, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. The company has already spent a similar amount in passenger compensation after chaos following May's new timetables. The DfT said: ""Performance after the May timetable change was unacceptable."" MPs also said that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling should have been more proactive in preventing the problems. In a scathing report on May's timetable changes, the Transport Committee said ""genuine change"" was needed to restore trust in the railways. Although Mr Grayling had not been fully informed, this could not absolve him of all responsibility, the MPs said. It was extraordinary that no-one took charge of the situation, they said. Mr Grayling admitted mistakes had been made, tellingthe BBC's Today programme:""I accept responsibility for myself and my department not asking tough enough questions."" But he added: ""At no point did I get the information that I would have needed to intervene."" Northern trains axed amid timetable 'carnage' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes Trains chaos: What's really going on? 'Nobody took charge' in timetable chaos The DfT decided not to strip GTR - which is 65%-owned by UK transport company Go-Ahead - of the franchise, because it said that would ""cause further and undue disruption for passengers, and is not an appropriate course of action"". But its sanctions on the company mean it will make a reduced profit for the rest of its time in charge. The DfT said it would continue to monitor the performance of GTR, ""particularly during the upcoming December timetable change"". ""These measures do not make GTR immune from further sanctions in the event of any subsequent failure to perform."" In the middle of May, passengers suffered delays and cancellations after the biggest timetable change in a generation. The upgrade - which involved changes to 46% of train times - mainly affected Northern trains and GTR routes into London. Over several weeks, GTR and Northern cancelled up to 470 and 310 scheduled trains respectively each weekday. And in July, it was announced that a timetable overhaul planned for December had been scaled back. Labour MP for Middlesbrough, Andy McDonald, and Tim Farron, Lib Dem MP for South Lakes, have both called for Northern to be stripped of its franchise. Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent And so the punishment lands, although the ""p-word"" in this context is a touch misleading. In reality, GTR and the government have been locked in long protracted negotiations. Yes, GTR was largely to blame for the chaos inflicted on thousands of its passengers. But Chris Grayling's government department is partly culpable too. The other caveat is the fact that GTR's franchising agreement was set up to be fundamentally different to most others as its ticket revenue goes to the government, not to itself. GTR is paid a ""management fee"" for running the franchise and can earn above and beyond that if its trains run on time and passengers are happy. As passengers were, understandably, hopping mad, the announcement the company will make no profit this year feels slightly hollow. Their profits being capped in subsequent years is more significant. The government calls the action ""robust"", but in reality this is the best it could achieve given the complexities of the contracts and rail system itself. And the timing of the announcement, on the day Chris Grayling faces criticism from MPs, is more than convenient. Changes to the national rail timetable happen each May and December and are often relatively minor tweaks. But last May, after major infrastructure works, a far bigger timetable overhaul was introduced, involving 43,200 individual changes and affecting 46% of passenger services. MPs said its implementation was chaotic and resulted in inconvenient, costly and potentially dangerous disruption for passengers. The chaos was partly caused by the ""astonishing complexity"" of a fragmented railway in which inter-related private train companies, operating on publicly-owned and managed infrastructure, have competing commercial interests, the report said. It concluded that no-one took charge. Mr Grayling had the ultimate authority to judge trade-offs between competing commercial interests and he should have been more proactive, the report said. ""There was extraordinary complacency about protecting the interests of passengers, who were very badly let down,"" said committee chairwoman Lilian Greenwood. MPs say the rail timetabling process requires genuinely independent oversight Last week's announcement thatrail fares will increase by an average of 3.1% next yearadded ""insult to passengers' injury"", said Ms Greenwood. Mr Grayling has announced a year-long independent rail review, chaired by Keith Williams, deputy chairman of John Lewis Partnership and former chief executive of British Airways. But MPs said passengers cannot wait that long for lessons to be learned and reforms implemented. They recommend: Establishing effective independent oversight of the next national rail timetable changes Worst-affected 2018 season ticket holders should receive a discount on 2019 season tickets Effective contingency plans for disabled passengers and stringent enforcement Automated or automatic compensation schemes. Govia Thameslink Railway chief executive Patrick Verwer says services are now more reliable Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, described the report as ""devastating"" and laid the blame on the ""disastrous fragmentation of our railways"" as well as Mr Grayling. Anthony Smith, chief executive of watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""This industry knows it must deliver a smooth set of changes when the next round of timetable changes takes effect this Sunday. ""They must show they've learned lessons after a torrid summer of timetable crisis, and are acting to improve performance."" GTR chief executive Patrick Verwer said the firm had already processed compensation claims for 68,000 season ticket-holders, with the deadline for claims extended to 31 January 2019. He said: ""Since July, services on Thameslink and Great Northern have become more stable and reliable."" Are you a GTR passenger? Where would you like to see the improvement money spent?

Grindr cheat pharmacist guilty of murderMitesh Patel planned to cash in Â£2m from his wife's death to move to Australia with his boyfriend.Tees,"Jessica Patel was found dead in the living room of the couple's home A pharmacist who strangled his wife with a Tesco bag so he could start a new life with his boyfriend has been found guilty of murder. Mitesh Patel, 37, denied killing Jessica, 34, and staging a burglary at the couple's home in Middlesbrough. Teesside Crown Court heard he had planned to claim a Â£2m life insurance payout and move to Australia with lover Dr Amit Patel. Jurors returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for three hours. He will be sentenced on Wednesday. Latest news and stories from the North East The two-week trial heard Patel had a series of affairs with men he met via the dating app Grindr. Patel had claimed he had returned home to find the couple's house burgled and his wife's wrists bound with duct tape. Mitesh Patel had claimed his wife was his ""best mate"" and he would not have harmed her But prosecutors said he had tied her up after injecting her with insulin. Nicholas Campbell QC said: ""The prosecution case was that a plastic shopping bag, ironically a Tesco Bag For Life, was used both as a ligature and to suffocate her."" Patel was secretly in a relationship with his ""soulmate"", a doctor who had emigrated to Sydney and with whom he hoped to bring up his and Jessica's IVF baby after her death. The jury heard Patel had made internet searches dating back years, including ""I need to kill my wife"", ""insulin overdose"", ""plot to kill my wife, do I need a co-conspirator?"", ""hiring hitman UK"" and ""how much methadone will kill you?"". Detectives used Patel's iPhone health app to help convict him, in what is thought to be a legal first in the UK. Motion processors in the phone keep track of a user's steps and when the device is taken upstairs. Grindr cheat 'lied' to murder police Pharmacist claims wife was 'best mate' Murder accused 'killed wife with Tesco bag' Data on the app showed Patel went upstairs to ransack rooms in an attempt to stage a break-in after he had strangled his wife in the living room. It also showed that after he returned from a shopping trip that night, he went upstairs after pretending to find his wife's body in order to hide a CCTV hard drive in a clothes-filled suitcase. Mr Justice Goss told the jury a life sentence was mandatory and he would determine Patel's minimum term behind bars. In a statement, Mrs Patel's family said they had been ""devastated"" by her death. They said: ""She had simple dreams, all she ever wanted was to fall in love, have a family of her own and live happily ever after. ""The man we welcomed into our family, who promised to look after and protect her, betrayed her in every sense of the word, cheating her of her dreams, robbing her of her life and robbing us of her."" The house was ransacked to make it look as if there had been a burglary Following the verdict, Det Ch Insp Matt Murphy-King said evidence had emerged to show Patel ""had researched and planned Jess's death for a number of years"". Staging the burglary was ""one of the many lies which Mitesh spun to conceal his guilt and devious lifestyle"", he said. ""Whilst nothing can be done to bring Jess back or lessen the pain and suffering caused to Jess's family, I sincerely hope that by bringing Mitesh Patel to justice for his despicable crime it at least brings some solace to them.""

France U-turn after fuel tax rise protests,"Central Paris has seen vehicles burned, business premises damaged and hundreds of arrests Fuel tax rises which have led to weeks of violent protests in France have now been postponed for six months. The move was announced in a televised address by PM Edouard Philippe, who said anyone would have ""to be deaf or blind"" not to hear or see the anger. The protests have hit major cities, causing damage and disruption over the past three weekends. The ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protests have now grown to reflect more widespread anger at the government. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work The ""yellow vests"" are so called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. President Emmanuel Macron was elected last year with an overwhelming mandate for sweeping economic reform, but his popularity has fallen sharply in recent months amid accusations that he is a ""president for the rich"". Four people have died since the unrest began and the resulting violence and vandalism have been widely condemned. Mr Philippe said that the next planned rise in the so-called carbon tax on vehicle fuel, which had been due to come in on 1 January, would be suspended for six months to allow consultations across the country to see what accompanying measures might be introduced to ease the burden for the worst-off. He also said planned increases in gas and electricity prices this winter would be halted, and that a toughening of the rules for vehicle emissions tests would also be postponed. It is a major climbdown by the government of President Macron, who has said the measures are necessary to combat climate change and meet budget deficit reduction targets. Vandalism was rife during the protests in Paris, including here at the Arc de Triomphe ""This anger, you would have to be deaf and blind not to see it, nor hear it,"" said Mr Philippe after meeting lawmakers from the governing party La Republique en Marche. ""The French who have donned yellow vests want taxes to drop, and work to pay. That's also what we want. If I didn't manage to explain it, if the ruling majority didn't manage to convince the French, then something must change,"" he added in his televised address. ""No tax merits putting the unity of the nation in danger."" But he said the violence must stop. ""If there is another day of protests, it must be declared in advance and must take place calmly."" He also warned that people should not expect better public services alongside lower taxes. Mr Macron was elected on a platform of economic reform which would improve the lives of French people via lower unemployment and a kick-started economy. But many feel that has not emerged. An analysis of the 2018-19 budget carried out by France's public policy institute, for example, found that incomes for the poorest quarter of households would largely drop or stay the same under the plans. Middle-income earners would see a modest bump - but the greatest beneficiaries would be those who were already wealthy, in the top 1%. The pattern is worse for retired people - almost all of whom will be worse off. Mr Macron (L) had vowed not to capitulate to street protests By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Will it be enough? That is the first question. Will the yellow vests feel they have won a big enough concession from the government, and  therefore call off their protest? There are plenty of voices that can be heard today saying they want more. Why is it only a suspension of the tax rise, they ask, and not an abolition? What is to guarantee that the government won't reinstate it next June? Maybe we need to step up the pressure. But by making a concession, the government does not need to satisfy everyone. It needs only to satisfy a large enough bloc of ""moderates"" among the gilets jaunes, and wean them away from the barricades. If that happens, then the movement will lose momentum. And though it won't be over, the end will be in sight. My bet would be that this will be what happens. Opinion polls will show a general approval of the government's concession. The gilets jaunes en masse start to waver. But there's still a protest by hardliners on Saturday. Maybe a parting shot, but still - and maybe because of that - a dangerous moment. Read more from Hugh The first question is whether the concession will be enough to satisfy the protesters. Some have vowed to keep up a blockade at an oil depot in Lorient in the north-west of the country, and there have been calls for further demonstrations on Saturday. Yellow vest spokesman Benjamin Cauchy said the movement wanted a cancellation - not a postponement - of the taxes. ""The measures announced today do not satisfy us at all, for the simple reason they don't go far enough,"" he told reporter Chris Bockman in Toulouse. ""The French people want a complete political transformation. They want to change the way things have been for the last 30 years. ""We're sick and tired of taxes being raised and the quality of public services going down. There are more and more people out there who can't make ends meet each month, more and more people are sleeping rough and yet we continue to raise taxes. ""Where is the money going? Where is it being used?"" This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? Fears that violent protests in the capital could continue next weekend have led Paris St Germain to postpone their League 1 home football match on Saturday. PSG v Montpellier off at police request The ""gilets jaunes"" movement began as a protest against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by about 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s. Mr Macron has blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise, but said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol from 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw for the protesters. Protesters say Mr Macron is out of touch, particularly with non-city dwellers who rely on their cars. Changes affecting ambulance drivers are part of a raft of reforms by President Macron The movement has grown to reflect a range of grievances, including the marginalisation of rural areas, high living costs, and general anger at President Macron's economic policies. The protests have no identifiable leadership and gained momentum via social media, encompassing a range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and plenty of moderates in between. In recent days, ambulance drivers and students have launched their own protests. Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Who are France's 'yellow vests'?

Water bill 'too expensive' to flush toilet,"Shirley Widdop says her family has to ""ration"" the use of water - in a constant worry about bills and debts A disabled mother from Yorkshire says she is so worried about the cost of water that she sometimes has to miss out on washing or flushing the toilet. Shirley Widdop, from Keighley, whose bill, based on a water meter, has risen by 35%, says: ""It's outrageous and like something from the 1930s."" ""We shouldn't have to ration water."" A report on poverty from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that arrears for water bills are now the most common form of debt for the poorest families. ""I am on a water meter and because I'm on a low income I constantly worry about the bill being too high,"" says the 51-year-old, who lives with two of her children. She says it's embarrassing but wants to raise awareness for many other people in a similar situation ""who can't speak up for themselves"". The Consumer Council for Water, the watchdog for water consumers, says the number of people being put on to reduced rates for water bills, because they are struggling to pay, has risen by 50% in a year, to almost 400,000. Ms Widdop suffers from a disability, degenerative cervical myelopathy, which she says can cause incontinence. This becomes even more upsetting when she has to worry about the cost of water, when she wants the dignity of being able to ""clean herself up"". ""This is my everyday life. In a decent society, you should be able to wash when you want. ""Access to clean water should be a basic human right,"" she says. Her monthly water payments are going up from Â£21 to Â£31, which she says makes a big difference for people already on the financial brink. ""Any increase means having to cut back on other things - food or clothing,"" she says. Otherwise it means falling behind with bills and the anxiety of ""pressure, pressure, pressure from debt"". There is no choice of water company - so she says it means trying to cut down on consumption, such as flushing the toilet less often. ""It's basically a monopoly. Customers aren't first and foremost,"" she says. Thames Water faced a fine of Â£120m this year for poor management of leaks It could have got much worse, says Ms Widdop. Last year, her boiler had been leaking into a wall cavity - and the amount of water lost gave her a water bill of Â£700. She says her water supplier, Yorkshire Water, showed ""goodwill"", in writing off Â£500 of the debt, but she still had to find Â£200. ""Even Â£200 is an awful lot of money when you have no money at all,"" she says. Problems with paying water bills have become one of the most common forms of debt, says a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a think tank that addresses tackling poverty in the UK.. More water bills are being linked to water meters Figures from the charity show that among the poorest families water bills are now the most common arrears, ahead of council tax, rent or gas or electricity bills. The UK Poverty 2018 report has also highlighted the growing problem of children growing up in poverty in working families. There are 14.3 million people of all ages living in poverty Of these, eight million are in working families The report blames ""parents stuck in low-paid work with little progression"" Rising costs, including private rent, leave families with less money for other essentials Water bills are a growing part of the problem, with the Consumer Council for Water saying up to three million people could be struggling - as well as the 400,000 on reduced ""social tariffs"". Each water company has a limit set on its charges by the Ofwat regulator - set at an average level across the region where it provides water. But below this average, individual customers can face changes in their bills - and those paying bills will also have to cover the cost of the rising numbers on reduced tariffs, which might be paying at half the full price. There has been a 50% increase in customers being put on to reduced tariffs The move to water meters, which is meant to link cost to consumption, can also mean changes in individual bills, if consumption rises or is higher than expected. Ofwat is negotiating with water companies on how much they will be able to charge in the next round of contracts from 2020.

Prankster pits Giuliani against Trump,"Rudy Giuliani appears not to have noticed Twitter had turned his typo into a link A critic of President Trump has taken advantage of a Twitter typo by his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to mount an attack. Mr Giuliani left out a space between a full stop and the following word within a tweet, which caused the text to become a link. The prankster subsequently acquired the webpage it directed users to. There, they posted a brief message saying: ""Donald J Trump is a traitor to our country."" Mr Giuliani's tweet - which has been ""liked"" more than 39,000 times and retweeted more than 14,000 times - is still live, at the time of writing, four days after being created.

Kuenssberg: MPs take back control,"As MPs begin five days of debate on Theresa May's Brexit deal it looks like the prime minister faces the exact situation she called an election last year to try and avoid. Whether it is the decision on whether the government is in contempt of Parliament (in other words, in lots of embarrassing trouble for ignoring the demand to publish the full Brexit legal advice), or MPs asking for the right to tell ministers what to do if there is a second attempt by the government to get Theresa May's Brexit compromise deal through the Commons (the attempt by Dominic Grieve today, that could take 'no deal' off the table for good), or what seems now, the likely rejection of  Theresa May's agreement with the EU next week, those manoeuvres, those sub-plots in the Brexit drama, amount to one central thing - slowly but surely, Parliament grasping the levers of power - one might even say, taking back control. To use the posh term, it is the legislature trying to take over the executive, and this is what chills some spines in No 10. With MPs on the Tory benches as well as the opposition looking for ever more arcane ways of tying ministers up in knots, there is a sense whatever happens next Tuesday, what we are seeing is the gumming up of the government, maybe for good. For many MPs of course, this is a moment, if not to hang out the bunting, to take heart from Parliament's influence, to be reassured about its role, its ability not just to scrutinise legislation, but to make things happen, or more pertinently, to stop them taking place. Parliament Live: Rolling updates May prepares to open crunch Brexit debate Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? But remember, as one government insider put it this morning, ""there are no numbers FOR anything"" - in essence the idea that the Commons would be able to come together to agree anything quickly on behalf of the country seems optimistic in the extreme. They'd be able to agree that they should prevent a disorderly 'no deal' exit. The prominent Labour MP, Hilary Benn, is making a formal attempt to guarantee just that. But beyond that? If the government's plan falls, some MPs will certainly push for another referendum - but a majority for that seems out of reach for now. Some, and there is cross-party support, would try to argue for a Norway-style deal with close economic ties to the EU. There might, just about, be a majority for that. But that model would not see the UK have total control of its immigration policy. For many, but of course not all, Leave voters, that was the priority in the referendum. It's potentially therefore deeply problematic to go for such an arrangement. If voters partly voted Leave to demand more say over immigration, what message does Westminster send back to the electorate if they carve up a deal that simply does not do that? Of course MPs absolutely ought to be voting for what they believe is best, at this huge moment. Some of them may be spooked by the idea of turmoil, or at least on-going confusion. Many more are poised to make their objections count. But don't kid yourself that if Parliament takes charge of the process that the situation will become any clearer fast. By calling the election last year, this kind of Parliamentary mess was exactly what the prime minister was trying to avoid. She had a tiny majority then, and this would have been a hard fight in any case. But that historic gamble, that she tried and failed, has made this perhaps harder than she could have imagined. With no majority, even tiny numbers of MPs can make a huge amount of noise. PM seeks to reassure world leaders on Brexit What happens if MPs reject deal?

'Food prices could rise 10%',"This video can not be played Bank governor Mark Carney Food prices could rise between 5% and 10% if there is a disorderly Brexit, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has warned. Mr Carney told MPs that in the most ""extreme"" case, prices would rise by 10%, but in a less severe scenario the increase would be about 6%. The Bank of England and its governor have attempted to assess the impact of Brexit on several occasions. All its assessments have seen it as a potential negative for the economy. Mr Carney's colleague, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said the UK imported about half of its food from overseas. UK food warehouses almost full Many foodstuffs cannot be stockpiled, says Sainsbury boss Can firms stop stocks running low? The price rises would come partly from a fall in the value of the pound, partly from any tariffs imposed and partly from increased costs at the border as imports are checked. Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Committee: ""In the most extreme scenario, your shopping bill goes up 10%."" Mr Carney also said the UK's ports were not ready for a no-deal Brexit that would see the country trade under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. He said: ""At this point in time, the ports are not ready for a move to an administered WTO relationship. ""To be absolutely clear, our agents, my colleagues, we have gone to these ports and had conversations directly with the ports in question. We have talked to the private logistics companies, so we have gathered direct information on this."" Under WTO rules, tariffs - a tax on traded goods - would be applied to UK goods. The average WTO tariff varies from product to product, from 0% on mineral fuels and pharmaceuticals, to about 20-35% on processed food and 45-50% on meat. In a timely personal revelation, Mr Carney said he had spent the weekend with the head of the WTO, Roberto Azevedo. Mr Carney said if the UK waived tariffs on European goods and continued the tariff-free benefits of membership of the European Union, it would have to do the same for everybody else. This video can not be played Brexit: How will it affect chocolate supplies? MPs challenged Mr Carney over what some critics have called Brexit scaremongering. Last week,the Bank published scenariosthat indicated a no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis. Mr Carney told MPs that a lot of work had gone into the Bank's assessments: ""There's no exam crisis. We didn't stay up all night."" He said a core team of 20 senior economists had worked on the assessments for a couple of years, 150 different professionals across the Bank were also drawn in and then the report was reviewed by both the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank's Financial Policy Committee. The Bank has direct responsibility for the financial sector, which is losing jobs amid the Brexit uncertainty. But Mr Carney said the Bank was comfortable with preparations for the sector, because it had prepared for the worst-case scenario: ""We're already sleeping soundly at night, because we have the financial sector, the core of the financial sector, in a position that it needs to be for a tough scenario."" His colleague, deputy governor Sam Woods, who was also appearing before MPs, said fewer than 5,000 financial jobs had moved out of the country since the referendum out of some half a million employed in the sector, a ""pretty small"" number.

Funeral firms 'took advantage of grief',"Funeral costs are up 84% in 10 years The boss of the UK's largest funeral provider, the Co-op Group, has admitted the industry has taken advantage of people's grief in the past. Steve Murrells said price wasn't on the agenda for people arranging a funeral - which created ""the wrong behaviour in the industry"". Last week, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a major investigation into the sector. The CMA said it had ""serious concerns"" about above-inflation price rises. The Co-op has recently launched a number of affordable products, including a cremation without ceremony product, which Steve Murrells says is already proving popular. ""One in 30 of our funerals are already being taken up in that form,"" he said. However, speaking toBBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money Boardroom Storiespodcast he said that changes were needed. ""For too long the industry kept putting prices up.  People felt obliged to spend it - they kind of felt it represented the importance of that person's life."" He said that 12 to 18 months ago ""I felt we needed to make funerals more affordable for people at a time of austerity and of sorrow"". He added that attitudes to funerals are also different: ""People's interpretation at the saddest point is changing, from one of grief to celebration."" The average cremation fee was Â£737 last year, with the fees having risen by 84% in the past 10 years. The CMA found that people typically spent between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 organising a funeral, with the average price of the core elements now standing at Â£4,271. Steve Murrells, Co-op Group chief executive Mr Murrells said the Co-op had been pushing for an investigation. ""We think this market needs regulation. This is a caring market that needs to provide the best service at the most difficult of circumstances,"" he said. ""You or I could open up a funeral business tomorrow with no qualifications or regulation. It's crazy."" People arranging a funeral could save more than Â£1,000 by shopping around for a funeral, the CMA said. However, the regulator pointed out that grieving families would be distressed and not in a position to do so. Most prices were not available or clear online, it added. The CMA also said that smaller funeral directors had tried to keep the costs low, but that larger chains had consistently increased prices. Mr Murrells said: ""I can't put right the way the market ran itself in the past. It's important for us to lead in this space now though, because it's the right thing to do. We've been bringing prices down and making them more affordable."" 'My mum's funeral costs were extortionate' 'How could I find Â£3,000 to pay for my mum's funeral?'

Michelle Obama tells of 'impostor syndrome',"This video can not be played Michelle Obama: âMy parents saw this flame in me"" Michelle Obama has said she still feels ""impostor syndrome"", adding that ""it never goes away"". Mrs Obama was speaking during her return to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School, an all-girls school in north London she previously visited in 2009. The former US First Lady also attended a sold-out event at London's Royal Festival Hall. There she recalled how the Queen had dismissed royal protocol as ""rubbish"" when the Obamas visited Windsor Castle. She said she was panicking about how to act but the Queen said: ""Just get in"". On Monday evening, Mrs Obama spoke to author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at the Southbank Centre to promote her new autobiography Becoming. More than 40,000 peoplehad reportedly tried to get tickets onlinewhen the event went on sale. And last month, her memoirbecame the best-selling bookreleased this year, just 15 days after being published. Mrs Obama was in conversation with Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Mrs Obama also spoke to an audience of 300 students at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School in Islington as part of her book tour. She first visited the school during the G20 summit nine years ago, when she had only been first lady for a few months. Asked how she felt to be seen as a ""symbol of hope"", Mrs Obama told students: ""I still have a little [bit of] impostor syndrome, it never goes away, that you're actually listening to me. ""It doesn't go away, that feeling that you shouldn't take me that seriously. What do I know? I share that with you because we all have doubts in our abilities, about our power and what that power is.

Impostor syndrome is a term used to describe feelings of insecurity or self-doubt, despite there being no evidence to support such a belief. During the event at the Southbank Centre, Mrs Obama also recalled her and President Barack Obama's visit to meet the Queen.

Mr Obama served two terms in the White House. Mrs Obama is a lawyer and has led charity initiatives including Let Girls Learn, to promote education for girls around the world. Mrs Obama also described her experience of black women being caricatured, saying: ""The size of our hips, our style, our swag, it becomes co-opted but then we are demonised. ""My advice to young women in that you have to start by getting those demons out of your head. The questions I ask myself - 'am I good enough?' - that haunts us, because the messages that are sent from the time we are little is: maybe you are not, don't reach too high, don't talk too loud."" The former first lady said this was true for women and working-class people, and ""profound for women of colour"", as people in power tried to make them feel they did not ""belong"". ""Here is the secret,"" she added. ""I have been at probably every powerful table that you can think of, I have worked at non-profits, I have been at foundations, I have worked in corporations, served on corporate boards, I have been at G-summits, I have sat in at the UN; they are not that smart.""

Law officer: UK can cancel Brexit,"The case was heard by the full court of European judges last week The UK should be able to unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU, according to a top European law officer. The non-binding opinion was delivered by an advocate general of the European Court of Justice. A group of Scottish politicians has asked the court whether the UK can call off Brexit without the consent of other member states. The Court of Justice (ECJ) will deliver its final ruling at a later date. The advice from advocate general Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona,externalcomes as the House of Commons begins five days of debates on Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal, with a vote due to be held next Tuesday. In a written statement, the ECJ said Mr Campos Sanchez-Bordona's opinion was that if a country decided to leave the EU, it should also have the power to change its mind during the two-year exit process specified in Article 50 of the EU treaty. And it should be able to do so without needing the consent of the other 27 member states - contrary to what the EU itself has argued. May prepares to open crunch Brexit debate What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: A really simple guide While the advocate general's opinions are not binding, the court tends to follow them in the majority of its final rulings. The anti-Brexit politicians and campaigners who have brought the case hope it will give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve Mrs May's draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off Brexit - potentially through another referendum. The ECJ statement said the advocate general had proposed that the Court of Justice should ""declare that Article 50 allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU"". It added: ""That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March next year, but the deal negotiated with the EU has to be backed by a majority MPs if it is to come into force. Welcoming the advocate general's opinion, SNP MEP Alyn Smith, one of those who brought the case, said it showed that ""we now have a roadmap out of the Brexit shambles"". He said parliament was not necessarily facing a choice between accepting Mrs May's deal or leaving the EU with no deal, and that ""there are other options, and we can stop the clock."" A group of politicians brought the case including (from top left) Catherine Stihler MEP; Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP A cross-party group of politicians and campaigners including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler brought the case together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project. They initially took it to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which ultimately agreed to pass it to the ECJ. Two attempts by the UK government to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected, and the case was opposed by the government and the EU institutions in ahearing before all 27 ECJ judges last week. Can the UK parliament block Brexit? Hubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could create ""endless uncertainty"" by allowing countries to announce they are leaving the EU in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal. The UK government's lawyers argued that the case was purely hypothetical as ""the UK does not intend to revoke its notification"", and ECJ judges should therefore refuse to rule on it. They added that the politicians behind the case wanted to use it as ""political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK parliament"". The advocate general's opinion that the UK has the right to unilaterally withdraw Article 50 notification of its intention to leave the EU flies in the face of what the UK government and the EU want. Although the Advocate General's opinion is non-binding, the ECJ follow his opinions in the majority of cases. The whole issue of revocation remains hypothetical at present because the government has made it clear there is no possibility of seeking to revoke the notice to leave the EU. However, the statement raises the question of how the UK might revoke notification. It would almost certainly need to be done by an act of parliament. If it was done by ministers alone using prerogative powers it would frustrate the will of parliament as expressed in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. It should be noted that the statement and the case concerns revocation of notice to leave, and not a delay or extension of the two-year period provided for under Article 50. That period can be extended, but only with the agreement of all of the other 27 EU states. Whereas extension of the Article 50 period could become a political necessity, revocation of Article 50 remains something of an academic point at present. However, that would change if there was a second referendum in which the British people voted to remain in the EU.

Carney: Food prices could rise 10%,"This video can not be played Bank governor Mark Carney Food prices could rise between 5% and 10% if there is a disorderly Brexit, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has warned. Mr Carney told MPs that in the most ""extreme"" case, prices would rise by 10%, but in a less severe scenario the increase would be about 6%. The Bank of England and its governor have attempted to assess the impact of Brexit on several occasions. All its assessments have seen it as a potential negative for the economy. Mr Carney's colleague, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said the UK imported about half of its food from overseas. UK food warehouses almost full Many foodstuffs cannot be stockpiled, says Sainsbury boss Can firms stop stocks running low? The price rises would come partly from a fall in the value of the pound, partly from any tariffs imposed and partly from increased costs at the border as imports are checked. Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Committee: ""In the most extreme scenario, your shopping bill goes up 10%."" Mr Carney also said the UK's ports were not ready for a no-deal Brexit that would see the country trade under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. He said: ""At this point in time, the ports are not ready for a move to an administered WTO relationship. ""To be absolutely clear, our agents, my colleagues, we have gone to these ports and had conversations directly with the ports in question. We have talked to the private logistics companies, so we have gathered direct information on this."" Under WTO rules, tariffs - a tax on traded goods - would be applied to UK goods. The average WTO tariff varies from product to product, from 0% on mineral fuels and pharmaceuticals, to about 20-35% on processed food and 45-50% on meat. In a timely personal revelation, Mr Carney said he had spent the weekend with the head of the WTO, Roberto Azevedo. Mr Carney said if the UK waived tariffs on European goods and continued the tariff-free benefits of membership of the European Union, it would have to do the same for everybody else. This video can not be played Brexit: How will it affect chocolate supplies? MPs challenged Mr Carney over what some critics have called Brexit scaremongering. Last week,the Bank published scenariosthat indicated a no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis. Mr Carney told MPs that a lot of work had gone into the Bank's assessments: ""There's no exam crisis. We didn't stay up all night."" He said a core team of 20 senior economists had worked on the assessments for a couple of years, 150 different professionals across the Bank were also drawn in and then the report was reviewed by both the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank's Financial Policy Committee. The Bank has direct responsibility for the financial sector, which is losing jobs amid the Brexit uncertainty. But Mr Carney said the Bank was comfortable with preparations for the sector, because it had prepared for the worst-case scenario: ""We're already sleeping soundly at night, because we have the financial sector, the core of the financial sector, in a position that it needs to be for a tough scenario."" His colleague, deputy governor Sam Woods, who was also appearing before MPs, said fewer than 5,000 financial jobs had moved out of the country since the referendum out of some half a million employed in the sector, a ""pretty small"" number.

Most adults living unhealthy lifestyle,"The overwhelming majority of adults in England are so unhealthy they put their lives at risk, a survey suggests. The data from the Health Survey for England showed nearly nine in 10 had at least one unhealthy trait. That was classed as those who smoke, drink more than 14 units of alcohol, eat fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables, are obese or have low rates of physical activity. Half of adults have two or more of these risk factors. Although there are signs some people are giving up some of the unhealthy traits. Parents give children alcohol 'too young' The cost of being unhealthy Britain 'needs to go on a diet' The survey,externalfrom NHS Digital has been published as the Office for National Statistics revealed the latest death rates linked to alcohol. In 2017, nearly 7,700 people died in the UK from alcohol-specific causes - where the death was wholly attributable. That is the equivalent to 12.2 deaths per 100,000 people - the highest rate since 2008. Of the four UK nations, Scotland had the highest rate. The annual survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles. For the first time, it has compared the lifestyles of children with their parents. It suggested children who have obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. Some 28% of children of an obese mother were also obese, compared with 8% of children whose mother was a healthy weight. Meanwhile, 24% of children of an obese father were also obese, compared with 9% of children where the father was not overweight or obese. Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the findings highlighted the need to tackle the ""increasingly obesogenic environments"". ""Children today are bombarded by promotions for unhealthy food and drinks in stores and on the high street and exposed to countless junk food adverts online and during the TV programmes they watch most."" Yes. Cigarette use is falling. In 1993 27% of adults were smokers, last year it was down to 17% with growing numbers turning to vaping. Drinking alcohol to excess is also down. It means the most common unhealthy lifestyle trait is low fruit and vegetable consumption. Although there are high levels of unhealthy lifestyles, around four in 10 adults have no signs of ill-health developing yet. This was classed as conditions such as high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels. There are also strong signs that children are becoming healthier - or at least demonstrating less risky behaviours. Last year just 5% of eight to 15-year-olds had tried smoking, down from 19% in 1997. The numbers trying alcohol have dropped from 45% in 2003 to 14% in 2017.

Special needs support 'a national scandal',"Thousands of children missing out on support for diagnosed special educational needs in England is a ""national scandal"", Ofsted has said. There are 2,060 children in 2018 who have education, health and care plans (EHCs) setting out their needs, but who receive no support at all. Some parents said a child is only assessed when they are excluded. Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, also raised the issue of children disappearing from education. Ms Spielman says: ""Too often, children who have been assessed still do not receive the services they need."" She uses her annual report to expose what she describes as a ""bleak picture"" of too many children ""failed by the education system"". The report raises concerns about support for the 1.3 million pupils with special needs. She says between 2010 and 2017, the number of children with a plan designating their needs, but who received no provision, had increased fivefold. It had been above 4,000 in 2017, but has now been reduced to 2,060. The Department for Education says some of these young people will be in the process of moving between schools or colleges. ""One child with Send [special educational needs and disability] not receiving the help they need is disturbing enough, but thousands is a national scandal,"" says Ms Spielman, England's chief inspector of schools. Special needs pupils 'spend years out of school' Parents head to High Court over special needs cuts Special needs cash shortfall 'leaves thousands of pupils unplaced' The report also says: ""Most disconcerting is that the whereabouts of some of our most vulnerable children is unknown."" It revisits serious concerns that some pupils are being moved off the school roll illegally, because they may be seen as difficult to teach. The report suggests 10,000 pupils cannot be accounted for and may have been ""off-rolled"" by schools in Years 10 and 11, because they did not appear on the pupil list of another state school. This video can not be played Kirsty Mitchell's son's behaviour led to exclusion It acknowledges many of these may have switched to independent schools, moved elsewhere or have been taken out for home schooling. But, it says, it is unlikely that all of this number would fit into these categories. The report says that compounding the difficulties faced by children with Send and their parents is that demand for EHC needs assessments from local authorities has risen by a half since 2015. In 2017, 45,200 children and young people were assessed, while 14,600 were refused an assessment. EHC assessments and plans were introduced in 2014 amid a shake-up designed to streamline and reduce the burden on the special needs education system. They replaced statements of special educational needs which were carried out by local authorities. Many parents complained of the long and difficult battles they had to get their child's needs ""statemented"". But campaigners say the same issues are being faced with EHCs. At the same time, the costs of supporting more children with lower levels of special needs were handed back to schools, which have been facing budget pressures of their own. There was also a stated intention to reduce the number of children diagnosed with lower levels of special needs. Some believe these are part of the reasons why the EHC assessment and plan system has come under pressure. Both local councils and head teachers have been grappling with huge rises in demand for high needs support - those children with the highest level of need. The report says: ""Too often, the identification of Send is inaccurate or comes too late. This only exacerbates children's needs and puts even greater strain on the need for services. ""Often the worst hand is dealt to those who do not quite meet the threshold for an EHC plan. ""Understandably, parents feel that to do the best for their children they must go to extreme lengths to secure an EHC plan, which not every child will need. ""Something is truly wrong when parents repeatedly tell inspectors that they have to fight to get the help and support that their child needs. That is completely contrary to the ethos of the Send reforms."" Last month, representatives of local authorities told MPs of the funding problems they face in their high needs budgets. Surrey County Council revealed it faced Â£30m in pressures on its high needs budget for this year, adding this was enough to trigger formal restrictions on any further spending at the council. The Ofsted report is published as the school watchdog in Wales,Estyn, publishes its annual report. Inspectors say secondary schools in Wales could do better, with only half judged good or excellent. A Department for Education spokesman said the report ""shows we have a robust education system - one where parents can feel assured that the vast majority of schools, early years providers, children's homes and local authorities provide a high level of education and care for young people, regardless of their circumstances"". ""One of the key functions of a good regulator is that it highlights areas of concern and we will work with Ofsted, schools, local authorities and others to address the issues this report picks out."" Head teachers union, the Association of School and College Leaders, said funding pressures were making it more difficult to give children the individual support to help them to overcome challenges they face. And that means schools are less able offer the early intervention which prevents challenging behaviour escalating to the point of an exclusion.

Taxpayers 'treated unfairly' by HMRC,"Greater powers given to HMRC to tackle tax avoidance and evasion are undermining the rule of law and justice, warns a House of Lords report. The Economic Affairs Committee said HMRC has been granted some broad, disproportionate powers without effective taxpayer safeguards. High penalties, designed to deter taxpayers from appealing, are a tax on justice, the committee claimed. It has demanded a review of the oversight of HMRC and its powers. The committee's chairman, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, said: ""HMRC is right to tackle tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. However, a careful balance must be struck between clamping down and treating taxpayers fairly. ""Our evidence has convinced us that this balance has tipped too far in favour of HMRC and against the fundamental protections every taxpayer should expect."" The committee's report warned that some of the powers ""disproportionately affect"" unrepresented and lower income taxpayers. In particular, it took some ""disturbing evidence,external"" on the approach to the loan charge, a new fee which has been brought in to combat what HMRC calls ""disguised remuneration"" schemes. Under these schemes, workers were paid by way of a loan, an arrangement that was intended to avoid tax and National Insurance contributions for the employee. There has been criticism of the fact that the charge can be applied retrospectively, which could hit people who may have been unaware they were at risk of falling foul of tax rules. HMRC investigates players, clubs & agents HMRC interest rate change is 'unfair' Millions of UK voices stored by HMRC ""This is devastating the lives of middle and lower income individuals, from the private and public sector (including the National Health Service) who used disguised remuneration schemes, in many cases being required to do so by their employers,"" said Lord Forsyth. ""The charge is retrospective in its effect, claiming tax from years which should be closed to enquiry."" The report recommends that HMRC should urgently review all loan charge cases where the only remaining consideration is the individual's ability to pay, and establish a dedicated helpline to give those affected by the loan charge advice and support. It said action should take place ""well in advance"" of the loan charge coming into effect in April 2019. HMRC pointed out it already has a helpline for those who may be facing a loan charge on 03000 534 226 and hasguidance online,external. The Loan Charge Action Group, which wants the charge to be forward-looking rather than retrospective. said: ""The draconian loan charge allows HMRC to go back 20 years, demanding huge tax bills for arrangements that were legal and openly declared to HMRC at the time. ""The victims - who include social workers, teachers, doctors and nurses as well as IT contractors - simply followed professional advice and submitted their tax returns every year, with HMRC never challenging these returns at the time. Yet they now face unjustifiable and life-destroying tax bills they cannot pay and cannot fairly appeal."" But in a briefing note published this summer,external, HMRC noted that almost two-thirds of those affected work in the business services sector, which includes management and IT consultants, and fewer than 3% work in medical services (doctors and nurses) and teaching. It added that disguised remuneration schemes users, on average, earned twice as much as the average UK taxpayer and that 70% of users have used the schemes for two years or more. HMRC warned that repeated use of the schemes would ""inevitably result in large tax liabilities"". One case presented to the committee concerned a social worker who was made redundant by her local council. The evidence reported: ""It had a farewell party on the Friday, and on the Monday it said 'If you join this agency and use the scheme, we will re-engage you as a contractor.' ""She was re-engaged as a contractor for five years but at the end of the five years, the council told her it would re-employ her as an employee, which it did. ""She was unaware of what was going on. She now faces a loan charge equal to probably a year and a half's salary. ""She has no means of paying it."" The committee has also recommended that Parliament considers how it can improve the scrutiny of the powers being given to HMRC and oversight of how it carries out those powers. Other report findings and recommendations include: Consideration should be given to widening the remit of the Adjudicator's Office, and to oblige HMRC to follow its recommendations The government should withdraw clauses 79 and 80 of the Finance Bill, which would extend HMRC time limits to assess offshore matters to 12 years The government should withdraw its proposal, for which consultation closed in October, to remove oversight of the tax tribunal from HMRC access to information about taxpayers from third parties Penalties associated with General Anti-Abuse Rule and Follower Notices restrict access to justice, and should be abolished The government should legislate to give the First-tier Tribunal (Tax) the power to conduct judicial reviews. The Treasury should assess whether HMRC is adequately resourced to fulfil its Charter obligations in the next Spending Review. A Government spokesperson responded: ""We've taken unprecedented action to crack down on avoidance and evasion, making sure people pay their fair share of tax and securing funding for our vital public services. ""Parliament has given HMRC powers it needs to tackle businesses and individuals who do not pay their fair share, and it uses them responsibly and subject to appropriate checks and balances. ""On the loan charge in particular, it is important to bear in mind that disguised remuneration schemes are aggressive tax avoidance structures that allowed some people to avoid the taxes that Parliament requires them to pay.""

'I didn't know teeth whitening was illegal',"This video can not be played Brenda McFadyen says she didn't know she was breaking the law A woman convicted of illegally whitening people's teeth has told BBC Scotland she did not know what she was doing was against the law. The General Dental Council (GDC) says only registered dentists should carry out teeth whitening. But private companies offer training in how to oversee the procedure. Brenda McFadyen, from Clydebank, was fined Â£1,000 after she pled guilty to the illegal practice of dentistry at Glasgow Sheriff Court last month. The 63-year-old said she was angry that she had been prosecuted and she now wants to warn others not to get involved in offering teeth whitening products and services. Figures suggest one in eight Scots have had it done Celebrity culture and reality shows such as The Only Way is Essex have contributed to a big growth in the popularity of teeth whitening treatments. The procedure involves bleaching your teeth using a whitening product usually containing hydrogen peroxide. Figures suggest one in eight Scots have had their teeth whitened but it is against the law for anyone who is not registered with the GDC, which regulates the UK dental industry, to practise dentistry. It involves bleaching teeth using a whitening product But Ms McFadyen said she did not know she was doing something illegal until the police knocked on her door in Clydebank on a Saturday night earlier this year. ""I had been teeth whitening for three or four years. In my eyes I wasn't doing anything illegal but I had to go to court and plead guilty and I was hit with a Â£1,000 fine,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""It was just a bit of extra income. We are both retired, you're trying your best to get on in life. And at my age, this is what I've had to go through. ""They've taken my name and they've ruined it."" Ms McFadyen was prosecuted under the Dentists Act 1984 after the GDC employed private detectives to gather evidence that she was whitening teeth. The GDC told BBC Scotland it was protecting public safety. Head of criminal enforcement, Katie Spears, praised the fine handed to Ms McFadyen and said it reflected the ""seriousness"" of the offence. The GDC says the law in relation to teeth whitening is very clear Dentists use custom-made trays to apply the whitening product Dentists regularly carry out teeth whitening but private companies also train people in how to oversee the procedure. The GDC has not brought any cases against training companies but it has prosecuted 31 individuals across the UK this year. Ms Spears added: ""There are big training providers who try to mislead members of the public into signing up to their training courses and buying their equipment and they make claims which are simply not true. ""The law in relation to tooth whitening is very clear and the only way you can have it safely done is through a registered dentist."" Dentist Jaspal Purba says he has treated patients who have come to him with complications after having their teeth whitened It is unclear how many people are injured as a result of illegal teeth whitening and there is no suggestion that any of Ms McFadyen's clients were harmed. BBC Scotland spoke to the dental hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee where the most serious cases would be treated. None of them had any referrals in relation to teeth whitening in the past year. But dentist Jaspal Purba, from Bupa Dental Care, has treated patients who have come to him with complications. ""Allergies alone can be quite serious and can be life threatening if they begin to affect your airways,"" he said. ""I have seen a few cases of allergic reaction and swelling of the lips and the tongue. ""But the most common complications I have seen, if someone has not had a custom-made tray, is burns of the lining of the mouth and the gums."" Ms McFadyen said she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened and she wants to warn others against getting involved in teeth whitening. ""Nobody should be out doing this,"" she said. ""There will be someone out there who will come for them and they (the GDC) will come sooner rather than later.""

Protest-hit France 'to halt fuel tax rise',"Central Paris has seen vehicles burned, business premises damaged and hundreds of arrests Fuel tax rises which have led to weeks of violent protests in France have now been postponed for six months. The move was announced in a televised address by PM Edouard Philippe, who said anyone would have ""to be deaf or blind"" not to hear or see the anger. The protests have hit major cities, causing damage and disruption over the past three weekends. The ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protests have now grown to reflect more widespread anger at the government. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work The ""yellow vests"" are so called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. President Emmanuel Macron was elected last year with an overwhelming mandate for sweeping economic reform, but his popularity has fallen sharply in recent months amid accusations that he is a ""president for the rich"". Four people have died since the unrest began and the resulting violence and vandalism have been widely condemned. Mr Philippe said that the next planned rise in the so-called carbon tax on vehicle fuel, which had been due to come in on 1 January, would be suspended for six months to allow consultations across the country to see what accompanying measures might be introduced to ease the burden for the worst-off. He also said planned increases in gas and electricity prices this winter would be halted, and that a toughening of the rules for vehicle emissions tests would also be postponed. It is a major climbdown by the government of President Macron, who has said the measures are necessary to combat climate change and meet budget deficit reduction targets. Vandalism was rife during the protests in Paris, including here at the Arc de Triomphe ""This anger, you would have to be deaf and blind not to see it, nor hear it,"" said Mr Philippe after meeting lawmakers from the governing party La Republique en Marche. ""The French who have donned yellow vests want taxes to drop, and work to pay. That's also what we want. If I didn't manage to explain it, if the ruling majority didn't manage to convince the French, then something must change,"" he added in his televised address. ""No tax merits putting the unity of the nation in danger."" But he said the violence must stop. ""If there is another day of protests, it must be declared in advance and must take place calmly."" He also warned that people should not expect better public services alongside lower taxes. Mr Macron was elected on a platform of economic reform which would improve the lives of French people via lower unemployment and a kick-started economy. But many feel that has not emerged. An analysis of the 2018-19 budget carried out by France's public policy institute, for example, found that incomes for the poorest quarter of households would largely drop or stay the same under the plans. Middle-income earners would see a modest bump - but the greatest beneficiaries would be those who were already wealthy, in the top 1%. The pattern is worse for retired people - almost all of whom will be worse off. Mr Macron (L) had vowed not to capitulate to street protests By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Will it be enough? That is the first question. Will the yellow vests feel they have won a big enough concession from the government, and  therefore call off their protest? There are plenty of voices that can be heard today saying they want more. Why is it only a suspension of the tax rise, they ask, and not an abolition? What is to guarantee that the government won't reinstate it next June? Maybe we need to step up the pressure. But by making a concession, the government does not need to satisfy everyone. It needs only to satisfy a large enough bloc of ""moderates"" among the gilets jaunes, and wean them away from the barricades. If that happens, then the movement will lose momentum. And though it won't be over, the end will be in sight. My bet would be that this will be what happens. Opinion polls will show a general approval of the government's concession. The gilets jaunes en masse start to waver. But there's still a protest by hardliners on Saturday. Maybe a parting shot, but still - and maybe because of that - a dangerous moment. Read more from Hugh The first question is whether the concession will be enough to satisfy the protesters. Some have vowed to keep up a blockade at an oil depot in Lorient in the north-west of the country, and there have been calls for further demonstrations on Saturday. Yellow vest spokesman Benjamin Cauchy said the movement wanted a cancellation - not a postponement - of the taxes. ""The measures announced today do not satisfy us at all, for the simple reason they don't go far enough,"" he told reporter Chris Bockman in Toulouse. ""The French people want a complete political transformation. They want to change the way things have been for the last 30 years. ""We're sick and tired of taxes being raised and the quality of public services going down. There are more and more people out there who can't make ends meet each month, more and more people are sleeping rough and yet we continue to raise taxes. ""Where is the money going? Where is it being used?"" This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? Fears that violent protests in the capital could continue next weekend have led Paris St Germain to postpone their League 1 home football match on Saturday. PSG v Montpellier off at police request The ""gilets jaunes"" movement began as a protest against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by about 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s. Mr Macron has blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise, but said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol from 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw for the protesters. Protesters say Mr Macron is out of touch, particularly with non-city dwellers who rely on their cars. Changes affecting ambulance drivers are part of a raft of reforms by President Macron The movement has grown to reflect a range of grievances, including the marginalisation of rural areas, high living costs, and general anger at President Macron's economic policies. The protests have no identifiable leadership and gained momentum via social media, encompassing a range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and plenty of moderates in between. In recent days, ambulance drivers and students have launched their own protests. Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Who are France's 'yellow vests'?

Trump pays respects as Bush lies in state,"This video can not be played President Trump visits George HW Bush's coffin lying in state at the US Capitol US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania have paid their respects to President George HW Bush as he lies in state at the US Capitol. Mr Trump made a brief visit to the rotunda, where the public can visit the coffin until the funeral on Wednesday. Mr Trump has in the past clashed with the Bush family but will attend the funeral service. Mr Bush, who died on Friday aged 94, will later be buried in his home state of Texas, alongside his wife, Barbara. His coffin had earlier left Texas to a 21-gun salute and was carried to Washington on board Air Force One - temporarily renamed Special Air Mission 41 in homage to the late president. The making of a president A life in pictures Service dog Sully pays touching last tribute Mr Bush, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, had been receiving treatment for a form of Parkinson's disease and had been admitted to hospital with a blood infection in April. BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, Capitol Hill Three hours after an assemblage of officials, dignitaries, family and friends welcomed the coffin of President George HW Bush to the US Capitol, the current president and first lady made a mid-evening visit to pay their respects. The motorcade took only a few minutes to travel down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. At 20:30 (01:30 GMT on Tuesday) Donald and Melania Trump arrived inside what was now a relatively empty Capitol rotunda. Members of the five branches of the US military continued to stand to attention, as the two approached the flag-draped coffin. The president gave an extended salute and the first lady put her hand over her heart. The only sound in the massive, marbled room - where 32 people, including 12 presidents, have lain in state - was the steady whirr of press cameras. Mr and Mrs Trump then turned and left. In all, the president was away from the White House less than half an hour, without a word to the public or press. The president tweeted that he was ""looking forward"" to seeing the ""wonderful Bush family"" at a presidential guest house on Tuesday. He added that Mrs Trump would be giving former First Lady Laura Bush a tour of the White House Christmas decorations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Zombie warzone' at troubled jail,"Inspectors at Birmingham Prison found smashed windows and jagged glass Inmates at troubled Birmingham Prison were ""walking around like zombies, high on Spice"" in an environment likened to a warzone, inspectors have said. More details have been revealed about the ""appalling"" conditions uncovered at the jail this summer, which led tothe government taking it over from G4S. Just 12 of 70 recommendations made by inspectors in 2017 had been met when theyreturned unannounced,externalin July. G4S said it continued to work with the Ministry of Justice. Inspectors said they found ""drug taking was barely concealed"" at the category B jail, where three ""likely"" drug-related deaths had occurred since the last inspection. Spice, a former ""legal high"", and other similar drug compounds have been previously highlighted as being available in the prison. Inmates left graffiti on cell walls Inspectors found a cell with live electric wires being used by inmates to operate the lights ""We witnessed many prisoners under the influence of drugs and some openly using and trafficking drugs around the prison,"" inspectors reported. ""Incidents involving new psychoactive substances (NPS) were routine and we often smelt cannabis on the wings. ""Shockingly, staff were too often ambivalent and accepting of such incidents."" The deaths are still under investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. Other findings: The prison was ""exceptionally violent and fundamentally unsafe"", with many prisoners and staff living and working in fear Many frightened and vulnerable prisoners deliberately isolated themselves in locked cells but had urine and faeces thrown through their door panels Inmates could behave badly ""with near impunity"" Many prisoners lived in ""squalor and little was done to adequately occupy them, leaving many simply to mill around on wings"" The prison was ""failing in its responsibility to protect the public by preparing prisoners adequately for release, including hundreds of sex offenders"" Following the government takeover, a new governor was appointed, 300 prisoners were removed and 30 extra staff were drafted in. Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke called for an independent assessment ""as to how HMP Birmingham descended into appalling, chaotic conditions"" between inspections. He said the challenges still facing the prison were ""huge"" and the recommendations remained in place. Toilets in cells are often unscreened Inspectors said they found flooded and damaged cells The prison's independent monitoring board said some of the report's criticisms were linked to part of the jail being opened too quickly after a riot in December 2016 because of ""commercial pressures"" and a rise in inmates. ""Re-opening without CCTV on those wings, and with various services not fully functioning and with limited access to education facilities did not assist in provision of a safe stable environment for the men in the prison,"" chairman Roger Swindells said. Illegal drugs see rise in violence at riot-hit prison HMP Birmingham 'overcrowded, in crisis and run by prisoners' 'Signs of improvement' at 'worst' prison He said it was ""now the time to allow the governor the space to focus on the improvements needed"".

EU Brexit case opinion due,"The case was heard by the full court of European judges last week The UK should be able to unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU, according to a top European law officer. The non-binding opinion was delivered by an advocate general of the European Court of Justice. A group of Scottish politicians has asked the court whether the UK can call off Brexit without the consent of other member states. The Court of Justice (ECJ) will deliver its final ruling at a later date. The advice from advocate general Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona,externalcomes as the House of Commons begins five days of debates on Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal, with a vote due to be held next Tuesday. In a written statement, the ECJ said Mr Campos Sanchez-Bordona's opinion was that if a country decided to leave the EU, it should also have the power to change its mind during the two-year exit process specified in Article 50 of the EU treaty. And it should be able to do so without needing the consent of the other 27 member states - contrary to what the EU itself has argued. May prepares to open crunch Brexit debate What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: A really simple guide While the advocate general's opinions are not binding, the court tends to follow them in the majority of its final rulings. The anti-Brexit politicians and campaigners who have brought the case hope it will give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve Mrs May's draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off Brexit - potentially through another referendum. The ECJ statement said the advocate general had proposed that the Court of Justice should ""declare that Article 50 allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU"". It added: ""That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March next year, but the deal negotiated with the EU has to be backed by a majority MPs if it is to come into force. Welcoming the advocate general's opinion, SNP MEP Alyn Smith, one of those who brought the case, said it showed that ""we now have a roadmap out of the Brexit shambles"". He said parliament was not necessarily facing a choice between accepting Mrs May's deal or leaving the EU with no deal, and that ""there are other options, and we can stop the clock."" A group of politicians brought the case including (from top left) Catherine Stihler MEP; Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP A cross-party group of politicians and campaigners including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler brought the case together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project. They initially took it to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which ultimately agreed to pass it to the ECJ. Two attempts by the UK government to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected, and the case was opposed by the government and the EU institutions in ahearing before all 27 ECJ judges last week. Can the UK parliament block Brexit? Hubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could create ""endless uncertainty"" by allowing countries to announce they are leaving the EU in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal. The UK government's lawyers argued that the case was purely hypothetical as ""the UK does not intend to revoke its notification"", and ECJ judges should therefore refuse to rule on it. They added that the politicians behind the case wanted to use it as ""political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK parliament"". The advocate general's opinion that the UK has the right to unilaterally withdraw Article 50 notification of its intention to leave the EU flies in the face of what the UK government and the EU want. Although the Advocate General's opinion is non-binding, the ECJ follow his opinions in the majority of cases. The whole issue of revocation remains hypothetical at present because the government has made it clear there is no possibility of seeking to revoke the notice to leave the EU. However, the statement raises the question of how the UK might revoke notification. It would almost certainly need to be done by an act of parliament. If it was done by ministers alone using prerogative powers it would frustrate the will of parliament as expressed in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. It should be noted that the statement and the case concerns revocation of notice to leave, and not a delay or extension of the two-year period provided for under Article 50. That period can be extended, but only with the agreement of all of the other 27 EU states. Whereas extension of the Article 50 period could become a political necessity, revocation of Article 50 remains something of an academic point at present. However, that would change if there was a second referendum in which the British people voted to remain in the EU.

'Death threats' halt France protest summit,"This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? Protesters from France's ""gilet jaunes"" (yellow vests) movement have pulled out of a meeting with PM Edouard Philippe scheduled for Tuesday. Some members of the group said they had received death threats from hardline protesters warning them not to enter into negotiations with the government. The PM is due to make a major statement possibly as early as Tuesday. The yellow vests oppose a controversial fuel tax but now reflect more widespread anger at the government. A spokeswoman for the movement, Jacline Mouraud, said: ""The meeting today at Matignon [the prime minister's office] has been cancelled in the face of threats. ""There are calls to prevent us from going. If I were to get on a train, I would run the risk of being recognised."" Three people have died since the unrest began and the resulting violence and vandalism - notably when statues were smashed at the Arc de Triomphe last Saturday - have been widely condemned. Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? ""Yellow-vests"" are so called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. The movement has grown via social media and has supporters across the political spectrum. President Emmanuel Macron has accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. The French president held an urgent security meeting on Monday. Ministers said that while no options had been ruled out, imposing a state of emergency had not been discussed during the talks. Mr Macron has also cancelled a planned trip to Serbia to concentrate on the crisis. Culture Minister Franck Riester told reporters that Mr Philippe would announce ""a strong conciliatory gesture in the coming days"", without giving details. AFP news agency reports that the prime minister will announce a moratorium on fuel tax. Private ambulance drivers protested against reforms to the healthcare system Mr Philippe also spoke to leaders of the opposition on Monday. He is due to meet MPs from the ruling La Republique en Marche party later on Tuesday. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who was at the meeting, warned that Mr Macron could become the first president to give the order to open fire on his own people in 50 years. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire met business representatives to assess the damage caused to businesses over the weekend. Some retailers had seen sales drop by around 20-40% during the demonstrations, while some restaurants had lost 20-50% of their takings, he added. The ""gilets jaunes"" movement began as a protest against a rise in duties on diesel - which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. Mr Macron says his motivation for the increase is environmental, but protesters call him out of touch - particularly with non-city dwellers who rely on their cars. The movement later grew to reflect a range of grievances, including the marginalisation of rural areas, high living costs, and general anger at President Macron's economic policies. The protests have no identifiable leadership and gained momentum via social media, encompassing a whole range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and plenty of moderates in between. Nearly 300,000 people took part in the first countrywide demonstration. There were more than 106,000 a week later and 136,000 people last Saturday. Protests continued into Monday. About 50 ""yellow vests"" blocked access to a major fuel depot in the port of Fos-sur-Mer, near Marseille, and petrol stations across the country have run out of fuel. Students in about 100 secondary schools across the country held demonstrations against educational and exam reforms. Changes affecting ambulance drivers are part of a raft of reforms by President Macron Also on Monday, French private ambulance drivers staged further demonstrations against a range of social security and healthcare reforms they say could affect their services. One protester told the Reuters news agency: ""[The reforms] will bludgeon us financially and destroy our companies. We're going to have to fire people, that's for sure."" It is unclear whether the groups of students and health workers have directly aligned themselves with the ""yellow vests"". One member of the movement, a man in his 20s, is in a critical condition in hospital in Toulouse. He was injured in a clash with police.

MPs issue scathing verdict on rail chaos,"Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) must contribute Â£15m towards improvements in services for rail passengers and will make no profit in 2018, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. The company has already spent a similar amount in passenger compensation after chaos following May's new timetables. The DfT said: ""Performance after the May timetable change was unacceptable."" MPs also said that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling should have been more proactive in preventing the problems. In a scathing report on May's timetable changes, the Transport Committee said ""genuine change"" was needed to restore trust in the railways. Although Mr Grayling had not been fully informed, this could not absolve him of all responsibility, the MPs said. It was extraordinary that no-one took charge of the situation, they said. Mr Grayling admitted mistakes had been made, tellingthe BBC's Today programme:""I accept responsibility for myself and my department not asking tough enough questions."" But he added: ""At no point did I get the information that I would have needed to intervene."" Northern trains axed amid timetable 'carnage' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes Trains chaos: What's really going on? 'Nobody took charge' in timetable chaos The DfT decided not to strip GTR - which is 65%-owned by UK transport company Go-Ahead - of the franchise, because it said that would ""cause further and undue disruption for passengers, and is not an appropriate course of action"". But its sanctions on the company mean it will make a reduced profit for the rest of its time in charge. The DfT said it would continue to monitor the performance of GTR, ""particularly during the upcoming December timetable change"". ""These measures do not make GTR immune from further sanctions in the event of any subsequent failure to perform."" In the middle of May, passengers suffered delays and cancellations after the biggest timetable change in a generation. The upgrade - which involved changes to 46% of train times - mainly affected Northern trains and GTR routes into London. Over several weeks, GTR and Northern cancelled up to 470 and 310 scheduled trains respectively each weekday. And in July, it was announced that a timetable overhaul planned for December had been scaled back. Labour MP for Middlesbrough, Andy McDonald, and Tim Farron, Lib Dem MP for South Lakes, have both called for Northern to be stripped of its franchise. Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent And so the punishment lands, although the ""p-word"" in this context is a touch misleading. In reality, GTR and the government have been locked in long protracted negotiations. Yes, GTR was largely to blame for the chaos inflicted on thousands of its passengers. But Chris Grayling's government department is partly culpable too. The other caveat is the fact that GTR's franchising agreement was set up to be fundamentally different to most others as its ticket revenue goes to the government, not to itself. GTR is paid a ""management fee"" for running the franchise and can earn above and beyond that if its trains run on time and passengers are happy. As passengers were, understandably, hopping mad, the announcement the company will make no profit this year feels slightly hollow. Their profits being capped in subsequent years is more significant. The government calls the action ""robust"", but in reality this is the best it could achieve given the complexities of the contracts and rail system itself. And the timing of the announcement, on the day Chris Grayling faces criticism from MPs, is more than convenient. Changes to the national rail timetable happen each May and December and are often relatively minor tweaks. But last May, after major infrastructure works, a far bigger timetable overhaul was introduced, involving 43,200 individual changes and affecting 46% of passenger services. MPs said its implementation was chaotic and resulted in inconvenient, costly and potentially dangerous disruption for passengers. The chaos was partly caused by the ""astonishing complexity"" of a fragmented railway in which inter-related private train companies, operating on publicly-owned and managed infrastructure, have competing commercial interests, the report said. It concluded that no-one took charge. Mr Grayling had the ultimate authority to judge trade-offs between competing commercial interests and he should have been more proactive, the report said. ""There was extraordinary complacency about protecting the interests of passengers, who were very badly let down,"" said committee chairwoman Lilian Greenwood. MPs say the rail timetabling process requires genuinely independent oversight Last week's announcement thatrail fares will increase by an average of 3.1% next yearadded ""insult to passengers' injury"", said Ms Greenwood. Mr Grayling has announced a year-long independent rail review, chaired by Keith Williams, deputy chairman of John Lewis Partnership and former chief executive of British Airways. But MPs said passengers cannot wait that long for lessons to be learned and reforms implemented. They recommend: Establishing effective independent oversight of the next national rail timetable changes Worst-affected 2018 season ticket holders should receive a discount on 2019 season tickets Effective contingency plans for disabled passengers and stringent enforcement Automated or automatic compensation schemes. Govia Thameslink Railway chief executive Patrick Verwer says services are now more reliable Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, described the report as ""devastating"" and laid the blame on the ""disastrous fragmentation of our railways"" as well as Mr Grayling. Anthony Smith, chief executive of watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""This industry knows it must deliver a smooth set of changes when the next round of timetable changes takes effect this Sunday. ""They must show they've learned lessons after a torrid summer of timetable crisis, and are acting to improve performance."" GTR chief executive Patrick Verwer said the firm had already processed compensation claims for 68,000 season ticket-holders, with the deadline for claims extended to 31 January 2019. He said: ""Since July, services on Thameslink and Great Northern have become more stable and reliable."" Are you a GTR passenger? Where would you like to see the improvement money spent?

Want your own home? Have wealthy parents,"The best way for young people to get their own home? Have property-owning parents. Youngsters with parents who have property wealth are nearly three times more likely to be home owners by 30,according to the Resolution Foundation.,external Its report found that parental wealth is almost as crucial as how much people earn when it comes to getting a home. ""Buying a home is almost impossible for many young people without access to the bank of mum and dad,"" it said. The report put together two sets of data to come up with its conclusions: the long time series of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and its successor, Understanding Society (USoc). The research shows that in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, home ownership rates for 30-year-olds with parental property wealth were only twice that of young people whose parents did not own a home. The gap has grown so that recent home ownership rates for 30-year-olds with parental property wealth are almost three times that of those without parental property wealth. Young people with high levels of parental wealth benefit in other ways too - they are 74% more likely to have a degree than those without parental wealth, and typically earn at least Â£500 more per month. Both of these factors increase their chances of home ownership, the Foundation -  a think tank that focusing on people on lower incomes - pointed out. Where can I afford to live? Young with deposits cannot afford homes Young face renting 'all their lives' The think tank added that having a society where young people's housing aspirations are so dependent on what their parents own is undesirable, and emphasises the need for politicians that say they want a socially mobile country to focus on wealth, not just income. While building more homes will help, the report warned that policymakers will need to be more radical if they want to see real change, with high house prices also being driven by long term declines in interest rates. Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Our housing crisis is so big that what your parents own is becoming as important as how much you earn when it comes to owning your own home. ""This is particularly worrying for the one in two millennials who aren't homeowners, and whose parents also aren't either."" Mortgage broker Mark Harris, chief executive of SPF Private Clients, backed up the research. ""The majority of first-time buyers who come to us to get a mortgage have significant financial assistance from the bank of mum and dad,"" he said. ""It's the only way most youngsters can afford soaring property prices, both in terms of help with the deposit and also with the mortgage payments."" Where can I afford to live?

Not enough evidence for energy drink ban,"Experts advising the government have said there is not enough scientific evidence to warrant a ban on the sale of energy drinks to children. But the Science and Technology Committee said concerns in society, and evidence from teachers, could ""justify a ban."" The MPs recommended more prominent labels, saying the drinks were not suitable for children. Critics said they were disappointed not to see a recommendation for a ban. A number of big supermarkets alreadyban their saleto under-16s due to concerns over the levels of sugar and caffeine in them. In August the government launcheda public consultationinto whether to make it illegal to sell energy drinks to children. Young people in the UK are the biggest consumers of energy drinks in Europe for their age group. Chairman of the cross-party committee, Norman Lamb, said they had heard a range of concerns which ""varied from a lack of concentration in the classroom and hyperactivity, to the effects on physical health"". He added it was ""clear from the evidence we received that disadvantaged children are consuming energy drinks at a higher rate than their peers."" But the committee found there was ""insufficient evidence"" as to whether children's consumption habits are significantly different for energy drinks than for other caffeinated drinks like tea and coffee. The MPs did find drinking energy drinks correlated with young people engaging in other risky behaviours such as drinking alcohol and smoking, but said it wasn't ""possible to determine whether there is any causal link"". Norman Lamb said: ""It would be legitimate for the Government to go beyond the evidence that is available at the moment and implement a statutory ban based on societal concerns and evidence, such as the experience of school teachers and pupils. If the Government decides to introduce a ban, it should explain why it has come to this decision."" The committee called on the Government to commission independent research to see whether energy drinks are more harmful than other soft drinks. The MPs also supported the idea of exclusion zones of sales to children around schools. They said that despite statutory labelling on energy drinks that they are not recommended for children, ""a significant number of young people continue to consume these products, and some in excessive amounts."" leading to concerns that children and their parents do not fully understand what they are consuming. The committee said the Government should use the opportunity of leaving the EU to introduce additional - more prominent - labelling requirements on energy drinks. Professor Russell Viner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said it was ""disappointing not to see a recommendation today to ban the sale of these drinks to children. ""We believe that the evidence is already compelling that energy drinks bring no benefits and only harm to children."" The committee members said they had heard from a number of witnesses who argued that the low cost of energy drinks made them more accessible to children. Prof Viner said the Government should introduce ""a minimum price for energy drinks as we know their cheap price tag is a key driver for their purchase"". The NASUWT Teachers Union gave evidence to the enquiry. Chris Keates, general secretary said: ""Teachers and school leaders continue to see first-hand the contribution energy drinks can make to poor pupil behaviour and pupils' ability to concentrate in class."" The union said the voluntary bans implemented by retailers were ""helpful"" but don't go far enough, and ""a blanket ban is needed.""

CIA head 'to brief Congress on Khashoggi',"This video can not be played Senators slam Saudi crown prince as 'crazy' and a 'wrecking ball' US senators say they are more certain than ever after a private CIA briefing that the Saudi crown prince had a role in the murder of a journalist. In a blistering attack, Senator Lindsey Graham said he had ""high confidence"" Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. The South Carolina Republican described the Saudi royal as ""a wrecking ball"", ""crazy"" and ""dangerous"". The Saudis have charged 11 people but deny the crown prince was involved. Where the Saudi prince stands revealed Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Members of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations did not mince words after the briefing by CIA Director Gina Haspel on Tuesday. ""There is not a smoking gun - there is a smoking saw,"" Mr Graham said, referring to Khashoggi's alleged dismemberment in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. The senator said he could not support Saudi Arabia's involvement in the war in Yemen or arms sales to the Saudi government as long as the crown prince remained in power. Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, echoed those views. He said the US must ""send a clear and unequivocal message that such actions are not acceptable in the world's stage"". This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS Another senator, Bob Corker, told reporters, using the crown prince's initials: ""I have zero question on my mind that the crown prince MBS ordered the killing."" The Tennessee Republican added: ""If he was in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes. Guilty."" Mr Corker suggested that President Donald Trump had condoned the murder of a journalist by refusing to condemn the Saudi crown prince. Fellow Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama said: ""Now the question is, how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation?"" The Senate is planning to vote on a proposal to end US military support to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, after members of both parties advanced the resolution last week. Senator Chris Murphy, who was not privy to Tuesday's briefing, criticised the Trump administration. ""Not everything needs to be secret,"" the Connecticut Democrat tweeted. ""If our government knows that Saudi leaders were involved in the murder of a US resident, why shouldn't the public know this?"" Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington Senators are trying to pressure the White House into condemning the Saudi crown prince. Failing that they are exploring ways to send a message of their own that the US will not tolerate the blatant violation of international norms. Options include blocking or suspending arms sales and imposing tougher sanctions. In a significant rebuke to the Trump administration, senators have already voted to advance a measure that would withdraw US military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. But it won't be easy to get the numbers to actually pass the resolution, at least not in its current form. One difficulty is that while there is a lot of anger over the Khashoggi affair, there isn't agreement on the best way to respond. And any measures that senators might pass would almost certainly be blocked by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. So they would have to start over again when Democrats take control of the House next year, which they may well do. Given the legislative obstacles, and with full White House backing, Mohammed bin Salman doesn't have too much to worry about, at least for now. But the Saudis won't like being the ongoing object of Senate wrath, especially after paying millions and millions of public relations dollars to improve their image in Washington. The CIA has concluded Mohammed bin Salman ""probably ordered"" the killing of Khashoggi. The spy agency has evidence he exchanged messages with Saud al-Qahtani, who allegedly oversaw the Saudi reporter's murder. The CIA director - who has reportedly heard an audio recording of the murder - did not attend a recent congressional briefing by cabinet members, dismaying lawmakers. The White House denied having a hand in Ms Haspel's conspicuous absence, and the CIA said no one had told Ms Haspel not to attend. At last week's hearing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary James Mattis told senators there was no direct evidence of the crown prince's involvement in Khashoggi's death. President Trump has said the CIA findings on the crown prince were not conclusive. On 20 November he said: ""It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Journalist who stepped into a consulate and vanished Jamal Khashoggi in his own words As a prominent journalist, he covered major stories including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of Osama Bin Laden for various Saudi news organisations. Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document For decades the US resident was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Mohammed bin Salman, including the war in Yemen. Yemen crisis: Why is there a war?

Three rainbows captured in photo,"A Gloucestershire village has been treated to the unusual sight of three rainbows. BBC Weather Watcher Gordon photographed the rainbows in the village of Frampton on Severn. He described the sight as ""amazing"", adding: ""I've never seen such a thing before."" A regular rainbow happens when sunlight is refracted through water droplets, usually rain drops, splitting the light into the spectrum of colours. By Matt Taylor, BBC Weather Double rainbows, which follow the same arc as each other, occur when sunlight is internally reflected as it passes through the raindrops. Effectively another arc of light emerges but the resulting secondary bow is less bold in its colouring and the colours are reversed. You can see this in Gordon's Weather Watcher picture. So what of the third bow? This is known as a reflection bow. Whilst rare, a reflection rainbow mainly occurs when the sun is lower on the horizon behind you (i.e. late afternoon/evening) and when you are near to a large body of water, such as a river, lake or sea inlet. Sunlight reflects off the surface of the water and through raindrops, but at a different angle to the direct beam of sunlight. This secondary beam of sunlight causes the centre of the rainbow arc to be higher in the sky, roughly the same distance above the horizon as the centre of the original rainbow below. This is why, on Gordon's picture, our third bow is at a different angle and crosses over the other rainbows. On rare occasions rays of light are reflected three times within a rain drop and a triple rainbow is produced. There have only been five scientific reports of triple rainbows in 250 years, says international scientific body the Optical Society. Your pictures: Rainbows Is this the longest-lasting rainbow?

Rugby ref 'saved my life after neck break',"Jessie Humber was reunited with Dean Davies (left) when she went to watch her brother (right) play rugby A woman who broke her neck playing rugby said the referee saved her life by stopping her head hitting the ground. Jessie Humber, from Padstow in Cornwall, suffered the injury playing for Plymouth Albion Ladies in November. The 26-year-old, who is also an RNLI lifeguard, was tackled and landed on her head against Cullompton. She said scans at the hospital showed that the referee Dean Davies' quick reactions had saved her life. Following the impact, Miss Humber was sitting down and lost feeling in her hands and feet when Mr Davies intervened. She said: ""As I was falling down the ref grabbed my head. ""The scans showed that one of four fractures in my C1 vertebrae was right next to my main artery. ""If the back of my head had hit the ground it would have gone straight through it and I'd be dead."" Jessie Humber is keen to encourage people to play rugby despite her injury Mr Davies made sure her head remained still for several minutes until an ambulance arrived. ""All refs have a duty of care but he went beyond that. He took control. All I can say is thank you - I owe him so much,"" Miss Humber added. She has called on him to be recognised by the Rugby Football Union. Rugby player breaks neck during game Miss Humber spent a week at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital after breaking her neck on 24 November. She is now wearing a metal neck brace for 12 weeks and has been told she will never play rugby again. The rugby player spent a week in hospital following the incident After being discharged from hospital, she went straight to watch her brother Ben playing rugby and was surprised that Mr Davies was the linesman. Mr Davies said he received a text message the Monday after the game from the team captain thanking him for his actions. He said: ""It's humbling to know that what you have done on instinct possibly saved somebody from catastrophic injury.""
