Three men killed by train in south London,"It is understood that spray cans were found near the bodies of the three men Three men have died after being struck by a train near a south London station. It is understood that spray cans were found near the bodies of the men, who are believed to be in their 20s. Police were called to Loughborough Junction station, near Brixton, at about 07:30 BST and the three were pronounced dead at the scene. The deaths are being treated as ""unexplained"" and police are investigating how the men came to be on the tracks. British Transport Police (BTP) said it is investigating whether the men were graffiti artists and confirmed that they were not employed to be on the tracks. Supt Matt Allingham told the BBC: ""When graffiti artists do get on to the tracks, there is massive risk."" Evidence bags taken from the scene by officers contained spray cans He said the bodies were spotted by another train driver who contacted police, and confirmed the men ""were dead for a while before we turned up"". ""We're still trying to identify the train that actually hit the individuals,"" he said. Read more on this and other stories from London Police officers remain at the scene where they are working to identify the men and inform their families. Evidence bags taken from the scene later on Monday contained spray cans and items of clothing. Officers could be seen taking photos of graffiti alongside the track as part of their inquiries. Police are carrying out investigations on the track near Loughborough Junction station It is believed the victims could have been struck overnight, when freight trains use the rail network more frequently as the passenger pathways are clear. Speaking about the spot where the bodies were found, Supt Allingham said there ""isn't a sort of safe refuge up there, so if somebody was on those tracks there wouldn't be anywhere for them to go to avoid the train"". ""If they've been caught in that section of track when a train came through then they really wouldn't have had much options,"" he added. Police were unable to confirm whether the men were hit by a freight or passenger service. Supt Allingham said they were ""aware that there are a number of speculative comments about this on social media"", but said it was ""too early for us to comment on their reasons for being on the track"". Officers could be seen taking photos of graffiti as part of their inquiries It is believed the victims could have been struck overnight Supt Allingham said officers ""have delivered the sad news to one family"", and are working to identify and locate the next of kin for the other two men. Det Supt Gary Richardson said his ""thoughts are with the family and friends of these three people"". ""My team are now working hard to understand what happened and how these three people came to lose their life on the railway,"" he added. He asked anyone who was near the station on Monday morning or ""saw something which they think might be relevant"" to contact police. Loughborough Junction is located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations The station remains open, but BTP warned that train services will be delayed while inquiries are carried out. Network Rail said it was ""assisting the British Transport Police as they investigate an incident at Loughborough Junction this morning"". London Ambulance Service said it was called to the station just before 09:00. ""We sent a number of ambulance crews but sadly three people were found dead at the scene,"" a spokesperson added. It is ""too early to speculate"" how the three men came to be on the tracks, police have said Rail regulator the Office of Rail and Road has opened a preliminary investigation. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said his ""heart goes out to the families"" of the people killed. Loughborough Junction is an elevated station managed by Thameslink and located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations. It is near three other lines used by trains which do not stop at the station.

KPMG audit work unacceptable - watchdog,"The auditing work of one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms has been sharply criticised by the industry's watchdog. KPMG audits had shown an ""unacceptable deterioration"" and will be subject to closer supervision, the Financial Reporting Council said. The FRC added all the Big Four - which also include PwC, EY and Deloitte - needed to reverse a decline. KPMG said it was ""disappointed"" and was taking steps to improve audit quality. Every year the watchdog reviews the audits of Britain's biggest companies to ensure they meet certain standards. The FRC noted problems at all the firms, but KPMG was singled out for the poor quality of its work. ""There has been an unacceptable deterioration in quality at one firm, KPMG,"" the FRC said in a statement. ""50% of KPMG's FTSE 350 audits required more than just limited improvements, compared to 35% in the previous year."" Stephen Haddrill, head of the FRC, said: ""At a time when public trust in business and in audit is in the spotlight, the Big Four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly. ""They must address urgently several factors that are vital to audit, including the level of challenge and scepticism by auditors, in particular in their bank audits.  We also expect improvements in group audits and in the audit of pension balances."" He said firms ""must strenuously renew"" their efforts to improve audit quality to meet the legitimate expectation of investors and other stakeholders. The increased scrutiny of KPMG will involve the FRC inspecting 25% more audits done by the firm in the 2018-19 financial year, the first time the FRC has taken such action. Michelle Hinchcliffe, head of audit at KPMG, said: ""We are disappointed that our overall audit quality score for our 2016/17 audits has decreased by 4% and that the steps taken in previous years have not resulted in the necessary improvements to audit quality. We are taking action to resolve this."" KPMG came in for criticism over its audit of collapsed construction firm Carillion earlier this year, and the FRC has opened an investigation into the group under the Audit Enforcement Procedure. The auditor was also recently fined Â£3.2m by the watchdog over its audit of insurance firm Quindell. Last year, the FRC opened an investigation into KPMG's audit of the accounts of aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce. Auditors review the accounts of firms to see if the figures are a true and fair reflection of companies' financial health. But the accounting industry has faced a lot of criticism in the last few years over whether their verdicts on companies' accounts can be trusted.

Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM,"This video can not be played Theresa May says taxpayers will have to help fund the NHS funding boost Tax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says. Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way. The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by Â£20bn by 2023. Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"". Kuenssberg: 'No magic money tree' The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming. But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money. ""Some of the extra funding I am promising will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left."" However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"". In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"". She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival. ""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said. At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years. That means by 2023 the budget will be Â£20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. Currently, NHS England spends Â£114bn a year. But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%. The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about Â£4bn - although it will be up to theWelshandScottishgovernments to decide how that is spent. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system. Like the prime minister, Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes. Economic growth would mean the size of the public purse would grow, which leaves more for public services. Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt the savings ""won't be anything like enough."" In fact, some have questioned the very idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" with the Liberal Democrats even asking the UK Statistics Authority to rule whether the government is right to claim there is one. The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the concept was ""tosh"". And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today there will be an ""increased burden of taxation"" to fund the NHS It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that. But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air. What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for? Read more from Hugh Ministers say there will be more details in the Budget in the autumn. There will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families. The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are. The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to. A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax. Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government. The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise Â£4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly Â£10bn. Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option. Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year. Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at: The workforce Technology Buildings Productivity The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015. A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community. Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time. In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support."" Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention. Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive."" The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.

"Queen's nephew seeks election to LordsLord Snowdon, who is 19th in line to the throne, is one of 19 hereditary peers contesting the ballot.UK Politics","Lord Snowdon, with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, at his father's memorial service last year The Queen's nephew who is 20th in line to the throne, is standing for election to the House of Lords. Lord Snowdon, the son of the late Princess Margaret and photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, is one of 19 candidates for the ballot on 3 July. A furniture designer and former UK chairman of Christie's auctioneers, David Armstrong-Jones inherited his father's title on his death last year. Next month's ballot was triggered by the retirement of Lord Baldwin. The then Lord Linley, third from left in back row, at the 1981 Royal Wedding There are 92 hereditary peers in the Lords, who stayed in the upper chamber after the remainder were expelled in 1999 in changes carried out by the government of Tony Blair. Hereditary peers reform plan falters Under current conventions, when one of their number dies or retires, a by-election is held to elect a successor. The contest is open to all those with hereditary titles on the register kept by the clerk of the parliaments. Princess Margaret with the late Lord Snowdon on their wedding day in 1960 The late Lord Snowdon, a celebrated photographer, sat in the Lords for more than 50 years Of the 790 members of the Lords, 92 are hereditary peers Of the 19 candidates this time around,external, the 56-year old Lord Snowdon - better known under his previous title of Lord Linley - is the only one not to issue a short statement outlining his reasons for standing and his relevant experience. When he was born, in 1961, he was fifth in line to the throne. He now sits 20th after Zara Tindall, the Queen's grand daughter, gave birth to a baby girl on Tuesday. He has published a number of books on design and set up a furniture, upholstery and accessories business in 1985. It was reported in 2012 that he had lost executive control of the business. His father sat in the House of Lords for more than 50 years after he was made a peer in 1961, a year after he married the Queen's younger sister. He was one of 10 hereditary peers to accept a life peerage in 1999, allowing them to continue to attend the Lords. If he were to be successful, his son would sit as a crossbencher - with no affiliation to any political party. He is not the only candidate with a royal connection. One of his rivals, Lord Bridges, has been the Queen's personal solicitor since 2002. He will shortly retire as a partner with the law firm Farrer and Co. The result of the ballot will be announced on 4 July. Only the 31 existing hereditary crossbenchers will be permitted to vote in the contest. Labour peer Lord Grocott has led a campaign to ban elections for hereditary peers, which he has called ""beyond ridiculous"". But a bill tabled in 2016 failed to make any headway. A separate election will be held on 17 July to elect a successor to Conservative hereditary peer Lord Glentoran. The list of candidates will be published later this month.

"Water firms 'failed' during snow chaosThe water industry regulator says firms did not properly support customers during the ""the Beast from the East"".Business","Some of the UK's biggest water companies did not support customers properly during this winter's Beast from the East snow chaos, causing ""significant hardship"", Ofwat has said. The regulator said more than 200,000 customers were left without water for more than four hours and tens of thousands were cut off for days. It accused firms of bad planning, communication and a lack of support. Severn Trent, South East, Southern and Thames Water performed worst, it found. The regulator also said it was concerned the Â£7m of compensation paid out to customers may not have been enough and that it would review existing guidelines. Ofwat chief executive Rachel Fletcher said: ""The freeze and rapid thaw earlier this year was forecast and was not unprecedented. ""But too many companies were caught off guard and let people down, causing real hardship as a result. Our report shows there is no excuse for this level of failure."" Speaking toBBC 5 live's Wake up to Money programme, she said: ""There is a huge amount to do to learn some lessons. The industry as a whole really needs to step up to make sure the next time something like this happens, customers are much better served."" The icy spell in late February and early March led to a big increase in the number of burst water mains and in customers' own water pipes as frozen pipes thawed. Water firms saw a spike in burst mains and pipes in the wake of the freeze and thaw But Ofwat said that while suppliers' frontline staff worked tirelessly to fix the issues, higher up some firms lacked proper emergency response plans. Citing survey data from the Consumer Council for Water, Ofwat identified common failings, including: Almost three-quarters of customers whose water supply was disrupted did not receive alternative supplies of water There was limited or inaccurate data on where problems were occurring and whether they had been resolved Only 60% of affected customers received direct communication from their supplier Stakeholders such as councils, schools and emergency services received ""little or no"" proactive communication ""before, during or after the event"". ""In some cases, customers were left to fend for themselves, or depend upon the support of local bodies or volunteers,"" it added. Ofwat said all water companies in England and Wales needed to improve, but it has asked Severn Trent, South East, Southern and Thames Water to publish action plans by 28 September setting out how they would do better next time. Big thaw leaves thousands without water No water? Can you claim compensation? ""We will take action if they don't rise to this challenge,"" Ofwat said of the four. Ms Fletcher told the BBC that punishments had already been imposed, saying: ""We managed to get Â£120m from Thames Water for failing to meet their leakage commitments to customers. ""We have strong fining powers and we're not afraid to use them."" Ofwat also said current compensation arrangements ""were not reflective"" of the impact on customers of being without water for a prolonged period. As such, it will consult on tougher rules obliging firms to provide customers with ""resilient supplies"". This video can not be played Mum in South London: ""Five kids and no water"" In a statement issued on behalf of the four worst performers, industry body Water UK said fewer than 3% of all customers in England and Wales were affected by supply disruptions during the extreme weather. However, it acknowledged significant numbers had experienced ""disruption and hardship"". A spokesman for Severn Trent said: ""We'd like to apologise again to our customers who were affected during the extreme weather in March. Customers rightly expect water whenever they need it, and we've been working hard since March to make improvements to our incident response processes."" Steve Robertson, boss of Thames Water, said: ""I am pleased Ofwat has recognised that frontline staff worked tirelessly in extreme circumstances to restore customer supplies. As the report notes, we rapidly increased water production by 15% to minimise disruption."" He said the scale of leaks and bursts was ""the worst in living memory"" but added: ""We're really sorry we could not protect those customers impacted."" Labour has been putting pressure on the government to tackle what it describes as ""scandalous"" profits made by private water companies. In February, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said suppliers had paid out Â£13.5bn in dividends to shareholders since 2010, while claiming tax breaks and pushing up prices for millions of consumers. The party has pledged torenationalise water, energy and rail companiesif it wins the next election. However, the government said the plan would cost taxpayers billions of pounds and lead to worse services.

Travolta mob film given 0% by criticsThe actor's troubled biopic of crime boss John Gotti gets a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.,"Travolta plays Gotti, pictured in 1990, at various points in his life and career John Travolta's troubled biopic of New York crime boss John Gotti has finally reached cinemas, and the critics have only one thing to say: fuhgeddaboudit. One reviewer called it the ""worst mob movie of all time,external"", while another said it was ""a dismal mess,external"". The reviews are so damning that Gotti has achieved the rare distinction of gettinga 0% rating,externalon Rotten Tomatoes.

"Breaking|Breaking newsRapper XXXTentacion shot dead in FloridaThe US rapper XXXTentacion, who topped the charts as he faced domestic violence charges, has been killed aged 20.US & Canada","The rapper's latest album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart US rapper XXXTentacion, who quickly rose to fame with two consecutive hit albums, has been killed aged 20. He was leaving a motorcycle dealership in south Florida on Monday when a gunman shot him. Police in Broward County said XXXTentacion, whose real name is Jahseh Onfroy, was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. He was often described as one of rap's most controversial artists and was facing domestic violence charges. XXXTentacion's lawyer, David Bogenschutz, said on Tuesday that investigators believe the slaying was the result of a random robbery. Mr Bogenschutz said the rapper may have recently withdrawn cash to buy the motorcycle. TheBroward County Sherriff's Office,externalhas offered a $3,000 (Â£2,200) reward for any information about the killing.

US to set up new military 'space force',"This video can not be played Trump: 'We must have American dominance in space' President Donald Trump has ordered the US military to establish a sixth branch of its armed forces - a ""space force"". The US president said on Monday it would bolster national security and the economy with the creation of jobs. ""It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space,"" Mr Trump said at the White House. He also promised that the US would ""return Americans to the Moon"" and would eventually send people to Mars. ""I'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces,"" Mr Trump announced,moments after he discussed US and German approaches to immigration. This video can not be played Could Trump's 'Space Force' become a reality? He also said it would be unacceptable to let either China or Russia lead in space, and he would be directing federal agencies to ""implement a state-of-the-art framework for space traffic management"". Details of what a new space force would look like and what it would do were not immediately clear. But Mr Trump said it would be ""separate but equal"" to the Air Force. The other US military branches are the Army, Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps. However, the US Congress would need to pass a law authorising it before any new branch of the military could be created. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the National Space Council, Mr Trump said, ""This time, we will do more than plant our flag and leave our footprints.  We will establish a long-term presence, expand our economy, and build the foundation for the eventual mission to Mars."" Elon Musk's huge rocket set for launch UK 'space drones' look to Proton ride Four reasons India is going big on space The Trump administration would also embrace the budding commercial space industry, Mr Trump said, by allowing American ""rich guys"" to use US real estate to launch their rockets. ""If you beat us to Mars, we'll be very happy, and you'll be even more famous,"" Mr Trump told the press conference, adding: ""They can beat us and we're taking full credit for it."" Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News I stood across the East Room from Mr Trump during the event, ""Moon, Mars and Worlds Beyond"", and I could see he was enjoying himself - especially when he spoke of a ""space force"". Other people in the audience seemed surprised, though. People in the back of the room started to laugh, and others wondered aloud how Joseph Dunford - the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the man whom the president had just put in charge of the project - felt. Still, the idea's not completely new. The president has spoken on previous occasions about adding another branch, the ""space force"", to the armed forces. And a former US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, once proposed the idea in 2000 (nothing ever came of it). Mr Trump's remarks in the East Room underscored his enthusiasm for the project, though, making it seem as though he'd return to the subject again.

Trump: US will not be a migrant camp,"This video can not be played The US teens training in border patrol President Donald Trump has said he will not allow the US to become a ""migrant camp"", as he stood by his administration's immigration crackdown. ""The United States will not be a migrant camp,"" he said at the White House. ""And it will not be a refugee-holding facility - it won't be."" Photos over the weekend showed undocumented children being held in fenced enclosures at a Texas facility. The UN human rights chief has condemned the policy as ""unconscionable"". Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents Trump wades into German migration row Migrant children 'held in cages' in Texas Mr Trump said on Monday: ""You look at what's happening in Europe, you look at what's happening in other places. This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents ""We cannot allow that to happen to the United States. Not on my watch."" Earlier, he said European countries had made a big mistake by allowing in millions of migrants. Mr Trump criticised Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in particular, saying her people were turning against their leaders because of the issue. Mrs Merkel is in a migration dispute with her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who wants to refuse migrants if they have already registered for asylum elsewhere in the EU. US and Germany compared on immigration The Republican president blamed Democrats for not coming to the table to negotiate immigration legislation. This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their parents at the border between mid-April and the end of May. The administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy entails criminally charging those entering the US illegally, including asylum seekers. This has led to parents being separated from their children, who are not charged with a crime. As a result, hundreds of children are being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas Some shelters and foster homes have said they are running out of space. On Sunday, Father's Day, Democratic lawmakers visited shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, demanding to see detainees. Officials have also announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F). Democrats and some in Mr Trump's own Republican Party have strongly condemned the administration. The crackdown has even provoked fierce criticism from the president's wife, Melania Trump, who said over the weekend she ""hates to see children separated from families"". Former First Lady Laura Bush meanwhile wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that the tactics were ""immoral"" and evoked Japanese-American internment camps during the Second World War.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Mr Trump's widely debunked claims that the family separations were mandated by law was ""an outright lie"". Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican, cited the ""inhumane"" policy on Monday as he reversed his decision to contribute National Guard resources to the southern US border to help enforce border security. A look at the facilities set up in Tornillo, Texas for migrant children Inside one of the tents set up in Tornillo Most congressional Republicans, however, have declined to criticise Mr Trump over the policy. A conservative commentator, Ann Coulter, claimed young people pictured crying at the border after being separated from parents were ""child actors"". ""Do not fall for it, Mr President,"" Ms Coulter said on Fox News. US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen faced reporters at the White House on Monday, just hours after telling Americans not to believe media reports about child migrants. She defended the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, arguing that the government was simply following the law and it would be up to Congress to change it. ""This administration did not create a policy of separating families... what has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,"" she said. During the heated briefing, Ms Nielsen also insisted that migrants who attempt to cross the US border are putting their children in an unsafe situation. ""By entering our country illegally, often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk,"" she said. Ms Nielsen was widely criticised on Sunday when she tweeted that her department does ""not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."" This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News Kirstjen Nielsen has taken on a huge responsibility. Not only is she supposed to fix immigration, she's dealing with a volatile boss. He's reportedly yelled at her, and I was in the room with them recently when strain in the relationship showed. During a briefing on hurricane preparedness, President Trump started to praise her work - only to blurt out: ""What do I say about you?"" She laughed, but it was an awkward exchange. Also recently Chief of Staff John Kelly spoke to me and a few other reporters about Ms Nielsen, his protege, making it clear he's tried to convince her to stay - though she's been desperate to leave. Like other officials, she's reflecting the boss' strategy: in the midst of blistering attacks, they're digging in their heels, lashing out at the media and - this morning at least - showing they won't be swayed.

'Pants protest' against Commons row MP,"Anger over a Conservative MP's decision to block a bill to make ""upskirting"" a criminal offence has manifested itself in an unusual way in Parliament. The entrance to Sir Christopher Chope's Commons office was decorated with women's pants in an apparent protest by Commons staff against his actions. No 10 has now said the government will now bring forward its own legislation. The MP told the BBC he was ""delighted"" by this and suggested he had been ""maligned for motives he never had"". Justice minister Lucy Frazer said by promising a bill before the end of July, ministers were sending a clear message that upskirting - the practice of secretly taking a photo up a woman's skirt - would not be tolerated. Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse, whose own bill was blocked by the Tory MP on Friday, said she was pleased the government had stepped in. Allow Twitter content?

Nearly half of young women harassed at festivals,"Festivals are a huge part of the UK summer calendar Nearly half of female festival goers (43%) under 40 say they have faced unwanted sexual behaviour at a music festival, a new survey suggests. Overall, 22% of all festival goers have faced assault or harassment, rising to 30% of women overall. The most common forms were unwelcome and forceful dancing and verbal sexualised harassment. YouGov surveyed 1,188 festival goers. The poll also suggested only 2% of such incidents were reported to police. Earlier this year, separate data released in the Crime Survey for England and Wales in February showed more than 80% of victims of sexual assault did not report it to police. Those statistics also revealed that one in five women had experienced some form of sexual assault since they turned 16. The festivals YouGov survey, which was commissioned by the Press Association, also found that only 1% of women reported sexual assault or harassment to a member of festival staff, either before or after the event, although 19% of men did report their experience to staff. Glastonbury Festival is the largest in the UK Rape Crisis's Katie Russell spoke to BBC News with some advice: ""As a bystander, do as much as you can to engage the perceived victim - be aware that they may feel humiliated and/or unempowered. ""Ask them what would they like to happen next? Try to avoid putting yourself in immediate physical danger and use your judgement. ""Our advice would be similar for a survivor in any circumstance. ""Try to be with someone you trust, who can stay with you, someone you can disclose to. ""You might be in shock, so try to stay warm and hydrated. ""If you want to report it, what we'd like to see is festivals working with specialist local services, so security staff are properly trained to show respect and empathy. ""They should have consideration if someone wants to report (an incident) to the police and know where the nearest sexual assault referral centre is. ""We'd love to see festival organisers inviting local services to have a presence at festivals with preventative messages and information on site."" She says victims should know ""it wasn't your fault"" and points out that just because drink/drugs are prevalent at festivals and there's a more relaxed vibe, ""none of those things mean you're partly to blame"". ""Everyone is entitled to enjoy themselves without worrying."" Regarding harassment, Katie used examples such as ""degrading language, or invading someone's personal space"". ""Within friendship groups, show zero tolerance to your friends, calling out to mates who might say stuff to bar staff that's making them feel uncomfortable, for example. ""Peer intervention can be powerful."" Tracey Wise, founder of campaign group Safe Gigs For Women (SGFW), said: ""We have struggled to find anyone with any definite statistics on this before now. ""It gives us something to show to festival organisers so we can say 'you need to take this on board'."" A 'consent matters' banner was pictured at a recent US festival Jen Calleja, a co-director of the Good Night Out Campaign, called the research ""shocking but not surprising"", saying it ""helps prove what we already know through anecdotal evidence"". She added: ""We know that the vast amount of harassment and sexual assault is not reported and we know this comes down to stigma, fear of not being believed and a minimisation of what harassment is. ""The idea we want to put forward is that harassment is everybody's problem, it's not just the person who is being assaulted,"" Calleja said. The poll also found that 70% of those who experienced sexual assault or harassment at a festival said the perpetrator was a stranger. The survey was carried out online between June 4 and 6 2018. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults. Paul Reed, chief executive of the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), said festivals ""have a duty to make their events as safe and secure and enjoyable"" as possible, and encouraged festival goers to report incidents if they witness them. ""If people don't intervene, then this behaviour becomes normalised,"" he added. ""People shouldn't feel that they need to tolerate the type of behaviour at festivals that they wouldn't tolerate in the street. ""If people don't intervene, then this behaviour becomes normalised."" Beth Granter, a 35-year-old campaign manager with social network Care2, said she was flashed by a man at Reading Festival when she was 17. She said she told him to go away and tried to laugh it off. ""Laughing was a defensive strategy to de-escalate the situation,"" she added. She said she did not report what happened but felt vulnerable for the rest of the festival. Only five out of 21 festivals asked for a response, gave one ""I think this kind of thing happens more at festivals than in the street during the day, but I haven't seen any evidence that it happens more at festivals than in nightclubs. I have lost count of the times I've been sexually assaulted in a nightclub,"" Ms Granter added. Another anonymous victim said she had been sexually assaulted by her drunk then-boyfriend inside their tent at a festival. ""Even though there had been a scuffle and I was upset, none of our friends said or did anything. I think people are particularly disinclined to intervene in something they see as a 'domestic' row."" She added: ""I've never been to a festival where I felt it was clear who I could talk to about sexual violence or harassment."" ""Specially-designated reps at a festival who are marked out as having responsibility for ensuring that people feel safe and supported would be helpful."" The Press Association contacted 21 of the UK's biggest festivals to discuss the new research on sexual assault and harassment at UK music festivals and ask about provisions and policy at their events. Only five responded - Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds, Creamfields, Latitude, RiZE and Wireless were among those that declined to comment. Somerset Police recorded two incidents of sexual assault, two incidents of rape and one incident of indecent exposure at last year's Glastonbury Festival. A spokesperson for The Green Man festival said: ""Stewards are positioned throughout the festival and are trained to report any harassment, or violence, to security to be investigated. Crew and service staff are also trained or advised on ways to report minor harassment, or violent behaviour or violence."" A spokesperson for Bestival said: ""We have a Harm Reduction protocol with Dorset Police and other agencies that is designed to address issues such as this.""

Raft of safety flaws at Grenfell Tower,"A list of failed safety regulations has been presented to a public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower blaze. Dr Barbara Lane said lifts in the tower were sub-standard, fire doors had not been replaced and combustible material was fitted around windows. She said the ""very basis"" of the policy telling people to stay in their flats during a fire only worked alongside other protection measures. But the standards firefighters relied on ""failed"" at 01:26 GMT. A total of 72 people died as a result into the fire on 14 June 2017 in North Kensington, west London. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Who were the victims? Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair - Monday's podcast Dr Lane, a chartered fire safety engineer, released a report about the fire two weeks ago, but on Monday gave evidence to Sir Martin Moore-Bick's inquiry. The hearing was told that Grenfell Tower was completed in 1974 and had 19 different sets of works on it up until 2017. But a number of the additions or refurbishments did not comply with regulations, according to Dr Lane. She said the lifts in the building were not up to the standard for firefighters, despite having been refurbished in 2005. The doors were not as fire resistant as they needed to be and did not have a secondary power supply. Dr Lane also said the lifts had no escape hatches, making them unsuitable for the evacuation of disabled people. The anniversary of the ifre that led to the deaths of 72 people was marked last week Dr Lane then described how only 106 of the 120 doors in the tower were replaced after additional refurbishments in 2011, meaning it is assumed the other doors had been there since 1974. At that time, building regulations meant they only had to be fire resistant for 20 minutes - but current regulations raises this to an hour. She told the inquiry: ""Fire doors are a crucial element of the stay-put strategy, as they represent an opportunity for weak spots to form in the fire-resistant partitions that separate a flat fire from occupants either on that floor where the fire has started or occupants in the flat above the floor the fire has started. ""Fire doors are, therefore, a building regulations requirement as a passive fire protection measure. Faulty fire doors mean faulty compartmentation and compartmentation is the primary basis of the stay-put strategy."" Dr Lane also said the dry rising mains in the tower - through which firefighters pump water to tackle fires in high-rise buildings - were also not suitable for a building of its height. Dr Lane said the dry riser loses effectiveness as the height of the building increases and rely on good water pressure to work against gravity. But eventually, the lack of water pressure means it cannot operate effectively. Buildings more than 50m in height should have a pressurised tank already in the building for firefighters to use, yet Grenfell Tower - measuring 67.3m - did not have one. A gas pipe installed in 2016 penetrated both the protected stair compartment wall and the protected flat compartment walls, Dr Lane added. She said the pipe - one of six gas risers running vertically up the block - had incomplete compartmentation and ventilation around it to protect it from fire. The hearing continues on Tuesday from 10:00 BST with further experts giving evidence throughout the week. Why was 'stay put' Grenfell advice so disastrous?

Palace terror suspect 'said Queen was enemy',"A man allegedly caught with a samurai sword outside Buckingham Palace said the Queen was the enemy ""that Allah tells us to fight"", a court has heard. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 27, from Luton, denies preparing acts of terrorism on 25 August last year, claiming he only wanted to get killed. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is the greatest"") as he was arrested, jurors at London's Old Bailey were told. In a suicide note, he allegedly said the Queen will ""be in the hellfire"". The court also heard how a potential sat-nav error led the defendant to a pub called the Windsor Castle, instead of one of the Queen's residences, earlier on the evening of his arrest. Uber driver Mr Chowdhury, of Kirkwood Road, Luton, had searched the internet for Islamic State group beheadings and Jihadi John, jurors were told. On the day of his arrest, Mr Chowdhury sent a suicide note to his sister and changed his social media profile picture to a green bird, in reference to becoming a martyr, jurors were told. ""The Queen and her soldiers will all be in the hellfire they go to war with Muslims around the world and kill them without any mercy,"" he allegedly wrote to his sister. Prosecutor Tim Cray showed jurors the Samurai sword allegedly recovered from the defendant Opening the trial, prosecutor Tim Cray recalled how shortly before 20:30 BST on Friday 25 August, Mr Chowdhury was driving outside Buckingham Palace in central London. On the other side of the road was a marked police van. ""As the defendant got up to where the police van was coming towards him, he swerved his car through the traffic cones designed to keep the two lanes of traffic apart,"" Mr Cray said. Two officers got out to investigate, thinking the driver was drunk or on drugs, he added. Mr Chowdhury then allegedly reached for what turned out to be a 42in (1.06m) sword - which was shown to the jury. ""There was a short, desperate struggle with the officers trying to get the sword off the defendant while he is punching at them and they are punching at him,"" Mr Cray told the court. PC Ian Midgley suffered a cut to the palm of his hand and Sgt Gavin Hutt cut his hand, before the officers used CS gas to disarm the accused. Giving evidence, Sgt Hutt told jurors: ""I feared for my own life, my colleagues and members of the public."" He said the situation was ""very bad"" and the ""penny dropped that this was happening outside Buckingham Palace"". ""It was just very surreal. I did not think it was happening to me. I realised it was a sword. I was saying, 'Get the knife off him',"" he added. The trial continues.

Queen's nephew seeks election to Lords,"Lord Snowdon, with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, at his father's memorial service last year The Queen's nephew who is 20th in line to the throne, is standing for election to the House of Lords. Lord Snowdon, the son of the late Princess Margaret and photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, is one of 19 candidates for the ballot on 3 July. A furniture designer and former UK chairman of Christie's auctioneers, David Armstrong-Jones inherited his father's title on his death last year. Next month's ballot was triggered by the retirement of Lord Baldwin. The then Lord Linley, third from left in back row, at the 1981 Royal Wedding There are 92 hereditary peers in the Lords, who stayed in the upper chamber after the remainder were expelled in 1999 in changes carried out by the government of Tony Blair. Hereditary peers reform plan falters Under current conventions, when one of their number dies or retires, a by-election is held to elect a successor. The contest is open to all those with hereditary titles on the register kept by the clerk of the parliaments. Princess Margaret with the late Lord Snowdon on their wedding day in 1960 The late Lord Snowdon, a celebrated photographer, sat in the Lords for more than 50 years Of the 790 members of the Lords, 92 are hereditary peers Of the 19 candidates this time around,external, the 56-year old Lord Snowdon - better known under his previous title of Lord Linley - is the only one not to issue a short statement outlining his reasons for standing and his relevant experience. When he was born, in 1961, he was fifth in line to the throne. He now sits 20th after Zara Tindall, the Queen's grand daughter, gave birth to a baby girl on Tuesday. He has published a number of books on design and set up a furniture, upholstery and accessories business in 1985. It was reported in 2012 that he had lost executive control of the business. His father sat in the House of Lords for more than 50 years after he was made a peer in 1961, a year after he married the Queen's younger sister. He was one of 10 hereditary peers to accept a life peerage in 1999, allowing them to continue to attend the Lords. If he were to be successful, his son would sit as a crossbencher - with no affiliation to any political party. He is not the only candidate with a royal connection. One of his rivals, Lord Bridges, has been the Queen's personal solicitor since 2002. He will shortly retire as a partner with the law firm Farrer and Co. The result of the ballot will be announced on 4 July. Only the 31 existing hereditary crossbenchers will be permitted to vote in the contest. Labour peer Lord Grocott has led a campaign to ban elections for hereditary peers, which he has called ""beyond ridiculous"". But a bill tabled in 2016 failed to make any headway. A separate election will be held on 17 July to elect a successor to Conservative hereditary peer Lord Glentoran. The list of candidates will be published later this month.

"Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PMThe prime minister promises any tax increases will be introduced in a ""fair and balanced"" way.HealthCommentsRelated contentKuenssberg: 'No magic money tree'NHS plan: What we still need to knowNHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend'","This video can not be played Theresa May says taxpayers will have to help fund the NHS funding boost Tax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says. Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way. The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by Â£20bn by 2023. Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"". Kuenssberg: 'No magic money tree' The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming. But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money. ""Some of the extra funding I am promising will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left."" However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"". In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"". She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival. ""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said. At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years. That means by 2023 the budget will be Â£20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. Currently, NHS England spends Â£114bn a year. But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%. The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about Â£4bn - although it will be up to theWelshandScottishgovernments to decide how that is spent. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system. Like the prime minister, Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes. Economic growth would mean the size of the public purse would grow, which leaves more for public services. Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt the savings ""won't be anything like enough."" In fact, some have questioned the very idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" with the Liberal Democrats even asking the UK Statistics Authority to rule whether the government is right to claim there is one. The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the concept was ""tosh"". And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today there will be an ""increased burden of taxation"" to fund the NHS It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that. But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air. What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for? Read more from Hugh Ministers say there will be more details in the Budget in the autumn. There will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families. The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are. The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to. A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax. Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government. The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise Â£4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly Â£10bn. Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option. Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year. Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at: The workforce Technology Buildings Productivity The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015. A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community. Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time. In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support."" Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention. Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive."" The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.

Kuenssberg: 'No magic money tree',"This video can not be played Theresa May was asked how the NHS cash boost would be funded ""There is no magic money tree."" That's what the prime minister used to say. She hasn't suddenly started believing that it exists in the depths of some forest somewhere, let alone in the well-manicured back garden of Number 10. But when she used to say that, what Theresa May meant was that the Tories did not want to raise taxes or borrow more to pay for the NHS. Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM She would always remind you that the overall amount of money going in was increasing - but as is well-documented, the demands on the health service have been outpacing the resources available. What's happened is that after many months of argument - remember the cabinetdiscussing tax risesfor health much earlier this year and the ongoing desire of Brexiteers in government to find more cash for the NHS (more of that in a minute) - the prime minister has been convinced by the health secretary and others that the strain on the health service is so acute that there simply is no choice. Jeremy Hunt has been remarkably open about this in recent weeks, and explicitly so today. Theresa May has also made it plain that tax rises are on the table. But what she won't do yet is tell us who will pay, or even rule out any particular taxes going up, down or being frozen to find the money. Be clear, the political decision to find the money has been made. It is even more political to decide from where. And this moment is not just about the NHS, it's about the era when the Tories' priority was paying down the deficit above all else coming to an end. Opposition politicians are rightly pushing for more detail. But this political shift is also awkward for Labour, as the amount promised is more than Labour had proposed during the election - advocating tax rises themselves, it's not clear where else the party can go. It is also the moment when Theresa May seems rather boldly to be willing to try to pull off a rhetorical accounting trick. She repeated her suggestion today that the money for the NHS will come, in part, from the so called ""Brexit dividend"". That is a matter of political presentation, not reality. Yes, after we leave the European Union and complete the transition period (leaving the departure lounge) it is true that we will no longer pay what's basically a membership subscription of Â£9bn a year. But what Number 10 and especially the Treasury know very well is that as things stand official forecasts suggest that the economy, the overall amount of cash available for the government to spend, will be smaller than if we had stayed in. In the most simple terms, Whitehall number-crunchers predict we will lose more cash wise than we will gain. Now, economic forecasts are often and thoroughly shown to be wrong. But right now, to suggest somehow that Brexit will partly pay for the NHS is at best extremely uncertain, at worst, downright misleading. Remember this though. The Vote Leave campaign repeatedly used a real figure of Â£350m that they knew gave only part of the picture about the costs of leaving the EU. That drove the Remain side, and plenty of voters, crazy - and there is still anger about it now. But they knew also that every time the other side complained about it, their claims about the NHS were heard by more people. Is Theresa May doing the same? Whether it is designed to cause controversy, or just give her Brexiteer ministers something rhetorical to applaud, she is certainly taking flak. It is one thing for a campaign group to put a pretty slippery gloss on statistics, and that caused enough outrage. It's quite another for the whole machinery of government to do the same.

"NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend'","""It is our firm intention to reduce taxes on British businesses and working families."" Page 14 of the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto is clear and could have come straight from the pen of Philip Hammond. The chancellor, those close to him repeat, is something of a tax and spending hawk. One of the original architects of the economics of ""austerity"" when he worked in opposition under George Osborne before 2010, Mr Hammond tends to reach first for the vocabulary of reform and efficiency rather than increased spending and taxes when asked about public services. It is a tendency that became more pronounced after an attempt at a relatively modest increase in taxes on the self-employed announced last spring burned on the altar of a Parliamentary and media backlash. Within a week, Mr Hammond had to execute a most embarrassing U-turn. For many in the Treasury, that event carries a lesson. The public are keen to tell pollsters that, yes, they agree with higher taxes - until the government announces higher taxes and the complaints start rolling in from households who haven't seen their incomes increase over the past decade. That is why the debate on people ""contributing a bit more"", as Theresa May described it today, is such a difficult one. And there's more - a second leg to the Conservatives pledge at the last election. ""Sound money and responsible public finances are the essential foundations of national economic success,"" the manifesto said. Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble To Mr Hammond, that means bringing down the deficit - the amount of money the government spends above the amount it gains in revenues from taxes and investment - to zero. Some economists argue that such a focus on ""balancing the books"" is unnecessary, and that the government could easily borrow more without spooking the international markets which fund Britain's deficit requirements. But Mr Hammond remains wholly committed to the government's target of a zero deficit by the middle of the next decade. Borrowing much more - apart from the small amount offered by the slightly better state of the public finances than initially forecast - is off the table as far as the Treasury is concerned. And with the economy weaker this year, any public revenue boost from the ""proceeds of growth"" is looking unlikely. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today there will be an ""increased burden of taxation"" to fund the NHS So, what about the ""Brexit dividend"" which the Prime Minister has said can pay part of the bill for increased government spending? My sources point out that, yes, in basic public accounting terms, in the financial year 2020-21 the government ""gains"" Â£3bn a year from Britain's departure from the European Union. That number rises to Â£5.8bn by 2022-23. The figures have been calculated by the independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), and are the difference between the government's payments to the EU as part of the ""divorce settlement"" (Â£7.5bn in 2023) and what the UK would have been paying if we had remained in the EU (Â£13.3bn). Even if all that money were recycled into the NHS, it would not cover the pledge made by the government of a Â£20bn a year boost by 2023. But even that ""gain"" is questioned by economists. That is for two reasons. First, the government has already committed some of that money to continuing to support policies and projects presently funded via the EU. That includes support for farming, support for a ""shared prosperity fund"" (to replace EU development finance) and support for joint projects with the EU, for example on research into science and education. There has also been a pledge to continue paying into pan-European regulatory agencies for example on aviation or pharmaceuticals if the right Brexit deal can be struck. Second, there is the overall economic impact on the public finances from leaving the EU - which most economists say will be significant and negative. The OBR itself puts the cost to the public finances at Â£15bn a year by 2023 - money which is going to have to be accounted for. This is the tough place the government now finds itself, and the Treasury has started the long and difficult process of trying to square a host of conflicting demands. A manifesto that pledged to reduce taxes and hit the government's deficit target. A pledge to the NHS of Â£20bn more spending by 2023. A Brexit ""dividend"" that is small, has been at least partly committed elsewhere and could easily be washed away by a Brexit effect which many economists say is negative. Mr Hammond has been tasked with coming up with the answers by the Autumn Budget. But few are convinced he will have all of them by then.

"Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PMThe prime minister promises any tax increases will be introduced in a ""fair and balanced"" way.HealthComments","This video can not be played Theresa May says taxpayers will have to help fund the NHS funding boost Tax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says. Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way. The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by Â£20bn by 2023. Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"". Kuenssberg: 'No magic money tree' The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming. But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money. ""Some of the extra funding I am promising will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left."" However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"". In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"". She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival. ""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said. At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years. That means by 2023 the budget will be Â£20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. Currently, NHS England spends Â£114bn a year. But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%. The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about Â£4bn - although it will be up to theWelshandScottishgovernments to decide how that is spent. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system. Like the prime minister, Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes. Economic growth would mean the size of the public purse would grow, which leaves more for public services. Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt the savings ""won't be anything like enough."" In fact, some have questioned the very idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" with the Liberal Democrats even asking the UK Statistics Authority to rule whether the government is right to claim there is one. The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the concept was ""tosh"". And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today there will be an ""increased burden of taxation"" to fund the NHS It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that. But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air. What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for? Read more from Hugh Ministers say there will be more details in the Budget in the autumn. There will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families. The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are. The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to. A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax. Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government. The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise Â£4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly Â£10bn. Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option. Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year. Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at: The workforce Technology Buildings Productivity The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015. A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community. Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time. In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support."" Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention. Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive."" The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.

Trump wades into German migration row,"This video can not be played US won't become 'migrant camp on my watch' US President Donald Trump has attacked the German government's approach to immigration, as he comes under pressure over his own crackdown on migrants. Mr Trump said German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition looked ""tenuous"". Mrs Merkel is in the middle of a serious domestic row after defending her government's immigration policy. Meanwhile, Mr Trump has adopted a highly criticised ""zero-tolerance"" approach, which has split families crossing the Mexican border. US and Germany compared on immigration Migrant children 'held in cages' in Texas Trump: US will not be a migrant camp That position has been condemned by many, including formerFirst Lady Laura Bush - wife of Republican ex-president George Bush - who wrote about it in the Washington Post newspaper,external. ""[Trump's] zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,"" she wrote, citing stories of children held in detention centres. In a series of tweets, the president defended his stance. ""We don't want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!"" he said. This video can not be played Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion Meanwhile, Mrs Merkel is in a migration dispute with her interior minister, Horst Seehofer. On Monday, Mr Seehofer gave her two-week ultimatum to come up with a EU-wide deal on migration, or he will start turning away migrants at the border - a move that could destroy the fragile coalition. Mr Seehofer wants to refuse migrants if they have already registered elsewhere in the EU, but Mrs Merkel has refused to back his plan. Allow Twitter content?

The disagreement has opened up a rift between Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats and Mr Seehofer's Bavarian CSU party - two parties that have been closely aligned since the end of World War Two. Trump and Merkel face off in G7 photo Angela Merkel's leadership woes First ladies urge US child migrant action Other claims in Mr Trump's tweets have already been debunked by various German news sites, especially his assertion that ""crime in Germany is way up"". They pointed out that Germany's crime rate is at its lowest since 1992, according to official figures released last month. A photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with US president Donald Trump during the G7 Summit went viral earlier in June President Trump said on Monday that the US ""will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee-holding facility"".  ""Not on my watch,"" he added. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions introduced a policy to deter new arrivals. The significant change, analysts say, is the justice department's decision to prosecute parents if they illegally cross the border, even if it is their first offence. Adults who try to cross the border outside official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. Their children - who are not charged with a crime - are taken to separate facilities, including warehouses and supermarkets that have been converted to deal with the swelling numbers. On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its ""unconscionable"" strategy of forced separations. Campaign group Amnesty International said it was causing mental distress that is ""nothing short of torture"". President Trump's wife, Melania, also made a rare statement expressing concern. She said she ""hates to see children separated from their families"", according to her spokeswoman. This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know She said ""both sides"" - Republicans and Democrats - needed to come together to resolve the immigration problem. Mr Trump has blamed the Democrats,external""for being weak and ineffective with Boarder [sic] Security and Crime"". Democrats - and numerous Republicans - have said the president's hard-line approach is not the answer. ""Children shouldn't be used as a negotiating tool,external,"" tweeted Mr Trump's former presidential Republican rival Jeb Bush. Mrs Merkel wants a new deal at EU level over migrants. She was widely criticised domestically for letting in about one million people in 2015. Mr Seehofer has been a longstanding critic of that open-door policy, which was summed up at the time by Mrs Merkel's phrase ""we can manage"". He says German border police should turn back all asylum seekers who lack IDs and those already registered in another EU country. Mrs Merkel sees that as a ""go-it-alone"" policy which would further hurt Italy and Greece, countries whose capacity to house migrants is stretched to breaking point. The Aquarius rescue boat - filled with migrants - was recently turned away from Italy and Malta, before being accepted by Spain There is a risk that Mr Seehofer's CSU party could break away, or at least trigger a confidence vote in Mrs Merkel's leadership. Newly released government figures show a fall in crime across Germany. However,the government has recently issued a report (in German),externalsuggesting that migrant involvement in crime was disproportionately high. In figures for 2017, it says that in 8.5% of all crimes, German police suspected a migrant of involvement. But for violent crime that figure was even higher, at 15%,according to a report in Die Zeit,external. Young males are more likely to be involved in crime than any other group and the report points out that recent migrants are both younger than the average age of the population and more likely to be male. The number of people claiming asylum in Germany has fallen in the past year - just over 200,000 applied for asylum last year compared with more than 720,000 people in 2016 - but the topic remains a major issue. Many cite the large number of assaults and robberies reported against women at Cologne's New Year's Eve celebrations in 2015. The victims said the men were of North African and Arab appearance.

New Brexit defeat for government in Lords,"MPs will vote again on how much of a say Parliament should have on Brexit, after another House of Lords defeat for the government. Peers decided MPs should have to approve whatever the government decided to do next if there was no final agreement with the EU. Their amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill was backed by 354 votes to 235. It means the issue is sent back to the House of Commons for a debate on Wednesday. Leading Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the Lords of being ""cavalier"" towards the UK's constitution. Mark D'Arcy: Week of drama? Government 'could collapse' over Brexit deal Brexit: All you need to know The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019. And negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure. But there is an ongoing row about what happens if Parliament votes to reject the final deal reached between the two sides - or if no deal is reached. One side says Parliament should intervene to prevent the UK from ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal - but critics say the prospect of this happening would undermine the UK's negotiating hand. Last week, Theresa May avoided defeat on the issue - but rebels said they were not happy with the concessions they had been offered in return for not voting against the government. Now, peers have backed an amendment from former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Hailsham, which goes further than the government's proposals on how much power MPs could get. The 119 majority was 28 more than the last time peers voted on the so-called ""meaningful vote"" issue. Lord Hailsham, who described Brexit as a ""national calamity"" in his speech, said his amendment represented what had been agreed ""in good faith"" by the would-be Tory rebels, led by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Downing Street last week. ""It's a matter of honour,"" he said. He also said his proposals were in the ""national interest"", adding: ""In order to safeguard our nation's vital interests, in the event that there be no deal on the table, Parliament should have the authority to intervene."" Lord Hailsham described hisamendment,externalas ""Grieve Two"", meaning it was a new version of proposals tabled last week by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who wants Parliament to get more of a say over Brexit. It would apply in three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal If Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached If 21 January passes with no deal being struck Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the government's next steps. The government had offered MPs the chance to vote ""on neutral terms"" on this statement. But the amendment backed by the Lords on Monday goes further, saying the statement would have to be approved by MPs. Lord Hailsham also criticised what he called ""disgraceful"" newspaper attacks on Mr Grieve and said it was ""perfectly true"" that he had held talks with other parties in drawing up his amendment. ""I make absolutely no apology for that,"" he said. ""This is the high court of Parliament, and we are not party hacks."" Lord Hailsham's fellow Tory peer Lord True said ministers had already ""made a serious attempt to compromise"" with the rebels' demands. ""People outside Parliament are getting a little bit tired of the parliamentary games,"" he said. ""They actually want to know when they're going to get Brexit, when it will be delivered and when it will be done.""

"Three men killed by train in south LondonSpray cans were found by the bodies on the tracks near Loughborough Junction, it is understood.London","It is understood that spray cans were found near the bodies of the three men Three men have died after being struck by a train near a south London station. It is understood that spray cans were found near the bodies of the men, who are believed to be in their 20s. Police were called to Loughborough Junction station, near Brixton, at about 07:30 BST and the three were pronounced dead at the scene. The deaths are being treated as ""unexplained"" and police are investigating how the men came to be on the tracks. British Transport Police (BTP) said it is investigating whether the men were graffiti artists and confirmed that they were not employed to be on the tracks. Supt Matt Allingham told the BBC: ""When graffiti artists do get on to the tracks, there is massive risk."" Evidence bags taken from the scene by officers contained spray cans He said the bodies were spotted by another train driver who contacted police, and confirmed the men ""were dead for a while before we turned up"". ""We're still trying to identify the train that actually hit the individuals,"" he said. Read more on this and other stories from London Police officers remain at the scene where they are working to identify the men and inform their families. Evidence bags taken from the scene later on Monday contained spray cans and items of clothing. Officers could be seen taking photos of graffiti alongside the track as part of their inquiries. Police are carrying out investigations on the track near Loughborough Junction station It is believed the victims could have been struck overnight, when freight trains use the rail network more frequently as the passenger pathways are clear. Speaking about the spot where the bodies were found, Supt Allingham said there ""isn't a sort of safe refuge up there, so if somebody was on those tracks there wouldn't be anywhere for them to go to avoid the train"". ""If they've been caught in that section of track when a train came through then they really wouldn't have had much options,"" he added. Police were unable to confirm whether the men were hit by a freight or passenger service. Supt Allingham said they were ""aware that there are a number of speculative comments about this on social media"", but said it was ""too early for us to comment on their reasons for being on the track"". Officers could be seen taking photos of graffiti as part of their inquiries It is believed the victims could have been struck overnight Supt Allingham said officers ""have delivered the sad news to one family"", and are working to identify and locate the next of kin for the other two men. Det Supt Gary Richardson said his ""thoughts are with the family and friends of these three people"". ""My team are now working hard to understand what happened and how these three people came to lose their life on the railway,"" he added. He asked anyone who was near the station on Monday morning or ""saw something which they think might be relevant"" to contact police. Loughborough Junction is located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations The station remains open, but BTP warned that train services will be delayed while inquiries are carried out. Network Rail said it was ""assisting the British Transport Police as they investigate an incident at Loughborough Junction this morning"". London Ambulance Service said it was called to the station just before 09:00. ""We sent a number of ambulance crews but sadly three people were found dead at the scene,"" a spokesperson added. It is ""too early to speculate"" how the three men came to be on the tracks, police have said Rail regulator the Office of Rail and Road has opened a preliminary investigation. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said his ""heart goes out to the families"" of the people killed. Loughborough Junction is an elevated station managed by Thameslink and located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations.

Boy discharged after getting cannabis oil,"This video can not be played Cannabis oil row: Mother calls for drug to be legalised A boy with severe epilepsy, who was admitted to hospital after his medical cannabis oil was confiscated, has been discharged. Billy Caldwell, 12, was treated with the drug in hospital after the Home Officegranted a 20-day licencefor the use of the banned substance. His mother says his seizures are reduced when he takes the oil and has called for it to be freely available. The government is creating an expert panel to look into individual cases. Home Office minister Nick Hurd told the House of Commons that the panel of clinicians, led by England's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, will advise ministers on any applications to prescribe the drug. He said Billy's case had ""highlighted the need for the government to explore the issue and our handling of these issues further"". But Billy's mother Charlotte Caldwell said there were still ""unanswered questions"". Speaking to Radio 4 she said: ""When will the panel be set up? When will it produce its report? ""This is something that has to be moved forward quickly and urgently."" Her comments followed earlier confusion when Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt suggested that Home Secretary Sajid Javid had launched a wider review of the law. But Prime Minister Theresa May said government would look only at the current system of licences for use in individual cases. ""There's a very good reason why we've got a set of rules around cannabis and other drugs, because of the impact that they have on people's lives, and we must never forget that,"" she said. Cannabis oil is used to control Billy's seizures Last weekofficials at Heathrow Airport confiscated Billy's cannabis oil,which Ms Caldwell had been attempting to bring into the UK from Canada. It contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is illegal in the UK but available elsewhere. She said that Billy had been taken to hospital in a ""life-threatening condition"" on Friday evening, leading the Home Office to intervene. During the weekend,Mr Javid granted a team at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital the 20-day licenceto administer the medicine. Ms Caldwell said: ""The fact that Billy has been discharged is testimony to the effectiveness of the treatment and underlines how vital it is that every child and every single family affected in our country should have immediate access to the very same medication."" The mother, from County Tyrone, said she has rented a flat in order to facilitate this temporary treatment. But she wants the law to be reformed, so Billy can have the medication administered at home. ""I will demand that the health department, not the Home Office, takes responsibility for providing access to medication for these incredibly sick children - this meeting must take place within 24 hours,"" Ms Caldwell said on Monday afternoon. It is uncertain what will happen when Billy's 20-day licence expires, and whether the Home Office will continue to allow him to use the drug. Raising an urgent question on the issue in the Commons, Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi said there were two children - aged six and one - in her constituency who have a serious life-limiting condition and could ""benefit hugely"" from medicinal cannabis. This video can not be played Robbie Emerson spoke about his two-year-child who has up to 30 seizures a day. Other MPs also raised cases, includingthat of six-year-old Alfie Dingley, from Warwickshire, who also has epilepsy,whose family is awaiting a government decision on whether he can use cannabis oil medication. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith - who said he is ""by no means a supporter of recreational cannabis use"" - shared the case of a woman who, after being given two weeks to live because of a brain tumour, used a form of the drug to get rid of the tumour. This video can not be played Tonia Antoniazzi says medicinal cannabis should be given now to all who need it Antoinette Sandbach, the MP for Eddisbury, told of a constituent's two-year-old son who has 300 seizures a day, which were reduced to about 50 a day following the use of cannabis oil. Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the current system - even with the new expert panel announced - is ""simply not fit for purpose"" and called for the legalisation of cannabis oil for medical use. Shadow transport secretaryAndy McDonald, whose son died as a result of his epilepsy, also backed a change in the law, adding ""I'm speaking out in the hope that further deaths can be avoided.""

Dr Julian Lewis, MP for New Forest East, likened the current issue to the relationship between the drug heroin and morphine, adding: ""Why can't common sense prevail in the case of marijuana, as in that case too?"" Supporters of the Caldwell's cause also include the MP leading an all-party parliamentary group looking at medical cannabis, Sir Mike Penning. He called the existing laws ""bizarre and cruel"",and added that ""fundamental reform of the system"" was needed. ""Medical cannabis is a health issue, not a misuse of drugs issue,"" Sir Mike said in a statement. ""It's about patients and relieving suffering."" By Michelle Roberts, health editor Cannabis contains different active ingredients and experts say some of them might be therapeutic for certain patients. THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the part that makes people feel ""high"", but CBD or cannabidiol is another component found in cannabis that scientists are interested in understanding more about as medical treatments. CBD-based treatments have shown some promising results for reducing seizures in children with severe epilepsies. Medical trials have largely focused on pharmacological preparations, but some parents of children with epilepsy have been buying oils containing CBD and THC. There is currently little scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these oils as a treatment for epilepsy, although they do contain the same active ingredients. It is vital that you talk to your doctor or health professional before making any changes to your epilepsy medication.

First ladies urge child migrant action,"This video can not be played Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion The former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border. Writing in the Washington Post newspaper, she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel, immoral and heart-breaking. Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. Earlier Melania Trump made a rare statement expressing concern. Mrs Trump ""hates to see children separated from their families"", her spokeswoman said. Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents Migrant children 'held in cages' in Texas She repeated her husband's call for ""both sides"" to work on immigration reform as a solution. However, fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trump's attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped. In a recentsix-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separationsfollowing a crackdown on illegal border crossings. Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents. Laura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy. ""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,""she wrote in the Washington Post,external. ""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert."" Laura Bush, left, and Melania Trump have both spoken out about the treatment of child migrants ""These images are eerily reminiscent of theJapanese American internment camps of World War Two,external, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,"" she added. Earlier Mrs Trump said she ""hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform"". ""We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart,"" her statement added. Ivanka's mother and child photo sparks backlash How Melania compares to other first ladies US attorney general quotes Bible to defend separating families The first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy. On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its ""unconscionable"" strategy of forced separations. Earlier Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended her agency's role at the border, saying: ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."" Butshe said authorities would remove children,externalif the parent they were travelling with had broken the law. Mr Trump has said a law ""Democrats gave us"" is responsible for the policy, but it is unclear which law he is referring to. In a tweet on Saturday he urged Democrats to work with Republicans to create new legislation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents is the consequence of a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to deter new arrivals. The significant change, analysts say, is the justice department's decision to prosecute parents if they illegally cross the border, even if it is their first offence. The children are not charged with a crime, which means they cannot be jailed together. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas Until this policy was announced, such families were usually subject to civil deportation proceedings, which did not require separation. The recent child detentions have resulted in some shelters and foster homes reporting that they are running out of space. On Sunday, Democratic lawmakers visited shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, demanding to see detainees. ""They call it zero-tolerance, but a better name for it is zero-humanity. And there is zero logic to this,"" Sen Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who organised a visit to Casa Padre detention centre in Brownsville, Texas, told the BBC. ""What we saw is this huge warehouse, it was a super centre for Walmart before, now it's a super detention centre. It's holding almost 1,500 kids inside there."" Vermont congressman Peter Welch said he saw children held ""in chain link cages"" in a processing facility and one shelter ""filled to capacity"". Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, officials announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F). Local lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as ""totally inhumane"" and ""outrageous"", adding: ""It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility."" Protesters marched to one such tent city in Tornillo, Texas, on Sunday where hundreds of children were being held separately from their parents. They chanted ""Families united!"" and ""Free our children now!"",external, reported NPR. The policy faces legal challenges, including a federal case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The number offamilies trying to enter the US overland without documentation,externalis on the rise. In the first two weeks of the new ""zero-tolerance"" approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that travelled with them, according to US border officials. In many of the cases, the families have been reunited after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months. But it is not clear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from travelling. This is because many are fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Honduras and El Salvador, and staying put is often fraught with dangers.

Ryanair calls for restricted alcohol sales,"A flight from Dublin to Ibiza had to be diverted to Paris on Saturday after three passengers became disruptive Ryanair has called for more restrictions on alcohol sales at airports. The airline proposed a two-drink limit for passengers and a ban on alcohol sales in airports before 10:00. This move comes after a flight from Dublin to Ibiza had to land unexpectedly in Paris on Saturday after three passengers became disruptive. The three passengers were removed from the plane when it touched down at Paris Beauvais and detained by French police. ""It is incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights,"" said Ryanair in a statement. The airline added: ""It's completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences."" Referring to its own policy on alcohol sales in-flight, Ryanair said very little alcohol was actually sold on board as all of its flights were short haul. The carrier is Europe's largest low-cost airline, transporting 130m passengers a year, with more than 2,000 flights a day from some 215 airports across Europe and North Africa. ""Our cabin crew are fully trained to deal with customers' alcohol sales and intake,"" added the airline. A Dublin airport spokesman said that while the behaviour of some individuals on Saturday's Ryanair flight was ""clearly unacceptable"", the airline's suggested alcohol restrictions were ""draconian"". These would ""affect all passengers because of the behaviour of a very, very small minority of airline travellers"", said the spokesman. Last month, Ryanair reported record annual results, with profits after tax rising by 10% to â¬1.45bn (Â£1.27bn).

Nearly half of women harassed at festivals,"Festivals are a huge part of the UK summer calendar Nearly half of female festival goers (43%) under 40 say they have faced unwanted sexual behaviour at a music festival, a new survey suggests. Overall, 22% of all festival goers have faced assault or harassment, rising to 30% of women overall. The most common forms were unwelcome and forceful dancing and verbal sexualised harassment. YouGov surveyed 1,188 festival goers. The poll also suggested only 2% of such incidents were reported to police. Earlier this year, separate data released in the Crime Survey for England and Wales in February showed more than 80% of victims of sexual assault did not report it to police. Those statistics also revealed that one in five women had experienced some form of sexual assault since they turned 16. The festivals YouGov survey, which was commissioned by the Press Association, also found that only 1% of women reported sexual assault or harassment to a member of festival staff, either before or after the event, although 19% of men did report their experience to staff. Glastonbury Festival is the largest in the UK Rape Crisis's Katie Russell spoke to BBC News with some advice: ""As a bystander, do as much as you can to engage the perceived victim - be aware that they may feel humiliated and/or unempowered. ""Ask them what would they like to happen next? Try to avoid putting yourself in immediate physical danger and use your judgement. ""Our advice would be similar for a survivor in any circumstance. ""Try to be with someone you trust, who can stay with you, someone you can disclose to. ""You might be in shock, so try to stay warm and hydrated. ""If you want to report it, what we'd like to see is festivals working with specialist local services, so security staff are properly trained to show respect and empathy. ""They should have consideration if someone wants to report (an incident) to the police and know where the nearest sexual assault referral centre is. ""We'd love to see festival organisers inviting local services to have a presence at festivals with preventative messages and information on site."" She says victims should know ""it wasn't your fault"" and points out that just because drink/drugs are prevalent at festivals and there's a more relaxed vibe, ""none of those things mean you're partly to blame"". ""Everyone is entitled to enjoy themselves without worrying."" Regarding harassment, Katie used examples such as ""degrading language, or invading someone's personal space"". ""Within friendship groups, show zero tolerance to your friends, calling out to mates who might say stuff to bar staff that's making them feel uncomfortable, for example. ""Peer intervention can be powerful."" Tracey Wise, founder of campaign group Safe Gigs For Women (SGFW), said: ""We have struggled to find anyone with any definite statistics on this before now. ""It gives us something to show to festival organisers so we can say 'you need to take this on board'."" A 'consent matters' banner was pictured at a recent US festival Jen Calleja, a co-director of the Good Night Out Campaign, called the research ""shocking but not surprising"", saying it ""helps prove what we already know through anecdotal evidence"". She added: ""We know that the vast amount of harassment and sexual assault is not reported and we know this comes down to stigma, fear of not being believed and a minimisation of what harassment is. ""The idea we want to put forward is that harassment is everybody's problem, it's not just the person who is being assaulted,"" Calleja said. The poll also found that 70% of those who experienced sexual assault or harassment at a festival said the perpetrator was a stranger. The survey was carried out online between June 4 and 6 2018. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults. Paul Reed, chief executive of the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), said festivals ""have a duty to make their events as safe and secure and enjoyable"" as possible, and encouraged festival goers to report incidents if they witness them. ""If people don't intervene, then this behaviour becomes normalised,"" he added. ""People shouldn't feel that they need to tolerate the type of behaviour at festivals that they wouldn't tolerate in the street. ""If people don't intervene, then this behaviour becomes normalised."" Beth Granter, a 35-year-old campaign manager with social network Care2, said she was flashed by a man at Reading Festival when she was 17. She said she told him to go away and tried to laugh it off. ""Laughing was a defensive strategy to de-escalate the situation,"" she added. She said she did not report what happened but felt vulnerable for the rest of the festival. Only five out of 21 festivals asked for a response, gave one ""I think this kind of thing happens more at festivals than in the street during the day, but I haven't seen any evidence that it happens more at festivals than in nightclubs. I have lost count of the times I've been sexually assaulted in a nightclub,"" Ms Granter added. Another anonymous victim said she had been sexually assaulted by her drunk then-boyfriend inside their tent at a festival. ""Even though there had been a scuffle and I was upset, none of our friends said or did anything. I think people are particularly disinclined to intervene in something they see as a 'domestic' row."" She added: ""I've never been to a festival where I felt it was clear who I could talk to about sexual violence or harassment."" ""Specially-designated reps at a festival who are marked out as having responsibility for ensuring that people feel safe and supported would be helpful."" The Press Association contacted 21 of the UK's biggest festivals to discuss the new research on sexual assault and harassment at UK music festivals and ask about provisions and policy at their events. Only five responded - Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds, Creamfields, Latitude, RiZE and Wireless were among those that declined to comment.

Virgin Money bought by CYBG for ÃÂ£1.7bn,"The owner of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, CYBG, has agreed to buy Virgin Money for Â£1.7bn. Under the deal, all the group's retail customers will be moved to Virgin Money over the next three years. It will be the UK's sixth-largest bank, with about six million customers, but 1,500 jobs are likely to go. CYBG said it had agreed with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group to license the Virgin Money brand for Â£12m a year, rising to Â£15m later. Virgin Group is Virgin Money's biggest shareholder with a 34.8% stake in the business. Don't bank on it: why we fail to switch our accounts Under the terms of the deal, Virgin Money shareholders will get 1.2125 new CYBG shares for every Virgin Money share they hold, and will end up owning about 38% of the combined business. CYBG said the combined group would have about 9,500 employees, but it intended to reduce that total by about a sixth, suggesting about 1,500 jobs would go. It said some of those job losses would be achieved through ""natural attrition"" as there was little overlap in customer-facing roles. The Unite union expressed ""deep unease"" at the prospect of the takeover, adding it was ""vital that the skilled and experienced workforce are given assurances that branches and contact centres will not be closed"". Virgin Money, which was founded in 1995, expanded its business in 2011 when it bought the remnants of Northern Rock for about Â£747m. Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Nimbleness and the ability to attract customers through new technology have been seen as challenger banks' main attributes. That is why the Open Banking scheme - opening traditional accounts to specialist services from smaller players - appeared to be a potential game changer for fintechs and banking upstarts. But the TSB fiasco may well have damaged consumer confidence in these companies being able to provide more customer-friendly tech than the big banks. With this deal, the focus shifts to a more traditional form of competition - growing a business to a sufficient size to take on the incumbents at their own game. CYBG said the takeover would ""bring together the complementary strengths of two successful challenger banks to create the UK's first true national competitor to the large incumbent banks"". Its chief executive, David Duffy, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're going to become a competitor of scale."" He added that ""technology and agility"" were the factors that would decide the future of banking. ""I think we have sufficient scale - the brands, the product and the technology,"" he said. ""We can be agile enough to deliver a much better deal for the customer."" Mr Duffy will retain his current position in the combined group, as will CYBG chairman Jim Pettigrew.

Debit card payments more popular than cash,"Debit card payments have overtaken cash use for the first time, new figures show, as contactless technology takes a firm hold on day-to-day spending. A total of 13.2 billion debit card payments were made last year, a rise of 14% on the previous year, according to banking trade body UK Finance. That outstripped the 13.1 billion cash payments made, as the use of notes and coins dropped by 15%. An estimated 3.4 million people hardly used cash at all during the year. The annual report into the way consumers make payments revealed that the UK is a nation of spontaneous spenders. Only 15% of the 38.8 billion payments made in the UK in 2017 were for regular bills and commitments. These purchases have increasingly been made using contactless technology, when cards are placed on or near a reader without the need to enter a personal four-digit number. The frequency of contactless payments almost doubled in a year to 5.6 billion payments last year. This was most commonly used in supermarkets, but card suppliers say that public transport and car parking have also become regular spots for the use of contactless cards. Who do you trust after cash? Animal fat to stay in future banknotes Old Charles Darwin paper Â£10 notes out, new 10p coins in In 2017, contactless cards accounted for 15% of all payments, but UK Finance - which represents the major banks - has predicted this proportion to rise to 36% a decade later. The growth of online shopping and card acceptance among smaller traders would lead to further growth in debit card use in general, UK Finance said. Young consumers, aged between 25 and 34, were most likely to make contactless payments. Those who shunned cash entirely were also most likely to be among this age group. On the flipside, there were 2.2 million people who predominantly used cash when shopping last year. Debit card use may have overtaken cash use faster than the industry expected, but notes and coins still had an important role to play, according to Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance. ""The choice of payment options available in the UK is allowing people to choose to pay the way that best suits them,"" he said. ""But we are far from becoming a cash-free society and despite the UK transforming to an economy where cash is less important than it once was, it will remain a payment method that continues to be valued and preferred by many."" Consumers using cards can be hit by IT failures Adam Herson, a director at Barclaycard Mobile Payments, suggested that card technology would increasingly be found in anything from watches to other ""wearable"" items. ""More recently, we have seen a surge in the use of wearable and mobile payments, creating new, exciting opportunities for both shoppers and brands. Consumers are increasingly able to match their payment accessory or device to their lifestyle or fashion taste. We expect this increase in popularity to continue for the foreseeable future,"" he said. However, consumers vulnerability to failures in technology have been made clear in recent IT problems - most notably the shutdown in Visa services following a hardware failure which left European customers unable to make some payments for several hours. At the time, earlier this month, Visa apologised and said the outage was not down to ""unauthorised access or a cyber attack"".

Parsons Green Tube bomber failings revealed,"Experts considered removing the Parsons Green Tube bomber from a list of extremists 10 days before he carried out the attack, a review has found. Ahmed Hassan, 18,took a bomb onto the Tube last Septemberafter more than 18 months of concerns that he had been radicalised by the Islamic State group. A review into how much police and other authorities knew of Hassan has been published on Monday. It reveals a series of errors made by police and Surrey County Council. In a letter to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee,external, the errors outlined include failing to take into account the full risks to the public posed by his suspected mental health problems, failing to bring in a national de-radicalisation expert and an apparent lack of a plan to closely monitor the teenager's progress. Ahmed Hassan arrived in the UK in October 2015 as an unaccompanied child migrant and he was placed in the care of Surrey County Council. This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball The following January, he told an immigration official that he had been trained to kill in Iraq by IS fighters. This was a key piece of evidence at his trial but it is not mentioned in the Home Office letter to MPs. In a further interview, he told officials he had been groomed to fight and also disclosed that he was struggling with mental illness. Despite these early warnings that Hassan could pose a risk, police and council officials running Surrey's Preventing Violent Extremism programme did not formally discuss how to de-radicalise him until June 2016. At that point, Surrey County Council placed Hassan on the government's flagship ""Channel"" programme, which aims to turn around the most dangerous potential terrorists in the UK. But it never asked the Home Office for a nationally-recognised expert mentor to work with Hassan. Ron and Penny Jones, his foster carers, have separately told the BBC that Surrey only asked them to join a course in preventing extremism after the bombing had happened. This video can not be played Bomber's foster parent Penny Jones: ""We feel betrayed"" Hassan repeatedly went missing while under Surrey County Council's care and the letter says police Prevent officers, and therefore the Channel panel, failed to ""fully consider these absences further"" as part of the overall pattern of Hassan's behaviour. When the Channel panel once more considered whether Hassan had made progress in the summer of 2017, it relied on reports from a college tutor and Mr and Mrs Jones. Both repeatedly raised concerns about the teenager's behaviour and state of mind - but the letter says the panel  ""did not clearly resolve"" these fears. And on 5 September, 10 days before the attack, the same panel considered that Hassan's case could soon be closed. Hassan left his bomb in the carriage and left the train ""The Channel panel were unable to establish a holistic overview taking into account the entirety of Hassan's turbulent background, mental health concerns, and ongoing behaviour and remarks,"" the letter says. ""National Channel Practitioners Guidance was not fully followed in this case with regard to record keeping, frequency of vulnerability assessments and intelligence developments along with the regular Channel panel meetings,"" says the letter. ""Channel panels will be reminded of the need for structured support plans in each case, and the need to regularly review progress in open cases."" The letter does not suggest that either Hassan's foster carers or college tutors should carry any blame for failing to stop the bombing. In a statement, Surrey County Council said: ""We fully acknowledge that our work with other agencies in this case wasn't as good as it should have been,"" and added that it had ""told Mr and Mrs Jones about Hassan's background at the time he was placed with them"". However, Mrs Jones has told the BBC that the county's risk assessment on Hassan, which she received hours before his arrival, did not detail the teenager's admissions of terrorism training. Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""The internal review into how the Parsons Green case was handled allowed the Home Office, Surrey County Council and the police to take swift action to address the issues raised. ""The Home Office and partner organisations have accepted the majority of the recommendations and following this case we had already put in place processes to ensure better communication between immigration and Prevent partners, as well as reviewing how Channel procedures are monitored. ""We should not allow this case to undermine all the good work taking place across the country.""

Brexit could cost ÃÂ£1k per household,"Households could be left up to Â£1,000 a year worse off because of Brexit trade barriers, a report will suggest. Global consultancy firm Oliver Wyman will say that under the most negative scenario of high import tariffs and high regulatory barriers the cost to the economy could total Â£27bn. Business profits for supermarkets and restaurants could be wiped out because of supply chain disruption. A rise in costs would likely be passed on to consumers, the report will argue. The analysis, to be published next week and seen by the BBC, will make clear that even under the most favourable scenario of no tariffs and few regulatory barriers, there are likely to be increased ""red tape"" costs. It will suggest that increased paperwork and delays for customs checks are likely to increase household costs by 1% a year, or Â£250 per household. The total cost to the economy would be Â£6.8bn. Big business issues Brexit warning to May Carney: Brexit has cost households Â£900 Brexit: All you need to know Economists who support Brexit said that reports of significant economic costs post-Brexit were ""alarmist"" and that by focusing on the domestic economy, Britain outside the European Union could flourish. The government has also made it clear that it wants a relationship with the EU that is as ""frictionless"" as possible when it comes to trade. ""While the outcomes of Brexit remain unclear, our analysis shows that any scenario will increase costs for UK households,"" said Duncan Brewer of Oliver Wyman, a consultancy firm that has done major pieces of work on the economic impact of Brexit for the financial services sector and retailers. It has also worked for the government. The analysis warns that supermarket chains could see profits drop substantially ""A Brexit deal that results in no new tariffs with the EU is still likely to increase the red tape costs of imports, driving down profits for businesses, and driving up prices for consumers,"" Mr Brewer continued. ""Looking across the whole supply chain and taking into account multiple different Brexit outcomes, one thing is clear: Brexit will decrease profits for consumer businesses. ""The only question is by how much, which will depend on what deal is negotiated. ""While businesses will do all they can to absorb rising costs, we expect they will be forced to gradually put up prices for shoppers. If they don't, profits could vanish."" The Oliver Wyman analysis looks at different sectors and the possible consequences of Britain's new relationship with the EU. It will suggest that a supermarket chain with annual takings of Â£10bn would see profits fall by a third under the most benign Brexit scenario modelled. Prices would need to rise by 2.3% to compensate and ensure the business made as much profit as it did pre-Brexit. The report follows a number of studies, including by government officials,that say there is likely to be a negative economic impact from Brexit. The Bank of England has alsosaid that the Brexit process has already cost households money. Gerard Lyons, of the Economists for Brexit group, which supports Britain leaving the EU, said that although there might be a short-term ""hit"" from leaving the EU and the political process had not been ""ideal"", the greater room for manoeuvre for Britain once out of the union would have economic advantages. ""We need pro-growth policies, and should remember that 90% of global growth in the future will come from outside the euro-area,"" said Mr Lyons, a former chief economist of Standard Chartered bank and now chief economic strategist for Netwealth. He said: ""Judgements such as this [by Oliver Wyman] are far too pessimistic. ""Without the constraints that come from being a member of the EU, our economy can flourish.""

"Cause of art school fire 'will be found'Fire investigators promise a ""comprehensive and professional"" probe into the blaze at the Glasgow School of Art.","Residents forced to leave their homes after the Glasgow School of Art fire have been promised help. Glasgow City Council said it will also deploy more pest-controllers after reports of rodents in the surrounding area. A rest centre set up in the early hours of Saturday saw 11 people from affected buildings, but the council believes other people will have made their own arrangements initially. A task force is being set up to help. It will also deal with support for businesses in the Sauchiehall Street area - and the council said it is willing to discuss rates refunds and appeals. Council leader Susan Aitken said: ""Temporary accommodation was arranged for a those evacuated by the emergency services and that remains in place. ""However, we are conscious that there are people who initially made their own arrangements, or who may have been out of the city at the weekend, who could still need advice or temporary accommodation."" She added: ""We understand there are reports of rodents in the area and it is likely they have been displaced as drains fill with water during the firefighting operation. ""As it becomes clearer where they are being displaced to, we are putting additional pest control resources into the area to get on top of that situation."" Meanwhile Kier, the construction company in daily control of the Mackintosh building, said an agreed fire safety strategy had been implemented during the restoration project. In a statement it said: ""These included a smoke and heat detection system and regular evacuation tests as well as 24 hour, seven days a week security and fire warden patrols by a team of three guards, originally appointed by the client after the 2014 fire and subsequently by Kier. ""We continue to work with and support Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and our client as they determine the next steps for the Mackintosh building and site. ""We have a passionate team of local construction and crafts people, skilled conservators, supply chain and engineering specialists who have worked incredibly hard on this iconic landmark, and together we are all keen to do whatever we can to help moving forward."" Fire investigators have promised they will find out what caused the blaze. Assistant Chief Officer David McGowan said a ""comprehensive and professional"" probe will be carried out. He said it was still too early to speculate if the fire started in the art school or in a nearby building. Eight fire appliances remain at the scene of the blaze which broke out on Friday night, as ""small pockets"" of fire continue to be found. Some experts have warned the building may have to be demolished with rebuild costs predicted to be more than Â£100m. Demolition or restoration: What next for the Mack? How Glasgow earned its reputation as the 'Tinderbox City' Timeline: The art school's devastating years The world's love of Glasgow School of Art Assistant Chief Officer McGowan told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The fire investigation process swings into operation as soon as our operational crews are on the scene. ""They will look at situations and issues such as which fire safety measures were in place beforehand, what was supposed to be in place, witness statements, CCTV footage and working with our partners we will collate that information into what will be the one, truly-informed source of what actually happened in this fire."" As it was: the art school building was under reconstruction from the first fire in 2014 After the fire: the art school and a neighbouring building have been devastated, He added: ""We can't speculate now as to exactly where it started. The scene of devastation is vast, as we've all seen from the aerial photographs. ""Our investigators will pinpoint a particular area of the complex structure of the buildings and that will be reported on in the final fire investigation report. ""It's very important for people to understand that it's a complex process to investigate such a scale of fire - and it will take time. ""The reason it takes time is that we want to conduct an absolute, comprehensive and professional investigation into what happened. ""And I can give this guarantee that we will find out what happened in this fire, what the cause was and what the cause of the spread was."" This video can not be played David McGown, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service: ""We really want people to understand it will be a lengthy investigation."" Billy Hare, a professor of construction management at Glasgow Caledonian University has saidthere was a ""growing consensus"" the globally-significant building may have to be pulled down. He compared the intensity of the blaze with a fire at a building housing Victoria's nightclub in nearby Sauchiehall Street in March. Sturgeon says blaze is 'heartbreaking' The story of the fire and its aftermath Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire Within days of that fire,Glasgow City Council confirmed it would demolish the building.

The Labour politician, who is a director of the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, posted videos of the building  after being allowed close access by the fire service. He said: ""It was clear that the interior is almost entirely lost. ""The one thing that did strike me was that the main structural beams appear to remain largely intact and are tying the wall-heads back into the building. ""That was a reassuring sign that there hadn't been any obvious movement in the main facades of the building. So that gives us some hope that, like last time, there can be some hand-dismantling of the upper sections of the building and then a reinstatement eventually."" 'I assumed it was a social media blip', by Pauline McLean, BBC Scotland arts correspondent He added; ""Whatever needs to happen to make this building realised again as Mackintosh's vision has to happen. ""This is building is the pinnacle of achievement of British art nouveau architecture and it's my job as a member of Parliament to go down and say this building ought to be saved for the nation.""

The roads affected are Sauchiehall Street, Hill Street, Dalhousie Street, Renfrew Street and Garnethill Street. Access to business premises within the cordon will not be allowed until the area is deemed to be safe. Friday night's blaze, which also damaged the neighbouring O2 ABC venue, wasthe second to hit the Mackintosh building in four years. It was undergoing an extensive restoration, costing up to Â£35m, while staff and students worked in neighbouring buildings on the campus. No-one was injured by the fire, which was reported at about 23:20 on Friday. At the height of the blaze, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene and nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. Hoses brought water from the River Clyde to help fight the flames. The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer.

Migrant children 'held in cages',"The authorities released this image of illegal migrants inside a large cage - reporters said they saw unaccompanied children in similar conditions Reporters and Democratic lawmakers have been allowed inside a detention centre that lies at the heart of a growing storm over a new US policy separating migrant children from their parents. Authorities did not allow photos or videos to be taken inside the centre, but US Customs and Border Protection later released several images. Former First Lady Laura Bush has compared it to the internment camps used for Japanese-Americans during World War Two. A Democratic congressman who visited the site said it was ""nothing short of a prison"". The Texas facility is known as Ursula, though immigrants are reportedly calling it La Perrera - dog kennel in Spanish - in reference to the cages used to hold children and adults who have ended up there after crossing the border from Mexico illegally. ""One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips [crisps] and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets,""the Associated Press reports,external. This image from the US Customs and Border Protection shows the foil blankets given to children Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley led the team of lawmakers to the site in the town of McAllen on Sunday. He hit the headlines earlier this month whenhe was turned away from another facility housing some 1,500 boys in a disused Walmart store,external. Speaking to CNN after the visit to Ursula, he said: ""In wire-mesh, chain linked cages that are about 30x30 [feet], a lot of young folks put into them. ""I must say though, far fewer than I was here two weeks ago. I was told that buses full (of children) were taken away before I arrived. ""That was one of my concerns, that essentially, when you have to give lengthy notice, you end up a little bit of a show rather than seeing what's really going on in these centres."" Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen and Vermont Congressman Peter Welch expressed shock and anger over the conditions they saw: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Inside Ursula, more than 1,100 illegal immigrants are waiting to be processed. They have been separated into three wings: unaccompanied children, lone adults and parents with their children. Officials said nearly 200 of those being held there were unaccompanied minors and another 500 were parents with their children. The Los Angeles Times, which also sent a team there, described the 72,000 sq ft facility as ""clean and spare, with bare concrete floors"". A patrol agent currently in charge of the site, John Lopez, told the paper the 42 portable toilets on site are cleaned three times a day. There are three paramedics, two medical members of staff and 310 employees - but no mental health staff, or training, the paper notes. The main lights in the building remain on at all times. Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents US attorney general quotes Bible to defend separating families Is US only country to separate migrant children? Nearly 60 miles away, in the town of Brownsville, some 1,500 boys are being housed inside a building that was once a Walmart superstore. The boys, aged 10 to 17, were all caught illegally crossing the border. It is America's largest facility for such minors, and numbers have increased in the past month by several hundred. Senator Merkley's Facebook Live on 4 June showing security officials denying him entry to that site - known as Casa Padre - led to questions about conditions there. Last week, news organisations were given a tour. This video can not be played Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion No cages were mentioned, but the accommodation was likened to dorm rooms inside a giant warehouse. To accommodate for the growing numbers since the new ""zero-tolerance"" policy went into force, cots have been added to sleeping areas in the Casa Padre. The New York Times described it as ""clean, massive and brightly lit"",external, with the children given classes six hours each week day and outdoor play time for two hours a day. They have 48 medical staff and three on call doctors on hand. ""Those kids inside who have been separated from their parents are already being traumatised,"" Senator Merkley warned. ""It doesn't matter whether the floor is swept and the bed-sheets tucked in tight."" Officials say they are trying to keep siblings together and not separate children under four or younger from their parents. But Anne Chandler, who's running a non-profit project for migrant children found on the southern US border, told Texas Monthlyshe had heard stories of ""kids that are very young, that are breastfeeding babies and under three in the shelters, separated from their parents"".,external The head of the Tahirih Justice Centre in Houston said she had seen cases where parents had not been told ahead of time that their child was being taken away, and instead were told by immigration officers that their child required a bath, only to not be returned. ""I was talking to one mother, and she said, ""Don't take my child away,"" and the child started screaming and vomiting and crying hysterically, and she asked the officers, ""Can I at least have five minutes to console her?"" They said no,"" Ms Chandler told the magazine. Authorities say they do not separate parents with children under five A rights worker who visited the Ursula facility at the weekend told the Associated Press she had spoken to a 16-year-old girl who was left in charge of an unaccompanied toddler for three days and tasked with changing the child's nappies. ""She had to teach other kids in the cell to change her diaper,"" Michelle Brane, from the Women's Refugee Commission, said. The girl - who was four years old - was later reunited with her aunt, but the process took time because she did not speak Spanish but a language indigenous to Guatemala, the agency reports. ""She was so traumatised that she wasn't talking,"" Ms Brane said, describing the girl. ""She was just curled up in a little ball."" She is not alone in voicing concerns over the long-term effects of separating adults and their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics warned last week that""highly stressful experiences, including family separation, can cause irreparable harm to lifelong development by disrupting a child's brain architecture"",external. Separately, authorities have announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F). Local lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as ""totally inhumane"" and ""outrageous"", adding: ""It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility.""

Child migrant separations explained,"The number of people trying to cross into the US has risen sharply recently US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has defended the separation of migrant children from their parents at the border with Mexico, a measure that has faced increasing criticism. The ""zero-tolerance"" policy he announced last month sees adults who try to cross the border, many planning to seek asylum, being placed in custody and facing criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of minors are now being housed in detention centres, and kept away from their parents. Over a recent six-week period, nearly 2,000 children were separated from their parents after illegally crossing the border, figures released on Friday said. Mr Sessions said those entering the US irregularly would be criminally prosecuted, a change to a long-standing policy of charging most of those crossing for the first time with a misdemeanour offence. As the adults are being charged with a crime, the children that come with them are being separated and deemed unaccompanied minors. Advocates of separations point out that hundreds of children are taken from parents who commit crimes in the US on a daily basis. As such, they are placed in custody of the Department of Health and Human Services and sent to a relative, foster home or a shelter - officials at those places are said to be already running out of space to house them. Many of the families fled violence in their countries and planned to seek asylum in the US In recent days, a former Walmart in Texas has been converted into a detention centre for immigrant children. Officials have also announced plans to erect tent cities to hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F). Local lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as ""totally inhumane"" and ""outrageous"", adding: ""It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility."" US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials estimatethat around 1,500 people are arrested each day for illegally,externalcrossing the border. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas In the first two weeks of the ""zero-tolerance"" new approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that came with them, according to the CBP. The practice, however, was apparently happening way before that, with reports sayingmore than 700 families had been affected,externalbetween October and April. Not only the families crossing irregularly are being targeted, activists who work at the border say, but also those presenting themselves at a port of entry. The Casa Padre shelter in Brownsville, Texas is a former Walmart Murals adorn the walls of the converted Walmart ""This is really extreme, it's nothing like we have seen before,"" said Michelle BranÃ©, director of Migrant Rights and Justice at the Women's Refugee Commission, a New York-based non-governmental organisation that is helping some of these people. In many of the cases, the families have already been reunited, after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months. Family separations had been reported in previous administrations but campaigners say the numbers then were very small. Mr Trump has blamed Democrats for the policy, saying ""we have to break up the families"" because of a law that ""Democrats gave us"". It is unclear what law he is referring to, but no law has been passed by the US Congress that mandates that migrant families be separated. Fact-checkers say that the only thing that has changed is the Justice Department's decision to criminally prosecute parents for a first-time border crossing offence. Because their children are not charged with a crime, they are not permitted to be jailed together. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Under a 1997 court decision known as the Flores settlement, children who come to the US alone are required to be released to their parents, an adult relative, or other caretaker. If those options are all exhausted, then the government must find the ""least restrictive"" setting for the child ""without unnecessary delay"". The case initially applied to unaccompanied child arrivals, but a 2016 court decision expanded it to include children brought with their parents. According to the New York Times,external, the government has three options under the Flores settlement - release whole families together, pass a law to allow for families to be detained together, or break up families. It is worth noting that Mr Trump's chief of staff John Kelly - who previously served as the head of Homeland Security - said in 2017 that the White House was considering separating families as a means of deterring parents from trying to cross the border. The number of families trying to enter the US overland without documentationis on the rise,external. For the fourth consecutive month in May, there was an increase in the number of people caught crossing the border irregularly - in comparison with the same month of 2017, the rise was of 160%. ""The trends are clear: this must end,""Mr Sessions said last month.,external It is not clear, though, if the tougher measures will stop the migrants. Most are fleeing violence and poverty in Central American countries like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras and staying, for many, could mean a death sentence. This video can not be played Lorry full of migrants found in Texas Human rights groups, campaigners and Democrats have sharply criticised the separations, warning of the long-term trauma on the children. Meanwhile the UN Human Rights Office called on the US to ""immediately halt"" them. ButMr Sessions has defended the measure, saying the separations were ""not our goal"" but it was not always possible to keep parents and children together. No other country has a policy of separating families who intend to seek asylum, activists say. In the European Union, which faced its worst migrant crisis in decades three years ago, most asylum seekers are held in reception centres while their requests are processed - under the bloc's Dublin Regulation, people must be registered in their first country of arrival. Measures may vary in different member states but families are mostly kept together. Most of the families have been separated while trying to cross illegally, activists say Even in Australia, which has some of the world's most restrictive policies, including the detention of asylum seekers who arrive by boat in controversial offshore centres, there is no policy to separate parents from their children upon arrival. Meanwhile,Canada has a deal with the USthat allows it to deny asylum requests from those going north. It has tried to stem the number of migrants crossing outside border posts after a surge of Haitians and Nigerians coming from its neighbour. However, there were no reports of families being forcibly separated. ""What the US is doing now, there is no equivalent,"" said Michael Flynn, executive director of the Geneva-based Global Detention Project, a non-profit group focused on the rights of detained immigrants. ""There's nothing like this anywhere"". Republicans in the House of Representatives have unveiled legislation to keep families together but it is unlikely to win the support of its own party or the White House.

Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - Hunt,"This video can not be played Theresa May says taxpayers will have to help fund the NHS funding boost Tax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says. Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way. The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by Â£20bn by 2023. Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"". Kuenssberg: 'No magic money tree' The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming. But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money. ""Some of the extra funding I am promising will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left."" However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"". In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"". She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival. ""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said. At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years. That means by 2023 the budget will be Â£20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. Currently, NHS England spends Â£114bn a year. But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%. The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about Â£4bn - although it will be up to theWelshandScottishgovernments to decide how that is spent. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system. Like the prime minister, Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes. Economic growth would mean the size of the public purse would grow, which leaves more for public services. Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt the savings ""won't be anything like enough."" In fact, some have questioned the very idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" with the Liberal Democrats even asking the UK Statistics Authority to rule whether the government is right to claim there is one. The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the concept was ""tosh"". And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today there will be an ""increased burden of taxation"" to fund the NHS It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that. But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air. What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for? Read more from Hugh Ministers say there will be more details in the Budget in the autumn. There will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families. The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are. The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to. A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax. Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government. The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise Â£4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly Â£10bn. Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option. Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year. Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at: The workforce Technology Buildings Productivity The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015. A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community. Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time. In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support."" Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention. Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive."" The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.

"Debit card payments more popular than cashMore than three million people hardly used cash at all last year, according to the banking trade body.BusinessComments","Debit card payments have overtaken cash use for the first time, new figures show, as contactless technology takes a firm hold on day-to-day spending. A total of 13.2 billion debit card payments were made last year, a rise of 14% on the previous year, according to banking trade body UK Finance. That outstripped the 13.1 billion cash payments made, as the use of notes and coins dropped by 15%. An estimated 3.4 million people hardly used cash at all during the year. The annual report into the way consumers make payments revealed that the UK is a nation of spontaneous spenders. Only 15% of the 38.8 billion payments made in the UK in 2017 were for regular bills and commitments. These purchases have increasingly been made using contactless technology, when cards are placed on or near a reader without the need to enter a personal four-digit number. The frequency of contactless payments almost doubled in a year to 5.6 billion payments last year. This was most commonly used in supermarkets, but card suppliers say that public transport and car parking have also become regular spots for the use of contactless cards. Who do you trust after cash? Animal fat to stay in future banknotes Old Charles Darwin paper Â£10 notes out, new 10p coins in In 2017, contactless cards accounted for 15% of all payments, but UK Finance - which represents the major banks - has predicted this proportion to rise to 36% a decade later. The growth of online shopping and card acceptance among smaller traders would lead to further growth in debit card use in general, UK Finance said. Young consumers, aged between 25 and 34, were most likely to make contactless payments. Those who shunned cash entirely were also most likely to be among this age group. On the flipside, there were 2.2 million people who predominantly used cash when shopping last year. Debit card use may have overtaken cash use faster than the industry expected, but notes and coins still had an important role to play, according to Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance. ""The choice of payment options available in the UK is allowing people to choose to pay the way that best suits them,"" he said. ""But we are far from becoming a cash-free society and despite the UK transforming to an economy where cash is less important than it once was, it will remain a payment method that continues to be valued and preferred by many."" Consumers using cards can be hit by IT failures Adam Herson, a director at Barclaycard Mobile Payments, suggested that card technology would increasingly be found in anything from watches to other ""wearable"" items. ""More recently, we have seen a surge in the use of wearable and mobile payments, creating new, exciting opportunities for both shoppers and brands. Consumers are increasingly able to match their payment accessory or device to their lifestyle or fashion taste. We expect this increase in popularity to continue for the foreseeable future,"" he said. However, consumers vulnerability to failures in technology have been made clear in recent IT problems - most notably the shutdown in Visa services following a hardware failure which left European customers unable to make some payments for several hours. At the time, earlier this month, Visa apologised and said the outage was not down to ""unauthorised access or a cyber attack"".

Sussex Police said their inquiries were at an early stage, but the deaths were not being treated as suspicious. Emergency teams discovered the bodies at about 07:00 BST The emergency services were alerted on Sunday evening after a car was found in a car park. Eastbourne RNLI coxswain Mark Sawyer said the boy's body was recovered by the coastguard helicopter, and the woman's by the lifeboat.

Children 'held in solitary confinement',"This video can not be played Sheena Evelyn says her son was placed into solitary confinement, describing it as ""inhumane"" At least 40 children have been held in solitary confinement in young offenders institutions in the past year, the Victoria Derbyshire show has been told. The UN defines solitary confinement as being held for 22 hours a day without meaningful human contact. The government said child prisoners were never held in solitary confinement in England and Wales. But the Howard League for Penal Reform said it has been told of numerous incidents which amounted to it. The charity, which gives legal advice to children who phone from inside prisons, said callers used differing terminology to describe conditions of isolation. ""They would say that they are on bang-up, block, seg, there are many different names. But often, when you dig beneath that word or that phrase, what children are describing to me is being kept alone, in a room, for 22 hours or more a day,"" lawyer Laura Janes said. The UN defines solitary confinement as being held for 22 hours a day without meaningful human contact. There are about 900 under-18s serving jail sentences at any one time in England and Wales. Up to a third could expect to spend some time in isolation, a report from the Children's Commissioner said in 2015. To many people, this is an issue of semantics, with the government calling it ""segregation"" and ""isolation"" and maintaining the children have more than two hours of meaningful human contact a day. But this programme has been told by former inmates and medical professionals who have worked within these institutions, that children in isolation are held in conditions which meet the international definition for solitary confinement. Dr Heidi Hales from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, who has worked within children's prisons, said the government was ""hiding behind definitions"" by denying it was happening. ""There are young people who end up locked in their cells for longer than 22 hours each day, therefore they are in de facto solitary confinement,"" she said. 'Michael' was 16 when he says he was placed in solitary confinement as a punishment. He was in an institution for a drugs offence. ""Maybe in some cases some people need to be away from other people, but the majority of the time it can be for something like having phones. It's a punishment. ""There's people screaming and shouting, you can't sleep. You've got to think about how you're going to fight your case. ""You're a child, not an adult to comprehend these things. ""It's hard as a child to mentally prepare yourself to be confined for 23 hours, 23 and a half hours a day with just a mattress and a sink. It's mentally challenging. Last July, the High Court ruled a 16-year-old boy's human rights were breached by his being kept in solitary confinement for 23-and-a-half hours a day at Feltham Young Offenders Institution. A judge said the boy was unlawfully denied access to education and the ability to mix with other inmates. Dr Hales said she wanted the practice banned. ""There is an increased risk of self-harm and suicide-related behaviour and there's increased risk when they do come out then there'll be more violent behaviour,"" she said. ""So it's bad for them and it's bad for the people around them."" A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Segregation can be an important last resort for limited periods when young people are putting themselves or others at risk. ""But they are not held in solitary confinement and continue to have access to education and religious services, outdoor exercise and entitlements to social and legal visits.""

Breaking|Breaking newsThree killed by train in south LondonThree people are killed after being struck by train near Loughborough Junction in south London.London,"It is understood that spray cans were found near the bodies of the three men Three men have died after being struck by a train near a south London station. It is understood that spray cans were found near the bodies of the men, who are believed to be in their 20s. Police were called to Loughborough Junction station, near Brixton, at about 07:30 BST and the three were pronounced dead at the scene. The deaths are being treated as ""unexplained"" and police are investigating how the men came to be on the tracks. British Transport Police (BTP) said it is investigating whether the men were graffiti artists and confirmed that they were not employed to be on the tracks. Supt Matt Allingham told the BBC: ""When graffiti artists do get on to the tracks, there is massive risk."" Evidence bags taken from the scene by officers contained spray cans He said the bodies were spotted by another train driver who contacted police, and confirmed the men ""were dead for a while before we turned up"". ""We're still trying to identify the train that actually hit the individuals,"" he said. Read more on this and other stories from London Police officers remain at the scene where they are working to identify the men and inform their families. Evidence bags taken from the scene later on Monday contained spray cans and items of clothing. Officers could be seen taking photos of graffiti alongside the track as part of their inquiries. Police are carrying out investigations on the track near Loughborough Junction station It is believed the victims could have been struck overnight, when freight trains use the rail network more frequently as the passenger pathways are clear. Speaking about the spot where the bodies were found, Supt Allingham said there ""isn't a sort of safe refuge up there, so if somebody was on those tracks there wouldn't be anywhere for them to go to avoid the train"". ""If they've been caught in that section of track when a train came through then they really wouldn't have had much options,"" he added. Police were unable to confirm whether the men were hit by a freight or passenger service. Supt Allingham said they were ""aware that there are a number of speculative comments about this on social media"", but said it was ""too early for us to comment on their reasons for being on the track"". Officers could be seen taking photos of graffiti as part of their inquiries It is believed the victims could have been struck overnight Supt Allingham said officers ""have delivered the sad news to one family"", and are working to identify and locate the next of kin for the other two men. Det Supt Gary Richardson said his ""thoughts are with the family and friends of these three people"". ""My team are now working hard to understand what happened and how these three people came to lose their life on the railway,"" he added. He asked anyone who was near the station on Monday morning or ""saw something which they think might be relevant"" to contact police. Loughborough Junction is located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations The station remains open, but BTP warned that train services will be delayed while inquiries are carried out. Network Rail said it was ""assisting the British Transport Police as they investigate an incident at Loughborough Junction this morning"". London Ambulance Service said it was called to the station just before 09:00. ""We sent a number of ambulance crews but sadly three people were found dead at the scene,"" a spokesperson added. It is ""too early to speculate"" how the three men came to be on the tracks, police have said Rail regulator the Office of Rail and Road has opened a preliminary investigation. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said his ""heart goes out to the families"" of the people killed. Loughborough Junction is an elevated station managed by Thameslink and located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations.

"Medical cannabis ban 'bizarre and cruel'An MP leading an all-party group looking at medical cannabis calls for ""more fundamental reform"".UK","This video can not be played Charlotte Caldwell said the medication ordeal had been 'horrific and cruel' A senior MP leading an all-party group looking at medical cannabis has called the existing laws ""bizarre and cruel"". Sir Mike Penning MP has called for ""fundamental reform"" of the system. ""Medical cannabis is a health issue, not a misuse of drugs issue,"" Sir Mike said in a statement. ""It's about patients and relieving suffering."" It follows the home secretary's decision to grant 12-year-old Billy Caldwell temporary access to cannabis oil medication to treat his epilepsy. Mr Penning, who is the proposed chairman of the new All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Medical Cannabis Under Prescription, said: ""It's bizarre and cruel that we have a system that allows the medical use of strong opiates, but bars the medical use of cannabis. ""The current structures within government on this issue are not fit for purpose. We need to move this from criminal justice to health."" He said he supported reclassifying cannabis under the law so it would be regarded as having a medicinal use. Last Monday officials at Heathrow airport confiscated Billy's cannabis oil,  which his mother Charlotte uses to treat his severe epileptic seizures. She had been attempting to bring a supply into the UK from Canada. Ms Caldwell says her son's seizures dramatically reduce when he takes the oil, which contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is illegal in the UK. Following the confiscation, Billy was admitted to hospital in London after his seizures ""intensified"". His condition led to Home Secretary Sajid Javid later approving the return of some of the cannabis oil, after doctors made clear it was a medical emergency. Billy was admitted to Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London on Friday The Home Office has granted a limited licence for the drug to be administered to the child in hospital for 20 days. Billy's case has prompted a renewed debate on the legislation surrounding medical cannabis. Sir Mike said many more families needed ""urgent"" access to medical cannabis, adding that the medical use of cannabis was ""totally separate from recreational use"". CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant. A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy. Source:NHS Choices,external Sir Mike is one of a growing number of MPs from all parties who support the reform of the laws regarding the medicinal use of cannabis and cannabis products. Fellow Conservative Crispin Blunt MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform, said the existing law was ""frankly absurd"". Ex-Tory health minister Dan Poulter said the current situation was ""ridiculous"" and pledged to push for a change in the law. Former drugs minister Norman Baker, a Liberal Democrat, has described the confiscation as ""cruel and inhumane"", and renewed calls for a law change citing cannabis's ""useful medical properties"". But UCL's Dr Michael Bloomfield said the use of medical marijuana is ""far from straightforward"". He said in some jurisdictions the drug's use for medical conditions is ""a potential way of decriminalising cannabis through the back door"". Many other countries, including much of the US, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have legalised the substance's use medicinally.

"Virgin Money bought by CYBG for Â£1.7bnThe new merged company will be the UK's sixth largest bank, with six million customers.","The owner of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, CYBG, has agreed to buy Virgin Money for Â£1.7bn. Under the deal, all the group's retail customers will be moved to Virgin Money over the next three years. It will be the UK's sixth-largest bank, with about six million customers, but 1,500 jobs are likely to go. CYBG said it had agreed with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group to license the Virgin Money brand for Â£12m a year, rising to Â£15m later. Virgin Group is Virgin Money's biggest shareholder with a 34.8% stake in the business. Don't bank on it: why we fail to switch our accounts Under the terms of the deal, Virgin Money shareholders will get 1.2125 new CYBG shares for every Virgin Money share they hold, and will end up owning about 38% of the combined business. CYBG said the combined group would have about 9,500 employees, but it intended to reduce that total by about a sixth, suggesting about 1,500 jobs would go. It said some of those job losses would be achieved through ""natural attrition"" as there was little overlap in customer-facing roles. The Unite union expressed ""deep unease"" at the prospect of the takeover, adding it was ""vital that the skilled and experienced workforce are given assurances that branches and contact centres will not be closed"". Virgin Money, which was founded in 1995, expanded its business in 2011 when it bought the remnants of Northern Rock for about Â£747m.

That is why the Open Banking scheme - opening traditional accounts to specialist services from smaller players - appeared to be a potential game changer for fintechs and banking upstarts. But the TSB fiasco may well have damaged consumer confidence in these companies being able to provide more customer-friendly tech than the big banks. With this deal, the focus shifts to a more traditional form of competition - growing a business to a sufficient size to take on the incumbents at their own game. CYBG said the takeover would ""bring together the complementary strengths of two successful challenger banks to create the UK's first true national competitor to the large incumbent banks"". Its chief executive, David Duffy, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're going to become a competitor of scale.""

Defence spend rise urged over Russian threat,"The UK's armed forces need increased funding in order to meet threats from states including Russia, MPs have said. The Commons Defence Committee report,externalsaid the level of defence spending should rise from 2% to 3% of total GDP. Chairman Julian Lewis said this would also help the UK fill existing financial ""black holes"". The Ministry of Defence said the UK has the biggest defence budget in Europe and continues to exceed Nato's 2% spending target. Earlier this year, ex-commander of the UK's Maritime Forces Rear Admiral Alex Burton said Britain was in danger of losing its status as a ""credible military power"" and called for a rise in defence spending. UK military credibility 'at risk' over cuts What's happening to defence spending? UK 'must prepare for Russia fight' In the committee's report, called Beyond 2 Per Cent, MPs said that failure to finance the military on a sustainable basis made it ""very difficult"" to have a long-term defence strategy. Increased spending was the ""only solution"" at a time when the UK faced a renewed threat from Russia and increasing challenges from terrorism, extremism and cyber-warfare, the MPs said. The report said defence spending was ""far too low"" and the government ""needs to apply the resources that are necessary to keep this country safe"". It must move the level of defence expenditure back towards 3% of GDP, as it was in the mid-1990s, it said. The committee warned of ""serious deficiencies in the quantities of armour, armoured vehicles and artillery available to the British Army"". The lack of vehicle-mounted anti-tank weapons and self-propelled artillery and the need for modernisation of rocket artillery left the Army ""at serious risk of being outgunned by its Russian counterpart"", it said. Other defence needs identified included: Greater anti-submarine warfare capacity The maintenance of the Army at a minimum of 82,000 personnel A layered air defence system A Royal Navy carrier group capable of protecting the new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers In January, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson announced a new review, the Defence Modernisation Programme, focusing solely on military defence. Mr Williamson has indicated he will demand more money if the review deems it necessary. The review's findings are expected to be revealed in the coming weeks. In December,analysis by the House of Commons Library,externalfound that between 2010 and 2015 the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) budget had fallen by Â£8bn in real terms. Since then, spending has stabilised and in the last financial year (April 2016 - March 2017), Â£35.3bn was spent on defence. In 2016, the UK had the fifth biggest defence budget - the highest of all EU countries - according to an international militarystudy,external. Committee chairman Mr Lewis said:  ""The government now needs to look beyond the 2% minimum on defence spending, and begin moving towards a figure of 3%, to place our defence policy on a sustainable basis to meet new threats and fill existing financial 'black holes'. ""Defence is constantly described as the first duty of government. ""The MDP is the government's opportunity to show that it means what it says."" A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The defence secretary launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our armed forces in the face of intensifying threats and, while we welcome the Defence Committee's preliminary report, we will not speculate on the outcome of the programme before we share our headline conclusions.""

Brexit trade barriers 'may cost UK ÃÂ£27bn',"Households could be left up to Â£1,000 a year worse off because of Brexit trade barriers, a report will suggest. Global consultancy firm Oliver Wyman will say that under the most negative scenario of high import tariffs and high regulatory barriers the cost to the economy could total Â£27bn. Business profits for supermarkets and restaurants could be wiped out because of supply chain disruption. A rise in costs would likely be passed on to consumers, the report will argue. The analysis, to be published next week and seen by the BBC, will make clear that even under the most favourable scenario of no tariffs and few regulatory barriers, there are likely to be increased ""red tape"" costs.

Theresa May unveils ÃÂ£20bn boost for NHS,"This video can not be played Mrs May said the extra funding amounted to billions of pounds a year extra for the NHS The NHS in England is to get an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 as a 70th ""birthday present"", Theresa May says. It means the Â£114bn budget will rise by an average of 3.4% annually - but that is still less than the 3.7% average rise the NHS has had since 1948. The prime minister said this would be funded partly by a ""Brexit dividend"", but also hinted at tax rises. Labour said the government had failed to fund the NHS properly and was relying on a ""hypothetical"" windfall. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour's taxation plans meant his party could match the Conservatives' spending plans and ""will go further"". In her BBC interview, Mrs May did not spell out how the Â£20bn a year would be funded but said: ""As a country we will be contributing more, a bit more, but also we will have that sum of money that is available from the European Union."" But Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"". The Conservative MP accused the government of using ""populist arguments rather than evidence"". And the director of economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),Paul Johnson, has tweeted to say ""there is no Brexit dividend"",external. NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The five-year funding settlement covers just front-line budgets overseen by NHS England. About a 10th of the overall health budget is held by other bodies for things such as training and healthy lifestyle programmes, including stop smoking services and obesity prevention programmes. The BBC understands these will be protected, but beyond that it is unclear what will happen to them. The 2015 spending review - the last time a five-year settlement was announced - saw these budgets cut to help pay for an Â£8bn increase in NHS England's budget. 2019-20 - 3.6% 2020 - 21 - 3.6% 2021-22 - 3.1% 2022-23 - 3.1% 2023-24 - 3.4% All figures are above inflation The announcement means extra money will also be made available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mrs May acknowledged that pressure had been growing on the NHS, which was founded 70 years ago, and said her formal announcement on Monday would be about ""securing its future"". ""We're going to ensure there's a 10-year plan for the NHS,"" she said. ""That will be a plan for world-class health care - more doctors, more nurses. It means extra money - significantly more money going into the NHS."" This video can not be played Ashworth: Labour will 'go further' on NHS spending than the Conservatives Mr Ashworth told the BBC's Sunday Politics that Labour's tax plans meant it would be able to spend more but added the exact percentage of how much it could increase spending by would have to wait until the chancellor presented his own spending plans. And shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the government announcement as a ""publicity stunt"", adding: ""Can you imagine if I came forward with this? There'd be accusations of magic money trees. This is a magic money forest that's come out this morning."" Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the government's settlement was the ""minimum"" that was needed. ""After almost a decade of austerity, the NHS has a lot of catching up to do."" By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Step back from the big figures and the arguments about Brexit and there is something significant in Theresa May's announcement. A Conservative prime minister promising more money for public services, with the implication that taxes could go up to pay for it. Because when Mrs May talks about ""contributing more as a country"" that is what she means. You'll struggle to find a politician arguing against a boost for the NHS, but there might just be one or two Tories privately questioning whether this portrays them as a tax-and-spend party. Support for the NHS is such a big political prize that Mrs May appears willing to go against traditional Conservative low-tax instincts. The government clearly feels the detail on funding is for another day. There will be difficult decisions ahead - but the prime minister appears to be saying ""trust me"". Mr Hopson also pointed out that the government needed to work out what it was going to do about social care run by councils. Ministers have promised the system, covering care homes and help at home, will be reformed soon to ensure there is better access to services. And Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents healthcare organisations, said the announcement ""isn't a bonanza by any means"" and that it fell short of the of the 4% extra-a-year figure an independent report had suggested was needed. However, he added: ""It's a lot better than we've been used to over the last few years."" And Ian Dalton, head of regulator NHS Improvement, said the settlement was good news for the NHS and would ""enable the dedicated staff in our NHS to go on improving the care we can offer the patients"". In her BBC interview, Mrs May said the funding boost was partly coming from a ""Brexit dividend"". ""Some people may remember seeing a figure on the side of a bus a while back of Â£350m a week in cash,"" she said. The PM references the controversial Â£350m a week claim seen on a bus used during the EU referendum campaign ""I can tell you that what I'm announcing will mean that in 2023-24 there will be about Â£600m a week, more in cash, going into the NHS. ""That will be through the Brexit dividend. The fact that we're no longer sending vast amounts of money every year to the EU once we leave the EU."" But she also conceded that ""as a country"" we will need to contribute more. She did not spell out that would require tax rises, although a recent report by the IFS said they would be needed because it was hard to imagine the money could be found from economic growth or raiding other areas of government spending. And Mr Johnson said the government had accepted Brexit would weaken the public finances and the financial settlement with the EU plus commitments to replace EU funding ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years. Does the Brexit dividend actually exist? There has been a lot of speculation that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt - supported by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens - had been pushing for close to 4% a year extra. This was the figure many in the health service had said was needed to get services back on track and to improve waiting times. Reports have suggested the Treasury were initially offering less than 3%. So the 3.4% average appears to be a compromise between the two camps - and is close to the 3.7% average increase the NHS has seen if you look back over the past 70 years. So what will this mean? The final picture is somewhat clouded by the lack of clarity about what will happen to the wider health budget. However, talk to those working for the health service and they say this was the ""bare minimum"" that was needed to keep services going. They say tough choices will still be needed and that the public should not expect a dramatic increase in performance - targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are all being missed.

Melania Trump calls for child migrant action,"This video can not be played Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion The former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border. Writing in the Washington Post newspaper, she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel, immoral and heart-breaking. Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. Earlier Melania Trump made a rare statement expressing concern. Mrs Trump ""hates to see children separated from their families"", her spokeswoman said. Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents Migrant children 'held in cages' in Texas She repeated her husband's call for ""both sides"" to work on immigration reform as a solution. However, fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trump's attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped. In a recentsix-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separationsfollowing a crackdown on illegal border crossings. Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents. Laura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy. ""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,""she wrote in the Washington Post,external. ""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert."" Laura Bush, left, and Melania Trump have both spoken out about the treatment of child migrants ""These images are eerily reminiscent of theJapanese American internment camps of World War Two,external, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,"" she added. Earlier Mrs Trump said she ""hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform"". ""We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart,"" her statement added. Ivanka's mother and child photo sparks backlash How Melania compares to other first ladies US attorney general quotes Bible to defend separating families The first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy. On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its ""unconscionable"" strategy of forced separations. Earlier Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended her agency's role at the border, saying: ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."" Butshe said authorities would remove children,externalif the parent they were travelling with had broken the law. Mr Trump has said a law ""Democrats gave us"" is responsible for the policy, but it is unclear which law he is referring to. In a tweet on Saturday he urged Democrats to work with Republicans to create new legislation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents is the consequence of a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to deter new arrivals. The significant change, analysts say, is the justice department's decision to prosecute parents if they illegally cross the border, even if it is their first offence. The children are not charged with a crime, which means they cannot be jailed together. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas Until this policy was announced, such families were usually subject to civil deportation proceedings, which did not require separation. The recent child detentions have resulted in some shelters and foster homes reporting that they are running out of space. On Sunday, Democratic lawmakers visited shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, demanding to see detainees. ""They call it zero-tolerance, but a better name for it is zero-humanity. And there is zero logic to this,"" Sen Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who organised a visit to Casa Padre detention centre in Brownsville, Texas, told the BBC. ""What we saw is this huge warehouse, it was a super centre for Walmart before, now it's a super detention centre. It's holding almost 1,500 kids inside there."" Vermont congressman Peter Welch said he saw children held ""in chain link cages"" in a processing facility and one shelter ""filled to capacity"". Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, officials announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F). Local lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as ""totally inhumane"" and ""outrageous"", adding: ""It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility."" Protesters marched to one such tent city in Tornillo, Texas, on Sunday where hundreds of children were being held separately from their parents. They chanted ""Families united!"" and ""Free our children now!"",external, reported NPR. The policy faces legal challenges, including a federal case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The number offamilies trying to enter the US overland without documentation,externalis on the rise. In the first two weeks of the new ""zero-tolerance"" approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that travelled with them, according to US border officials. In many of the cases, the families have been reunited after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months. But it is not clear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from travelling. This is because many are fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Honduras and El Salvador, and staying put is often fraught with dangers.

NHS 'needs 10-year plan for funding boost',"This video can not be played Theresa May says taxpayers will have to help fund the NHS funding boost Tax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says. Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way. The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by Â£20bn by 2023. Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"". Kuenssberg: 'No magic money tree' The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming. But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money. ""Some of the extra funding I am promising will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left."" However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"". In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"". She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival. ""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said. At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years. That means by 2023 the budget will be Â£20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. Currently, NHS England spends Â£114bn a year. But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%. The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about Â£4bn - although it will be up to theWelshandScottishgovernments to decide how that is spent. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system. Like the prime minister, Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes. Economic growth would mean the size of the public purse would grow, which leaves more for public services. Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt the savings ""won't be anything like enough."" In fact, some have questioned the very idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" with the Liberal Democrats even asking the UK Statistics Authority to rule whether the government is right to claim there is one. The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the concept was ""tosh"". And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today there will be an ""increased burden of taxation"" to fund the NHS It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that. But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air. What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for? Read more from Hugh Ministers say there will be more details in the Budget in the autumn. There will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families. The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are. The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to. A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax. Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government. The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise Â£4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly Â£10bn. Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option. Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year. Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at: The workforce Technology Buildings Productivity The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015. A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community. Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time. In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support."" Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention. Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive."" The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.
