Face coverings to be compulsory in England's shops,"Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government has announced. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would ""give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protections for those who work in shops"". The move will bring England into line with Scotland and other major European nations like Spain, Italy and Germany. Since mid-May, members of the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. Mask-wearing has been compulsory on public transport in England and at NHS facilities across the UK since 15 June. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The list of exemptions has not yet been published, but the rules for face maskson public transport,externalexempt anyone who cannot wear one ""because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability"", who would experience ""severe distress"" from doing so, or relies on lip reading, among other reasons. Mr Hancock told the Commons: ""Sadly, sales assistants, cashiers and security guards have suffered disproportionately in this crisis. ""The death rate of sales and retail assistants is 75% higher amongst men and 60% higher amongst women than in the general population."" He added: ""There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop."" The new rule will not apply to retail staff. It comes asthe UK recorded the deaths of a further 138,externalpeople who had tested positive for coronavirus. Why have attitudes to face masks changed? How to make your own face mask Why do customers have to wear face coverings but not staff? And other questions Tory MP Desmond Swayne described the rule as a ""monstrous imposition"" that would make him less likely to go shopping. Labour said ministers had been ""slow and muddled"" on face coverings and questioned why the new rules would not come into force for 11 days. But Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC that research on the use of face coverings, including advice from the World Health Organization, had been ""evolving"". And he said the delay between the announcement and the rule coming into force on 24 July ""gives people time to prepare"". Wearing face coverings in shops is an ""appropriate mitigation"" against the ""overall risk"" of the coronavirus, but the rule would not work in pubs, cafes or restaurants, he added. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if the fine is paid within 14 days. ""A shop can refuse them entry and can call the police if they refuse to comply,"" Mr Hancock said. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said police should be involved only as a ""last resort"". During lockdown, police in England issued around 16,000 fines for alleged breaches of the restrictions. Enforcing the rules was not always easy, particularly because the regulations were drawn up at the last minute, but forces did at least have enough resources - as crime and emergency calls had fallen sharply. Now, as the country begins to return to normal, demands on police time are growing again. That's one reason why officers don't want the extra burden of dealing with non-compliant shop customers. Another factor is a concern is that it may draw police into confrontations with the public at a time when the service is already under the spotlight for its use of tactics, such as stop-and-search. However, the way the face-covering rules are likely to be drafted means it will be the police, not shop staff, who will be called upon if people refuse to abide by the measures. Ken Marsh of the Metropolitan Police Federation suggested enforcing the new rule could strain the relationship between police officers and the general public. And John Apter of the Police Federation said it should be down to shops to make wearing a face covering a ""condition of entry"". In Scotland, the use of coveringsin shops has been mandatory since 10 July. Few fines have been issued and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggestedcompliance had been ""extremely high"". Shoppersin WalesandNorthern Irelandare not currently required to wear them, although both nations have said this will be kept under review. Peter Barnes says wearing coverings in shops to stop the spread can only be a good thing Antiques shop owner Mary Foster from Weybridge, Surrey, tells the BBC she fears mandatory face coverings in stores could increase shoplifting. ""I think people will feel more empowered to try to steal things,"" she says. For some BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, face coverings are uncomfortable, steam up your glasses, and infringe on personal freedom. Andy, from Manchester, says the discomfort means he's less likely to go to the shops and now worries shopping must carry a higher risk than he thought. Pamela, who runs a clothes shop in East Kilbride, says most of her customers have been happy to wear one - only one refused because they didn't like it. But Peter Barnes, a London-based political consultant who contracted Covid-19 in March, tells BBC Business the discomfort of a covering is worth it to save lives. ""If we can save one life, then wearing a mask in the supermarket for an hour or so has got to be entirely worth it,"" he says. Read morehere. Do you work in a shop?

Boris Johnson signalled a shift in the government's position on Friday when he spoke of the need for a stricter approach in confined setting. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove downplayed the suggestion of any immediate legal change on Sunday. Labour said the mixed messages demonstrated the government's indecision during the pandemic, and ministers had to explain the ""further delay"". ""The government has been slow and muddled again,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. Boris Johnson has been seen wearing a cloth face covering in recent days A No 10 spokesman said: ""There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from coronavirus. ""The prime minister has been clear that people should be wearing face coverings in shops and we will make this mandatory from 24 July."" Unions and businesses have said the new guidance must be ""clear and detailed"" to protect staff and customers. While welcoming clarity over the issue, shop workers union Usdaw said coverings could not be a substitute for strict hygiene controls and social distancing measures.

Property sale tax threshold raised in Wales,"The average cost of a home in Wales is Â£161,719, already under the tax payment threshold Land transaction tax will be changed in Wales, meaning about 80% of house sales will be exempt from paying tax. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans made the announcement at the Welsh Government daily coronavirus briefing. It will bring the rate payable for properties valued at between Â£180,000 and Â£250,000 to zero from 27 July until the end of March 2021. Properties selling for less than Â£180,000 are already exempt from paying the tax. The change will not apply to second homes or buy-to-let properties, which have to pay an additional 3% in taxon top of the existing rate for their value,external. The tax, known as stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland, has already been waived for properties there up to the value of Â£500,000. This video can not be played Rebecca Evans says the change will ""help those moving up the housing ladder and first-time buyers"" Ms Evans said: ""Unlike in England, this new threshold will not apply to the purchase of additional properties such as buy-to-lets or second homes. ""It will support people looking to purchase their first home or those seeking to move up the property ladder. So it will offer more targeted help to those who may be affected by the economic challenges resulting from the pandemic."" The minister said the new threshold meant no tax would be paid on around 80% of transactions in Wales where the main residential rates apply. Ms Evans said the decision to cut the tax house buyers pay was ""very much a response"" to the chancellor's change to the system in England last week, saying the ""porous"" nature of the Wales-England border was a motivating factor. The UK government changes meant Wales had received some additional funding, she explained, some of which was being redirected towards social housing. ""This decision will not only provide support to homebuyers, it will also free up some Â£30m to invest in a different, even more direct stimulus to the housebuilding industry,"" Ms Evans said. ""I am pleased to confirm that this funding will be committed to the construction of modern social homes, supporting jobs and securing a decent place to call home for those who need it"". What does the stamp duty holiday mean for Wales? House prices 'fall for first time in eight years' 'Historic' bill for Welsh taxes passed Currently, properties sold for between Â£180,000 and Â£250,000 pay 3.5% of the value in tax. As an example, an average selling price of Â£212,063 in Cardiff means the buyer would pay Â£1,262.21 in land transaction tax (LTT). The maximum tax payable at present on a Â£250,000 property is Â£2,450. Forecasts from February by theOffice for Budget Responsibility,externalshowed the Welsh Government was expected to raise Â£250m from the tax, although this was before the coronavirus pandemic, so it is now likely to be lower. Nathan Hardee and his girlfriend will save nearly Â£2,500 Nathan Hardee and his girlfriend have been renting in Cardiff for three years while saving up to buy a house. They found a house for around Â£300,000 in the new Plasdwr development to the city's north-west. If coronavirus had not come along, they would have moved in by now after finding the house in December. However, the Welsh Government's announcement on the land transaction tax holiday has seen a silver lining to the cloud of delay. It means the couple will now save nearly Â£2,500 on what they would have had to pay, as they will only be taxed on the portion of the payment which is more than Â£250,000, rather than everything above Â£180,000. Mr Hardee told BBC Wales: ""If you haven't got to save up for stamp duty as well, that could be quite a big, significant difference to people who want to buy. ""We're due to complete early September at the moment, so today's announcement has made a massive difference to us. We'll get an extra Â£2,450 now. ""When we come to complete on the day, we end up paying less money. ""It was the sort of thing that was needed."" He thought the tax holiday could help keep buyers in his situation in Wales, saying if there had been a tax break only in England they might have looked at Bristol instead. The tax holiday will only apply to main residence purchases, not second homes In England and Northern Ireland, anyone completing on a main residence costing up to Â£500,000 between 8 July and 31 March will not pay any stamp duty, and more expensive properties will only be taxed on their value above that amount. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the average stamp duty bill in the two countries would fall by Â£4,500, with nine out of ten people paying no duty at all. Scotland has also announceda rise in the threshold for its version of stamp duty, the land and buildings transaction tax, from Â£145,000 to Â£250,000. Although welcoming Ms Evans announcement, Conservative finance spokesman in the Senedd Nick Ramsay said capping the tax holiday at sales of Â£250,000 would ""do very little to kick-start the housing market in Wales or to tempt buyers near the border to buy a property here rather than in England"". Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was pleased Welsh ministers did not ""cut and paste England's changes to stamp duty"" saying the move ""shows the value of being able to tailor taxation policy to Wales' needs and being able to set different priorities"".

UK economy rebounds more slowly than expected,"The UK's economy rebounded more slowly than expected in May, growing just 1.8% from the previous month, as the gradual easing of lockdown had a modest impact. Manufacturing and house building showed signs of recovery in May as some firms saw staff return to work. But the Office for National Statistics said the economy was ""in the doldrums"". As a result of big contractions in previous months, the UK economy is now 24.5% smaller than it was in February, the ONS added. The return to economic growth in May was described as ""disappointing"" by economists, who had expected an expansion of 5% or more. UK 'faces tax rises or spending cuts' What is a recession? The increase came after a fall of 6.9% in March and a record 20.4% decline in April. In the three months to May, the economy shrank by 19.1% compared with the previous three-month period, the ONS said. ""The economy was still a quarter smaller in May than in February, before the full effects of the pandemic struck,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. ""In the important services sector, we saw some pick-up in retail, which saw record online sales. However, with lockdown restrictions remaining in place, many other services remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines."" Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that there could be signs of improvement in next month's release of figures. ""Some of the survey data we're seeing suggests that as more of the economy reopened and as some of the restrictions were eased, we did see stronger performance in June, but it's really early,"" he said. ""You've got one month of firm data and some indicators suggesting June might be stronger, but there's a long road to go here and we're still trying to figure out what the best data is to understand the overall picture."" This video can not be played 'We need a date to restart so we can save our staff' May's modest month-on-month expansion came as sectors such as manufacturing, construction, DIY retailers and garden centres were allowed to reopen. Manufacturing grew by more than 8% during the month, as did construction. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. It's been used since the 1940s. It's the main way of determining the health of the UK economy. What is GDP and why does it matter? ""Today's figures underline the scale of the challenge we face,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The 'whatever it takes' chancellor ""I know people are worried about the security of their jobs and incomes. That's why I set out our Plan for Jobs last week, following the PM's new deal for Britain, to protect, support and create jobs as we safely reopen our economy. ""Our clear plan invests up to Â£30bn in significant and targeted support to put people's livelihoods at the centre of our national renewal as we emerge through the other side of this crisis."" A quarter of the economy's output was lost under lockdown in March and April, and May's figures show even firms who are back in business may be struggling to get on track. It's one thing being allowed to open the doors again (and some firms remain mothballed); another to be confident you can do so safely. And then there's the biggest hurdle of all, ensuring customers are willing and able to spend again. As job losses mount, it clear that even some firms who qualify for government help are faltering. Some won't have made it as far. The Bank of England's own chief economist is among those who've voiced hopes for a ""V-shaped"" recovery - a swift and full bounce back in activity. But history tells us that economies can take years to make up lost ground after a slump. The blow from this crisis was felt within days, convalescence may be tougher. And in the meantime, the livelihoods of many may feel the strain. The British Chambers of Commerce said May's ""modest rally"" in economic growth did little to alter ""the UK's historically downbeat growth trajectory"". ""The pick-up in output in May is more likely to reflect the partial release of pent-up demand as restrictions began to loosen rather than evidence of a genuine recovery,"" said the BCC's head of economics, Suren Thiru. ""While UK economic output may grow further in the short term as restrictions ease, this may dissipate as the economic scarring caused by the pandemic starts to bite, particularly as government support winds down."" Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data showed the recovery was ""maybe not so V-shaped after all"" - a reference toremarks last month by Bank of England economist Andy Haldane, who said the UK was on track for a quick recovery. He said May's figure was ""a disappointing first step on the road to recovery"" and suggested that ""hopes of a rapid rebound from the lockdown are wide of the mark"". ""Indeed, the path to full economic recovery will probably be much longer than most people anticipate,"" he added. Has your business or job been affected by the economic downturn?

Weâll be back on Wednesday to bring you the latest developments about the coronavirus pandemic from the UK and around the world. Good evening to those of you who are just joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the main UK news stories from today.  The Colombian capital BogotÃ¡ has reintroduced restrictions because of a spike in cases The coronavirus continues to spread across the Americas, with the US and Brazil, the world's hardest-hit countries, still cause for concern. In the US, southern states like Florida and Texas in particular have become the new epicentres of the outbreak there. California, the most populous state, has reimposed restrictions on businesses and public spaces amid a spike of coronavirus infections. In Latin America, there are worries that ill-equipped hospitals will not be able to cope as more infections are reported. The Colombian capital BogotÃ¡ has joined a growing list of places where lockdowns are being reintroduced because of a surge in cases. They also include the Indian city of Bangalore, Iranian capital Tehran and Hong Kong, as well as Melbourne, Australiaâs second-biggest city. Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron said he was in favour of making face masks compulsory in public indoor spaces to curtail the virus, adding such a measure could come into force from 1 August. Around the world, there have been more than 13 million confirmed coronavirus cases with around 570,000 deaths. You can find out more about the pandemic around the world here. Protective equipment is being used by shop workers around the borough As we just reported a moment ago, emergency measures have been introduced in Blackburn and Darwen in a bid to avoida Leicester-style local lockdown. People are being urged to abide by new, stricter guidance, in a bid to bring the number of coronavirus cases down, and are warned a tighter, Leicester-style local lockdown will follow if it doesn't work. The measures include:  Health officials have warned that if infection rates continue to rise after two weeks the local authority will ""have to consider reversing some of the national lockdown lifting measures locally"". Blackburn with Darwen's public health director, Prof Dominic Harrison, said: ""These steps will help and we are appealing to everyone in Blackburn with Darwen to follow them to protect themselves and their loved ones. ""If we don't, a local lockdown, like in Leicester, becomes a very real possibility."" Mass testing began in the area at the weekend after 61 new cases sprang up within a week. Figures show Blackburn with Darwen now has 41 new cases per 100,000 - up from 29.5. Leicester,where a local lockdown has been imposed, has seen the rate fall from 156.8 per 100,000 in the seven days to 26 June, to 114.3 per 100,000 in the seven days to 10 July. The place with the second-highest rate in England is in Pendle, Lancashire, where the rate has gone up from 14.2 to 67.8 per 100,000.  Two days after South Africa reinstated a ban on alcohol to curb the spread of coronavirus, thieves have broken into a liquor store in Cape Town. ""They basically emptied the whiskies out,"" Mark Kallend, shop owner of Liquor Bothasig, told News24 about the incident early on Tuesday morning. ""They ripped the safety gate off with their vehicle... they tied a rope around it and yanked it off. They then threw a boulder through the window,"" he said. Bottles of wine and brandy were left untouched, he added. Kallend said the incident showed how desperate people were. The alcohol-ban came in, was called off, but came back again In a speech on Sunday President Cyril Ramaphosa said the alcohol ban - the second this year - would take pressure off the health system. More than 40% of the 40,000 trauma cases recorded in the country in a week are alcohol-related - something the health system cannot afford right now. When it comes to coronavirus, South Africa is the hardest-hit country in Africa with more than 275,000 cases. Deaths resulting from Covid-19 have also risen to more than 4,000, and government projections estimate this could increase to 50,000 by the end of the year. The alcohol ban, however, has divided South Africans. The rules around wearing face coverings in shops in England are changing, and people in Scotland and other European cities are already advised to wear them in enclosed public spaces. But if you wear glasses you will know that the two things can be a tricky combination - with the mask causing your breath to mist up the lenses. Here are three simple tips for stopping the steam. (Don't worry, one of them isn't ""wear contact lenses"".)

Residents of the Lancashire town are facing tougher limits on visitors to their homes and are being urged to bump elbows instead of hugging. Our colleagues at the Visual and Data Journalism Team have been tracking the pandemic, and these charts help us understand the impact of the virus on different continents. The graphic below shows how cases are rising fast in the Americas. This is being partially driven by the outbreaks in the US and Brazil, the world's hardest-hit countries. Meanwhile countries in Africa are also seeing a spike in infections The graphic below shows the countries where deaths have been rising fast. Brazil is particularly bad hit, with an average of 1,000 daily deaths - andyou can find out more here. As we told you earlier, infections have risen rapidly in about 40 of America's 50 states over the last two weeks, according to an analysis by Reuters news agency. Southern states like Florida and Texas in particular have become the new epicentres of the outbreak in the country - as the graphic below shows. The US has the world's highest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths - there are currently more than 3.3 million reported infections and over 135,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Residents of Lleida are facing another stint in lockdown With coronavirus outbreaks still flaring up far and wide, communities that have endured so much already during the pandemic are coming to terms with the return of lockdowns. The Spanish region of Catalonia and the Indian state of Bihar are the latest places to reimpose restrictions after a spike in cases. Around 160,000 residents of Lleida, a city in north-eastern Catalonia, are to be quarantined for 14 days under an order issued by authorities in the region. The Catalan government said the rules, which needed the approval of a judge, would ban people from leaving their homes for non-essential activities. Meanwhile in Bihar, a 16-day state-wide lockdown will be imposed by the government from 16 July. Lleida and Bihar join a growing number of places where localised lockdowns are being announced as infections rise. They include, but are not limited to: A new survey by theCanadian Cancer Survivor Network (CCSN),externalhas found that more than 50% of Canadians have had cancer treatments or tests delayed because of Covid-19. The survey found patients waiting for confirmation of a cancer diagnosis or the recently diagnosed were most affected by the disruption in care. Virtual consults were feasible for 83% of those polled, but 71% reported concerns about accessing treatments and tests in-person - and 15% said they had surgeries or procedures cancelled. The CCSN says the government should make sure cancer treatments are a priority in future public health crises. CCSN chief Jackie Manthorne said: ""Cancer canât wait. It canât be cancelled or postponed. We now know that the huge physical, psychological and financial impact of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, while also facing cancer, has put these Canadians in double jeopardy."" Protesters outside of an Amazon warehouse in New York in May Amid recent lawsuits and strikes, Amazon has told employees at a New York warehouse that they will not be punished for taking extra time to wash their hands. In a message sent to employees, the company said time used for safety measures would not be counted against them as unproductive minutes,Bloomberg reported,external. The company has said this policy has been in place since mid-March, when the pandemic began in the US, but employees have contested this, saying they never heard of such a change. According to a lawsuit against the e-commerce giant's New York fulfillment centre, at least one worker died from Covid-19 and others have reported transmitting the virus to their family members, leading to some deaths. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing and says it has made policy changes to protect employees. The number of people who have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus has increased by 138 to 44,968, according to theDepartment of Health and Social Care.,external Here are the figures in more detail, including some of the trends in the numbers. Emna Charqui, seen here in May, said she never intended to shock, only to amuse A blogger in Tunisia has been sentenced to six months in prisonafter sharing a satirical post about Covid-19 written in the form of a verse from the Koran. Emna Charqui, 28, was arrested in May for sharing a message on Facebook urging people to follow hygiene rules in the style of Islam's holy book. The post mimicking a Koranic verse called for people to wash their hands and observe social distancing in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Charqui said in a recent interview that she had no intention of provoking shock, but found the post amusing. She was found guilty in a Tunis court of ""inciting hatred between religions"". She is not yet in custody as she intends to file an appeal. A new Axios-Ipsos poll,externalshows most US parents are afraid of sending their kids back to school even as the Trump administration continues to insist schools ought to reopen in the autumn. Majorities in both political parties and 71% of all parents polled say it would be risky to send their children back to school. President Trump has threatened to cut federal funding to schools if they don't resume classes. In Texas, where cases are rising, Republican Governor Gregg Abbott's plan to restart in-person schooling has been criticised by some educators. The Houston Federation of Teachers called the plan ""unacceptably vague and hardly adequate"", and said schools should opt for virtual learning until it was safe to begin a phase reopening. ""It is the height of hubris that the governor is more
focused on opening the economy than on the health and well-being of our children and the people
who educate them."" Steven Poole, head of the United Educators Association in Texas, pointed out many staff or their family members had health conditions that put them at serious risk from the virus, saying: ""While parents are given options to send their children to school or stay home for virtual instruction, teachers and staff do not have that option.""

The presenter said to him: âItâs the policeâs job to enforce the law and regulations.â He replied: âNot on private property. ""If someoneâs not doing what someone privately owns their property for, it isnât the policeâs problem to deal with it, I think youâll find, under legislation.â Mr Marsh has since confirmed to Reality Check that it will indeed be up to the police to enforce the new rules. He said what he meant was that police would not be patrolling supermarkets looking for people who were not wearing face coverings, but would come to an incident if called. He also confirmed that that distinction was not in the legislation. You can read more about police powers during the coronavirus pandemic here. Belgium was one of the hardest hit countries in the world Belgium has reported zero deaths related to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the first time the country has done so since the start of the pandemic in March. The countryâs death total remained at 9,787 on Tuesday, the 12th highest in the world. With a population of 11.5 million, Belgium has the second-highest mortality rate per 100,000 people in the world,according to Johns Hopkins University,external, which is tracking the pandemic. However, comparisons with other countries may be somewhat misleading, as some are believed to be under-reporting deaths and infections. The last time Belgium reported no deaths was on 9 March,according to health authorities,external. That was just days before the countryâs lockdown came into effect on 14 March. Some of those social-distancing measures have been eased in phases since mid-May, when new coronavirus infections started to level off. Since then, the curve of coronavirus infections has been flattened considerably in Belgium, where a total of 62,781 cases have been recorded to date. Keith Horton, from Newcastle, has chronic asthma which hampers his breathing, so cannot wear a mask. He saysnew rules making people wear face coverings in shopswould be ""stressful"" for him, and fears being penalised by shopkeepers and other patrons for not wearing one. ""My nose runs constantly and I can't breathe when I put [a mask] on, I get into a panic. I don't want people to approach me asking why I'm not wearing one. All I want to do is do a bit of shopping without being hassled,"" the 68-year-old said. Mr Horton urged people to ""think"" before challenging someone for not wearing a face covering, as ""you can't see asthma"" and many other underlying health conditions. The governmenthas released guidance,externalon groups who do not need to wear a mask in shops or on public transport. Asthma UK recommends that people with asthma try a mask at home, or do a short walk with one, before wearing them in shops.,external If it makes it harder to breathe, people with asthma do not have to wear them, it says. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Leawood, Kansas At a barbecue restaurant in Kansas, a teenaged worker told a customer in a Make America Great Again hat to wear a mask if he wanted to eat inside. The customer got angry and flashed a gun. The restaurant owner, Bob Palmgren, is â like the customer himself - a Trump supporter. But after hearing about the dispute, Palmgren told the customer to leave. ""Iâm like: âYour gunâs not going to kill coronavirus. Now get the hell out of here,"" Palmgren said,according to the Kansas City Star,external. The dispute revealed a division among conservatives in Kansas and other parts of the US. Palmgren and many other conservatives think that people should wear masks. But some conservatives refuse to wear them. In the restaurant, a gun also played a role. The argument was tense and unsettling for Palmgren and others inside the restaurant, and it showed how explosive the controversy over masks has become in this country. President Rajoelina takes a swig of the Covid-Organics tonic, the efficacy of which is unproven  Madagascarâs
President Andry
Rajoelina,who made headlines in May touting a plant-based tonic cure for Covid-19,
has announced the deaths of several high-profile figures from coronavirus, including two MPs, a
Unicef representative and a WHO doctor. Soldiers have been deployed in the
capital, Antananarivo, to enforce a 15-day lockdown, following
a spike in cases. Kenyaâs largest maternity hospital tested 290 members of staff for
coronavirus and found 41 of them had Covid-19. The authorities at Pumwani Maternity
Hospital in the capital, Nairobi, have sought to calm fears and say those
infected are isolating and receiving treatment at home. Meanwhile, churches and
mosques in the deeply religious country will also be able to reopen from today,
four months after their closure - though some are opting not to do so. The reinstatement of a ban on alcohol in South Africaprompted some thieves to
target an off-licence in Cape Town. But they reportedly left the wine untouched
- opting only for hard stuff. âThey basically emptied the whiskies out,â Mark
Kallend, shop owner of Liquor Bothasig, told the News24 site. It is hoped the ban
will take pressure off the health system, which deals with many trauma cases
caused by alcohol-fueled violence. A girlsâ high school inGhanaâs capital, Accra, has been hit by
an outbreak, with 55 confirmed cases. The girls have been transferred to
treatment and isolation centres. The West African country allowed final-year
students back into classrooms last month to allow them to sit exams. Meanwhile,
President Nana Akufo-Addo is still in quarantine as a precaution after a member
of his close circle tested positive for the virus last week. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Weâll be back on Wednesday to bring you the latest developments about the coronavirus pandemic from the UK and around the world. Good evening to those of you who are just joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the main UK news stories from today.  The Colombian capital BogotÃ¡ has reintroduced restrictions because of a spike in cases The coronavirus continues to spread across the Americas, with the US and Brazil, the world's hardest-hit countries, still cause for concern. In the US, southern states like Florida and Texas in particular have become the new epicentres of the outbreak there. California, the most populous state, has reimposed restrictions on businesses and public spaces amid a spike of coronavirus infections. In Latin America, there are worries that ill-equipped hospitals will not be able to cope as more infections are reported. The Colombian capital BogotÃ¡ has joined a growing list of places where lockdowns are being reintroduced because of a surge in cases. They also include the Indian city of Bangalore, Iranian capital Tehran and Hong Kong, as well as Melbourne, Australiaâs second-biggest city. Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron said he was in favour of making face masks compulsory in public indoor spaces to curtail the virus, adding such a measure could come into force from 1 August. Around the world, there have been more than 13 million confirmed coronavirus cases with around 570,000 deaths. You can find out more about the pandemic around the world here. Protective equipment is being used by shop workers around the borough As we just reported a moment ago, emergency measures have been introduced in Blackburn and Darwen in a bid to avoida Leicester-style local lockdown. People are being urged to abide by new, stricter guidance, in a bid to bring the number of coronavirus cases down, and are warned a tighter, Leicester-style local lockdown will follow if it doesn't work. The measures include:  Health officials have warned that if infection rates continue to rise after two weeks the local authority will ""have to consider reversing some of the national lockdown lifting measures locally"". Blackburn with Darwen's public health director, Prof Dominic Harrison, said: ""These steps will help and we are appealing to everyone in Blackburn with Darwen to follow them to protect themselves and their loved ones. ""If we don't, a local lockdown, like in Leicester, becomes a very real possibility."" Mass testing began in the area at the weekend after 61 new cases sprang up within a week. Figures show Blackburn with Darwen now has 41 new cases per 100,000 - up from 29.5. Leicester,where a local lockdown has been imposed, has seen the rate fall from 156.8 per 100,000 in the seven days to 26 June, to 114.3 per 100,000 in the seven days to 10 July. The place with the second-highest rate in England is in Pendle, Lancashire, where the rate has gone up from 14.2 to 67.8 per 100,000.  Two days after South Africa reinstated a ban on alcohol to curb the spread of coronavirus, thieves have broken into a liquor store in Cape Town. ""They basically emptied the whiskies out,"" Mark Kallend, shop owner of Liquor Bothasig, told News24 about the incident early on Tuesday morning.

Face coverings to be compulsory in England's shopsThe health secretary says the new rule aims to give shoppers confidence and protect retail staff.UK PoliticsComments,"Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government has announced. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would ""give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protections for those who work in shops"". The move will bring England into line with Scotland and other major European nations like Spain, Italy and Germany. Since mid-May, members of the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. Mask-wearing has been compulsory on public transport in England and at NHS facilities across the UK since 15 June. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The list of exemptions has not yet been published, but the rules for face maskson public transport,externalexempt anyone who cannot wear one ""because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability"", who would experience ""severe distress"" from doing so, or relies on lip reading, among other reasons. Mr Hancock told the Commons: ""Sadly, sales assistants, cashiers and security guards have suffered disproportionately in this crisis. ""The death rate of sales and retail assistants is 75% higher amongst men and 60% higher amongst women than in the general population."" He added: ""There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop."" The new rule will not apply to retail staff. It comes asthe UK recorded the deaths of a further 138,externalpeople who had tested positive for coronavirus. Why have attitudes to face masks changed? How to make your own face mask Why do customers have to wear face coverings but not staff? And other questions Tory MP Desmond Swayne described the rule as a ""monstrous imposition"" that would make him less likely to go shopping. Labour said ministers had been ""slow and muddled"" on face coverings and questioned why the new rules would not come into force for 11 days. But Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC that research on the use of face coverings, including advice from the World Health Organization, had been ""evolving"". And he said the delay between the announcement and the rule coming into force on 24 July ""gives people time to prepare"". Wearing face coverings in shops is an ""appropriate mitigation"" against the ""overall risk"" of the coronavirus, but the rule would not work in pubs, cafes or restaurants, he added. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if the fine is paid within 14 days. ""A shop can refuse them entry and can call the police if they refuse to comply,"" Mr Hancock said. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said police should be involved only as a ""last resort"". During lockdown, police in England issued around 16,000 fines for alleged breaches of the restrictions. Enforcing the rules was not always easy, particularly because the regulations were drawn up at the last minute, but forces did at least have enough resources - as crime and emergency calls had fallen sharply. Now, as the country begins to return to normal, demands on police time are growing again. That's one reason why officers don't want the extra burden of dealing with non-compliant shop customers. Another factor is a concern is that it may draw police into confrontations with the public at a time when the service is already under the spotlight for its use of tactics, such as stop-and-search. However, the way the face-covering rules are likely to be drafted means it will be the police, not shop staff, who will be called upon if people refuse to abide by the measures. Ken Marsh of the Metropolitan Police Federation suggested enforcing the new rule could strain the relationship between police officers and the general public. And John Apter of the Police Federation said it should be down to shops to make wearing a face covering a ""condition of entry"". In Scotland, the use of coveringsin shops has been mandatory since 10 July. Few fines have been issued and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggestedcompliance had been ""extremely high"". Shoppersin WalesandNorthern Irelandare not currently required to wear them, although both nations have said this will be kept under review. Peter Barnes says wearing coverings in shops to stop the spread can only be a good thing Antiques shop owner Mary Foster from Weybridge, Surrey, tells the BBC she fears mandatory face coverings in stores could increase shoplifting. ""I think people will feel more empowered to try to steal things,"" she says. For some BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, face coverings are uncomfortable, steam up your glasses, and infringe on personal freedom. Andy, from Manchester, says the discomfort means he's less likely to go to the shops and now worries shopping must carry a higher risk than he thought. Pamela, who runs a clothes shop in East Kilbride, says most of her customers have been happy to wear one - only one refused because they didn't like it. But Peter Barnes, a London-based political consultant who contracted Covid-19 in March, tells BBC Business the discomfort of a covering is worth it to save lives. ""If we can save one life, then wearing a mask in the supermarket for an hour or so has got to be entirely worth it,"" he says. Read morehere. Do you work in a shop?

Boris Johnson signalled a shift in the government's position on Friday when he spoke of the need for a stricter approach in confined setting. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove downplayed the suggestion of any immediate legal change on Sunday. Labour said the mixed messages demonstrated the government's indecision during the pandemic, and ministers had to explain the ""further delay"". ""The government has been slow and muddled again,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. Boris Johnson has been seen wearing a cloth face covering in recent days A No 10 spokesman said: ""There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from coronavirus. ""The prime minister has been clear that people should be wearing face coverings in shops and we will make this mandatory from 24 July."" Unions and businesses have said the new guidance must be ""clear and detailed"" to protect staff and customers. While welcoming clarity over the issue, shop workers union Usdaw said coverings could not be a substitute for strict hygiene controls and social distancing measures.

Scarves or other textile items that can be used to continually cover the nose and mouth without having to be held in place by hand are considered adequate in non-medical settings. There has been a reported increase in the use of face coverings by people in England, Scotland and Wales. More than half of adultssurveyed by the Office for National Statisticsin the first week of July said they used a covering while outside their home. Downing Street said it would keep the guidance on face coverings in other settings, such as offices, under review.

Virgin Atlantic finalises Â£1.2bn rescue deal,"Virgin Atlantic saw passenger numbers slump as countries closed borders and brought in travel bans Troubled airline Virgin Atlantic has finalised a rescue deal worth Â£1.2bn that should protect thousands of jobs. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group will inject Â£200m, with additional funds provided by investors and creditors. The billionaire Virgin boss had a request for government money rejected, leaving the airline in a race against time to secure new investment. Virgin Atlantic is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline said the remaining 6,500 jobs should be secure. The deal includes funding from US hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management, and the postponement of about Â£450m in payments to creditors. Virgin Group owns 51% of the airline, with the rest held by US carrier Delta Air Lines. Virgin Atlantic said the refinancing covered the next five years and paved the way for it to rebuild its balance sheet and return to profitability in 2022. ""We have taken painful measures, but we have accomplished what many thought impossible,"" said chief executive Shai Weiss. ""The last six months have been the toughest we have faced in our 36-year history."" Virgin Australia to fly again with new US owner BA may not reopen at Gatwick once pandemic passes Virgin bailout 'could help green economy' - Miliband As with other airlines, the Covid-19 outbreak plunged Virgin Atlantic into a crisis as air travel dried up. Virgin grounded most of its fleet for months, but is due to resume some services next week. The company had initially hoped the government would step in with up to Â£500m in bailout loans, but ministers made it clear taxpayers' money could only be considered once all other options had been exhausted. Sir Richard even offered to mortgage his Caribbean holiday island, Necker, in return for new investment, although this was no longer necessary. Virgin Group raised money for the investment from the sale of some shares in the Virgin Galactic space tourism company. The investment plan still needs formal approval from Virgin Atlantic's creditors under a court-sanctioned process. In May, the airline announced 3,500 job cuts and the closure of its base at Gatwick airport. Although the restructuring and investment plans protect the remaining jobs, it does not change the need to re-shape the size of the business, Virgin Atlantic said. Virgin Atlantic calls this a ""solvent recapitalisation"". But the question is, will it be enough to secure the company's long-term future? There is some new money here - an extra Â£200m in cash from the Virgin Group and loans worth Â£170m from Davidson Kempner. But a large part of the package is made up of deferring or waiving existing liabilities. This was probably the best the company could do in the circumstances, after the government made it clear targeted state aid would only be considered as a last resort, after private-sector options had been exhausted. But it doesn't seem to give the company much of a war chest to absorb future shocks. It is due to resume flights next week - and managers will be desperate for demand to pick up, and quickly. Virgin Atlantic has already taken drastic action to cut costs, shedding more than 3,500 staff and closing its base at London Gatwick. There's no doubt it will be a much leaner operation in future. This deal does at least keep the airline flying, but navigating its way through the stormy skies facing the industry for the foreseeable future will still be a huge challenge. Virgin insiders say the company has wargamed the worst-case scenario, which is a failure of transatlantic flights to recover, and it still reckons this deal will be enough to keep Virgin in the air. On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines wrote down the value of its stake in Virgin Atlantic, taking a $200m (Â£160m) charge. The giant US airline alsoreported an adjusted pre-tax loss of $3.9bn,external, saying it was burning through cash at a rate of $27m per day. Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive officer said. ""Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe that it will be more than two years before we see a sustainable recovery."" Last month, Mr Bastian told the BBC: ""We're not planning on injecting additional capital into Virgin. We're supporting them in doing everything we can, helping them through a restructuring, hopefully to avoid an in-court process, and I'm still optimistic, cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to get there."" Aviation firms have been battered by the coronavirus crisis. On Tuesday, Ryanair said it would cut 1,000 flights between Ireland and the UK in August and September because of Irish quarantine restrictions which had ""suppressed demand"". ""Air travel between Ireland and the UK is being badly damaged by this ineffective 14-day quarantine,"" a spokesperson said. ""This means 100,000 fewer visitors from the UK travelling to regional airports in Cork, Shannon, Knock and Kerry during the peak months of the tourism season.""

Coronavirus in Wales: Updates on Tuesday,"No tax will be charged on the first Â£250,000 of property sale proceeds in Wales from 27 July to the end of March Face coverings should be mandatory in shops in Wales, says Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price It follows the announcement that they will be required on public transport from July 27, as in the other UK nations People with non-life threatening illnesses will need to book a slot to visit A&E at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff Two more deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales were reported on Tuesday, taking the official total to 1,543 Chris Wood, George Herd and Andy Roberts That's it from our live updates today on the battle against coronavirus in Wales. Here are some of Tuesday's main developments: We'll be back tomorrow with another live blog. There is ""a disconnect"" between operational guidance and scientific advice on the reopening of schools in Wales, according to a teaching union leader. The Welsh Government has saidall schools should fully reopen in September with class sizes of up to 30 children. NASUWT General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach  said: âWhilst the Technical Advisory Group has suggested a maximum group size of around 10 for secondary age pupils, the [Welsh] governmentâs operational guidance is at variance with the scientific advice. âTeachersâ confidence in the Welsh Governmentâs plans for the full reopening of schools in September will be undermined because it has ignored key recommendations by its own scientific advisors.â A recent survey by the union found that 65% felt safe or very safe to return to work when schools in Wales partially reopened on 29 June due to measures put in place to minimise the risk of coronavirus. However, this survey of more than 350 teachers was conducted when a maximum of one third of learners were allowed on school sites at any one time. Local Democracy Reporting Service A memorial day for people who died during  lockdown has been suggested by councillors in the south Wales valleys. The call was made after an update was given to members on Rhondda Cynon Taf council's response to the coronavirus pandemic from chief executive Chris Bradshaw. The idea was brought up by independent councillor Mike Diamond who said many family members werenât able to attend the funerals of their loved ones who died in that period due to lockdown restrictions. He said: âOne thing that is very disturbing and upsetting is the fact that in the early days of the pandemic a lot of people that passed away were buried without their family being present. âAnd I just wondered as a council, in time to come, that we maybe have a memorial day to try and help these families that went through this situation.â Funerals have had to be held with few or no mourners present during the pandemic A property tax holiday on the first Â£250,000 of any house sale in Wales has been announced by the Welsh Government. Butwhat exactly does it mean? Still known as stamp duty in England, the tax varies across the UK. Since being devolved to Wales in April 2018 it has been known as the land transaction tax. The change announced today means there will be no tax charged on houses selling for less than Â£250,000 in Wales, or on the first Â£250,000 of any house sale above that figure, from 27 July to the end of next March. Another two deaths of people with coronavirus have been confirmed in Wales. The official total number of deaths with Covid-19 now stands at 1,543, according to Public Health Wales. It comes after a week in which there were no deaths reported on four out of seven days. This graph shows the daily number of confirmed deaths according
 to when they occurred, rather than when they were announced. Two more deaths of people with coronavirus have been recorded in Wales, by Public Health Wales. Both are in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board area, covering the whole of north Wales. It is the largest geographical health board area in Wales, and has also recorded the largest number of deaths with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Public Health Wales says two more deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales. It follows a week when there were four days without any deaths reported. The official total number of deaths of people in Wales with Covid-19 now stands at 1,543. As well as a cut in tax on property sales, the Welsh Government has also announced that Â£30m will be used to build new, energy-efficient social housing. Allow Twitter content?

The owners of smaller shops in Wales where social distancing is not possible should consider recommending that shoppers wear face coverings, according to the finance minister. Rebecca Evans said proprietors should look at ""making those additional adaptations that they need to make, should they be in a position where they can't keep their members of staff two metres apart"", ""Certainly it would be one of the measures which they can potentially look to take,"" she added. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Pricehas called for face coverings to be mandatory in shops in Wales, as they already are in Scotlandand will be in England from 24 July. There are âlots of unanswered questionsâ over the UK governmentâs plans to create free ports, according to the Welsh finance minister. But Rebecca Evans says she is âabsolutely willing to engageâ with UK ministers on the matter. Free ports allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules. The UK government has said itwants to create 10 free ports, and bids are expected to be considered later this year. There is speculation that several sites in Wales may wish to be considered. âIt's one of those issues and areas where we really need the UK government to be properly and fully engaging with us,"" Ms Evans said. âThis is a reserved matter [with the UK government being responsible], but the implications for us could be very significant here in Wales. She said a lot of ""unanswered questions"" remained, adding: ""We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where free ports lead to any lowering of environmental standards, of labour market standards for example. âWe don't want to find ourselves in a situation where tax breaks make other companies or Welsh firms uncompetitive. âAnd we certainly don't want to find ourselves in a position where economic activity is displaced as a result of those free ports as well. âSo I think all of those things need further discussion."" Free ports allow firms to import goods and then re-export them outside normal tax and customs rules Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said a public awareness campaign was needed before wearing face coverings on public transport becomes mandatory in Wales from 27 July. She said: âThe last thing we want is for people who, for whatever reason, are not able to wear face masks, finding themselves in awkward situationsâ. Ms Evans said the Welsh Government did not want to put passengers or train staff in a âvery difficult positionâ. The mandatory use of face coverings in public spaces is ""under constant monitoring and review"", according to the finance minister. Rebecca Evans said there was ""greater concern"" in tourist hotspots where ""the number of people in that area mushrooms for a small part of the year. But she said there was no update on the first minister's announcement on Monday thatface coverings are to be required on public transport in Wales from 27 July. The move was criticised by Welsh Conservatives who said that wasn't soon enough, whilePlaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants face masks to be mandatory in shops. Speaking at the Welsh Government's daily press conference, Ms Evans said: ""We're keeping this under constant review. ""We're having constant discussions also with the retail sector to ensure that we take into account their particular perspective. ""But also discussions with those local authorities where we have high densities of tourist attractions, tourist businesses and so on to ensure that the decisions that we take, bear in mind the concerns that there are locally."" Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said changes in the tax on property sales in Wales amount to a ""very generous offer"", after being asked about the different rates which will apply in England. ""The house price here in Wales, on average, is much lower than that across the border in England,"" she said. ""I think it's probably fair to say that the chancellor's efforts last week in England were very much directed at homebuyers in London and the south east."" She added: ""We're helping to ensure that 80% of people who buy their main residence here in Wales don't pay any tax at all. ""And I think that that is a very generous offer, and we're seeking to ensure that it's not just first time buyers but actually people who are already on that housing ladder looking to move properties, potentially for their growing family for example, are also able to benefit from it."" Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the decision to cut the tax on property sales was âvery much a responseâ to the chancellorâs change to the system in England last week. She said the âporousâ nature of the Wales-England border was a motivating factor. âWe do recognise that changes to the housing market in England do have a knock-on impact in Wales,"" she said. ""But at the same time that decision made by the UK government also meant that we would receive some additional funding. âSo Â£30m of which I'm able now to redirect to social housing. So I think that's important in recognising the picture that we have here in Wales. ""And even before the announcement from the UK chancellor last Wednesday, Wales had the best offer in terms of our highest starting threshold for land transaction tax. So there were no immediate plans to change this.â Rhondda Cynon Taff has one of the highest Covid-19 death rates across the UK with 122.9 deaths per 100,000 people, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Cardiff has the largest number of deaths with 373, followed by Rhondda Cynon Taff with 295 up to 3 July, but the rate of increase has dramatically slowed down. Around half the deaths in the latest week were in north Wales. But there were no new coronavirus deaths registered in nine council areas: Blaenau Gwent, Ceredigion, Gwynedd, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Powys, Swansea and Torfaen. There were fewer care home deaths - six - in the latest week, with a total of 686 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 3 July, making up 27.8% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales. The Welsh Government says no tax will be paid on main residential property purchases for less than Â£250,000. Finance Minister Rebecca Evansannounced the Land Transaction Tax ""holiday"" at the daily coronavirus briefing. The minister said the move would take effect on 27 July to coincide with the full reopening of the housing market in Wales as the coronavirus lockdown eases. She said the ""tax holiday"" would  last until 31 March 2021. ""Unlike in England, this new threshold will not apply to the purchase of additional properties such as buy-to-lets or second homes,"" she added. ""It will support people looking to purchase their first home or those seeking to move up the property ladder. ""So it will offer more targeted help to those who may be affected by the economic challenges resulting from the pandemic."" The minister said the new threshold meant that no tax will be paid on around 80% of transactions in Wales where the main residential rates apply. She said it would help ""growing families needing to move on in the housing ladder as well as first time buyers"". Ms Evans added that Â£30m would be invested in ""the construction of modern social homes, supporting jobs and securing a decent place to call home for those who need it"". The Welsh Government's ""tax holiday"" follows UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement ofa stamp duty holiday on the first Â£500,000 of property sale values in England and Northern Ireland. The Scottish government says it will introduce a temporary cut to the transaction tax on house sales in Scotland next week. With face masks set to be made compulsory on public transport in Wales on 27 July, here's a handy guide to making your own covering. This video can not be played Coronavirus: What can you use as a face mask and where to wear it There will be no property tax - formerly known as stamp duty - payable onproperty sales below Â£250,000in Wales from 27 July, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans will explain the details shortly at the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing. It follows last week's announcement ofa stamp duty holiday on the first Â£500,000 of property sale values in England and Northern Ireland. Properties valued at up to Â£180,000 in Wales are already exempt from the charge, known here as land transaction tax. The policy will be introduced on 27 July and will last until 31 March 2021. The Welsh Government estimates the change will mean there will be no land transaction tax on 80% of property sales in Wales. An estimated Â£30m will be left over from the money supplied by the UK government to provide assistance to the housing market, which will be used for a house building programme. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans is to deliver the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing on Tuesday. The briefing is due to start at 12:30 BST. We'll update you with the key points here - you can also watch proceedings live on BBC One Wales,via the BBC iPlayer, and via the Coronavirus Daily Update video link at the top of this page. The number of deaths involving coronavirus in Wales has risen slightly in thelatest weekly figures from the Office for National Statistics(ONS). For deaths registered in the week ending 3 July, the figure had increased by 35, compared to 30 the week before. The number of so-called ""excess"" deaths is also above what we would normally expect to see at this time of year. The ONS, unlikePublic Health Wales' daily figures, includes all deaths in care homes and people's homes, as well as people suspected by doctors of having coronavirus, not just confirmed cases. We have to wait a little longer for the figures but they are regarded as being more comprehensive and reliable. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK economy rebounds more slowly than expectedThe UK's economy grew 1.8% in May as the lockdown began to ease, less than economists had predicted.Business","The UK's economy rebounded more slowly than expected in May, growing just 1.8% from the previous month, as the gradual easing of lockdown had a modest impact. Manufacturing and house building showed signs of recovery in May as some firms saw staff return to work. But the Office for National Statistics said the economy was ""in the doldrums"". As a result of big contractions in previous months, the UK economy is now 24.5% smaller than it was in February, the ONS added. The return to economic growth in May was described as ""disappointing"" by economists, who had expected an expansion of 5% or more. UK 'faces tax rises or spending cuts' What is a recession? The increase came after a fall of 6.9% in March and a record 20.4% decline in April. In the three months to May, the economy shrank by 19.1% compared with the previous three-month period, the ONS said. ""The economy was still a quarter smaller in May than in February, before the full effects of the pandemic struck,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. ""In the important services sector, we saw some pick-up in retail, which saw record online sales. However, with lockdown restrictions remaining in place, many other services remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines."" Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that there could be signs of improvement in next month's release of figures. ""Some of the survey data we're seeing suggests that as more of the economy reopened and as some of the restrictions were eased, we did see stronger performance in June, but it's really early,"" he said. ""You've got one month of firm data and some indicators suggesting June might be stronger, but there's a long road to go here and we're still trying to figure out what the best data is to understand the overall picture."" This video can not be played 'We need a date to restart so we can save our staff' May's modest month-on-month expansion came as sectors such as manufacturing, construction, DIY retailers and garden centres were allowed to reopen. Manufacturing grew by more than 8% during the month, as did construction. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. It's been used since the 1940s. It's the main way of determining the health of the UK economy. What is GDP and why does it matter? ""Today's figures underline the scale of the challenge we face,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The 'whatever it takes' chancellor ""I know people are worried about the security of their jobs and incomes. That's why I set out our Plan for Jobs last week, following the PM's new deal for Britain, to protect, support and create jobs as we safely reopen our economy. ""Our clear plan invests up to Â£30bn in significant and targeted support to put people's livelihoods at the centre of our national renewal as we emerge through the other side of this crisis."" A quarter of the economy's output was lost under lockdown in March and April, and May's figures show even firms who are back in business may be struggling to get on track. It's one thing being allowed to open the doors again (and some firms remain mothballed); another to be confident you can do so safely. And then there's the biggest hurdle of all, ensuring customers are willing and able to spend again. As job losses mount, it clear that even some firms who qualify for government help are faltering. Some won't have made it as far. The Bank of England's own chief economist is among those who've voiced hopes for a ""V-shaped"" recovery - a swift and full bounce back in activity. But history tells us that economies can take years to make up lost ground after a slump. The blow from this crisis was felt within days, convalescence may be tougher. And in the meantime, the livelihoods of many may feel the strain. The British Chambers of Commerce said May's ""modest rally"" in economic growth did little to alter ""the UK's historically downbeat growth trajectory"". ""The pick-up in output in May is more likely to reflect the partial release of pent-up demand as restrictions began to loosen rather than evidence of a genuine recovery,"" said the BCC's head of economics, Suren Thiru. ""While UK economic output may grow further in the short term as restrictions ease, this may dissipate as the economic scarring caused by the pandemic starts to bite, particularly as government support winds down."" Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data showed the recovery was ""maybe not so V-shaped after all"" - a reference toremarks last month by Bank of England economist Andy Haldane, who said the UK was on track for a quick recovery. He said May's figure was ""a disappointing first step on the road to recovery"" and suggested that ""hopes of a rapid rebound from the lockdown are wide of the mark"". ""Indeed, the path to full economic recovery will probably be much longer than most people anticipate,"" he added. Has your business or job been affected by the economic downturn?

Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent,"Online grocer Ocado says the switch to internet shopping amid the coronavirus lockdown has led to a ""permanent redrawing"" of the retail landscape. Its comments came as it said sales during the first half of 2020 jumped 27% to more than Â£1bn. ""The world as we know it has changed,"" said chief executive Tim Steiner. ""As a result of Covid-19, we have seen years of growth in the online grocery market condensed into a matter of months; and we won't be going back."" ""We are confident that accelerated growth in the online channel will continue, leading to a permanent redrawing of the landscape of the grocery industry worldwide."" He said Ocado was now the fastest growing grocer in the UK, thanks to a 50/50 partnership with Marks and Spencer announced last year. As part of the deal, which saw M&S take a half-share in Ocado's retail business, Ocado will start delivering M&S grocery products from September, when its current deal with Waitrose expires. The group reported a loss before tax of Â£40.6m in the six months to the end of May, blaming an increase in investment to handle the higher demand generated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. During the period the company opened its first two customer fulfilment centres abroad, for Casino in France and Sobeys in Canada, while increasing capacity in the UK. Retailers report sales jump in June The loss was smaller than the Â£147.4m posted in the same period last year, although that figure included Â£99m of costs incurred as a result of a major fire at its warehouse in Andover. But after raising Â£1bn through an equity and bond issue last month, Ocado said it had Â£2.3bn in cash on its balance sheet. ""There is evidence to suggest many shoppers will likely continue buying their groceries online once lockdown measures have been lifted completely, but it will be difficult for Ocado to maintain the sales registered at the peak of the crisis,"" said John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin. ""Nevertheless, Ocado has a strong balance sheet and the Covid-19 pandemic has super-accelerated many of the trends that have led to its exceptional share price growth over the last few years, placing the company in a good position for the future."" Separately, discount grocer Lidl has revealed plans to open a shop a week until Christmas, creating 1,000 jobs. The 25 new stores will be opened across England, Scotland and Wales with sites in Selhurst, Harrow Weald, Coleford and Llandudno Junction opening in the coming weeks. By the end of 2023 it plans another 100 stores across Britain, creating 4,000 more jobs, and bringing its total number of shops to 1,000. ""It is testament to the continued hard work of our colleagues that we are able to continue forging ahead with our expansion plans, despite the challenging circumstances that have been faced over the past months,"" said Lidl GB boss Christian HÃ¤rtnagel. Lidl - which opened its first shops in the UK in 1994 - has opened new stores throughout the pandemic in locations such as Birmingham, Torquay and across London.

Masks compulsory in England's shops: Latest updates,"Wearing face coverings in shops in England will be compulsory from the end of next week, with non-compliance punishable by a Â£100 fine. Downing Street said there was growing evidence that face coverings helped to protect people from Covid-19 in enclosed spaces. Scientists warn the UK could see around 120,000 new coronavirus deaths in a second wave of infections this winter.

Until then, stay safe. Deaths of cleaners who worked at the Ministry of Justice during the Covid-19 pandemic must be examined as part of an independent investigation, Labour has said. Speaking in the House of Commons, shadow justice secretary David Lammy said leaked emails, interviews and messages show cleaners were ""forced"" into the department during the lockdown period and ""denied"" personal protective equipment (PPE). Seven outsourced staff have had ""consistent symptoms"" for coronavirus and two are now dead, Mr Lammy told MPs.

I don't want people to approach me asking why I'm not wearing one, all I want to do is do a bit of shopping without being hassled,"" the 68-year-old said. Mr Horton urged people to ""think"" before challenging someone for not wearing a face covering, as ""you can't see asthma"" and many other underlying health conditions. ""People should understand that if they see someone without

People in Leicester will learn whether local lockdown measures will be eased on Thursday, the health secretary has said. Speaking in the House of Commons, Matt Hancock said the government would base its decision on ""14 days of data"" on coronavirus cases. Non-essential shops and schools in the city were shut as a result of a spike in positive cases. The lockdown was due to be reviewed by Saturday. The government has decided that wearing face coverings in shops in England will be compulsory from 24 July. This video can not be played Ashworth: âMinisterial muddle' on coronavirus face masks Labour's shadow health secretary said âit did not have to be this wayâ over government advice on wearing face coverings in shops in England.

Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check New rules making face coverings compulsory inside shops in
England have led to lots of heated discussion on social media. People have been
encouraging others to wear a face mask, but thereâs also opposition to the new
rules and #NoMasks and #muzzles have been trending on Twitter in the UK. Weâve looked at misleading claims that masks might actually
be dangerous to the wearer. Memes shared on social media claim that masks
might deprive you of oxygen or lead to the body taking in too much carbon
dioxide. But thereâs no evidence this will happen. The recommended type of mask worn properly wonât do
you any harm. The World Health Organization says ""the prolonged use of
medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen
deficiency. Graffitidaubed by beachgoerson cliffs at Durdle Door beach in Dorset has been removed. Lulworth Estate, which owns the beach on the Jurassic Coast, said a ""vast and unacceptable amount of graffiti"" had recently appeared on the cliffs. The Unesco World Heritage site has seen an influx of visitors since lockdown restrictions were eased across England. Rangers from the estate and volunteers from Dorset Climbing have removed the messages and signatures. Rob EnglandBBC News More awareness is needed of people who are exempt from wearing face coverings in Englandas new measures in shops are announced, charities have warned. People with severe respiratory conditions are one of the groups not required to wear masks - as this can make them feel unwell. Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy at Asthma UK and the British Lung
Foundation, said: ""As face coverings become mandatory in shops in England, we urge the
public to think twice before they judge someone for not wearing a face mask. She added: ""Not all health conditions are visible and people with lung conditions have already
told us that theyâve been publicly confronted by strangers about not wearing
one, leaving them feeling anxious and humiliated."" The governmenthas released some guidance,externalon groups who are currently exempt on public transport, including those who have ""a physical or mental illness or impairment, or a disability"" meaning they cannot do so. A pub has been shut for a ""deep clean""after a customer tested positive for coronavirus. The Crown & Anchor in Aveley, Essex, said a man had been taken to hospital on 12 July after previously visiting the establishment. It said on itsFacebook page,externalthat all ""necessary measures took place"", that the ""situation was out of our control"" and it would be shut for 72 hours. Pubs in England were allowed toreopen to customers on 4 July. Tighter lockdown restrictions could be introduced in Blackburn following a spike in coronavirus cases. People in the town will be asked to limit visitors from another household to two,compared with looser rules elsewhere. The area's public health director said stronger measures would be imposed in two weeks if the number of cases did not fall. Mass testing began at the weekend after 61 new cases sprang up within a week. The burden ofenforcing new rules on wearing facemasksshould not fall on shop staff, retailers have said. JD Sports chief executive, Peter Cowgill, said: ""The guidance so far is that our store colleagues are not really to get involved and it's a police matter to enforce rather than for them to get involved in any potential public disturbances."" Mr Cowgill urged the public to ""play their part and to abide by these restrictions"" but also criticised the government for ""inconsistencies and indecisiveness"" over the new rules. Environment Secretary George Eustice said both retailers and shoppers have responsibilities to uphold the new measures before the police will be asked to step in. ""Of course retailers have been very responsible in the way they're approaching this challenge, they will have a role to play in making sure there's compliance,"" he said. ""But when it comes to that final sanction of issuing a penalty, that is something that only the police can do."" A bed factory has seen eight workers test positive for coronavirus - the third in a series of outbreaks at similar sites in West Yorkshire. Highgrove Beds in Liversedge ceased production as a safety precaution with all staff being offered tests. The outbreak follows cases at Deep Sleep Beds in Ossett and Dura Beds in Batley over the past month. There have also been cases of coronavirus reported at two meat factories in West Yorkshire. The government has saidnew rules that people must wear face coveringswill apply to ""all shops"" but not some other establishments. Pubs and restaurants are excluded due to people needing to be able to eat. Shop staff would also not be forced to wear coverings, as the government says it ""won't be right for every setting in retail"" for example, staff behind tills. The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if people pay within 14 days. The changes are due to come into effect in England on 24 July. The owners of a village pub which was virtually empty on its first Friday night after lockdown have pleaded for customers to return. Julie and Stephen Penney filmed a quiet bar and restaurant at The Swan in Monks Eleigh, Suffolk, which would normally be busy at the start of the weekend. Mrs Penney said: ""We need people to realise that we need them back because next year is a long way away when you've got no trade."" The government said it would help the hospitality industry by reducing VAT from 20% to 5% for six months and by offering diners a discount of up to Â£10 per head at eligible restaurants, Monday to Wednesday.

The hashtag #NoMasks and #Muzzles were both trending on Twitter this morning, while several people posted pictures of chopped-up cards or cancelled registrations. Dominey Jenner and her cut-up card Many said the order -which will come into effect from 24 July and carries a maximum fine of Â£100 for non-compliance- is incompatible with the party's libertarian values. Dominey Jenner, 42, from Wimbledon, south-west London, told the PA news agency that the face mask rules are the ""final straw"".

UK Huawei spat symptom of wider China tensions,"Tensions over Huawei's 5G network are symptomatic of wider pressures China faces globally In diplomacy there are words and actions. Rhetoric can often be exchanged without skirmish becoming battle. But hard decisions with real consequences tend to produce tangible responses. So it may be when Britain announces its much-anticipated plans to restrict further the involvement of the Chinese tech giant, Huawei, in the UK's 5G mobile telecoms network. This is the moment when simmering Sino-British tensions may come to the boil. Thus far China has made generic threats without being specific. The country's ambassador in London, Liu Xiaoming,warned Britain it will have to ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a hostile country.,external. Banning Huawei would, he said, damage Britain's reputation as an open, trading nation. It would not be trusted to stick to its word. The world would know the UK had ""succumbed to foreign pressure"" - he meant the US - and no longer had an independent foreign policy. What would happen if the UK ditched Huawei? The spying game: China's global network But when pushed - both on Huawei and the UK's decision to offer a pathway to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kong residents after China imposed draconian new national security laws - the ambassador declined to say how Beijing might respond. ""Wait and see,"" he said with a glint in his eye that was not altogether cheery. A delayed response would not be unusual. China is well known for taking a long view in diplomacy. While many western politicians can hardly see beyond next week, China's statesmen often see history in terms of decades, if not centuries. Beijing knows the UK's u-turn on Huawei is part of a broad reassessment of its relations with China that has yet to be concluded. A so-called ""Integrated Review"" of Britain's foreign policy is under way, in which the rising power of China will play a central role. Britain is assessing its economic exposure to China in light of recent events As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government is looking again at the exposure of the British economy to China, not just in terms of pharmaceutical or medical equipment, but also other sectoral supply chains. The government has alreadytaken new powers to block the takeover of British firms by Chinese corporations,external, and there is further legislation in the pipeline in the form of the National Security & Investment Bill. Urging the government on at every stage is a parliament pushing for a tougher line on China. There is a profusion of new ginger groups on the Tory benches - the China Research Group, the Huawei Interest Group, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. Labour too are lobbying hard, with the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Lisa Nandy, calling for curbs on China's investment in critical national infrastructure, such as nuclear power. The Lib Dems want the UK to offer settlement rights to all Hong Kongers, not just those with British passports. So Britain's policy response to China is in flux. Beijing may wait to see how it settles before deciding what price the UK should pay for its new-found assertiveness. Beijing is also fighting fires on many fronts. Its long-running confrontation with the United States shows no sign of ending. Anti-Chinese sentiment is still a running theme of the US presidential elections. The US is imposing sanctions on senior Communist party leaders involved in abuses on Uighur and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province.China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, talks of ""the most serious challenges in 40 years of relations"",externalbut notably also speaks of the need for reconciliation. US President Trump claims Huawei 'backed by Chinese military' There is China's stand-off with Australia which began when Canberra called for an international investigation into Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. This provoked a Chinese ban on some Australian beef and barley imports. Canberra is now relaxing its immigration rules for people who want to leave Hong Kong, whilesuspending its extradition law with the former British colony.Australia has also decided to boost its defence spending by 40%,externalto counter what some see as the growing threat from China in the Indo-Pacific. New Zealand, too, is reviewing its relationship with Hong Kong,externalas a result of the new security laws, including its extradition arrangements and travel advice. The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order China's relations with Canada remain in the deep freeze, again over Huawei. In December 2018, the Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer, at the request of United States over allegations she had breached US sanctions on Iran. Within weeks two Canadians were arrested in China and held in what has been described as""hostage diplomacy"". Canada is restricting military exports to Hong Kong over the new security laws and has also suspended its extradition treaty. Chinese and Indian troops clashed over a border dispute earlier this year As if all that were not enough global diplomacy sitting on Beijing's desk, one should not forgetthe first serious border clash between China and India for decades. And of course there are the continuing tensions with countries around the South China Sea as China expands its military presence in the region. The point is that China's Huawei difficulties with the UK are not isolated, they are part of a list of global confrontations that Beijing is facing. At some point, of course, China may well make good on some of its threats against Britain. There are many options. Beijing could make it even harder for British firms to operate in Chinese markets. It could impose sanctions in specific goods. It could restrict - or even reverse - Chinese investment coming into the UK. It could reduce the number of Chinese students and pupils in Britain, upending the finances of universities and public schools that have grown too reliant on foreign fees. How hard China pushes back may depend on specific decisions such as whether it wishes to make an example of the UK over Hong Kong and Huawei ""pour encourager les autres"". It knows that it has the potential to punish the UK severely at a time when London will need as much trade and investment it can get its hands on in the post-Covid-19 economic downturn. Or there may be a wider strategic consideration. How much does China really want confrontation across the board? It is one thing to be more assertive overseas to encourage nationalistic sentiment at home. It is quite another to enter an era of prolonged, low level tension with the West with a constant risk of escalation at a time of huge economic uncertainty. Australia is among several countries beefing up military co-operation in the Pacific The danger for China is that its aggression acts as a catalyst to unite countries against it. Where once Beijing could pick countries off one by one, it might be more constrained if the so-called Five Eyes group of nations - the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - joined forces with other democracies - such as India, South Korea, Japan - and other nations - such as Vietnam or Malaysia - to push back against China. Last Thursday foreign ministers from the Five Eyes network discussed what further action they could take over Hong Kong. The so-called 'quad' of Australia, India, Japan and the US -are beefing up their defence cooperation.,external. There is talk of a new so-called D10 group of nations,external- the G7 plus Australia, South Korea and India - to generate non-Chinese technology. The big strategic decision for many countries in the 21st Century is how to get the right balance in their relationship with China between engagement and independence, between defending their values and protecting their economic and security interests. And while China is engaged in diplomatic skirmishes across the globe, the big decision for the People's Republic is how hard it wants to fight.

Huawei UK 5G ban 'should happen sooner',"The government should remove Chinese firm Huawei from the UK's 5G network by 2025 instead of 2027, as planned, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has said. The telecoms company is to be banned from setting up 5G, but will remain involved in 3G and 4G. Mr Duncan Smith said allowing Huawei to work on these also posed a continued ""risk"" to national security. But the government said it would ""ensure"" the UK's communications system was as ""secure as it possibly can be"". Huawei, which has repeatedly said itwould not cause harm to any country,predicted the UK would now be pushed ""into the digital slow lane"", with higher bills for consumers. Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027 BT: Impossible to ditch Huawei in under 10 years Could Huawei be out of the UK by 2024? In January, ministers announced the company would be kept out of the sensitive core of the 5G network - including national intelligence - but be allowed involvement in up to 35% of other parts. This prompted criticismfrom backbench Conservative MPs,marshalled by Mr Duncan Smith, who called Huawei an arm of the Chinese Communist Party and a risk to the UK. The US, with which the UK shares much of its intelligence, also applied diplomatic pressure for a rethink. Under its revised plans, the government says Huawei willnot be allowed to install any equipment for the 5G networkfrom next year - and its existing equipment will be removed by 2027. But Mr Duncan Smith told the House of Commons that the head of BT thought the removal could happen two years earlier. He said: ""I do think he [Mr Dowden] can do it quicker than this... There's no reason why it can't [happen]."" The government thought it had made its decision on Huawei earlier this year. It wanted to get on with delivering faster internet and thought Huawei was best placed to ensure speedy upgrades. But since then the US has continued to apply pressure - with its decision to impose new sanctions on China a crucial factor. Meanwhile, dozens of Tory backbenchers continued their opposition - and refused to fall in line. They have cautiously welcomed the announcement that the UK is moving away from Huawei - but they want things to move faster. Some are also uneasy that the company's technology will stay in the 3G and 4G network. This decision wasn't without cost though. Ministers admit it will delay the rollout of 5G across the UK and will cost significant amounts of money - into the billions. They've also had to consider warnings from telecoms providers about service provision. Ultimately though, the combination of political pressure - international and domestic - has won the debate in government. Mr Duncan Smith added that there were ""contradictions"" in banning Huawei from 5G but not 3G and 4G, which would undergo ""software upgrades""by Huawei ""for the next decade"". ""So, if they're a risk to us in 5G, why are they not a risk to us generally?"" he asked. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden replied: ""The reality of the 5G network is that it is fundamentally different and it's a recognition of that fundamental difference that we are imposing these rules for 5G. ""Of course, over time... 5G will be replaced by 6G, and in all of that Huawei will be absent."" He also said: ""There is of course no such thing as a perfectly secure network, but the responsibility of the government is to ensure that it is as secure as it possibly can be."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy described the announcement as a ""welcome, long-overdue step"" but accused the government of having ""no consistent approach"" to China. Speaking to the BBC, she said said that, while one department is ""seeking to ban them from the 5G network"", another is ""considering handing over technology involved in our nuclear industry to the Chinese government."" SNP culture spokesman John Nicolson said it had been wrong in the first place to allow Huawei near the ""nervous system"" of the UK's telecoms network. And Labour MP Chris Bryant told the Commons there was ""unity"" among MPs in opposition to the company's further involvement in 5G, saying: ""I wish the government would listen to its own backbenchers."" The US has claimed China coulduse Huawei to ""spy, steal or attack"",externalthe UK - but the company denies this and its founder has said he would rather shut the company down than do anything to damage its clients. Sanctions imposed in May by Washington havelimited China's access to US chip technology, which prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to launch a review of the use of Huawei.

The government has decided that wearing face coverings in shops in England will be compulsory from 24 July. This video can not be played Ashworth: âMinisterial muddle' on coronavirus face masks Labour's shadow health secretary said âit did not have to be this wayâ over government advice on wearing face coverings in shops in England. Jonathan Ashworth asked Health Secretary Matt Hancock why it had taken two months to decide on making them mandatory, and why this would not be enforced for a further 11 days. âAll we need and want is clarity,â he told MPs. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check New rules making face coverings compulsory inside shops in
England have led to lots of heated discussion on social media. People have been
encouraging others to wear a face mask, but thereâs also opposition to the new
rules and #NoMasks and #muzzles have been trending on Twitter in the UK. Weâve looked at misleading claims that masks might actually
be dangerous to the wearer. Memes shared on social media claim that masks
might deprive you of oxygen or lead to the body taking in too much carbon
dioxide. But thereâs no evidence this will happen. The recommended type of mask worn properly wonât do
you any harm. The World Health Organization says ""the prolonged use of
medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen
deficiency. Graffitidaubed by beachgoerson cliffs at Durdle Door beach in Dorset has been removed. Lulworth Estate, which owns the beach on the Jurassic Coast, said a ""vast and unacceptable amount of graffiti"" had recently appeared on the cliffs. The Unesco World Heritage site has seen an influx of visitors since lockdown restrictions were eased across England. Rangers from the estate and volunteers from Dorset Climbing have removed the messages and signatures. Rob EnglandBBC News More awareness is needed of people who are exempt from wearing face coverings in Englandas new measures in shops are announced, charities have warned. People with severe respiratory conditions are one of the groups not required to wear masks - as this can make them feel unwell. Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy at Asthma UK and the British Lung
Foundation, said: ""As face coverings become mandatory in shops in England, we urge the
public to think twice before they judge someone for not wearing a face mask. She added: ""Not all health conditions are visible and people with lung conditions have already
told us that theyâve been publicly confronted by strangers about not wearing
one, leaving them feeling anxious and humiliated."" The governmenthas released some guidance,externalon groups who are currently exempt on public transport, including those who have ""a physical or mental illness or impairment, or a disability"" meaning they cannot do so. A pub has been shut for a ""deep clean""after a customer tested positive for coronavirus. The Crown & Anchor in Aveley, Essex, said a man had been taken to hospital on 12 July after previously visiting the establishment. It said on itsFacebook page,externalthat all ""necessary measures took place"", that the ""situation was out of our control"" and it would be shut for 72 hours. Pubs in England were allowed toreopen to customers on 4 July. Tighter lockdown restrictions could be introduced in Blackburn following a spike in coronavirus cases. People in the town will be asked to limit visitors from another household to two,compared with looser rules elsewhere. The area's public health director said stronger measures would be imposed in two weeks if the number of cases did not fall. Mass testing began at the weekend after 61 new cases sprang up within a week. The burden ofenforcing new rules on wearing facemasksshould not fall on shop staff, retailers have said. JD Sports chief executive, Peter Cowgill, said: ""The guidance so far is that our store colleagues are not really to get involved and it's a police matter to enforce rather than for them to get involved in any potential public disturbances."" Mr Cowgill urged the public to ""play their part and to abide by these restrictions"" but also criticised the government for ""inconsistencies and indecisiveness"" over the new rules. Environment Secretary George Eustice said both retailers and shoppers have responsibilities to uphold the new measures before the police will be asked to step in. ""Of course retailers have been very responsible in the way they're approaching this challenge, they will have a role to play in making sure there's compliance,"" he said. ""But when it comes to that final sanction of issuing a penalty, that is something that only the police can do."" A bed factory has seen eight workers test positive for coronavirus - the third in a series of outbreaks at similar sites in West Yorkshire. Highgrove Beds in Liversedge ceased production as a safety precaution with all staff being offered tests. The outbreak follows cases at Deep Sleep Beds in Ossett and Dura Beds in Batley over the past month. There have also been cases of coronavirus reported at two meat factories in West Yorkshire. The government has saidnew rules that people must wear face coveringswill apply to ""all shops"" but not some other establishments. Pubs and restaurants are excluded due to people needing to be able to eat. Shop staff would also not be forced to wear coverings, as the government says it ""won't be right for every setting in retail"" for example, staff behind tills. The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if people pay within 14 days. The changes are due to come into effect in England on 24 July. The owners of a village pub which was virtually empty on its first Friday night after lockdown have pleaded for customers to return. Julie and Stephen Penney filmed a quiet bar and restaurant at The Swan in Monks Eleigh, Suffolk, which would normally be busy at the start of the weekend. Mrs Penney said: ""We need people to realise that we need them back because next year is a long way away when you've got no trade."" The government said it would help the hospitality industry by reducing VAT from 20% to 5% for six months and by offering diners a discount of up to Â£10 per head at eligible restaurants, Monday to Wednesday. This video can not be played Conservative Party members have been cutting up their membership cards in protest at Boris Johnson's move to make face masks mandatory in shops in England. The hashtag #NoMasks and #Muzzles were both trending on Twitter this morning, while several people posted pictures of chopped-up cards or cancelled registrations. Dominey Jenner and her cut-up card Many said the order -which will come into effect from 24 July and carries a maximum fine of Â£100 for non-compliance- is incompatible with the party's libertarian values. Dominey Jenner, 42, from Wimbledon, south-west London, told the PA news agency that the face mask rules are the ""final straw"". ""I think people should be trusted, I think we should be given a choice. I'm really angry at how the government has invoked fear in its population to control people - I think that is the wrong way to manage a population and to govern."" Jay VydelingumBBC News Online James in Bedford has contacted us to say his partner who has hearing difficulties is extremely anxious about wearing a mask. ""My partner is terrified.  She has hearing difficulties and making masks mandatory will isolate her as she relies on lip reading to support her hearing. ""People say it isn't a big deal but they're not thinking about all the people that will be isolated.

""My partner is not classified as deaf and rejects the label of being disabled even though this could be applied to her. ""I've even looked into the masks that are transparent at the front so that we can communicate via lip reading when we are together.

""She is very worried she will end up being stuck at home and has anxiety because of it"". Earlier this month,we told you about clear masks being made to help deaf people with lip-reading. Gail Conway is using clear masks as she relies on lip reading to communicate effectively Â© 2025 BBC.

Major museums expect 80% drop in visitors,"A curator checks the distancing between two exhibits at the Natural History Museum Some of London's biggest museums have announced their plans to reopen next month, but are expecting visitor numbers to drop by 80% when they do. The Natural History Museum, V&A and Science Museum will all open their doors again during August. Visitors will be ""strongly"" recommended to wear face masks, but it will not be compulsory, as it will in shops. Free tickets must be booked in advance. The venues ruled out charging, despite their ""very precarious"" finances. The museums all have their main bases in South Kensington and will reopen before the end of the school summer holidays: Natural History Museum- 5 August, Wednesday-Sunday, with the ""vast majority"" of galleries open. The branch in Tring, Hertfordshire, will reopen on the same day. V&A- ground and lower ground floors from 6 August, open Thursday-Sunday; then first and second floors, and the V&A Dundee, from 27 August. Science Museum- 19 August, seven days a week until 6 September, then Wednesday-Sunday. Reopening dates vary for the four other attractions in the Science Museum Group. Natural History Museum director Sir Michael Dixon said its visitor numbers would initially be capped at 2,800 per day. ""But that's about a fifth of our normal average attendance,"" he said. ""We're expecting something like an 80% reduction until social distancing rules change, and the public attitudes to visiting change. ""We think that demand will outstrip supply, but that's a guess because we're in a period of mass uncertainty at the moment."" Museums including the V&A have been closed since March The V&A is expecting a reduction ""in the same ballpark"", director Tristram Hunt said, explaining that it would open for fewer days than normal at first. ""Our finances have been bolstered by the government but are still very precarious, so there's little point having very extended opening hours if no-one's coming through the door,"" he said. The museum bosses praised the government forits Â£1.5bn emergency funding package, but said they would need more money next year to make up for fewer people buying from their cafes and shops. Hunt said there would need to be ""a new partnership with government which recognises this new reality, which understands that in the absence of the commercial income that comes from those visitors we will need more government support going into the future"". The funding announced by the government earlier this month was ""resoundingly good"", according to Sir Ian Blatchford, director of the Science Museum Group and chair of the National Museum Directors' Council. ""It's the type of thing you'd expect the German or the French government to spend,"" he said. ""The big issue for us is next year - the [next] full financial year - there'll be a discussion with the government this autumn."" But he said charging for entry to make up the financial shortfall was ""definitely not on the agenda"", beyond special exhibitions. ""It seems to me absolutely the worst possible policy. There's no support for entrance fees from any major political party. ""As far as I'm concerned, that debate is dead, buried and covered in concrete because at a time when we're trying to increase the diversity of our audiences, I think charging people to go to museums would be a retrograde step of absolutely the worst sort.

Face coverings to be compulsory in England's shopsThe new rules will apply from 24 July and those failing to comply will face a fine of up to Â£100.UK PoliticsComments,"Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government has announced. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would ""give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protections for those who work in shops"". The move will bring England into line with Scotland and other major European nations like Spain, Italy and Germany. Since mid-May, members of the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. Mask-wearing has been compulsory on public transport in England and at NHS facilities across the UK since 15 June. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The list of exemptions has not yet been published, but the rules for face maskson public transport,externalexempt anyone who cannot wear one ""because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability"", who would experience ""severe distress"" from doing so, or relies on lip reading, among other reasons. Mr Hancock told the Commons: ""Sadly, sales assistants, cashiers and security guards have suffered disproportionately in this crisis. ""The death rate of sales and retail assistants is 75% higher amongst men and 60% higher amongst women than in the general population."" He added: ""There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop."" The new rule will not apply to retail staff. It comes asthe UK recorded the deaths of a further 138,externalpeople who had tested positive for coronavirus. Why have attitudes to face masks changed? How to make your own face mask Why do customers have to wear face coverings but not staff? And other questions Tory MP Desmond Swayne described the rule as a ""monstrous imposition"" that would make him less likely to go shopping. Labour said ministers had been ""slow and muddled"" on face coverings and questioned why the new rules would not come into force for 11 days. But Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC that research on the use of face coverings, including advice from the World Health Organization, had been ""evolving"". And he said the delay between the announcement and the rule coming into force on 24 July ""gives people time to prepare"". Wearing face coverings in shops is an ""appropriate mitigation"" against the ""overall risk"" of the coronavirus, but the rule would not work in pubs, cafes or restaurants, he added. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if the fine is paid within 14 days. ""A shop can refuse them entry and can call the police if they refuse to comply,"" Mr Hancock said. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said police should be involved only as a ""last resort"". During lockdown, police in England issued around 16,000 fines for alleged breaches of the restrictions. Enforcing the rules was not always easy, particularly because the regulations were drawn up at the last minute, but forces did at least have enough resources - as crime and emergency calls had fallen sharply. Now, as the country begins to return to normal, demands on police time are growing again. That's one reason why officers don't want the extra burden of dealing with non-compliant shop customers. Another factor is a concern is that it may draw police into confrontations with the public at a time when the service is already under the spotlight for its use of tactics, such as stop-and-search. However, the way the face-covering rules are likely to be drafted means it will be the police, not shop staff, who will be called upon if people refuse to abide by the measures. Ken Marsh of the Metropolitan Police Federation suggested enforcing the new rule could strain the relationship between police officers and the general public. And John Apter of the Police Federation said it should be down to shops to make wearing a face covering a ""condition of entry"". In Scotland, the use of coveringsin shops has been mandatory since 10 July. Few fines have been issued and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggestedcompliance had been ""extremely high"". Shoppersin WalesandNorthern Irelandare not currently required to wear them, although both nations have said this will be kept under review. Peter Barnes says wearing coverings in shops to stop the spread can only be a good thing Antiques shop owner Mary Foster from Weybridge, Surrey, tells the BBC she fears mandatory face coverings in stores could increase shoplifting. ""I think people will feel more empowered to try to steal things,"" she says. For some BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, face coverings are uncomfortable, steam up your glasses, and infringe on personal freedom. Andy, from Manchester, says the discomfort means he's less likely to go to the shops and now worries shopping must carry a higher risk than he thought. Pamela, who runs a clothes shop in East Kilbride, says most of her customers have been happy to wear one - only one refused because they didn't like it. But Peter Barnes, a London-based political consultant who contracted Covid-19 in March, tells BBC Business the discomfort of a covering is worth it to save lives. ""If we can save one life, then wearing a mask in the supermarket for an hour or so has got to be entirely worth it,"" he says. Read morehere. Do you work in a shop?

Boris Johnson signalled a shift in the government's position on Friday when he spoke of the need for a stricter approach in confined setting. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove downplayed the suggestion of any immediate legal change on Sunday. Labour said the mixed messages demonstrated the government's indecision during the pandemic, and ministers had to explain the ""further delay"". ""The government has been slow and muddled again,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. Boris Johnson has been seen wearing a cloth face covering in recent days A No 10 spokesman said: ""There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from coronavirus. ""The prime minister has been clear that people should be wearing face coverings in shops and we will make this mandatory from 24 July."" Unions and businesses have said the new guidance must be ""clear and detailed"" to protect staff and customers.

Is the UK in a recession?,"The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was ""returning to full health"", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a ""victory lap"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces. When GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result. But sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets. What is GDP and how does it affect me? The UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters. The economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December. This meantthe economy went into recession at the end of 2023. But the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession. Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises? Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth.

Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027,"The UK's mobile providers are being banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December, and they must also remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden told the House of Commons of the decision. It follows sanctions imposed by Washington, which claims the firm poses a national security threat - something Huawei denies. Mr Dowden said the supply ban would delay the UK's 5G rollout by a year. The technology promises faster internet speeds and the capacity to support more wireless devices, which should be a boon to everything from mobile gaming to higher-quality video streams, and even in time driverless cars that talk to each other. 5G connections are already available in dozens of UK cities and towns, but coverage can be sparse. Mr Dowden added that the cumulative cost of the moves when coupled with earlier restrictions announced against Huawei would be up to Â£2bn, and a total delay to 5G rollout of ""two to three years"". ""This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the UK telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy, both now and indeed in the long run,"" he said. This video can not be played Watch: The digital secretary says providers must remove all of Huawei's 5G kit from their networks by 2027 Because the US sanctions only affect future equipment, the government has been advised there is no security justification for removing 2G, 3G and 4G equipment supplied by Huawei. However, when swapping out the company's masts, networks are likely to switch to a different vendor to provide the earlier-generation services. Huawei said the move was ""bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone"" and threatened to ""move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide."" The action, however, does not affect Huawei's ability to sell its smartphones to consumers or how they will run. China's ambassador to the UK said the decision was ""disappointing and wrong"". ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries,""tweeted Liu Xiaoming,external. But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the news, saying: ""The UK joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors."" New restrictions will also apply to use of the company's broadband kit. Operators are being told they should ""transition away"" from purchasing new Huawei equipment for use in full-fibre networks, ideally within the next two years. Many of Huawei's products are developed at its labs near Shenzhen, China Mr Dowden said the government would ""embark on a short technical consultation"" with industry leaders about this. He explained that the UK needed to avoid becoming dependent on Nokia - which is currently the only other supplier used for some equipment - and he wanted to avoid ""unnecessary delays"" to the government's gigabit-for-all by 2025 pledge. BT's Openreach division told the BBC it had in fact recentlystruck a deal to buy full-fibre network kit from a new supplier,external- the US firm Adtran - but first deliveries would only start in 2021. The UK last reviewed Huawei's role in its telecoms infrastructure in January, whenit was decided to let the firm remain a supplier but introduced a cap on its market share. But in May the US introduced new sanctions designed to disrupt Huawei's ability to get its own chips manufactured. The Trump administration claims that Huawei provides a gateway for China to spy on and potentially attack countries that use its equipment, suggestions the company strongly rejects. The sanctions led security officials to conclude they could no longer assure the security of its products if the company had to start sourcing chips from third-parties for use in its equipment. The minister cited a review carried out by GCHQ'sNational Cyber Security Centre as being the motivation for the changes,external. TSMC - one of the world's biggest chip manufacturers - has stopped taking orders from Huawei as a consequence of the US sanctions NCSC has said Huawei productsadapted to use third-party chips would be,external""likely to suffer more security and reliability problems"". But other political considerations are also likely to have also come into play, including the UK's desire to strike a trade deal with the US, and growing tensions with China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its treatment of Hong Kong. Some backbench Tory MPs had pressed for a shorter time-span for its removal, in particular there had been calls for the 5G ban to come into effect before the next election in May 2024. However, Mr Dowden said that ""the shorter we make the timetable for removal, the greater the risk of actual disruption to mobile phone networks"". BT and Vodafone had warned that customerscould face mobile blackouts if they were forcedto remove all of Huawei's 5G kit in less time. Huawei: What does the ban mean for you? Huawei UK 5G ban 'should happen sooner' UK Huawei decision part of wider strategic tensions with China Labour's shadow technology minister Chi Onwurah said the government was incapable of sorting ""this mess out on their own"". It had ""refused to face reality"" and been ""incomprehensively negligent"" in allowing matters to get to this point, she added, and a taskforce of experts now needed to be created. Hopes on the part of government that this decision may put the Huawei issue to bed may be optimistic. The reason that we are here again despite a decision in January is because one of the key players - the US - played a new card in the form of sanctions. And there is still time between now and legislation coming to parliament in Autumn for others to do the same - whether Conservative backbenchers or Beijing. In the long run, many countries will be watching carefully how China reacts. Will it feel it needs to punish the UK in order to discourage others from following its lead on 5G? Or will it want to avoid being seen as a bully and prefer to try and influence the decision more subtly? Whatever the case, the Huawei story in the UK is not over yet. Huawei says it employs about 1,600 people in the UK and claims to be one of Britain'slargest sources of investment from China,external. The firm - whose shares are not publicly traded - does not provide a regional breakdown of its earnings. But on Monday, it announced a 13% rise in sales for the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, totalling 454bn yuan ($64.8bn; Â£51.3bn). The UK will have accounted for a fraction of that. The firm's UK chief recently noted that Huawei had only deployed a total of 20,000 5G base stations - the radio receiver/transmitter equipment fitted to a mast - in the UK so far. By contrast it expects to deliver a total of 500,000 globally this year. Even so, what the firm fears and Washington hopes is that other countries will now follow Westminster's lead with bans of their own. Despite there seeming little chance of a U-turn, Huawei said it was still urging UK ministers to reconsider. ""We will conduct a detailed review of what today's announcement means for our business here and will work with the UK government to explain how we can continue to contribute to a better connected Britain,"" spokesman Ed Brewster said. Shortly before the announcementSky News revealed that Lord Browne,external, Huawei's UK chairman and the ex-chief executive of BP, would be leaving the Chinese company before his term had expired. It said he had given his notice a few days ago and would formally step down in September. Lord Browne is stepping down six months before his time at Huawei was due to end Lord Browne had led efforts to improve the company's image in the UK and had tried to prevent a ban. ""He has been central to our commitment here dating back 20 years, and we thank him for his valuable contribution,"" said Huawei, confirming the report. BT is set to be the telecoms operator most affected by the decision given it runs both the EE mobile network and Openreach, which provides fixed-line infrastructure to individual internet providers. ""We need to further analyse the details and implications of this decision before taking a view of potential costs and impacts,"" it said. The move should, however, benefit Nokia and Ericsson, which are the two other main 5G kit vendors. ""We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed... with minimal impact on the people using our customers' networks,"" said Nokia. Huawei still supplies masts and other 5G equipment to Germany, Switzerland and China among other countries Ericsson added: ""Today's decision removes the uncertainty that was slowing down investment decisions around the deployment of 5G in the UK... and we stand ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable."" However, both firms manufacture some of their 5G equipment in China, which has also caused concern in Washington. Huawei: Why is it being banned from the UK's 5G network? What is 5G? Trudeau rejects calls to release Huawei executive In June, the US Department of Defense published a list of 20 companies it claimed had close ties to the Chinese military. It included Panda Electronics - the firm with which Ericsson jointly runs a manufacturing facility in the Chinese city of Nanjing. ""A lot of companies assemble equipment or have some type of manufacturing in China,"" Ericsson's head of corporate communications Peter Olofsson told the BBC, when asked about this. ""Our trade compliance people have looked at this [list] and they concluded that it's not something that has an impact on Ericsson or our operations."" Ultimately Huawei believes that this was a political decision and not a business one. And if the political winds change, then Huawei's fortunes may too. My understanding is that a longer time frame for the removal of its 5G kit from UK networks was a relatively desirable outcome for Huawei. So even though no new Huawei UK equipment can be bought by UK mobile carriers after the end of this year, the fact that the UK has until 2027 to remove Huawei's 5G kit from all of its network could be seen as a potential positive. A new US administration in November could markedly change Washington's position on Huawei. So for Huawei, playing the long game makes sense. And one thing that was crystal clear to me frommeeting Ren Zhengfei, the company's founder is that he's a fighter. Ren Zhengfei told the BBC: 'If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North is dark, then there is still the South.' Nothing he has said indicates he is willing to give up. For now though, the immediate impact of the UK decision will be seen as a signal that Washington's campaign on Huawei has worked. And the Chinese firm will not want that replicated in other countries around the world. Huawei: What does the ban mean for you?

"Property sale tax threshold raised in WalesProperties up to the value of Â£250,000 will now be exempt from paying until next March.","The average cost of a home in Wales is Â£161,719, already under the tax payment threshold Land transaction tax will be changed in Wales, meaning about 80% of house sales will be exempt from paying tax. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans made the announcement at the Welsh Government daily coronavirus briefing. It will bring the rate payable for properties valued at between Â£180,000 and Â£250,000 to zero from 27 July until the end of March 2021. Properties selling for less than Â£180,000 are already exempt from paying the tax. The change will not apply to second homes or buy-to-let properties, which have to pay an additional 3% in taxon top of the existing rate for their value,external. The tax, known as stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland, has already been waived for properties there up to the value of Â£500,000. This video can not be played Rebecca Evans says the change will ""help those moving up the housing ladder and first-time buyers"" Ms Evans said: ""Unlike in England, this new threshold will not apply to the purchase of additional properties such as buy-to-lets or second homes. ""It will support people looking to purchase their first home or those seeking to move up the property ladder. So it will offer more targeted help to those who may be affected by the economic challenges resulting from the pandemic."" The minister said the new threshold meant no tax would be paid on around 80% of transactions in Wales where the main residential rates apply. Ms Evans said the decision to cut the tax house buyers pay was ""very much a response"" to the chancellor's change to the system in England last week, saying the ""porous"" nature of the Wales-England border was a motivating factor. The UK government changes meant Wales had received some additional funding, she explained, some of which was being redirected towards social housing. ""This decision will not only provide support to homebuyers, it will also free up some Â£30m to invest in a different, even more direct stimulus to the housebuilding industry,"" Ms Evans said. ""I am pleased to confirm that this funding will be committed to the construction of modern social homes, supporting jobs and securing a decent place to call home for those who need it"". What does the stamp duty holiday mean for Wales? House prices 'fall for first time in eight years' 'Historic' bill for Welsh taxes passed Currently, properties sold for between Â£180,000 and Â£250,000 pay 3.5% of the value in tax. As an example, an average selling price of Â£212,063 in Cardiff means the buyer would pay Â£1,262.21 in land transaction tax (LTT). The maximum tax payable at present on a Â£250,000 property is Â£2,450. Forecasts from February by theOffice for Budget Responsibility,externalshowed the Welsh Government was expected to raise Â£250m from the tax, although this was before the coronavirus pandemic, so it is now likely to be lower. Nathan Hardee and his girlfriend will save nearly Â£2,500 Nathan Hardee and his girlfriend have been renting in Cardiff for three years while saving up to buy a house. They found a house for around Â£300,000 in the new Plasdwr development to the city's north-west. If coronavirus had not come along, they would have moved in by now after finding the house in December. However, the Welsh Government's announcement on the land transaction tax holiday has seen a silver lining to the cloud of delay. It means the couple will now save nearly Â£2,500 on what they would have had to pay, as they will only be taxed on the portion of the payment which is more than Â£250,000, rather than everything above Â£180,000. Mr Hardee told BBC Wales: ""If you haven't got to save up for stamp duty as well, that could be quite a big, significant difference to people who want to buy. ""We're due to complete early September at the moment, so today's announcement has made a massive difference to us. We'll get an extra Â£2,450 now. ""When we come to complete on the day, we end up paying less money. ""It was the sort of thing that was needed."" He thought the tax holiday could help keep buyers in his situation in Wales, saying if there had been a tax break only in England they might have looked at Bristol instead. The tax holiday will only apply to main residence purchases, not second homes In England and Northern Ireland, anyone completing on a main residence costing up to Â£500,000 between 8 July and 31 March will not pay any stamp duty, and more expensive properties will only be taxed on their value above that amount. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the average stamp duty bill in the two countries would fall by Â£4,500, with nine out of ten people paying no duty at all. Scotland has also announceda rise in the threshold for its version of stamp duty, the land and buildings transaction tax, from Â£145,000 to Â£250,000. Although welcoming Ms Evans announcement, Conservative finance spokesman in the Senedd Nick Ramsay said capping the tax holiday at sales of Â£250,000 would ""do very little to kick-start the housing market in Wales or to tempt buyers near the border to buy a property here rather than in England"". Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was pleased Welsh ministers did not ""cut and paste England's changes to stamp duty"" saying the move ""shows the value of being able to tailor taxation policy to Wales' needs and being able to set different priorities"".

Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027The government is also banning telecoms firms from buying new Huawei 5G kit after 31 December.Technology,"The UK's mobile providers are being banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December, and they must also remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden told the House of Commons of the decision. It follows sanctions imposed by Washington, which claims the firm poses a national security threat - something Huawei denies. Mr Dowden said the supply ban would delay the UK's 5G rollout by a year. The technology promises faster internet speeds and the capacity to support more wireless devices, which should be a boon to everything from mobile gaming to higher-quality video streams, and even in time driverless cars that talk to each other. 5G connections are already available in dozens of UK cities and towns, but coverage can be sparse. Mr Dowden added that the cumulative cost of the moves when coupled with earlier restrictions announced against Huawei would be up to Â£2bn, and a total delay to 5G rollout of ""two to three years"". ""This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the UK telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy, both now and indeed in the long run,"" he said. This video can not be played Watch: The digital secretary says providers must remove all of Huawei's 5G kit from their networks by 2027 Because the US sanctions only affect future equipment, the government has been advised there is no security justification for removing 2G, 3G and 4G equipment supplied by Huawei. However, when swapping out the company's masts, networks are likely to switch to a different vendor to provide the earlier-generation services. Huawei said the move was ""bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone"" and threatened to ""move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide."" The action, however, does not affect Huawei's ability to sell its smartphones to consumers or how they will run. China's ambassador to the UK said the decision was ""disappointing and wrong"". ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries,""tweeted Liu Xiaoming,external. But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the news, saying: ""The UK joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors."" New restrictions will also apply to use of the company's broadband kit. Operators are being told they should ""transition away"" from purchasing new Huawei equipment for use in full-fibre networks, ideally within the next two years. Many of Huawei's products are developed at its labs near Shenzhen, China Mr Dowden said the government would ""embark on a short technical consultation"" with industry leaders about this. He explained that the UK needed to avoid becoming dependent on Nokia - which is currently the only other supplier used for some equipment - and he wanted to avoid ""unnecessary delays"" to the government's gigabit-for-all by 2025 pledge. BT's Openreach division told the BBC it had in fact recentlystruck a deal to buy full-fibre network kit from a new supplier,external- the US firm Adtran - but first deliveries would only start in 2021. The UK last reviewed Huawei's role in its telecoms infrastructure in January, whenit was decided to let the firm remain a supplier but introduced a cap on its market share. But in May the US introduced new sanctions designed to disrupt Huawei's ability to get its own chips manufactured. The Trump administration claims that Huawei provides a gateway for China to spy on and potentially attack countries that use its equipment, suggestions the company strongly rejects. The sanctions led security officials to conclude they could no longer assure the security of its products if the company had to start sourcing chips from third-parties for use in its equipment. The minister cited a review carried out by GCHQ'sNational Cyber Security Centre as being the motivation for the changes,external. TSMC - one of the world's biggest chip manufacturers - has stopped taking orders from Huawei as a consequence of the US sanctions NCSC has said Huawei productsadapted to use third-party chips would be,external""likely to suffer more security and reliability problems"". But other political considerations are also likely to have also come into play, including the UK's desire to strike a trade deal with the US, and growing tensions with China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its treatment of Hong Kong. Some backbench Tory MPs had pressed for a shorter time-span for its removal, in particular there had been calls for the 5G ban to come into effect before the next election in May 2024. However, Mr Dowden said that ""the shorter we make the timetable for removal, the greater the risk of actual disruption to mobile phone networks"". BT and Vodafone had warned that customerscould face mobile blackouts if they were forcedto remove all of Huawei's 5G kit in less time. Huawei: What does the ban mean for you? Huawei UK 5G ban 'should happen sooner' UK Huawei decision part of wider strategic tensions with China Labour's shadow technology minister Chi Onwurah said the government was incapable of sorting ""this mess out on their own"". It had ""refused to face reality"" and been ""incomprehensively negligent"" in allowing matters to get to this point, she added, and a taskforce of experts now needed to be created. Hopes on the part of government that this decision may put the Huawei issue to bed may be optimistic. The reason that we are here again despite a decision in January is because one of the key players - the US - played a new card in the form of sanctions. And there is still time between now and legislation coming to parliament in Autumn for others to do the same - whether Conservative backbenchers or Beijing. In the long run, many countries will be watching carefully how China reacts. Will it feel it needs to punish the UK in order to discourage others from following its lead on 5G? Or will it want to avoid being seen as a bully and prefer to try and influence the decision more subtly? Whatever the case, the Huawei story in the UK is not over yet. Huawei says it employs about 1,600 people in the UK and claims to be one of Britain'slargest sources of investment from China,external. The firm - whose shares are not publicly traded - does not provide a regional breakdown of its earnings. But on Monday, it announced a 13% rise in sales for the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, totalling 454bn yuan ($64.8bn; Â£51.3bn). The UK will have accounted for a fraction of that. The firm's UK chief recently noted that Huawei had only deployed a total of 20,000 5G base stations - the radio receiver/transmitter equipment fitted to a mast - in the UK so far. By contrast it expects to deliver a total of 500,000 globally this year. Even so, what the firm fears and Washington hopes is that other countries will now follow Westminster's lead with bans of their own. Despite there seeming little chance of a U-turn, Huawei said it was still urging UK ministers to reconsider. ""We will conduct a detailed review of what today's announcement means for our business here and will work with the UK government to explain how we can continue to contribute to a better connected Britain,"" spokesman Ed Brewster said. Shortly before the announcementSky News revealed that Lord Browne,external, Huawei's UK chairman and the ex-chief executive of BP, would be leaving the Chinese company before his term had expired. It said he had given his notice a few days ago and would formally step down in September. Lord Browne is stepping down six months before his time at Huawei was due to end Lord Browne had led efforts to improve the company's image in the UK and had tried to prevent a ban. ""He has been central to our commitment here dating back 20 years, and we thank him for his valuable contribution,"" said Huawei, confirming the report. BT is set to be the telecoms operator most affected by the decision given it runs both the EE mobile network and Openreach, which provides fixed-line infrastructure to individual internet providers. ""We need to further analyse the details and implications of this decision before taking a view of potential costs and impacts,"" it said. The move should, however, benefit Nokia and Ericsson, which are the two other main 5G kit vendors. ""We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed... with minimal impact on the people using our customers' networks,"" said Nokia. Huawei still supplies masts and other 5G equipment to Germany, Switzerland and China among other countries Ericsson added: ""Today's decision removes the uncertainty that was slowing down investment decisions around the deployment of 5G in the UK... and we stand ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable."" However, both firms manufacture some of their 5G equipment in China, which has also caused concern in Washington. Huawei: Why is it being banned from the UK's 5G network? What is 5G? Trudeau rejects calls to release Huawei executive In June, the US Department of Defense published a list of 20 companies it claimed had close ties to the Chinese military. It included Panda Electronics - the firm with which Ericsson jointly runs a manufacturing facility in the Chinese city of Nanjing. ""A lot of companies assemble equipment or have some type of manufacturing in China,"" Ericsson's head of corporate communications Peter Olofsson told the BBC, when asked about this. ""Our trade compliance people have looked at this [list] and they concluded that it's not something that has an impact on Ericsson or our operations."" Ultimately Huawei believes that this was a political decision and not a business one. And if the political winds change, then Huawei's fortunes may too. My understanding is that a longer time frame for the removal of its 5G kit from UK networks was a relatively desirable outcome for Huawei. So even though no new Huawei UK equipment can be bought by UK mobile carriers after the end of this year, the fact that the UK has until 2027 to remove Huawei's 5G kit from all of its network could be seen as a potential positive. A new US administration in November could markedly change Washington's position on Huawei. So for Huawei, playing the long game makes sense. And one thing that was crystal clear to me frommeeting Ren Zhengfei, the company's founder is that he's a fighter. Ren Zhengfei told the BBC: 'If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North is dark, then there is still the South.' Nothing he has said indicates he is willing to give up. For now though, the immediate impact of the UK decision will be seen as a signal that Washington's campaign on Huawei has worked. And the Chinese firm will not want that replicated in other countries around the world. Huawei: What does the ban mean for you?

How to make your own face covering,"People across the country have to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. It is compulsory to wear one on public transport and in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, covering the nose and mouth, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown thatthe best materials to use,externalare tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands thoroughly or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth Avoid touching the mask, your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times Try not to keeping taking it off and putting it back on again, eg when going in and out of shops Store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them Wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent VIDEO: How to wear a face covering safely Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other guidance, such as social distancing and hand washing. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut-up sports socks. UK government: How to make a face covering,external Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly. When you have your mask, here are a few reminders of whatnotto do.

UK prepares to change course on Huawei,"The UK government is preparing to change course over the role of Huawei in its 5G telecoms network. Six months after agreeing it could have a limited role, ministers look set to exclude the Chinese company, with no new equipment installed from next year. The move is in part a result of pressure from Washington. However, the precise time frame and details of the phase-out will be crucial in determining how the decision is received. In January, after a lengthy delays and hard-fought battles, the government announced that Huawei would be kept out of the sensitive core of the 5G network and limited to 35% market share of its other parts. But now it finds itself revisiting that decision. A key reason is the Trump administration has continued what one UK official calls a campaign of ""unrelenting pressure"" on the company. US officials have claimed China could use the firm as agateway to ""spy, steal or attack"" the UK,external- Huawei denies this and its founder has said he would rathershut the company down than do anything to damage its clients. New sanctions in May,externallimited Huawei's access to US chip technology. That forced the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to launch a review to understand whether using alternative chips would reduce the level of assurance it could offer about Huawei's presence in the UK. But the decision will be as much about geopolitics and domestic politics as it is about technicalities. Replacing Huawei's 5G equipment will often involve simultaneously swapping out its 4G base stations and antennas Attitudes to China have hardened in the last six months. The Coronavirus crisis - and Beijing's handling of it - have increased concerns about dependencies on China. And the growing tension over Hong Kong has heightened concerns about whether China is becoming more authoritarian. Asignificant Conservative backbench rebellionin March suggested there were already many wanting a tougher policy, and their confidence and numbers have been fuelled by events in the intervening months. But amid heavy lobbying from telecoms companies, which have warned of mobile coverage blackouts if they are forced to remove Huawei equipment fast, the government has been debating how quickly to move. A long lead time for Huawei kit to be removed of seven to 10 years would leave critics unhappy but cause less disruption. Three to five years would placate them, but impose many more costs because of the need to rip out existing Huawei equipment, which is sometimes integrated with 4G and older equipment. BT: Impossible to ditch Huawei in under 10 years Could Huawei be out of the UK by 2024? Why the UK might hang up on Huawei If the telecom networks fall behind with their 5G rollout as a result, it would make it harder for the government to deliver on its promises of increasing connectivity for the country in the coming years. China may also seek some way of punishing the UK, partly to discourage others from following its course. But equally, if the new policy is seen as not tough enough, then critics on the backbenches may continue their rebellion to push for a tighter time-frame when legislation is brought to parliament in the autumn. Whatever the case, a decision which has already been overturned once may still be fought over in the months ahead.

'No DSS' letting bans 'ruled unlawful' by court,"A judge has ruled that blanket bans on renting properties to people on housing benefit are unlawful and discriminatory. The ""momentous"" court ruling found a single mother-of-two had experienced indirect discrimination when a letting agent refused to rent to her. She ended up homeless with her two children, when her case was taken on by housing charity Shelter. The judge ruled ""No DSS"" rental bans are against equality laws. Previously, cases backed by Shelter - and first reported by BBC News - have established that ""No DSS"" landlords and agents are guilty of indirect discrimination, but the cases were settled before any court heard them in full. In February 2018, single mother Rosie Keogh won compensation for sex discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant because she was on state benefit, but the case was settled out of court. Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law Legal victories over 'No DSS' letting agents Zoopla bans housing benefit discrimination District Judge Victoria Mark heard this latest case in York County Court on 1 July, and ruled: ""Rejecting tenancy applications because the applicant is in receipt of housing benefit was unlawfully discriminating on the grounds of sex and disability"". And this was, therefore, contrary to the Equality Act 2010, she said. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""This momentous ruling should be the nail in the coffin for 'No DSS' discrimination. ""It will help give security and stability to people who unfairly struggle to find a place to live just because they receive housing benefit."" Single mother, Jane (not her real name) had been looking for a new home in October 2018 after being subject to a ""no fault"" eviction by her previous landlord. She said: ""I was shocked and found it very unfair that they wouldn't even give me a chance. ""I had excellent references from both my landlords of the last nine years as I've always paid my rent on time and I had a professional guarantor. ""I could have paid up to six months' rent in advance because my parents lent me the amount. ""When the letting agent wouldn't take me because of a company policy, I felt offended that after all those years when I have prided myself on paying my rent, paying my bills, being a good tenant, it just meant nothing. ""When I realised I was going to be homeless because I couldn't find anywhere, I felt sick to my stomach."" The letting agent in the case cannot be named for legal reasons. The ruling of indirect discrimination is due to the fact that women and those with disabilities are disproportionately more likely to be in receipt of housing benefit, and therefore disproportionately affected by blanket ""No DSS"" bans. The successful case is the latest step in the charity's End DSS Discrimination campaign to stop the practice, which excludes thousands of people from renting homes each year - and the charity hopes the ruling will send a clear message that landlords or agents who continue to refuse to rent to housing benefit claimants risk legal action. It was Rosie's case in 2018 that established the principle of indirect discrimination The legal action was also supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Nationwide Foundation and barrister Tessa Buchanan at Garden Court Chambers. A survey for the charity conducted by YouGov in December 2019 and January 2020 found nearly two-thirds of private landlords either do not, or prefer not to, let to people on housing benefits. Rose Arnall, the Shelter solicitor who has led the charity's legal challenges on the issue, said: ""This is the first time a court has fully considered a case like this. ""It finally clarifies that discriminating against people in need of housing benefits is not just morally wrong, it is against the law. ""This sends a huge signal to letting agents and landlords that they must end these practices and do so immediately."" Responding to the ruling, Chris Norris, policy director at the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""No landlord should discriminate against tenants because they are in receipt of  benefits. ""Every tenant's circumstance is different and so they should be treated on a case by case basis, based on their ability to sustain the tenancy."" But he added that the government could support tenants by ensuring benefits covered rents entirely. Minister for rough sleeping and housing Luke Hall said the government had been working with landlords and letting agents to ensure tenants are treated on an individual basis and that benefits are not a barrier. He added: ""Everyone should have the same opportunity when looking for a home and discriminating against someone simply because they receive benefits has no place in a modern hosing market.""

Face masks 'should be compulsory in shops',"The rules on face masks vary around the UK The Welsh Government needs to ""go further and faster"" on face coverings and make them mandatory in shops, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has said. Mr Price told BBC Radio Wales ""there is no reason for any further delay"" and said they should be freely available. But Wales' chief medical officer said ""very little had changed"" in the science, which pointed to them having little benefit. Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July. They are currently required on public transport in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, while wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Adam Price called for more urgency from the Welsh Government Mr Price called for more urgency from the Welsh Government, adding that the scientific evidence had changed in terms of the ""airborne nature"" of the virus. How to make your own face mask Who should wear a face mask or face covering? Face coverings in England's shops to be compulsory ""I think sometimes, slow can be good - in terms of the slow, cautious approach to easing restrictions, I think the Welsh Government has got it right,"" Mr Price told BBC Radio Wales' Claire Summers programme. ""But slow sometimes can be our enemy - if we need to move with agility, if we need to move fast. ""If the science changes as it has done around face coverings, then we need the Welsh Government to move fast."" Chief medical officer Frank Atherton said the evidence on face masks was ""quite weak"" Also speaking to Claire Summers on Tuesday, Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said the evidence for making face coverings mandatory was ""quite weak"", although there might be a ""small benefit"". Whether they would be introduced, Dr Atherton said ""never say never"" but believed they were inappropriate and social distancing and personal hygiene, like hand-washing, were more important. Asked on Monday why coverings were not mandatory in other public spaces, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""The advice of the Welsh Government is that if places are crowded then face coverings are advisory. Where places are not crowded it is a matter for the individual citizen to make that decision."" Coronavirus is now ""at its lowest ebb"" since the pandemic began, he added, saying the Welsh Government's response had to be ""proportionate"". While Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory for shoppers, businesses may ask people to wear them. Later, he said Wales had taken longer than other governments in the UK to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory because it was ""an intrusion on people's civil liberties"". He told Times Radio: ""It's not straightforward because there are people who cannot wear them - people with breathing difficulties, people who rely on lip reading, children - and you don't do it, I think, without being very certain that it will make a material difference."" The Welsh Conservatives have also been calling for the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops, saying it was a key element of its 10-point plan published last week. BMA Cymru Wales council chairman Dr David Bailey said on Monday: ""We also continue our calls for face coverings to be worn by the public in all areas where they cannot socially distance, not just on public transport, and for the continued practice of good hand hygiene."" Prof Sian Griffiths, co-chairwoman of the SARS expert committee in Hong Kong, said it was ""common sense"" to wear face masks. ""In a way, it's great that the various governments are setting timelines and instituting more mandatory regulations, but at the same time we ourselves could take action and could be wearing face coverings at the current time, because we know they contribute towards cutting the spread of the disease,"" she said. ""Given that up to 30% of cases of coronavirus are asymptomatic but infectious at that time, it just makes common sense to protect other people from possibly passing disease onto them.""

Bailiff fears as councils chase unpaid tax debts,"Penelope Dudley is behind on her council tax payments. Already stressed about losing her job after being furloughed, she's worried things may soon get a whole lot worse. Bailiffs employed to chase late payers will soon have the right to resume visits to homes following an enforced break during the coronavirus lockdown. ""The thought of bailiff charges, the thought of prison, has of course been a source of stress,"" said Penelope. ""But I have to trust that won't happen. Things are slightly getting better, but they're not getting better for everybody and it could easily go downhill again if I was unlucky."" Some 800,000 UK households are behind on council tax, and from 23 August debt collectors can re-start work chasing payment. According to the Local Government Association, Â£700m is owed in council tax since the start of lockdown - a figure that's expected to grow. Emergency legislation was introduced in April banning bailiffs from visiting homes to enforce debts during the Covid-19 restrictions. But next month, Penelope fears debt enforcement agents may come knocking to demand payment. ""I've had some help from charities and my local church, but I'm not sure how it will all be in a few months' time. The thought of bailiffs is stressful. I had a dark moment on the phone when I was speaking to an advisor who said it [a bailiff visit] could be a prospect."" Penelope is on furlough from her job as an usherette at a London theatre. But when the scheme comes to an end, she won't be returning to work, as the theatre can't afford to keep her. She is hoping to pick up acting work on the side to help pay off some debt. The UK's largest debt charity StepChange has told the BBC it wants the government to reconsider lifting the ban. ""Enforcement action like bailiffs can very quickly compound the financial problems of particularly vulnerable households"", said Richard Lane, the organisation's director of external affairs. ""We're worried that in the middle of a global pandemic when households are financially struggling, that's going to make things worse."" Richard Lane says councils should be more flexible The charity wants to see councils assess personal finances before sending in debt collectors. ""If they're financially vulnerable, sending in bailiffs is probably not going to be the right thing to do to the get back on their feet. We also want the government to give councils more flexibility about how they enforce council tax arrears collections. There are more compassionate approaches that can work."" Energy firms permitted to chase unpaid bills again Debt letters 'make money problems worse' 'Poorer households see debts rise' during lockdown Paul, who asked that his surname wasn't used, was a bartender in a Manchester nightclub until lockdown closed the venue. Concerned about being able to pay for living expenses, he applied for universal credit. But because he had to wait six weeks for the first payment to come through, he's behind on his regular household bills. ""I'm behind on my council tax and rent. It's been helpful that bailiff charges have not been added on and that I don't have to worry about them knocking on my door. But I know it's only temporary,"" he said. ""The wait for furlough and universal credit was too long. If those payments had come sooner, I wouldn't be in the situation I'm in now. It would be great if the government could pay some of the relief directly to the landlords and councils, so that I can have more money to pay off this debt I've accumulated. ""I start teacher training later this year and that will involve moving home. At the moment I don't have the cash for a deposit, let alone rent. I don't know what to do,"" Paul said. The government has said it expects councils to be sympathetic to those in genuine hardship and this should be taken into consideration before enforcement action is put in place. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, said: ""Many councils have put in place alternative payment arrangements to help people who are struggling to pay, for example by deferring payments to later in the year. Our Â£500m hardship fund builds on local support schemes by further reducing the council tax bills of some of the most vulnerable households by up to Â£150."" For the likes of Penelope and Paul, however, this does not ease the stress. All they can do is hope they don't receive a knock on the door and they are able to repay what they owe. ""I have relied on prayer a lot,"" says Penelope. ""I just have to trust that I'm going to be okay.""

Downing Street said there was growing evidence that face coverings helped to protect people from Covid-19 in enclosed spaces. Scientists warn the UK could see around 120,000 new coronavirus deaths in a second wave of infections this winter. Updates on Tuesday 14 July Rob England and Jay Vydelingum Rob EnglandBBC News Our live page has finished for today, but we'll be back tomorrow from 09:00 with all the latest coronavirus news and updates. Until then, stay safe. Deaths of cleaners who worked at the Ministry of Justice during the Covid-19 pandemic must be examined as part of an independent investigation, Labour has said. Speaking in the House of Commons, shadow justice secretary David Lammy said leaked emails, interviews and messages show cleaners were ""forced"" into the department during the lockdown period and ""denied"" personal protective equipment (PPE). Seven outsourced staff have had ""consistent symptoms"" for coronavirus and two are now dead, Mr Lammy told MPs. Justice minister Lucy Frazer said the matters have been ""looked at"" but she would be happy to consider any further points. The Ministry of Justice later said it was complying with official guidance and there was ""no evidence"" to suggest there had ever been a coronavirus outbreak at its premises. This video can not be played Hancock: Labour âpolitical footballâ on face masks The health secretary said he would take opposition criticism over mandatory face masks in English shops âwith a pinch of saltâ. Matt Hancock said his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth, used to offer âconstructive engagementâ but was now turning coronavirus policy in to a âparty political footballâ. Mr Hancock then set out how lockdown measures in Leicester might be changed. Local lockdowns are in force on a Herefordshire farm and in Leicester, but how do they work? A trial of prebooked A&E appointmentshas seen more than 200 patients use the systemin its first week. The pilot at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth sees NHS 111 call handlers book time slots for patients who have been advised to go to A&E but are not in a medical emergency. The trial is aimed at cutting both wait times and the risk of coronavirus spreading in hospital waiting rooms. The hospital's chief executive called it a ""really exciting development."" Rob EnglandBBC News Keith Horton, from Newcastle, has chronic asthma which hampers his breathing, so cannot wear a mask. He saysnew rules making people wear face coverings in shopswould be ""stressful"" for him, and fears being penalised by shopkeepers and other patrons for not wearing one. ""My nose runs constantly and I can't breathe when I put [a mask] on, I get into a panic. I don't want people to approach me asking why I'm not wearing one, all I want to do is do a bit of shopping without being hassled,"" the 68-year-old said. Mr Horton urged people to ""think"" before challenging someone for not wearing a face covering, as ""you can't see asthma"" and many other underlying health conditions. ""People should understand that if they see someone without
a facemask on it might be because like me they cant wear one."" The governmenthas released guidance,externalon groups who do not need to wear a mask in shops or on public transport. People in Leicester will learn whether local lockdown measures will be eased on Thursday, the health secretary has said. Speaking in the House of Commons, Matt Hancock said the government would base its decision on ""14 days of data"" on coronavirus cases. Non-essential shops and schools in the city were shut as a result of a spike in positive cases. The lockdown was due to be reviewed by Saturday. The government has decided that wearing face coverings in shops in England will be compulsory from 24 July. This video can not be played Ashworth: âMinisterial muddle' on coronavirus face masks Labour's shadow health secretary said âit did not have to be this wayâ over government advice on wearing face coverings in shops in England. Jonathan Ashworth asked Health Secretary Matt Hancock why it had taken two months to decide on making them mandatory, and why this would not be enforced for a further 11 days. âAll we need and want is clarity,â he told MPs. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check New rules making face coverings compulsory inside shops in
England have led to lots of heated discussion on social media. People have been
encouraging others to wear a face mask, but thereâs also opposition to the new
rules and #NoMasks and #muzzles have been trending on Twitter in the UK. Weâve looked at misleading claims that masks might actually
be dangerous to the wearer. Memes shared on social media claim that masks
might deprive you of oxygen or lead to the body taking in too much carbon
dioxide. But thereâs no evidence this will happen. The recommended type of mask worn properly wonât do
you any harm. The World Health Organization says ""the prolonged use of
medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen
deficiency. Graffitidaubed by beachgoerson cliffs at Durdle Door beach in Dorset has been removed. Lulworth Estate, which owns the beach on the Jurassic Coast, said a ""vast and unacceptable amount of graffiti"" had recently appeared on the cliffs. The Unesco World Heritage site has seen an influx of visitors since lockdown restrictions were eased across England. Rangers from the estate and volunteers from Dorset Climbing have removed the messages and signatures. Rob EnglandBBC News More awareness is needed of people who are exempt from wearing face coverings in Englandas new measures in shops are announced, charities have warned. People with severe respiratory conditions are one of the groups not required to wear masks - as this can make them feel unwell. Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy at Asthma UK and the British Lung
Foundation, said: ""As face coverings become mandatory in shops in England, we urge the
public to think twice before they judge someone for not wearing a face mask. She added: ""Not all health conditions are visible and people with lung conditions have already
told us that theyâve been publicly confronted by strangers about not wearing
one, leaving them feeling anxious and humiliated."" The governmenthas released some guidance,externalon groups who are currently exempt on public transport, including those who have ""a physical or mental illness or impairment, or a disability"" meaning they cannot do so. A pub has been shut for a ""deep clean""after a customer tested positive for coronavirus. The Crown & Anchor in Aveley, Essex, said a man had been taken to hospital on 12 July after previously visiting the establishment. It said on itsFacebook page,externalthat all ""necessary measures took place"", that the ""situation was out of our control"" and it would be shut for 72 hours. Pubs in England were allowed toreopen to customers on 4 July. Tighter lockdown restrictions could be introduced in Blackburn following a spike in coronavirus cases. People in the town will be asked to limit visitors from another household to two,compared with looser rules elsewhere. The area's public health director said stronger measures would be imposed in two weeks if the number of cases did not fall. Mass testing began at the weekend after 61 new cases sprang up within a week. The burden ofenforcing new rules on wearing facemasksshould not fall on shop staff, retailers have said. JD Sports chief executive, Peter Cowgill, said: ""The guidance so far is that our store colleagues are not really to get involved and it's a police matter to enforce rather than for them to get involved in any potential public disturbances."" Mr Cowgill urged the public to ""play their part and to abide by these restrictions"" but also criticised the government for ""inconsistencies and indecisiveness"" over the new rules. Environment Secretary George Eustice said both retailers and shoppers have responsibilities to uphold the new measures before the police will be asked to step in. ""Of course retailers have been very responsible in the way they're approaching this challenge, they will have a role to play in making sure there's compliance,"" he said. ""But when it comes to that final sanction of issuing a penalty, that is something that only the police can do."" A bed factory has seen eight workers test positive for coronavirus - the third in a series of outbreaks at similar sites in West Yorkshire. Highgrove Beds in Liversedge ceased production as a safety precaution with all staff being offered tests. The outbreak follows cases at Deep Sleep Beds in Ossett and Dura Beds in Batley over the past month. There have also been cases of coronavirus reported at two meat factories in West Yorkshire. The government has saidnew rules that people must wear face coveringswill apply to ""all shops"" but not some other establishments. Pubs and restaurants are excluded due to people needing to be able to eat. Shop staff would also not be forced to wear coverings, as the government says it ""won't be right for every setting in retail"" for example, staff behind tills. The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if people pay within 14 days. The changes are due to come into effect in England on 24 July. The owners of a village pub which was virtually empty on its first Friday night after lockdown have pleaded for customers to return. Julie and Stephen Penney filmed a quiet bar and restaurant at The Swan in Monks Eleigh, Suffolk, which would normally be busy at the start of the weekend. Mrs Penney said: ""We need people to realise that we need them back because next year is a long way away when you've got no trade."" The government said it would help the hospitality industry by reducing VAT from 20% to 5% for six months and by offering diners a discount of up to Â£10 per head at eligible restaurants, Monday to Wednesday. This video can not be played Conservative Party members have been cutting up their membership cards in protest at Boris Johnson's move to make face masks mandatory in shops in England. The hashtag #NoMasks and #Muzzles were both trending on Twitter this morning, while several people posted pictures of chopped-up cards or cancelled registrations. Dominey Jenner and her cut-up card Many said the order -which will come into effect from 24 July and carries a maximum fine of Â£100 for non-compliance- is incompatible with the party's libertarian values. Dominey Jenner, 42, from Wimbledon, south-west London, told the PA news agency that the face mask rules are the ""final straw"". ""I think people should be trusted, I think we should be given a choice. I'm really angry at how the government has invoked fear in its population to control people - I think that is the wrong way to manage a population and to govern."" Jay VydelingumBBC News Online James in Bedford has contacted us to say his partner who has hearing difficulties is extremely anxious about wearing a mask. ""My partner is terrified.  She has hearing difficulties and making masks mandatory will isolate her as she relies on lip reading to support her hearing.

""My partner is not classified as deaf and rejects the label of being disabled even though this could be applied to her. ""I've even looked into the masks that are transparent at the front so that we can communicate via lip reading when we are together.

'No DSS' letting bans 'ruled unlawful' by courtA court rules that refusing to rent to a person because they are on housing benefit is unlawful.,"A judge has ruled that blanket bans on renting properties to people on housing benefit are unlawful and discriminatory. The ""momentous"" court ruling found a single mother-of-two had experienced indirect discrimination when a letting agent refused to rent to her. She ended up homeless with her two children, when her case was taken on by housing charity Shelter. The judge ruled ""No DSS"" rental bans are against equality laws. Previously, cases backed by Shelter - and first reported by BBC News - have established that ""No DSS"" landlords and agents are guilty of indirect discrimination, but the cases were settled before any court heard them in full. In February 2018, single mother Rosie Keogh won compensation for sex discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant because she was on state benefit, but the case was settled out of court. Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law Legal victories over 'No DSS' letting agents Zoopla bans housing benefit discrimination District Judge Victoria Mark heard this latest case in York County Court on 1 July, and ruled: ""Rejecting tenancy applications because the applicant is in receipt of housing benefit was unlawfully discriminating on the grounds of sex and disability"". And this was, therefore, contrary to the Equality Act 2010, she said. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""This momentous ruling should be the nail in the coffin for 'No DSS' discrimination. ""It will help give security and stability to people who unfairly struggle to find a place to live just because they receive housing benefit."" Single mother, Jane (not her real name) had been looking for a new home in October 2018 after being subject to a ""no fault"" eviction by her previous landlord. She said: ""I was shocked and found it very unfair that they wouldn't even give me a chance. ""I had excellent references from both my landlords of the last nine years as I've always paid my rent on time and I had a professional guarantor. ""I could have paid up to six months' rent in advance because my parents lent me the amount. ""When the letting agent wouldn't take me because of a company policy, I felt offended that after all those years when I have prided myself on paying my rent, paying my bills, being a good tenant, it just meant nothing. ""When I realised I was going to be homeless because I couldn't find anywhere, I felt sick to my stomach."" The letting agent in the case cannot be named for legal reasons. The ruling of indirect discrimination is due to the fact that women and those with disabilities are disproportionately more likely to be in receipt of housing benefit, and therefore disproportionately affected by blanket ""No DSS"" bans. The successful case is the latest step in the charity's End DSS Discrimination campaign to stop the practice, which excludes thousands of people from renting homes each year - and the charity hopes the ruling will send a clear message that landlords or agents who continue to refuse to rent to housing benefit claimants risk legal action. It was Rosie's case in 2018 that established the principle of indirect discrimination The legal action was also supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Nationwide Foundation and barrister Tessa Buchanan at Garden Court Chambers. A survey for the charity conducted by YouGov in December 2019 and January 2020 found nearly two-thirds of private landlords either do not, or prefer not to, let to people on housing benefits. Rose Arnall, the Shelter solicitor who has led the charity's legal challenges on the issue, said: ""This is the first time a court has fully considered a case like this. ""It finally clarifies that discriminating against people in need of housing benefits is not just morally wrong, it is against the law. ""This sends a huge signal to letting agents and landlords that they must end these practices and do so immediately."" Responding to the ruling, Chris Norris, policy director at the National Residential Landlords Association, said: ""No landlord should discriminate against tenants because they are in receipt of  benefits. ""Every tenant's circumstance is different and so they should be treated on a case by case basis, based on their ability to sustain the tenancy."" But he added that the government could support tenants by ensuring benefits covered rents entirely. Minister for rough sleeping and housing Luke Hall said the government had been working with landlords and letting agents to ensure tenants are treated on an individual basis and that benefits are not a barrier. He added: ""Everyone should have the same opportunity when looking for a home and discriminating against someone simply because they receive benefits has no place in a modern hosing market.""

Natural solutions boosted to help prevent floods,"Last winter saw extensive flooding across the country A new approach to combating floods in England, backing natural solutions with government cash, has been unveiled. It includes funding for schemes such as creating sustainable drainage systems - and building hollows in the ground to catch flood water in heavy rain, before storing it to tackle summer droughts. Insurers have also been asked to pay to improve flood-hit homes so they are more resilient. The policy allowing building on plains liable to flood will be reviewed. And Â£200 million of the floods budget will be earmarked for measures including natural flood prevention to capture water on farmers' fields during heavy rainfall. Towns and villages flooded after further rain Flood-hit areas set for '10 difficult days' Critics say the schemes do not go far enough at a time of climate change. Flooding was forced up the priority list after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was accused by flood victims of failing to take their plight seriously. The government says the measures in the new plan are the most comprehensive in a decade, including the Â£5.2bn for flooding announced in the Budget four months ago. It says the cash will help protect a third of a million properties in England up to 2027. There will be money for innovative projects such as sustainable drainage systems to provide porous surfacesin new developments to prevent water run-off. And cash will be provided to createhollows in the ground to catch flood waters in heavy rain. These hollows in 25 test areas will benefit wildlife and provide water storage to tackle droughts in the summer. It is likely that incentives for farmers to capture water on their land will be included in the governmentâs coming reform of farm subsidies. A previous study for the Environment Agency suggested that these hollows and other nature-friendly solutions such as planting woodlands in river catchments would help with minor flooding events, but would be overwhelmed by major floods. Guy Shrubsole from Friends of the Earth told BBC News: âItâs great that nature-based solutions are being adopted, but the government needs to move beyond trialling and testing â itâs clear that they work. âWhatâs needed is hundreds of small interventions in river catchment areas â but thatâs not so interesting to a government that likes to unveil concrete-pouring on a large scale.â He welcomed the inquiry into flood plain construction, and said developers must be stopped fromallowing new properties to increase flood risk for others. But Professor Hannah Cloke, from the University of Reading, said: ""A commitment to review policies on developments on flood plains does not sound in tune with cutting red tape to build houses more quickly. ""A fortnight ago, Boris was attacking 'newt counting', and bemoaning the pace of progress in the UK. ""Dealing with flooding shows precisely the difficulties behind his promise to build better, faster and greener. ""Sometimes being better and greener requires building more slowly and carefully, or we risk long-term economic and social costs that we cannot afford."" The new measures follow last winterâs widespread flood misery when the insurers Flood Re incurred claims of Â£160m â thatâs 10 times higher than the previous year. After three relatively dry years, the UK saw thousands of homes flooded in northern and central England, as well as in South Wales and the Scottish Borders. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: âThe devastating impacts of last winterâs flooding were an important reminder of the need to continue to invest and accelerate action to reduce the impact of flooding. âBut we also recognise that we cannot prevent flooding entirely, which is why we will ensure that communities at high risk are more resilient.â This will be partly achieved by a change in support to householders from Flood Re, which offers cut-price insurance to people in flood-risk areas, subsidised by a levy on all insurance bills. Previously, the scheme would only pay to restore a flood-hit house to its pre-flood state. Under the new rules agreed by the government, flood victims will in future get insurance money to restore their homes to resist future flood damage by, for example, moving electric points higher up a wall. Itâs called âbuilding back betterâ. Discounted premiums also will come for households that have fitted property flood resilience measures, such as airbrick covers or non-return valves. Heather Shepherd from the National Flood Forum, which campaigns on behalf of families at risk of flooding, said: âObviously we welcome provision for building back better â weâve got to learn to live with floods.â But she called on the government to expand its investment criteria for flood defences so that sparsely-populated rural areas could also benefit. A related Environment Agency strategy says 62,000 more families will be added to the flood risk alert service, in which residents receive an electronic warning if their home is likely to be flooded. It means that, by the end of 2022, all of England's at-risk households will receive alerts. The agency said it must plan for more extreme weather, including summer temperatures up to 7.4C hotter and 59% more rainfall by 2050. Its chair, Emma Howard Boyd, said: ""This year we had major flooding and the sunniest spring on record in rapid succession. We know climate change is going to bounce us between these extremes more and more in the coming years."" She said the agency would embrace nature-based solutions: ""The clean, green recovery of the economy from coronavirus must have nature at its heart. This is a blueprint for using the natural world to build back better so that homes, businesses and infrastructure are more resilient.""

UK economy shrinks by one-fifth under lockdown,"The UK's economy rebounded more slowly than expected in May, growing just 1.8% from the previous month, as the gradual easing of lockdown had a modest impact. Manufacturing and house building showed signs of recovery in May as some firms saw staff return to work. But the Office for National Statistics said the economy was ""in the doldrums"". As a result of big contractions in previous months, the UK economy is now 24.5% smaller than it was in February, the ONS added. The return to economic growth in May was described as ""disappointing"" by economists, who had expected an expansion of 5% or more. UK 'faces tax rises or spending cuts' What is a recession? The increase came after a fall of 6.9% in March and a record 20.4% decline in April. In the three months to May, the economy shrank by 19.1% compared with the previous three-month period, the ONS said. ""The economy was still a quarter smaller in May than in February, before the full effects of the pandemic struck,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. ""In the important services sector, we saw some pick-up in retail, which saw record online sales. However, with lockdown restrictions remaining in place, many other services remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines."" Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that there could be signs of improvement in next month's release of figures. ""Some of the survey data we're seeing suggests that as more of the economy reopened and as some of the restrictions were eased, we did see stronger performance in June, but it's really early,"" he said. ""You've got one month of firm data and some indicators suggesting June might be stronger, but there's a long road to go here and we're still trying to figure out what the best data is to understand the overall picture."" This video can not be played 'We need a date to restart so we can save our staff' May's modest month-on-month expansion came as sectors such as manufacturing, construction, DIY retailers and garden centres were allowed to reopen. Manufacturing grew by more than 8% during the month, as did construction. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. It's been used since the 1940s. It's the main way of determining the health of the UK economy. What is GDP and why does it matter? ""Today's figures underline the scale of the challenge we face,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The 'whatever it takes' chancellor ""I know people are worried about the security of their jobs and incomes. That's why I set out our Plan for Jobs last week, following the PM's new deal for Britain, to protect, support and create jobs as we safely reopen our economy. ""Our clear plan invests up to Â£30bn in significant and targeted support to put people's livelihoods at the centre of our national renewal as we emerge through the other side of this crisis."" A quarter of the economy's output was lost under lockdown in March and April, and May's figures show even firms who are back in business may be struggling to get on track. It's one thing being allowed to open the doors again (and some firms remain mothballed); another to be confident you can do so safely. And then there's the biggest hurdle of all, ensuring customers are willing and able to spend again. As job losses mount, it clear that even some firms who qualify for government help are faltering. Some won't have made it as far. The Bank of England's own chief economist is among those who've voiced hopes for a ""V-shaped"" recovery - a swift and full bounce back in activity. But history tells us that economies can take years to make up lost ground after a slump. The blow from this crisis was felt within days, convalescence may be tougher. And in the meantime, the livelihoods of many may feel the strain. The British Chambers of Commerce said May's ""modest rally"" in economic growth did little to alter ""the UK's historically downbeat growth trajectory"". ""The pick-up in output in May is more likely to reflect the partial release of pent-up demand as restrictions began to loosen rather than evidence of a genuine recovery,"" said the BCC's head of economics, Suren Thiru. ""While UK economic output may grow further in the short term as restrictions ease, this may dissipate as the economic scarring caused by the pandemic starts to bite, particularly as government support winds down."" Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data showed the recovery was ""maybe not so V-shaped after all"" - a reference toremarks last month by Bank of England economist Andy Haldane, who said the UK was on track for a quick recovery. He said May's figure was ""a disappointing first step on the road to recovery"" and suggested that ""hopes of a rapid rebound from the lockdown are wide of the mark"". ""Indeed, the path to full economic recovery will probably be much longer than most people anticipate,"" he added. Has your business or job been affected by the economic downturn?

Plaid targets ending poverty for young and oldLeader Adam Price says he would bring in free childcare and a national health and care service.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says he wants to be 'open and honest' with the public Plaid Cymru's leader says his party is currently considering which taxes to raise to pay for some of the policies in their 2021 election manifesto. Adam Price told BBC Wales: ""It's important that we're open and honest with the people of Wales"". Plaid fleshed out plans to end poverty among the oldest and youngest in Wales. ""We certainly will need to raise additional revenue to enable us to do things that we've talked about for so long,"" said Mr Price. The party wants to introduce free childcare and a weekly Â£35 support payment for children, as well as a national health and care service. Mr Price believes it would allow parents to go back to work, create ""up to 3,000"" jobs and boost thousands of incomes. He estimated the cost of the policies to be Â£1bn and said that extra money would need to be raised to pay for it. Income tax has been partially devolved to the Welsh Government and the 2021 Senedd election will be the first where parties can campaign to change rates. While admitting Plaid would need to raise revenue to implement its policies, Mr Price refused to be drawn on whether that would mean a rise in income tax. ""We are thinking carefully about that but we need to look at the range of tax powers that we have,"" he told BBC Wales. ""In the long term we need to have a better balance between taxing income through employment for example, and taxing wealth."" He said that to be truly progressive, the party had to ensure it was also taxing wealth ""in a fair and proportionate way."" The Senedd election - Mr Price's first as leader - is due to happen on 6 May. Plaid Cymru managed to retain the four Westminster seats it won in last year's UK general election and increased its share of the vote in all but one of those seats. Plaid vow to lift children out of poverty Free childcare 'could help close poverty gap' Poverty gap 'major challenge' for schools Overall, however, in an election overshadowed by Brexit, the party's share of the vote across Wales was down 0.5%. Next year Plaid Cymru faces a Senedd election which again risks being overshadowed, this time by the coronavirus pandemic. In the last election to Cardiff Bay in 2016, Plaid Cymru won 12 seats under the previous leader Leanne Wood. Plaid Cymru's proposals include free childcare That number later fell to 10 after another former leader, Lord Elis-Thomas, left to become an independent AM then subsequently a deputy minister in the Labour-led government, before Neil McEvoy was expelled from the party. It meant Plaid Cymru lost its status as the largest opposition party to the Welsh Conservatives. Mr Price, who became leader in 2018, said the party's ""guiding mission"" if it formed the next government would be to make Wales an ""equal nation and a nation of equals"". The proposals include: A Welsh child payment of Â£35 a week for the poorest families Free childcare, which would provide universal access to education and care from 12 months of age A national health and care service, providing health and social care free at the point of access and give health and care workers the same terms, conditions and pay scales While the Welsh Government has had partial income tax varying powers since April 2019, the forthcoming election will be the first in which political parties will be able to make an offer to you that could impact directly on your pay packet. The Welsh Government has some other tax powers too, so how to balance the overall tax package is obviously something Plaid, and no doubt the other parties, are thinking about. The coronavirus pandemic has the potential to change the context too. In recent months the NHS and social care has been the focus of attention, but now concerns about jobs and the economy are starting to take centre stage. Who knows where we'll be in May 2021, but the politicians have to start planning now and gamble on whether you'd rather see a tax cut or pay more for policies they hope will appeal to you. Mr Price says the policies would be paid for by ""prioritising"" the budget, and hinted at tax rises Mr Price said the policies were ""designed to offer opportunity in youth and dignity in old age"". He added: ""After 20 years of a Labour-led government, there are still 200,000 children living in poverty in Wales. ""That is a blight on our communities and something I am determined to change with Â£35 a week child payment targeted at families, many who have to decide between heating the home and feeding the children. ""Plaid Cymru's childcare offer would boost the incomes of thousands of households, allowing non-working parents back into the workplace and creating up to 3,000 new jobs."" ""Similarly, the national care service will make Wales the 'caring nation' - valuing our carers and the cared for with salaries comparable with the NHS and making social care free at the point of delivery. ""I want to lead a government for all generations - a government delivering radical change, not for change's sake but for the sake of the thousands of families whose futures rest on it. ""I want my son to grow up in a country where poverty is a distant memory thanks to a belief that there is no challenge too big to overcome."" Mr Price said the 2021 election was a ""time for change"" of government.

Face coverings to be compulsory in England's shopsThe new rules will apply from 24 July and those failing to comply will face a fine of up to Â£100.UK Politics,"Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government has announced. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would ""give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protections for those who work in shops"". The move will bring England into line with Scotland and other major European nations like Spain, Italy and Germany. Since mid-May, members of the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. Mask-wearing has been compulsory on public transport in England and at NHS facilities across the UK since 15 June. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The list of exemptions has not yet been published, but the rules for face maskson public transport,externalexempt anyone who cannot wear one ""because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability"", who would experience ""severe distress"" from doing so, or relies on lip reading, among other reasons. Mr Hancock told the Commons: ""Sadly, sales assistants, cashiers and security guards have suffered disproportionately in this crisis. ""The death rate of sales and retail assistants is 75% higher amongst men and 60% higher amongst women than in the general population."" He added: ""There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop."" The new rule will not apply to retail staff. It comes asthe UK recorded the deaths of a further 138,externalpeople who had tested positive for coronavirus. Why have attitudes to face masks changed? How to make your own face mask Why do customers have to wear face coverings but not staff? And other questions Tory MP Desmond Swayne described the rule as a ""monstrous imposition"" that would make him less likely to go shopping. Labour said ministers had been ""slow and muddled"" on face coverings and questioned why the new rules would not come into force for 11 days. But Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC that research on the use of face coverings, including advice from the World Health Organization, had been ""evolving"". And he said the delay between the announcement and the rule coming into force on 24 July ""gives people time to prepare"". Wearing face coverings in shops is an ""appropriate mitigation"" against the ""overall risk"" of the coronavirus, but the rule would not work in pubs, cafes or restaurants, he added. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if the fine is paid within 14 days. ""A shop can refuse them entry and can call the police if they refuse to comply,"" Mr Hancock said. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said police should be involved only as a ""last resort"". During lockdown, police in England issued around 16,000 fines for alleged breaches of the restrictions. Enforcing the rules was not always easy, particularly because the regulations were drawn up at the last minute, but forces did at least have enough resources - as crime and emergency calls had fallen sharply. Now, as the country begins to return to normal, demands on police time are growing again. That's one reason why officers don't want the extra burden of dealing with non-compliant shop customers. Another factor is a concern is that it may draw police into confrontations with the public at a time when the service is already under the spotlight for its use of tactics, such as stop-and-search. However, the way the face-covering rules are likely to be drafted means it will be the police, not shop staff, who will be called upon if people refuse to abide by the measures. Ken Marsh of the Metropolitan Police Federation suggested enforcing the new rule could strain the relationship between police officers and the general public. And John Apter of the Police Federation said it should be down to shops to make wearing a face covering a ""condition of entry"". In Scotland, the use of coveringsin shops has been mandatory since 10 July. Few fines have been issued and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggestedcompliance had been ""extremely high"". Shoppersin WalesandNorthern Irelandare not currently required to wear them, although both nations have said this will be kept under review. Peter Barnes says wearing coverings in shops to stop the spread can only be a good thing Antiques shop owner Mary Foster from Weybridge, Surrey, tells the BBC she fears mandatory face coverings in stores could increase shoplifting. ""I think people will feel more empowered to try to steal things,"" she says. For some BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, face coverings are uncomfortable, steam up your glasses, and infringe on personal freedom. Andy, from Manchester, says the discomfort means he's less likely to go to the shops and now worries shopping must carry a higher risk than he thought. Pamela, who runs a clothes shop in East Kilbride, says most of her customers have been happy to wear one - only one refused because they didn't like it. But Peter Barnes, a London-based political consultant who contracted Covid-19 in March, tells BBC Business the discomfort of a covering is worth it to save lives. ""If we can save one life, then wearing a mask in the supermarket for an hour or so has got to be entirely worth it,"" he says. Read morehere. Do you work in a shop?

Boris Johnson signalled a shift in the government's position on Friday when he spoke of the need for a stricter approach in confined setting. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove downplayed the suggestion of any immediate legal change on Sunday. Labour said the mixed messages demonstrated the government's indecision during the pandemic, and ministers had to explain the ""further delay"".

Boris Johnson has been seen wearing a cloth face covering in recent days A No 10 spokesman said: ""There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from coronavirus.

"White House targets US disease chief FauciA memo leaked over the weekend said several officials were ""concerned"" by Dr Fauci's past comments.","US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci is being targeted by the Trump administration as tensions rise between the health expert and the president. The White House has been increasingly critical of Dr Fauci, and on Sunday, an official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments. Dr Fauci's changing advice on masks and remarks on Covid-19's severity are among the points from the White House. The move to undercut him comes as the US continues to see surges in Covid-19. There are over 3.3 million cases confirmed and more than 135,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. Dr Fauci has contradicted President Donald Trump's comments on the pandemic a number of times, pushing back on the president's claims that the outbreak is improving and attributing hasty state reopenings to the recent surges. Living in Florida and Texas as virus cases surge Why we should all be wearing masks The White House memo leaked over the weekend had noted ""several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr Fauci has been wrong on things"". Though the White House said Dr Fauci and Mr Trump have a ""good working relationship"" on Monday, Trump adviser Peter Navarro told CBS News:  ""When you ask me if I listen to Dr Fauci's advice, my answer is only with caution."" During a law enforcement event at the White House on Monday, Mr Trump said: ""I have a very good relationship with Dr Fauci. I've had for a long time - right from the beginning. ""I find him to be a very nice person. I don't always agree with him."" The president added: ""I get along with him very well. I like him personally."" Mr Trump earlier on Monday retweeted comments from a game show host accusing ""everyone"", including the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), of lying about the coronavirus. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later told reporters Mr Trump still had confidence in the CDC and the tweet was meant to express his displeasure with ""some rogue individuals"" who leaked planning documents. Echoing the contents of the anti-Fauci memo earlier, Mr Navarro, an economic adviser to Mr Trump, said Dr Fauci ""has been wrong about everything I have ever interacted with him on"". ""When I warned in late January in a memo of a possibly deadly pandemic, Fauci was telling the media not to worry,"" he said. Mr Navarro said Dr Fauci fought against Mr Trump's ""courageous decision"" to halt flights from China, initially said the virus was ""low-risk"" and ""flip-flopped on the use of masks"". ""Now Fauci is saying that a falling mortality rate doesn't matter when it is the single most important statistic to help guide the pace of our economic reopening."" This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant US health secretary and member of the virus task force, told NBC News on Sunday that while he respects Dr Fauci, he is not always right. ""Dr Fauci is not 100% right and he also doesn't necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view."" The face of America's fight against Covid-19 As cases and deaths continue to rise in a number of states, Mr Trump has been accused by critics of politicising health issues, including wearing masks. Mr Trump has also clashed with the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing the body of mismanaging the pandemic when it began and failing to make ""greatly needed reforms"". On 7 July, he formally began to pull the US out of the WHO and said funding would be redirected. Donald Trump has often railed against newspapers that publish anonymous quotes from administration aides critical of the president. Over the weekend, however, the White House was using its own unnamed ""officials"" in a remarkable attack on a member of its coronavirus task force, top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci. The White House even provided a list of Fauci's old statements about the virus similar to the kind of memo a campaign might use to direct negative attention on a political opponent. The administration, it appears, is trying to paint Fauci as wrong about the early threat of the virus and, consequently, untrustworthy when he questions the administration's analysis of the current situation and its planned actions. As if that wasn't enough, on Monday morning the president retweeted a post by former game show host Chuck Woolery, accusing the Centers for Disease Control, among others, of lying about the virus in an effort to undermine the Trump's re-election prospects. An administration at war with its own scientific and medical experts in the middle of a pandemic that is once again on the upswing makes developing a cohesive strategy - one that the public trusts and will follow - challenging, to say the least. More from Anthony: Things US has got wrong - and got right Dr Fauci has not weighed in on the White House memo, but he has remarked on his recent lack of television appearances. ""I have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things,""he told the Financial Times,externalon 10 July. ""And that may be one of the reasons why I haven't been on television very much lately."" Dr Fauci also said he has not seen Mr Trump in person since 2 June and has not briefed him for the last two months. The infectious disease chief has instead been appearing on livestreams and podcasts. On 9 July, he told FiveThirtyEight: ""As a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don't think you can say we're doing great. I mean, we're just not."" The chaplains on the coronavirus frontlines What is the true death toll of the coronavirus pandemic? Dr Fauci participated in a livestream with Stanford University Medical School on Monday afternoon, but did not directly address the White House comments. ANew York Times/Siena College poll,externalat the end of June found 67% of US voters trusted Dr Fauci regarding the pandemic, with just 26% expressing trust in Mr Trump. This video can not be played Protest, rally or eating out - Where is riskier? In February, Dr Fauci did not advise Americans to change their behaviour due to the pandemic, but he did note the situation was evolving. During an interview with the Today morning programme on 29 February, Dr Fauci said: ""Although the risk is low now, you don't need to change anything you're doing, when you start to see community spread, this could change."" At the time, there were fewer than 100 cases in the US. In early March, Dr Fauci and other health officials did advise against having the public wear masks. He did, at the time, note that infected individuals should wear one to prevent spreading the disease. Dr Fauci has defended his earlier comments on masks, citing new research and saying it was due to concerns over scarcity at the time for healthcare providers. He has since strongly recommended wearing face coverings in public. A career official, Dr Fauci has advised six presidents - Republican and Democratic - on health issues, including the HIV/AIDs epidemic. He has been the director of the National Institutes of Health Allergy and Infectious Diseases division since 1984. What is the true death toll of the coronavirus pandemic?

Fears Covid could fuel youth violence riseCross party group of MPs say the economic impact of the pandemic could drive young people to crime.,"This video can not be played Kevin works for the Violent Offender Watch (VOW) team in Edinburgh The social and economic devastation caused by Covid-19 could lead to an increase in serious youth violence in the UK, MPs have warned. AYouth Violence Commission report,externalsays incidents of unemployment, homelessness and trauma sparked by pandemic could impact on vulnerable young people. It fears 18 Violence Reduction Units in England and Wales could lose funding. The Home Office says Â£70m is being spent on the units modelled on a scheme which helped cut crime in Scotland. BBC Panorama has been investigating how Scotland's VRU - launched in 2005 and the first in the UK  - has succeeded in reducing crime. Karyn McCluskey, the former head of intelligence for Strathclyde Police and one of the founders of the unit, tells the programme they approached youth violence as a health issue, ""like a disease"". How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime 'Poverty link' to youth violence - London mayor 'Weakened' lockdown has 'woken dormant criminals' According to the cross-party Youth Violence Commission, long-term investment is needed in youth services and VRUs but the funding is at risk because of the ""economic devastation"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Itsreport,externalcomes after three years of research into the causes of violence in the UK which concludes that poverty and inequality are ""fundamental drivers"". ""Given the potential for the impact of Covid-19 to create the types of social conditions in which one might reasonably expect to see increased rates of serious violence, it is imperative that support for these units is not only maintained, but increased,"" the report says. ""If support and investment is withdrawn from these VRUs - a particular concern given the possibility of austerity measures that may be taken on the back of the economic impact of Covid-19 - the commission fears this would undo much of the hugely important work that has taken place."" The commission says serious youth violence across England and Wales has cost the economy Â£11bn since 2008 - based on costs to the police, criminal justice system, NHS, victim services, as well as costs from lost economic output and costs associated with physical and emotional harm. According to its report, the cost of running 18 regional VRUs for 10 years is Â£350m. Talking about the type of young offenders helped by Scotland's VRU, Karyn McCluskey says: ""You're brought up in an angry, aggressive home, so you almost become infectedâ¦ So we started to look at it like, what would prevention look like?"" This public health approach aimed to treat offenders with compassion and offering them more support, in the hope that they could bring down levels of violence. In 2005, there were 39 homicides in Glasgow alone. The police cracked down on Glasgow's gangs, with increased stop and search and tougher sentences, but also decided to look at the causes as well.  Over the next 14 years, homicides in Glasgow fell from 39 to 11 in one year. However, in recent years there has been a small increase in violence after a decade of steep falls. Kevin Neary works with the Violent Offenders Watch, a Police Scotland initiative to partner police officers and former convicts in order to reach out to young offenders. As a former armed robber and heroin addict himself, Mr Neary helps offenders keep out of prison. He says most young offenders had experienced childhood trauma such as separation or loss of parents through bereavement. ""What we're doing is not a soft justice; it's not a soft approach, it's a caring and compassionate approach."" By Kate Silverton, presenter of Panorama's How Scotland Cut Violent Crime The founders of the VRU believe that in order to tackle the root causes of violent crime, it needed to not just be a criminal justice issue but something much broader and tackled collaboratively across education, health and prisons. During my filming for the Panorama documentary, it became clear to me that this ""joined-up"" approach is essential to its effectiveness. The people I met believe that we need to understand that children will be much more likely to ""act out"" the violence they themselves experienced or observed and that they need access to counselling, education and training.
