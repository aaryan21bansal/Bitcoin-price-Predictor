No changes to tax rates in Scottish budget,"Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes stepped in to deliver the budget There will be no changes to income tax rates in Scotland in the coming year, the government has announced. Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes set out the budget in the place of Derek Mackay, whoresigned as finance secretary on Thursday morning. She announced that tax rates will not increase, although the threshold where the upper rates kick in will be frozen. And she committed extra funding to health, education and investment aimed at tackling the ""climate emergency"". The SNP need votes from opposition parties to pass the budget, and Ms Forbes urged them not to be ""partisan"". Scots finance secretary quits over messages to boy Live coverage of the budget and Derek Mackay's resignation The build-up to the budget was disrupted when Mr Mackay was forced to quit the government overreports he had sent hundreds of social media messages to a 16-year-old boy,external. Junior minister Ms Forbes - a first-term MSP who is aged just 29 - stepped in at the last minute to deliver the speech, and is set to take the lead in talks with opposition parties. She said the package included ""significant investment in our response to the global climate emergency, to strengthen our economy and improve our public services"". Draft Income Tax plan 19%Starter rate 20%Basic rate 21%Intermediate rate 41%Higher rate 46%Top rate Under the plans, Scotland's current tax rates will not increase, and the threshold at which people start paying the basic and intermediate rates will increase by the rate of inflation. The thresholds for the higher and upper rates will be frozen, with Ms Forbes calling this the ""fairest and most progressive income tax system in the UK"". Funding proposals in the budget include: more than Â£15bn for health and care services Â£117m of investment in mental health support a real-terms increase in revenue funding for councils Â£180m for closing the attainment gap in schools Â£270m for rail services a 60% boost in funding to reduce harm from alcohol and drugs The budget had a particular focus on environmental issues, with Ms Forbes saying it would ""step up the delivery of our ambition to tackle climate change"". This includes Â£1.8bn of capital investment in projects to reduce emissions, and funding for active travel, electric vehicles, agriculture and peatland restoration. A budget bill will now be introduced at parliament, and is due to be voted on by MSPs in three weeks' time - which is how long Ms Forbes now has to secure a deal. New forecasts from theScottish Fiscal Commission,externalwere published alongside the budget, warning that ""Brexit remains a risk to continued economic growth"". Ms Forbes stepped in after Derek Mackay tendered his resignation with immediate effect Opposition MSPs praised Ms Forbes for stepping in to deliver the budget, but were critical of some of the content. Murdo Fraser said the Conservatives could not support the budget because it ""falls well short of where we need it to be"". He said freezing the upper rate tax thresholds could widen the gap between what higher earners pay in Scotland and the rest of the UK, and said ""not enough money is being handed to police"". For Labour, Rhoda Grant said essential services were ""worse off"" under the SNP, and that the government was using ""smoke and mirrors"" to obscure this. She said the budget was a ""disappointment"", calling for a ""step change"" in local government funding and extra money to make Scottish education ""world-leading"" again. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the budget was ""timid"" and was not an ""emergency response"" to climate change. And Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said councils ""have only been given half of what they need"", saying the government should focus on services rather than independence.

Coronavirus kills Chinese whistleblower doctor,"Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital A Chinese doctor who tried to issue the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak has died, the hospital treating him has said. Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital. He had sent out a warning to fellow medics on 30 December but police told him to stop ""making false comments"". There had been contradictory reports about his death, but the People's Daily now says he died at 02:58 on Friday (18:58 GMT Thursday). The virus has killed 636 people and infected 31,161 in mainland China, the National Health Commission's latest figures show. The death toll includes 73 new deaths reported on Thursday. Another 41 catch virus on quarantined cruise ship Five need-to-know things about virus China's coronavirus 'brings our hearts together' The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Dr Li, an ophthalmologist, posted his story on Weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning. The 34-year-old had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003. The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan A visual guide to the outbreak On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection. Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter. In the letter he was accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"". He was one of eight people who police said were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"" Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li. In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing, the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 January. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Shanghai's deserted streets and metro, filmed in February A wave of anger and grief flooded Chinese social media site Weibo when news of Dr Li's death broke late on Thursday. The top two trending hashtags on the website were ""Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang and apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"". Both hashtags were quickly censored. When the BBC searched Weibo on Friday morning, hundreds of thousands of comments had already been wiped. Many have now taken to posting under the hashtag ""Can you manage, do you understand?"" - a reference to the letter Dr Li was told to sign where he was accused of disturbing ""social order"". Only a handful of critical comments now remain - many of which do not directly name him - but are an indication of the mounting anger and distrust towards the Chinese government. ""Do not forget how you feel now. Do not forget this anger. We must not let this happen again,"" said one comment on Weibo. ""The truth will always be treated as a rumour. How long are you going to lie? Are you still lying? What else do you have to hide?"" another said. Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing The death of Dr Li Wenliang has been a heart-breaking moment for this country. For the Chinese leadership it is an epic political disaster. It lays bare the worst aspects of China's command and control system of governance under Xi Jinping - and the Communist Party would have to be blind not to see it. If your response to a dangerous health emergency is for the police to harass a doctor trying to blow the whistle, then your structure is obviously broken. The city's mayor - reaching for excuses - said he needed clearance to release critical information which all Chinese people were entitled to receive. Now the spin doctors and censors will try to find a way to convince 1.4 billion people that Dr Li's death is not a clear example of the limits to the party's ability to manage an emergency - when openness can save lives, and restricting it can kill. Chinese people are going to take some convincing. Global Times, People's Daily and other Chinese media reported Dr Li's death earlier on Thursday. Dr Li, was initially declared dead at 21:30 local time and the news triggered a huge wave of popular reaction on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. The People's Daily sent out a tweet saying Dr Li's death had sparked ""national grief"". However, Global Times then said he had been given a treatment known as ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) which keeps a person's heart pumping and keeps their blood oxygenated without it going through their lungs. Global Times said he was in a critical condition. Journalists and doctors at the scene, who do not want their names used, told the BBC and other media that government officials had intervened. Official media outlets had been told to change their reports to say the doctor was still being treated. The media outlets then later reported the new time of Dr Li's death: Allow Twitter content?

Most of those killed by coronavirus have been over the age of 60 or have suffered from other medical conditions, according to China's health authorities. Dr Li's medical history is not known. China is introducing more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak. Beijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays and weddings while cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day. Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside. Its capital, Wuhan, has a lack of beds and equipment, one senior city official said. Despite the rapid construction of two hospitals, the volume of patients is causing severe strain. Reports on social media say the Wuhan government is to carry out door-to-door temperature checks on residents. This video can not be played Evacuating from China to a remote Australian island for quarantine There has been criticism of the crackdowns, with Human Rights Watch saying China was ""treating public health with a sledgehammer"". Meanwhile, Hong Kong has seen panic buying of goods, including toilet rolls, and there have been huge queues for masks. Although the virus has spread overseas, with confirmed infection in some 25 nations, there have so far been only two deaths outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, saying if funds are not allocated now to tackle the outbreak, nations would pay for it later. Coronavirus: What it does to the body Although the official figures in China are of 31,000 infections, some scientists have estimated that the actual rate could be 10 times higher, with the majority of infected people only presenting mild symptoms, not receiving treatment, yet passing on the potentially deadly disease. The UKon Thursday confirmed a third case of the virus. Some 3,700 people on the Diamond Princess cruise vessel moored off Japan face testing and quarantine for at least two weeks. On Friday, Japanese broadcaster NHK said 41 new cases had been detected on board, bringing the total to 61. Another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew is quarantined in Hong Kong with three cases on board. How worried should we be?

Welsh firefighters could perform NHS rolesFire and rescue services could be given a wider role in keeping people safe under new plans.Wales politicsComments,"Firefighters are trained to deal with incidents other than fire, ministers say Wales' fire and rescue services could be given a wider role in keeping people safe under new plans from ministers. The Welsh Government say the services have been so successful in reducing fires that they are now under-occupied. Many rural fire stations respond to a handful of fires a month, threatening their sustainability, ministers say. Firefighters could take on roles currently carried out by the NHS, such as responding to medical emergencies, the government has suggested. It is believed the move would be the first of its kind in the UK. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has been asked to respond. In astatement,external, Hannah Blythyn, the minister responsible for the fire service, said: ""I would like to thank our fire and rescue services in Wales for their continued success in reducing both the incidence and severity of fire. ""I have little doubt that this success is partly due to the great emphasis that the fire service places on preventing fire and improving awareness of fire risks.Â ""Firefighters are highly trained to deal with a wide range of incidents besides fires, and have the expertise and respect to raise awareness of and prevent non-fire threats too."" Hannah Blythyn says firefighters could ""make a real contribution to supporting the NHS"" Ms Blythyn said there was ""clear potential"" for the service to ""make a real contribution to supporting the NHS in particular, whether in terms of responding to medical emergencies or helping to prevent accidents like falls at home; and clear evidence that this can secure better outcomes and significant savings"". Fireman Sam mascot axed for not being inclusive ,externalFirefighters call for protection against cancer Firefighter recruitment 'more and more difficult' ""There are many impressive examples of this happening, but they are often small-scale and piecemeal"", she said. ""I want to see a fire and rescue service which deals with a range of threats to people's health and safety, both in terms of prevention and emergency response, complementing not duplicating the work of other professionals."" The announcement comes as the Welsh NHS facesincreasing pressurethroughout the system, resulting in cancelled operations, long waits for certain types of surgery and patients struggling to get GP appointments. The Welsh Government said there needed to be an agreement on firefighters' pay and conditions to reflect the proposed broader role, although it says negotiations on this have been ""very slow"". Ministers say they have a ""commitment to consider providing financial support to a pay deal that meets the needs of Wales and Welsh firefighters"" and ""there are already constructive discussions on this at a senior management level"". Wales has three fire and rescue services - North Wales, Mid and West Wales, and South Wales. Last year, firefighterstrained as special constablesin Devon and Somerset, to boost police numbers in rural areas, a move opposed by the FBU. The union said independence from the police was ""vital to ensure that communities know firefighters exist to save lives, not to enforce the law"".

Virus: What you need to know,"Myths around the risks of coronavirus in the UK are doing the rounds. We put the facts straight. You might be seeing people wearing them, butthere is limited evidence that they work. That's because they are generally too loose, don't cover the eyes and can't be worn for long periods. Face masks need to be changed frequently (because they get sweaty), if they are to offer any real protection. To protect yourself, the World Health Organization (WHO) says,externalit's more important to: cover your mouth and nose while sneezing, with a tissue or your elbow put the tissue straight into a closed bin wash your hands regularly with soap and water or sanitiser keep your distance from people who are coughing and sneezing (at least one metre) Don't bother: eating garlic gargling mouthwash rinsing your nose with saline using sesame oil under the nose None of these will help protect against the new virus in any way, the WHO adds. Dogs and cats are not spreaders There is no evidence that your pet dog or cat can pass on the new coronavirus,according to the WHO,external. UK experts say reports of a dog in Hong Kong repeatedly testing positive should not lead people to panic. ""We have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of the virus,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham. ""I still think it's questionable how relevant it is to the human outbreak as most of the global outbreak has been driven by human-to-human transmission."" He added: ""We need to find out more, but we don't need to panic - I doubt it could spread to another dog or a human because of the low levels of the virus."" But you should still wash your hands regularly with soap and water after touching pets. Even cuddly ones can carry bacteria such as E.coli and salmonella - and these are bugs that can pass between pets and humans. The new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19) is thought to have originated in wildlife and been passed to humans via a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus could have gone unnoticed in animals before jumping to humans, which is how many viruses start. eg. avian flu, Ebola, Sars. Scientists say the likelihood of the virus making yet another jump to another species like dogs in such a short space of time is very, very small. During the Sars outbreak in 2003, a small number of cats and dogs tested positive for the virus. These animals did not transmit the virus to other animals of the same species, or to humans. Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? The new virus is part of the coronavirus family, which includes the common cold, Sars and Mers Most people will have mild symptoms (dry cough, high temperature) and will recover,the UK's top doctor says. However, the virus is making some people seriously ill (pneumonia, breathing problems) and killing a small number (severe lung issues) - around 1%. The elderly, the unwell and (possibly) men are more at risk of getting a serious disease. Children and younger adults tend to have much milder symptomsbut those with severe asthma or weakened immune systems could still have serious complications. Remember that seasonal flu, which circulates every winter, kills people too -an average of 600 people die from complications of flu in the UK every year,externaland hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Prof Ball, from Nottingham University, recommends good personal and hand hygiene to protect against flu and coronavirus. Scientists still don't know exactly how the new virus is spread but it does seem to be very infectious. ""Tiny droplets from coughs and breathing are most likely,"" Prof Ball says, soadvising people with mild symptoms to self-isolate for seven daysis lowering that risk even further. Reducing close contact with people, particularly those who look unwell, is a good move too. Getting a flu vaccine at the moment is still advised by UK health officials. How deadly is the coronavirus? There are no specific medicines or vaccines for the new virus, and antibiotics don't work either (they fight off bacteria, not viruses). Treatment options do exist but most people get better on their own. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine, but this will have to be tested in trials first, so it could be some time before it's ready. Older people and those with other health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, cancer and diabetes, are most vulnerable to the new virus. Although anyone of any age can get it, it is hoped that only one in five of the population will be infected - but the worst case scenario could be 80%. There is no need to avoid your local take-away or to stop buying Chinese food or beer from any other outlet, despite fears on social media. The WHO says it's also safe to receive packages and letters from countries with coronavirus hotspots,external. The virus is unlikely to survive for long enough on these kind of surfaces. But it can survive on surfaces like door handles, cups, mobile phones and money for days, potentially, which is why regularly cleaning our hands with soap and water is so important. You have to be in close contact with an infected person - within two metres for 15 minutes or more - to be at risk, according to advice from Public Health England. UK government advisers say it's more likely you'll be infected from close family and friends than when attending a large gathering or event. The virus is now circulating widely within the UK so health officials say that reducing social contact - by working at home, avoiding busy public transport and staggering your commute - is a good idea too.

Top Democrat calls for review of Iowa voteFinal results of the caucus held three days ago are still not available amid an array of problems.US & Canada,"Tom Perez has called for a ""review"" of worksheets to ensure voting accuracy The chairman of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) has called for a review of the vote totals in the contest to pick a presidential nominee in Iowa, after an array of problems. His comments came just before the final results, which were three days later than expected amid technical problems and reporting delays. ""Enough is enough,"" said Tom Perez. He said he wanted to ensure accuracy. The Iowa Democratic Party said it had no plans to carry out an audit. Final results eventually came late on Thursday local time, with the party declaring Pete Buttigieg the winner by a tiny margin. At last, Iowa results. So who won and lost? A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Meanwhile Bernie Sanders, who was practically neck-and-neck with Pete Buttigieg, declared a ""very strong victory"". The results gave Mr Buttigieg a lead of 0.1% in the number of delegates selected ahead of Mr Sanders, although Mr Sanders has a greater share of the popular vote. Speaking in New Hampshire, where he is campaigning for the upcoming primary on Tuesday, Mr Sanders said: ""When more than 6,000 more people come out for you in an election than your nearest opponent, we here in northern New England call that a victory."" Mr Buttigieg had already declared victory for himself on Monday, before any of the results were released. The party blames the delay in results on a coding error in an app, called Shadow, which is being used for the first time to report the votes. Bernie Sanders thanked Iowans for what he called a ""very strong victory"" On Twitter, Mr Perez said a recanvass would not involve a recount of all votes, but a ""review of the worksheets from each caucus site to ensure accuracy"". While Mr Perez holds sway within the national party organisation, only the Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) has the power to call for a recanvass of votes. In a statement, IDP chair Troy Price said he acknowledged that ""reporting circumstances on Monday night were unacceptable"". This video can not be played 'The story of the night is... this system sucks' But Mr Price seemed to push back at the chairman's remarks, saying: ""We owe it to the thousands of Iowa Democratic volunteers and caucusgoers to remain focused on collecting and reviewing incoming results"". He added that the IDP was prepared for a recanvass should any presidential campaign requested one. The IDP said the flaw in the app did not impact the accuracy of voting data and there were no signs of hacking. Iowa is the first contest in a string of nationwide state-by-state votes, known as primaries and caucuses, that will culminate in the crowning of a Democratic nominee at the party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July. Eleven candidates remain in a Democratic field that has already been whittled down from more than two dozen. With 97% of precincts reporting, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in first place A caucus involves people attending a meeting - usually in schools, community centres and other designated buildings - and voting on their preferred candidate via a head count or a show of hands. Each candidate is then given a set number of delegates proportionate to the number of votes they received. The delegates will then go on to vote for them at the party's convention in Wisconsin where the final presidential candidate is chosen. Each candidate's secret weapon against Trump Iowa awards only 41 of the 1,991 delegates required to become the Democratic White House nominee.

Now the spin doctors and censors will try to find a way to convince 1.4 billion people that Dr Li's death is not a clear example of the limits to the party's ability to manage an emergency - when openness can save lives, and restricting it can kill. Chinese people are going to take some convincing. Global Times, People's Daily and other Chinese media reported Dr Li's death earlier on Thursday. Dr Li, was initially declared dead at 21:30 local time and the news triggered a huge wave of popular reaction on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. The People's Daily sent out a tweet saying Dr Li's death had sparked ""national grief"". However, Global Times then said he had been given a treatment known as ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) which keeps a person's heart pumping and keeps their blood oxygenated without it going through their lungs. Global Times said he was in a critical condition. Journalists and doctors at the scene, who do not want their names used, told the BBC and other media that government officials had intervened. Official media outlets had been told to change their reports to say the doctor was still being treated. The media outlets then later reported the new time of Dr Li's death: Allow Twitter content?

Top Democrat calls for review of Iowa vote,"Tom Perez has called for a ""review"" of worksheets to ensure voting accuracy The chairman of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) has called for a review of the vote totals in the contest to pick a presidential nominee in Iowa, after an array of problems. His comments came just before the final results, which were three days later than expected amid technical problems and reporting delays. ""Enough is enough,"" said Tom Perez. He said he wanted to ensure accuracy. The Iowa Democratic Party said it had no plans to carry out an audit. Final results eventually came late on Thursday local time, with the party declaring Pete Buttigieg the winner by a tiny margin. At last, Iowa results. So who won and lost? A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Meanwhile Bernie Sanders, who was practically neck-and-neck with Pete Buttigieg, declared a ""very strong victory"". The results gave Mr Buttigieg a lead of 0.1% in the number of delegates selected ahead of Mr Sanders, although Mr Sanders has a greater share of the popular vote. Speaking in New Hampshire, where he is campaigning for the upcoming primary on Tuesday, Mr Sanders said: ""When more than 6,000 more people come out for you in an election than your nearest opponent, we here in northern New England call that a victory."" Mr Buttigieg had already declared victory for himself on Monday, before any of the results were released. The party blames the delay in results on a coding error in an app, called Shadow, which is being used for the first time to report the votes. Bernie Sanders thanked Iowans for what he called a ""very strong victory"" On Twitter, Mr Perez said a recanvass would not involve a recount of all votes, but a ""review of the worksheets from each caucus site to ensure accuracy"". While Mr Perez holds sway within the national party organisation, only the Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) has the power to call for a recanvass of votes. In a statement, IDP chair Troy Price said he acknowledged that ""reporting circumstances on Monday night were unacceptable"". This video can not be played 'The story of the night is... this system sucks' But Mr Price seemed to push back at the chairman's remarks, saying: ""We owe it to the thousands of Iowa Democratic volunteers and caucusgoers to remain focused on collecting and reviewing incoming results"". He added that the IDP was prepared for a recanvass should any presidential campaign requested one. The IDP said the flaw in the app did not impact the accuracy of voting data and there were no signs of hacking.

Coronavirus kills Chinese whistleblower doctorThe hospital treating Li Wenliang confirms his death after a day of confused reports.China,"Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital A Chinese doctor who tried to issue the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak has died, the hospital treating him has said. Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital. He had sent out a warning to fellow medics on 30 December but police told him to stop ""making false comments"". There had been contradictory reports about his death, but the People's Daily now says he died at 02:58 on Friday (18:58 GMT Thursday). The virus has killed 636 people and infected 31,161 in mainland China, the National Health Commission's latest figures show. The death toll includes 73 new deaths reported on Thursday. Another 41 catch virus on quarantined cruise ship Five need-to-know things about virus China's coronavirus 'brings our hearts together' The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Dr Li, an ophthalmologist, posted his story on Weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning. The 34-year-old had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003. The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan A visual guide to the outbreak On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection. Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter. In the letter he was accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"". He was one of eight people who police said were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"" Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li. In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing, the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 January. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Shanghai's deserted streets and metro, filmed in February A wave of anger and grief flooded Chinese social media site Weibo when news of Dr Li's death broke late on Thursday. The top two trending hashtags on the website were ""Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang and apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"". Both hashtags were quickly censored. When the BBC searched Weibo on Friday morning, hundreds of thousands of comments had already been wiped. Many have now taken to posting under the hashtag ""Can you manage, do you understand?"" - a reference to the letter Dr Li was told to sign where he was accused of disturbing ""social order"". Only a handful of critical comments now remain - many of which do not directly name him - but are an indication of the mounting anger and distrust towards the Chinese government. ""Do not forget how you feel now. Do not forget this anger. We must not let this happen again,"" said one comment on Weibo. ""The truth will always be treated as a rumour. How long are you going to lie? Are you still lying? What else do you have to hide?"" another said. Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing The death of Dr Li Wenliang has been a heart-breaking moment for this country. For the Chinese leadership it is an epic political disaster. It lays bare the worst aspects of China's command and control system of governance under Xi Jinping - and the Communist Party would have to be blind not to see it. If your response to a dangerous health emergency is for the police to harass a doctor trying to blow the whistle, then your structure is obviously broken. The city's mayor - reaching for excuses - said he needed clearance to release critical information which all Chinese people were entitled to receive.

Arena attack brother used 'slaughter' email name,"Mr Penny said Hashem Abedi created the account two months before the attack An email address which translated from Arabic as ""to slaughter we have come"" was linked to the Manchester Arena attacker's brother and used to buy a bomb-making chemical, a jury has heard. Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb outside an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017, killing 22 people. Hashem Abedi has denied 22 counts of murder and other charges. A Gmail account using the Arabic phrase ""bedab7jeana"" was created in March 2017, his Old Bailey trial heard. Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, said it was created in Hulme Market, Manchester, where analysis of telephone and number-plate evidence has placed 22-year-old Hashem Abedi. The following month, he said, the email address was provided to Amazon when a ""successful purchase"" of hydrogen peroxide took place. Mr Penny said a ""literal translation"" from Arabic of the phrase was ""to slaughter we have come"" and when the Abedi family home in Fallowfield was searched after the attack, the address was found on a torn-up note in a bin outside.

Mr Penny said their Toyota Aygo, which they had bought for Â£250, was written off in the crash in Fallowfield on 23 March 2017. He said they had reacted ""unkindly to the interest of others in the collision and were abusive to the other driver"", and witnesses noticed a number of cardboard boxes in the back seat. He added there had been attempts to remove the labels on the boxes when it was discovered the Aygo could not be repaired. Jurors were also told the brothers visited a hardware superstore in Stockport at the end of March where their mother's card was used to buy a claw hammer, hacksaw, metal cutters and pliers. Mr Penny added that the pair bought a Nissan Micra, which he previously described as a ""de-facto storage facility"", on 13 April. It was bought quickly ""after a brief examination... and a test drive"", he said, and collected at 23:30 BST in an ""episode"" which ""smacks of real urgency"". The car - which was found in Rusholme after the bombing - had Hashem Abedi's fingerprints inside, along with bags of screws and nails handled by the defendant and more than 10 litres of sulphuric acid in the boot, he said. He said further examination found traces of the chemical compound used in the explosion ""on the driver's seat and in other areas of the car"", adding: ""Has all this happened under this defendant's nose without him realising anything about what was really going on, as he was later to claim?"" Hashem Abedi denies 22 counts of murder along with charges of attempted murder and conspiring to cause an explosion. The case continues.

Chinese media confusion over doctor's virus death,"Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital A Chinese doctor who tried to issue the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak has died, the hospital treating him has said. Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital. He had sent out a warning to fellow medics on 30 December but police told him to stop ""making false comments"". There had been contradictory reports about his death, but the People's Daily now says he died at 02:58 on Friday (18:58 GMT Thursday). The virus has killed 636 people and infected 31,161 in mainland China, the National Health Commission's latest figures show. The death toll includes 73 new deaths reported on Thursday. Another 41 catch virus on quarantined cruise ship Five need-to-know things about virus China's coronavirus 'brings our hearts together' The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Dr Li, an ophthalmologist, posted his story on Weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning. The 34-year-old had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003. The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan A visual guide to the outbreak On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection. Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter. In the letter he was accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"". He was one of eight people who police said were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"" Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li. In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing, the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 January. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Shanghai's deserted streets and metro, filmed in February A wave of anger and grief flooded Chinese social media site Weibo when news of Dr Li's death broke late on Thursday. The top two trending hashtags on the website were ""Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang and apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"". Both hashtags were quickly censored. When the BBC searched Weibo on Friday morning, hundreds of thousands of comments had already been wiped. Many have now taken to posting under the hashtag ""Can you manage, do you understand?"" - a reference to the letter Dr Li was told to sign where he was accused of disturbing ""social order"". Only a handful of critical comments now remain - many of which do not directly name him - but are an indication of the mounting anger and distrust towards the Chinese government. ""Do not forget how you feel now. Do not forget this anger. We must not let this happen again,"" said one comment on Weibo. ""The truth will always be treated as a rumour. How long are you going to lie? Are you still lying? What else do you have to hide?"" another said. Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing The death of Dr Li Wenliang has been a heart-breaking moment for this country. For the Chinese leadership it is an epic political disaster. It lays bare the worst aspects of China's command and control system of governance under Xi Jinping - and the Communist Party would have to be blind not to see it. If your response to a dangerous health emergency is for the police to harass a doctor trying to blow the whistle, then your structure is obviously broken. The city's mayor - reaching for excuses - said he needed clearance to release critical information which all Chinese people were entitled to receive. Now the spin doctors and censors will try to find a way to convince 1.4 billion people that Dr Li's death is not a clear example of the limits to the party's ability to manage an emergency - when openness can save lives, and restricting it can kill. Chinese people are going to take some convincing. Global Times, People's Daily and other Chinese media reported Dr Li's death earlier on Thursday. Dr Li, was initially declared dead at 21:30 local time and the news triggered a huge wave of popular reaction on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. The People's Daily sent out a tweet saying Dr Li's death had sparked ""national grief"". However, Global Times then said he had been given a treatment known as ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) which keeps a person's heart pumping and keeps their blood oxygenated without it going through their lungs. Global Times said he was in a critical condition. Journalists and doctors at the scene, who do not want their names used, told the BBC and other media that government officials had intervened. Official media outlets had been told to change their reports to say the doctor was still being treated. The media outlets then later reported the new time of Dr Li's death: Allow Twitter content?

Most of those killed by coronavirus have been over the age of 60 or have suffered from other medical conditions, according to China's health authorities. Dr Li's medical history is not known. China is introducing more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak. Beijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays and weddings while cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day. Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside. Its capital, Wuhan, has a lack of beds and equipment, one senior city official said. Despite the rapid construction of two hospitals, the volume of patients is causing severe strain. Reports on social media say the Wuhan government is to carry out door-to-door temperature checks on residents. This video can not be played Evacuating from China to a remote Australian island for quarantine There has been criticism of the crackdowns, with Human Rights Watch saying China was ""treating public health with a sledgehammer"". Meanwhile, Hong Kong has seen panic buying of goods, including toilet rolls, and there have been huge queues for masks. Although the virus has spread overseas, with confirmed infection in some 25 nations, there have so far been only two deaths outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, saying if funds are not allocated now to tackle the outbreak, nations would pay for it later. Coronavirus: What it does to the body Although the official figures in China are of 31,000 infections, some scientists have estimated that the actual rate could be 10 times higher, with the majority of infected people only presenting mild symptoms, not receiving treatment, yet passing on the potentially deadly disease. The UKon Thursday confirmed a third case of the virus. Some 3,700 people on the Diamond Princess cruise vessel moored off Japan face testing and quarantine for at least two weeks. On Friday, Japanese broadcaster NHK said 41 new cases had been detected on board, bringing the total to 61. Another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew is quarantined in Hong Kong with three cases on board. How worried should we be?

Bercow naming staff in book 'was unacceptable',"John Bercow stood down as Speaker last year The House of Commons has accused John Bercow of naming ex-staff in his autobiography without their permission, saying this was ""unacceptable"". In his book, Unspeakable, the former Commons Speaker hits back at accusations of bullying made against him by individual staff members. A Commons spokesperson said employees had a ""right to expect"" privacy. But Mr Bercow said he was responding to critics who had tried to ""blacken"" his name by making ""unfounded claims"". He quit as Speaker in October after more than 10 years in the role. Some of Mr Bercow's ex-colleagues have gone public with complaints against him in the past.

Coronavirus 'kills Chinese whistleblower doctor'Li Wenliang was warned by police in Wuhan after issuing his first alerts about the deadly virus.China,"Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital A Chinese doctor who tried to issue the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak has died, the hospital treating him has said. Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital. He had sent out a warning to fellow medics on 30 December but police told him to stop ""making false comments"". There had been contradictory reports about his death, but the People's Daily now says he died at 02:58 on Friday (18:58 GMT Thursday). The virus has killed 636 people and infected 31,161 in mainland China, the National Health Commission's latest figures show. The death toll includes 73 new deaths reported on Thursday. Another 41 catch virus on quarantined cruise ship Five need-to-know things about virus China's coronavirus 'brings our hearts together' The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Dr Li, an ophthalmologist, posted his story on Weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning. The 34-year-old had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003. The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan A visual guide to the outbreak On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection. Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter. In the letter he was accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"". He was one of eight people who police said were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"" Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li. In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing, the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 January. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Shanghai's deserted streets and metro, filmed in February A wave of anger and grief flooded Chinese social media site Weibo when news of Dr Li's death broke late on Thursday. The top two trending hashtags on the website were ""Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang and apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"". Both hashtags were quickly censored. When the BBC searched Weibo on Friday morning, hundreds of thousands of comments had already been wiped. Many have now taken to posting under the hashtag ""Can you manage, do you understand?"" - a reference to the letter Dr Li was told to sign where he was accused of disturbing ""social order"". Only a handful of critical comments now remain - many of which do not directly name him - but are an indication of the mounting anger and distrust towards the Chinese government. ""Do not forget how you feel now. Do not forget this anger. We must not let this happen again,"" said one comment on Weibo. ""The truth will always be treated as a rumour. How long are you going to lie? Are you still lying? What else do you have to hide?"" another said. Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing The death of Dr Li Wenliang has been a heart-breaking moment for this country. For the Chinese leadership it is an epic political disaster. It lays bare the worst aspects of China's command and control system of governance under Xi Jinping - and the Communist Party would have to be blind not to see it. If your response to a dangerous health emergency is for the police to harass a doctor trying to blow the whistle, then your structure is obviously broken. The city's mayor - reaching for excuses - said he needed clearance to release critical information which all Chinese people were entitled to receive. Now the spin doctors and censors will try to find a way to convince 1.4 billion people that Dr Li's death is not a clear example of the limits to the party's ability to manage an emergency - when openness can save lives, and restricting it can kill. Chinese people are going to take some convincing. Global Times, People's Daily and other Chinese media reported Dr Li's death earlier on Thursday. Dr Li, was initially declared dead at 21:30 local time and the news triggered a huge wave of popular reaction on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. The People's Daily sent out a tweet saying Dr Li's death had sparked ""national grief"". However, Global Times then said he had been given a treatment known as ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) which keeps a person's heart pumping and keeps their blood oxygenated without it going through their lungs. Global Times said he was in a critical condition. Journalists and doctors at the scene, who do not want their names used, told the BBC and other media that government officials had intervened. Official media outlets had been told to change their reports to say the doctor was still being treated. The media outlets then later reported the new time of Dr Li's death: Allow Twitter content?

Most of those killed by coronavirus have been over the age of 60 or have suffered from other medical conditions, according to China's health authorities. Dr Li's medical history is not known. China is introducing more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak. Beijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays and weddings while cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day. Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside. Its capital, Wuhan, has a lack of beds and equipment, one senior city official said. Despite the rapid construction of two hospitals, the volume of patients is causing severe strain. Reports on social media say the Wuhan government is to carry out door-to-door temperature checks on residents. This video can not be played Evacuating from China to a remote Australian island for quarantine There has been criticism of the crackdowns, with Human Rights Watch saying China was ""treating public health with a sledgehammer"". Meanwhile, Hong Kong has seen panic buying of goods, including toilet rolls, and there have been huge queues for masks. Although the virus has spread overseas, with confirmed infection in some 25 nations, there have so far been only two deaths outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, saying if funds are not allocated now to tackle the outbreak, nations would pay for it later. Coronavirus: What it does to the body Although the official figures in China are of 31,000 infections, some scientists have estimated that the actual rate could be 10 times higher, with the majority of infected people only presenting mild symptoms, not receiving treatment, yet passing on the potentially deadly disease. The UKon Thursday confirmed a third case of the virus. Some 3,700 people on the Diamond Princess cruise vessel moored off Japan face testing and quarantine for at least two weeks. On Friday, Japanese broadcaster NHK said 41 new cases had been detected on board, bringing the total to 61. Another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew is quarantined in Hong Kong with three cases on board. How worried should we be?

The baby was born on 2 February in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The baby's mother tested positive before she gave birth. It is unclear how the disease was transmitted - in the womb, or after birth. Only a handful of children have come down with the virus, which has killed 565 people and infected 28,018. All but one of the deaths were in China. State media outlet Xinhua reported news of the infection late on Wednesday. It added that the baby, who weighed 3.25kg at birth (7lbs 2oz), was now in a stable condition and under observation.  564dead 1,153cured 28,018confirmed cases 24,702suspected cases 186,354under medical watch Medical experts say it could be a case where the infection was contracted in the womb. ""This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission,"" chief physician of Wuhan Children Hospital's neonatal medicine department, Zeng Lingkong, told Reuters. But it is also possible that the baby was infected after birth from having close contact with the mother. ""It's quite possible that the baby picked it up very conventionally - by inhaling virus droplets that came from the mother coughing,"" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, told Business Insider. Five need-to-know things about coronavirus Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Virus 'forces' couple to live-stream into own wedding A visual guide to the outbreak Very few children have tested positive in this recent outbreak, which is consistent with other coronavirus outbreaks in recent history including Sars and Mers. A report by theJournal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said the median age of patients for the current outbreak is between 49 and 56 years,external, adding that cases in children ""have been rare"". Similarly, during the Mers outbreak in 2016,the World Journal of Clinical Paediatrics said the virus was rare in children,external, though it added that the ""reason for [this] low prevalence is not known"". A six-month old baby in Singapore is known to have tested positive for the new coronavirus, as well as an eight-year-old from Wuhan who is currently in Australia. The virus has spread overseas, with 25 nations confirming a total of 191 cases, although there has so far been only two deaths outside mainland China.

Its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Wednesday appealed for $675m (Â£520m) to fund a three-month response plan. The vast majority of the funds would go to nations that need help to protect against the virus. Some 500,000 masks and 40,000 respirators would be sent to 24 countries.

Now the spin doctors and censors will try to find a way to convince 1.4 billion people that Dr Li's death is not a clear example of the limits to the party's ability to manage an emergency - when openness can save lives, and restricting it can kill. Chinese people are going to take some convincing. Global Times, People's Daily and other Chinese media reported Dr Li's death earlier on Thursday. Dr Li, was initially declared dead at 21:30 local time and the news triggered a huge wave of popular reaction on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. The People's Daily sent out a tweet saying Dr Li's death had sparked ""national grief"". However, Global Times then said he had been given a treatment known as ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) which keeps a person's heart pumping and keeps their blood oxygenated without it going through their lungs. Global Times said he was in a critical condition. Journalists and doctors at the scene, who do not want their names used, told the BBC and other media that government officials had intervened. Official media outlets had been told to change their reports to say the doctor was still being treated. The media outlets then later reported the new time of Dr Li's death: Allow Twitter content?

Most of those killed by coronavirus have been over the age of 60 or have suffered from other medical conditions, according to China's health authorities. Dr Li's medical history is not known. China is introducing more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak. Beijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays and weddings while cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day. Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside. Its capital, Wuhan, has a lack of beds and equipment, one senior city official said. Despite the rapid construction of two hospitals, the volume of patients is causing severe strain. Reports on social media say the Wuhan government is to carry out door-to-door temperature checks on residents.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong has seen panic buying of goods, including toilet rolls, and there have been huge queues for masks.

Coronavirus: What it does to the body Although the official figures in China are of 31,000 infections, some scientists have estimated that the actual rate could be 10 times higher, with the majority of infected people only presenting mild symptoms, not receiving treatment, yet passing on the potentially deadly disease. The UKon Thursday confirmed a third case of the virus. Some 3,700 people on the Diamond Princess cruise vessel moored off Japan face testing and quarantine for at least two weeks. On Friday, Japanese broadcaster NHK said 41 new cases had been detected on board, bringing the total to 61. Another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew is quarantined in Hong Kong with three cases on board. How worried should we be?

"Baby, aged 30 hours, diagnosed with coronavirus","This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus A Chinese newborn has been diagnosed with the new coronavirus just 30 hours after birth, the youngest case recorded so far, state media said. The baby was born on 2 February in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The baby's mother tested positive before she gave birth. It is unclear how the disease was transmitted - in the womb, or after birth. Only a handful of children have come down with the virus, which has killed 565 people and infected 28,018. All but one of the deaths were in China. State media outlet Xinhua reported news of the infection late on Wednesday. It added that the baby, who weighed 3.25kg at birth (7lbs 2oz), was now in a stable condition and under observation.  564dead 1,153cured 28,018confirmed cases 24,702suspected cases 186,354under medical watch Medical experts say it could be a case where the infection was contracted in the womb. ""This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission,"" chief physician of Wuhan Children Hospital's neonatal medicine department, Zeng Lingkong, told Reuters. But it is also possible that the baby was infected after birth from having close contact with the mother. ""It's quite possible that the baby picked it up very conventionally - by inhaling virus droplets that came from the mother coughing,"" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, told Business Insider. Five need-to-know things about coronavirus Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Virus 'forces' couple to live-stream into own wedding A visual guide to the outbreak Very few children have tested positive in this recent outbreak, which is consistent with other coronavirus outbreaks in recent history including Sars and Mers. A report by theJournal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said the median age of patients for the current outbreak is between 49 and 56 years,external, adding that cases in children ""have been rare"". Similarly, during the Mers outbreak in 2016,the World Journal of Clinical Paediatrics said the virus was rare in children,external, though it added that the ""reason for [this] low prevalence is not known"". A six-month old baby in Singapore is known to have tested positive for the new coronavirus, as well as an eight-year-old from Wuhan who is currently in Australia. The virus has spread overseas, with 25 nations confirming a total of 191 cases, although there has so far been only two deaths outside mainland China. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. This video can not be played Evacuating from China to a remote Australian island for quarantine The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency. Its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Wednesday appealed for $675m (Â£520m) to fund a three-month response plan. The vast majority of the funds would go to nations that need help to protect against the virus. Some 500,000 masks and 40,000 respirators would be sent to 24 countries.

"Firefighters could perform NHS roles, ministers sayWales' fire and rescue services could be given a wider role in keeping people safe under new plans.Wales politics","Firefighters are trained to deal with incidents other than fire, ministers say Wales' fire and rescue services could be given a wider role in keeping people safe under new plans from ministers. The Welsh Government say the services have been so successful in reducing fires that they are now under-occupied. Many rural fire stations respond to a handful of fires a month, threatening their sustainability, ministers say. Firefighters could take on roles currently carried out by the NHS, such as responding to medical emergencies, the government has suggested. It is believed the move would be the first of its kind in the UK. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has been asked to respond. In astatement,external, Hannah Blythyn, the minister responsible for the fire service, said: ""I would like to thank our fire and rescue services in Wales for their continued success in reducing both the incidence and severity of fire. ""I have little doubt that this success is partly due to the great emphasis that the fire service places on preventing fire and improving awareness of fire risks.Â ""Firefighters are highly trained to deal with a wide range of incidents besides fires, and have the expertise and respect to raise awareness of and prevent non-fire threats too."" Hannah Blythyn says firefighters could ""make a real contribution to supporting the NHS"" Ms Blythyn said there was ""clear potential"" for the service to ""make a real contribution to supporting the NHS in particular, whether in terms of responding to medical emergencies or helping to prevent accidents like falls at home; and clear evidence that this can secure better outcomes and significant savings"". Fireman Sam mascot axed for not being inclusive ,externalFirefighters call for protection against cancer Firefighter recruitment 'more and more difficult' ""There are many impressive examples of this happening, but they are often small-scale and piecemeal"", she said. ""I want to see a fire and rescue service which deals with a range of threats to people's health and safety, both in terms of prevention and emergency response, complementing not duplicating the work of other professionals."" The announcement comes as the Welsh NHS facesincreasing pressurethroughout the system, resulting in cancelled operations, long waits for certain types of surgery and patients struggling to get GP appointments. The Welsh Government said there needed to be an agreement on firefighters' pay and conditions to reflect the proposed broader role, although it says negotiations on this have been ""very slow"". Ministers say they have a ""commitment to consider providing financial support to a pay deal that meets the needs of Wales and Welsh firefighters"" and ""there are already constructive discussions on this at a senior management level"". Wales has three fire and rescue services - North Wales, Mid and West Wales, and South Wales. Last year, firefighterstrained as special constablesin Devon and Somerset, to boost police numbers in rural areas, a move opposed by the FBU. The union said independence from the police was ""vital to ensure that communities know firefighters exist to save lives, not to enforce the law"".

Bercow naming staff in book 'was unacceptable'The former Speaker says he has a right to answer his accusers after criticism from the Commons.UK Politics,"John Bercow stood down as Speaker last year The House of Commons has accused John Bercow of naming ex-staff in his autobiography without their permission, saying this was ""unacceptable"". In his book, Unspeakable, the former Commons Speaker hits back at accusations of bullying made against him by individual staff members. A Commons spokesperson said employees had a ""right to expect"" privacy. But Mr Bercow said he was responding to critics who had tried to ""blacken"" his name by making ""unfounded claims"". He quit as Speaker in October after more than 10 years in the role. Some of Mr Bercow's ex-colleagues have gone public with complaints against him in the past. The Commons has not named the employees it is concerned about. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokesperson said: ""House of Commons staff work incredibly hard to enable the effective functioning of our democracy and have a right to expect that their privacy be respected. It is unacceptable to publicly name current or former staff without their prior knowledge or authority, especially for the purpose of financial gain or commercial success. ""A crucial element of the work of House of Commons staff is to provide confidential, impartial advice to MPs. Breaking this confidentiality undermines this important principle and also places staff in a position from which they are unable to respond."" In a statement, Mr Bercow's agent said: ""Given there is a small but highly vocal group of people consistently seeking to blacken his name, it would be odd if Mr Bercow did not comment on their unfounded allegations and the reasons behind them. ""He was advised by Speaker's Counsel not to do so in detail while he was in office. He is therefore doing so now. If the book had not addressed these issues, he would rightly have been accused of serious omission. ""Critics are entitled to air their views. What they are not entitled to do is to make unfounded allegations and expect Mr Bercow to say nothing in return."" Following Mr Bercow's comments, a Commons spokesperson said: ""In his book, Mr Bercow has chosen to name a number of staff who have never spoken publicly about their experiences or sought to gain publicity as a result. ""We condemn this behaviour and stand by our previous statement on the matter."" Earlier this week, Mr Bercow confirmed that he had been proposed for a peerage by outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

Who is Derek Mackay?,"Derek Mackay has resigned as Scottish finance secretary with immediate effect, on the day he was set to deliver his budget speech. His sudden exit - prompted by allegations he messaged a 16-year-old-boy on social media - cuts short a meteoric rise through Scottish politics. Raised in Renfrewshire, Derek Mackay attended Renfrew High School and the University of Glasgow. His familybriefly became homeless,externalduring his early teens, an experience he said shaped his outlook - as did the campaign against a new incinerator in the area. The young Mr Mackay studied social work, but always had his eye on a career in politics - he joined the SNP at 16, and served as national convener of the party's youth wing. Scots finance secretary quits amid messages claims He was elected to his local Renfrewshire Council in 1999 at the age of 21 - the youngest male councillor in the country at the time. He went on to lead the council between 2007 and 2011. Mr Mackay became MSP for the newly-created constituency of Renfrewshire North and West in 2011, beating Labour with a majority of 5.7%. Before the year was out he was local government minister, with Alex Salmond drafting him into government in a December reshuffle. Mr Mackay was transport minister before he became finance secretary When Nicola Sturgeon took office in 2015 he became transport minister, with responsibility for major projects such as the construction of the Queenferry Crossing. He faced down a crisis whenthe Forth Road Bridge had to be closedin December that year due to structural damage, later saying the closure was a ""make or break, do or die"" moment for him as a minister. After the 2016 Holyrood election - which saw him increase his majority to a very comfortable 24% - he was promoted to finance secretary. He initially shared the economy brief with Keith Brown, but absorbed the full role in the next reshuffle. The role saw him drawing up the Scottish budget each year - deciding the fate of Â£30bn of funding. Mr Mackay admitted occasionally feeling ""imposter syndrome"" at the top of politics. Derek Mackay has tendered his resignation with immediate effect Hetold Holyrood Magazine,external: ""I don't think it's a bad thing to admit that there are times when I don't think I'm good enough to do the job"". But he quickly added that ""having met my so-called Imperial Masters [at the Treasury], I am feeling perfectly apt and perfectly up to the job"". The 42-year-old also became a major figure in the SNP, serving as business convener for seven years between 2011 and 2018 - a period when the party's membership exploded in size. This role saw him oversee management of the party via its National Executive Committee, and he became a popular figure with the quickly-growing membership while chairing conferences. Mr Mackay came out as gay in 2013 and separated from his wife, with whom he has two sons. Bookmakers had Mr Mackay down as the favourite to succeed Ms Sturgeon as first minster some day Having served at the top of Ms Sturgeon's government, many bookmakers had tipped Mr Mackay as the favourite to succeed her some day. But his downfall has been even swifter than his rise through the ranks at Holyrood. After the Scottish Sun published transcripts of hundreds of text messages he had allegedly sent to a 16-year-old boy over a six-month period, he tendered his resignation to Ms Sturgeon ""with immediate effect"". He said he had ""behaved foolishly"" and was ""sorry to have let colleagues and supporters down"". His exit has come on the very day he was due to set out his latest tax and spending plans at Holyrood. He will now see the budget delivered by another rising star of the SNP, his junior minister Kate Forbes.

'Scantily-clad models not our issue'An annual industry event continues to use promotional models wearing revealing outfits.Business,"The gambling watchdog has said it's up to organisers to crack down on the use of scantily-clad models to promote products at a big industry trade event. Under its former boss, Sarah Harrison, the Gambling Commission hadthreatened to boycott ICE Londonbecause women ""were expected to wear nothing more than swimsuits"". It also convinced ICE to introduce a code of conduct to tackle sexism. But at this year's event it appeared that little had changed. And the Gambling Commission, which has a new boss, Neil McArthur, told the BBC: ""It is a matter for the organisers to enforce that code."" At the event at London's ExCel centre, the BBC found models dressed as Playboy bunnies promoting casino games sold by the Slovenian firm Interblock. The women also posed for pictures with male attendees. Meanwhile, other so-called ""promo-girls"" - models hired by firms to attract delegates to their stand - circulated the conference hall handing out leaflets and giveaways. Flavio Grasselli, a conference delegate from Italy, had his picture taken with three women dressed in mermaid outfits. He told the BBC he thought employing scantily-clad women to promote companies and products was not unethical. ""Gambling is linked with the forbidden,"" he said, adding that the ""sensuality of a woman"" and ""the sensuality of the roulette wheel"" in casinos were naturally linked. He said the ICE event was more like a music festival than a conference, describing himself as being ""like a child in a park"". Flavio Grasselli with three women promoting Synot Mr Grasselli was not the only one to speak out in support of conference's practices. Zenede, a model working at the event, said ICE was ""fun for people, it's great"". She added that the gaming firm that had employed her, Kajot, had chosen her tight cat suit because ""the people like it"". Zenede on the right loves her outfit Clarion Gaming, the company which runs the conference, brought in its code of conduct in 2019. It followed negative press about the use of pole dancers at the 2018 event. The code states that ""partial or total nudity or overtly sexual or suggestive clothing or marketing methods will not be allowed"". The firm told the BBC that companies at this year's event had largely met the code, but there had been one breach. It would not comment on the nature of the breach. ""Show management have spoken with the exhibitor concerned and immediate action was taken to ensure compliance,"" a spokesman said. Labour MP Carolyn Harris told the BBC that ICE London's practices were unacceptable. ""Having seen pictures from the ICE conference of scantily clad women being used by overseas gambling companies to once again promote their organisations to men in suits, I can't help but feel disappointed,"" she said. ""Time and again, this industry appears to be totally lacking in morals and decency. ""This kind of marketing is outdated and unnecessary and I would hope that Clarion who organised the event, think twice before doing this again."" A ""ring girl"" promotes a betting firm Her views echo the words of the former head of the Gambling Commission, Ms Harrison, who left in 2018. At the time, she said: ""A woman from the gambling industry is Britain's highest paid boss. Yet from walking around the exhibition you wouldn't know this."" She added: ""Instead you saw men representing their companies wearing expensive tailored suits whilst their female colleagues were expected to wear nothing more than swimsuits."" In a statement, a spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: ""We do not think this is acceptable, which is why we called the organisers out on this two years ago and they have since launched a code of conduct.

""Having seen pictures from the ICE conference of scantily clad women being used by overseas gambling companies to once again promote their organisations to men in suits, I can't help but feel disappointed,"" she said. ""Time and again, this industry appears to be totally lacking in morals and decency. ""This kind of marketing is outdated and unnecessary and I would hope that Clarion who organised the event, think twice before doing this again."" A ""ring girl"" promotes a betting firm Her views echo the words of the former head of the Gambling Commission, Ms Harrison, who left in 2018. At the time, she said: ""A woman from the gambling industry is Britain's highest paid boss. Yet from walking around the exhibition you wouldn't know this."" She added: ""Instead you saw men representing their companies wearing expensive tailored suits whilst their female colleagues were expected to wear nothing more than swimsuits."" In a statement, a spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: ""We do not think this is acceptable, which is why we called the organisers out on this two years ago and they have since launched a code of conduct. ""The organisers should enforce the code. Our focus is making sure that gambling is safer for British consumers.""

PM's dad spoke to China ambassador on coronavirus,"The PM's father, Stanley Johnson, held a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador Chinese officials were ""concerned"" Boris Johnson did not send a personal message of support after the coronavirus outbreak, emails suggest. The PM's father, Stanley Johnson, met Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming and emailed his worries to UK officials - accidentally copying in the BBC. Mr Liu told him the prime minister had not yet directly contacted the Chinese. A government spokesman said the UK had been in close contact with the Chinese authorities since the outbreak. Sources also stressed Stanley Johnson was not acting on behalf or at the request of the British government. NHS orders 'coronavirus pods' in hospitals in England Coronavirus: How worried should we be? A visual guide to the outbreak Stanley Johnson held a 90-minute meeting with Mr Liu on Tuesday. Mr Johnson, a longstanding environmental campaigner, was invited to the Chinese embassy to discuss summits on the topic, due to take place this autumn in China and the UK. Shortly after the meeting, the PM's father used his personal email address to share an account of the discussion with the environment minister Lord Goldsmith and other UK officials. He wrote: ""Re the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Liu obviously was concerned that there had not yet - so he asserted - been direct contact between the PM and Chinese head of state or government in terms of a personal message or telephone call."" Stanley Johnson also revealed he had raised the possibility of his son visiting China in October to attend an international conference on biodiversity, COP15, which will be held in Kunming. Lord Goldsmith wrote a reply from his personal email address, saying: ""Thank you so much Stanley. That is extremely useful."" No one in the exchange appeared to have noticed the BBC was copied in until it was raised with them. After being informed of his mistake, Mr Johnson said: ""I was copying in someone who happened to have the same name as a lady at the BBC. These things happen."" Mr Liu shared pictures of him and Stanley Johnson on Twitter, saying they had met to exchange views on the COP15 meeting and the COP26 meeting on climate change, to be hosted in Glasgow. He added: ""These two conferences are great opportunities to promote international cooperation on environmental protection & climate change."" The Chinese city of Wuhan is under quarantine following the coronavirus outbreak The World Health Organization says the coronavirus, which has spread to more than 20 countries, including the UK, does not yet qualify as a ""pandemic"". But the UK government is recommending that British citizens in Chinaleave the countryto minimise exposure to it. At a press conference in London, Mr Liu warned against ""panic"" and ""over-reaction"". He added: ""We would advise the British side to take the advice of the WHO... They [the UK government] recognise the effectiveness of the measures taken by China. They also tell us they will follow the WHO's advice."" Mr Liu also said the UK government's words were ""not entirely square"" with the facts and that it should take an ""objective, cool-headed view of what is happening"". The ""channel of communication"" between the Chinese and UK governments remained ""very open"", he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish tax and spending plans to be published,"Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes stepped in to deliver the budget There will be no changes to income tax rates in Scotland in the coming year, the government has announced. Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes set out the budget in the place of Derek Mackay, whoresigned as finance secretary on Thursday morning. She announced that tax rates will not increase, although the threshold where the upper rates kick in will be frozen. And she committed extra funding to health, education and investment aimed at tackling the ""climate emergency"". The SNP need votes from opposition parties to pass the budget, and Ms Forbes urged them not to be ""partisan"". Scots finance secretary quits over messages to boy Live coverage of the budget and Derek Mackay's resignation The build-up to the budget was disrupted when Mr Mackay was forced to quit the government overreports he had sent hundreds of social media messages to a 16-year-old boy,external. Junior minister Ms Forbes - a first-term MSP who is aged just 29 - stepped in at the last minute to deliver the speech, and is set to take the lead in talks with opposition parties. She said the package included ""significant investment in our response to the global climate emergency, to strengthen our economy and improve our public services"". Draft Income Tax plan 19%Starter rate 20%Basic rate 21%Intermediate rate 41%Higher rate 46%Top rate Under the plans, Scotland's current tax rates will not increase, and the threshold at which people start paying the basic and intermediate rates will increase by the rate of inflation. The thresholds for the higher and upper rates will be frozen, with Ms Forbes calling this the ""fairest and most progressive income tax system in the UK"". Funding proposals in the budget include: more than Â£15bn for health and care services Â£117m of investment in mental health support a real-terms increase in revenue funding for councils Â£180m for closing the attainment gap in schools Â£270m for rail services a 60% boost in funding to reduce harm from alcohol and drugs The budget had a particular focus on environmental issues, with Ms Forbes saying it would ""step up the delivery of our ambition to tackle climate change"". This includes Â£1.8bn of capital investment in projects to reduce emissions, and funding for active travel, electric vehicles, agriculture and peatland restoration. A budget bill will now be introduced at parliament, and is due to be voted on by MSPs in three weeks' time - which is how long Ms Forbes now has to secure a deal. New forecasts from theScottish Fiscal Commission,externalwere published alongside the budget, warning that ""Brexit remains a risk to continued economic growth"". Ms Forbes stepped in after Derek Mackay tendered his resignation with immediate effect Opposition MSPs praised Ms Forbes for stepping in to deliver the budget, but were critical of some of the content. Murdo Fraser said the Conservatives could not support the budget because it ""falls well short of where we need it to be"". He said freezing the upper rate tax thresholds could widen the gap between what higher earners pay in Scotland and the rest of the UK, and said ""not enough money is being handed to police"". For Labour, Rhoda Grant said essential services were ""worse off"" under the SNP, and that the government was using ""smoke and mirrors"" to obscure this. She said the budget was a ""disappointment"", calling for a ""step change"" in local government funding and extra money to make Scottish education ""world-leading"" again. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the budget was ""timid"" and was not an ""emergency response"" to climate change. And Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said councils ""have only been given half of what they need"", saying the government should focus on services rather than independence.

"Hang on, why was Trump impeached again?In this trial, people only heard what they wanted toHollywood legend Kirk Douglas dies at 103","The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

Water bills set to fall by about Â£17 a yearRegulator Ofwat had told water firms to invest more in improving services between 2020 and 2025.Business,"The average household's water and sewerage bill will drop by about Â£17 a year in England and Wales. Water UK, the industry trade body, said the average annual bill would fall by 4% to Â£396.60 from 1 April. Its chief executive, Christine McGourty, said the water industry was ""committed to giving customers good value for money"". The regulator Ofwat said the drop was down to the fact it had ""demanded greater efficiency"" from firms. Changes to bills will vary from customer to customer and depend on their supplier. The commitment comes at the start of the next five-year ""business cycle"" for water companies. Ofwat has been ""too soft"" on water companies in the past, Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), told the BBC's Today programme. ""Only about 60% of customers think their bills are fair and that's partly because bills have risen for many years and the regulatory system has been too generous to water companies until now. ""I think the regulator has somewhat belatedly got to grips with the industry now and we are fully supportive of that."" Water UK said that there would also be more help for vulnerable customers between 2020 and 2025. It said firms plan to double the number of people getting help with their bills every year, up from 760,000 customers now to at least 1.4 million by 2025. Measures to assist them could include introducing social tariffs, discounts for those on lower incomes or receiving benefits, or assisting charities that provide help. Ofwat told suppliers in Decemberthat they would have to cut the average customer bill by Â£50 over the next five years. There has been recent criticism of water companies over high profile pollution incidents as well as leaks, water quality and high bills. An Ofwat spokesperson said: ""We continue to push companies to deliver improved services for customers, the environment and resilience for generations to come while making sure that bills are fair."" They added: ""Today's announcement has been secured because we have demanded greater efficiency, passing through lower financing costs and promoting more innovation."" At the same time, it is forcing firms to restrict investor payouts and to invest billions of pounds to improve their performance and reduce leaks in their systems. Ofwat oversees the privatised water market in England and Wales. It monitors the market to see if it needs to intervene to protect customers and to set limits on the price they are asked to pay. Scotland has its own separate regulator, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland. The CCW told consumers to ""take full advantage"" of the reduction in bills. It added: ""There are still millions of households who could tap into savings by switching to a meter or cut their bills if they're on a low income by signing up to their company's social tariff.""

'No message' from PM to China after coronavirus,"The PM's father, Stanley Johnson, held a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador Chinese officials were ""concerned"" Boris Johnson did not send a personal message of support after the coronavirus outbreak, emails suggest. The PM's father, Stanley Johnson, met Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming and emailed his worries to UK officials - accidentally copying in the BBC. Mr Liu told him the prime minister had not yet directly contacted the Chinese. A government spokesman said the UK had been in close contact with the Chinese authorities since the outbreak. Sources also stressed Stanley Johnson was not acting on behalf or at the request of the British government. NHS orders 'coronavirus pods' in hospitals in England Coronavirus: How worried should we be? A visual guide to the outbreak Stanley Johnson held a 90-minute meeting with Mr Liu on Tuesday. Mr Johnson, a longstanding environmental campaigner, was invited to the Chinese embassy to discuss summits on the topic, due to take place this autumn in China and the UK. Shortly after the meeting, the PM's father used his personal email address to share an account of the discussion with the environment minister Lord Goldsmith and other UK officials. He wrote: ""Re the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Liu obviously was concerned that there had not yet - so he asserted - been direct contact between the PM and Chinese head of state or government in terms of a personal message or telephone call."" Stanley Johnson also revealed he had raised the possibility of his son visiting China in October to attend an international conference on biodiversity, COP15, which will be held in Kunming. Lord Goldsmith wrote a reply from his personal email address, saying: ""Thank you so much Stanley. That is extremely useful."" No one in the exchange appeared to have noticed the BBC was copied in until it was raised with them. After being informed of his mistake, Mr Johnson said: ""I was copying in someone who happened to have the same name as a lady at the BBC. These things happen."" Mr Liu shared pictures of him and Stanley Johnson on Twitter, saying they had met to exchange views on the COP15 meeting and the COP26 meeting on climate change, to be hosted in Glasgow. He added: ""These two conferences are great opportunities to promote international cooperation on environmental protection & climate change."" The Chinese city of Wuhan is under quarantine following the coronavirus outbreak The World Health Organization says the coronavirus, which has spread to more than 20 countries, including the UK, does not yet qualify as a ""pandemic"". But the UK government is recommending that British citizens in Chinaleave the countryto minimise exposure to it. At a press conference in London, Mr Liu warned against ""panic"" and ""over-reaction"". He added: ""We would advise the British side to take the advice of the WHO... They [the UK government] recognise the effectiveness of the measures taken by China. They also tell us they will follow the WHO's advice."" Mr Liu also said the UK government's words were ""not entirely square"" with the facts and that it should take an ""objective, cool-headed view of what is happening"". The ""channel of communication"" between the Chinese and UK governments remained ""very open"", he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Child protectors urge Facebook encryption rethink,"Child-protection organisations say Facebook's decision to strongly encrypt messages will give offenders a place to hide. The company is moving ahead with plans to implement the measure on Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct. But more than 100 organisations, led by the NSPCC, have signed an open letter warning the plans will undermine efforts to catch abusers. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she ""fully supported"" the move. In a statement to the BBC, she said: ""Tech companies like Facebook have a vital responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of vulnerable children."" ""Following my letter to Mark Zuckerberg, I met with Sheryl Sandberg and emphasised that Facebook's encryption plans cannot be allowed to hamper their ability to protect young people from paedophiles online. We have also submitted detailed evidence to the US Senate about these concerns. ""I fully support the continued efforts of the NSPCC and children's charities around the world to engage Facebook on this issue."" End-to-end encryption, already used on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, means no-one, including the company that owns the platform, can see the content of sent messages. Those signing the letter say Facebook has failed to address concerns about child safety. The missive urges the company to stop the rollout of its plans until ""sufficient safeguards"" are in place. ""At a time when we could be looking to build upon years of sophisticated initiatives, Facebook instead seems inclined to blindfold itself,"" the letter says. ""We urge you to recognise and accept that an increased risk of child abuse being facilitated on or by Facebook is not a reasonable trade-off to make. ""Children should not be put in harm's way either as a result of commercial decisions or design choices."" Among the other signatories were Barnardo's, 5Rights, the International Centre For Missing and Exploited Children, and Child USA. A spokesman for Facebook said protecting the wellbeing of children on its platform was ""critically important"" to it. ""We have led the industry in safeguarding children from exploitation and we are bringing this same commitment and leadership to our work on encryption,"" he said. ""We are working closely with child-safety experts, including NCMEC [the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children], law enforcement, governments and other technology companies, to help keep children safe online."" In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the NCMEC. The National Crime Agency said this had led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe. But, the NCMEC estimates, if Facebook implements end-to-end encryption, it could mean 70% of these vital reports are lost. In October, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said the increased risk of child abuse ""weighed heavily"" on him when considering the company's end-to-end encryption plan. ABBC News investigation last yearfound encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a place to host criminals. But WhatsApp bossWill Cathcart has previously posted on Hacker News,external: ""End-to-end encryption protects that right for over a billion people every day."" And Jo O'Reilly, digital privacy advocate at ProPrivacy, said many users would probably welcome Facebook's plans. ""It will make it significantly less likely that hackers will be able to intercept messages, going a long way to protect users from phishing and cyber-stalking,"" she said. ""It is the kind of of decisive action users will be looking for to reassure them that their private conversations really are private in the wake of privacy scandals."" But Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, said end-to-end encryption would make catching criminals tougher. ""If Facebook proceed with their current plans, they will knowingly put the safety of children at risk - ignoring the warnings of police, charities and experts across the world,"" he said. ""There is a moral responsibility on them to ensure this does not happen."" And NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Facebook may be happy to shut their eyes to abuse but they can't close their ears to this unanimous concern shown by international experts. ""In its current form, encryption would breach Facebook's duty of care for children so the UK government must ensure a new regulator has the power to hold them financially and criminally accountable.

Wuhan newborn becomes youngest coronavirus case,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus A Chinese newborn has been diagnosed with the new coronavirus just 30 hours after birth, the youngest case recorded so far, state media said. The baby was born on 2 February in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. The baby's mother tested positive before she gave birth. It is unclear how the disease was transmitted - in the womb, or after birth. Only a handful of children have come down with the virus, which has killed 565 people and infected 28,018. All but one of the deaths were in China. State media outlet Xinhua reported news of the infection late on Wednesday. It added that the baby, who weighed 3.25kg at birth (7lbs 2oz), was now in a stable condition and under observation.  564dead 1,153cured 28,018confirmed cases 24,702suspected cases 186,354under medical watch Medical experts say it could be a case where the infection was contracted in the womb. ""This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission,"" chief physician of Wuhan Children Hospital's neonatal medicine department, Zeng Lingkong, told Reuters. But it is also possible that the baby was infected after birth from having close contact with the mother. ""It's quite possible that the baby picked it up very conventionally - by inhaling virus droplets that came from the mother coughing,"" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, told Business Insider.

A report by theJournal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said the median age of patients for the current outbreak is between 49 and 56 years,external, adding that cases in children ""have been rare"". Similarly, during the Mers outbreak in 2016,the World Journal of Clinical Paediatrics said the virus was rare in children,external, though it added that the ""reason for [this] low prevalence is not known"". A six-month old baby in Singapore is known to have tested positive for the new coronavirus, as well as an eight-year-old from Wuhan who is currently in Australia. The virus has spread overseas, with 25 nations confirming a total of 191 cases, although there has so far been only two deaths outside mainland China. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu.

Why was Trump impeached?,"The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.
