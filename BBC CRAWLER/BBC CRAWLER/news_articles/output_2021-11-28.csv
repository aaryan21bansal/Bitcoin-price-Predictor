Travel bans must be urgently lifted - SA president,"This video can not be played Cyril Ramaphosa: ""We are deeply disappointed by the decision of several countries to prohibit travel."" South Africa's president has condemned travel bans enacted against his country and its neighbours over the new coronavirus variant Omicron. Cyril Ramaphosa said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the action, which he described as unjustified, and called for the bans to be urgently lifted. The UK, EU and US are among those who have imposed travel bans. Omicron has been classed as a ""variant of concern"". Early evidence suggests it has a higher re-infection risk. The heavily mutated variant was detected in South Africa earlier this month and then reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) last Wednesday. The variant is responsible for most of the infections found in South Africa's most populated province, Gauteng, over the last two weeks, and the number of cases of""appears to be increasing in almost all provinces"",externalin the country, according to the WHO. South Africa reported 2,800 new infections on Sunday, a rise from the daily average of 500 in the previous week. Government adviser and epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim said he expected the number of cases to reach more than 10,000 a day by the end of the week, and for hospitals to come under pressure in the next two to three weeks. But Health Minister Joe Phaahla said there was ""absolutely no need to panic"". ""We have been here before,"" he added, referring to the Beta variant identified in South Africa last December. On Monday, Japan became the latest country to reinstate tough border restrictions, banning all foreigners from entering the country from 30 November. The WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel curbs, saying they should look to a ""risk-based and scientific approach"". How worrying is the new Covid variant? South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Covid variants: Do we need new vaccines yet? WHO's Africa director Matshidiso Moeti said on Sunday: ""With the Omicron variant now detected in several regions of the world, putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity."" However, numerous bans have been introduced in recent days, with Rwanda and Angola being among the African states to restrict flights to and from South Africa. Foreign ministry spokesman Clayson Monyela described their decision as ""quite regrettable, very unfortunate, and I will even say sad"". This video can not be played Watch Dr Angelique Coetzee, the doctor who first spotted Omicron, describe ""extremely mild"" symptoms in patients In his speech on Sunday, Mr Ramaphosa said there was no scientific basis for the travel bans and that southern Africa was the victim of unfair discrimination. He also argued that the bans would not be effective in preventing the spread of the variant. ""The only thing the prohibition on travel will do is to further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to, and recover from, the pandemic,"" he said. He called on countries with bans in place to ""urgently reverse their decisions... before any further damage is done to our economies"". Mr Ramaphosa said South Africa would not impose new restrictions, but would ""undertake broad consultations on making vaccination mandatory for specific activities and locations"". Current regulations in South Africa make it mandatory to wear face coverings in public, and restrict indoor gatherings to 750 people and outdoor gatherings to 2,000. There are no vaccine shortages in South Africa itself, and Mr Ramaphosa urged more people to get jabbed, saying that remained the best way to fight the virus. Health experts said that Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg, had entered a fourth wave, and most hospital admissions were of unvaccinated people. Omicron has now been detected in a number of countries around the world, including the UK, Germany, Australia and Israel. In other developments: In theNetherlands,Omicron was detected in 13 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa. Separately,Dutch police said they detained a couple who had escaped from a quarantine hotel.According to the Dutch newspaper Het Parool, the Spanish man and Portuguese woman were arrested on a plane that was about to depart to Spain Israel banned all foreigners from entering the country for 14 daysfrom midnight Sunday TheUKcalled for an emergency meeting of the G7 group of nations on Monday to discuss the new variant Voters in Switzerland backed the government's measures to tackle Covid,according to preliminary results.

Formula 1 legend Sir Frank Williams dies,"Williams and his daughter Claire were well respected figures in the paddock Sir Frank Williams, founder and former team principal of the Williams Racing Formula 1 team, has died aged 79. He built the team named after him into one of the most successful in the sport. During his time with Williams, the team won nine constructors' championships and seven drivers' titles, and dominated much of the 1980s and 1990s. He and daughter Claire moved away from the sport in September 2020 after selling Williams to US investors. In a statement, the Williams team said: ""It is with great sadness that on behalf of the Williams family, the team can confirm the death of Sir Frank Williams CBE, founder and former team principal of Williams Racing, at the age of 79. ""After being admitted into hospital on Friday, Sir Frank passed away peacefully this morning surrounded by his family. ""Today we pay tribute to our much loved and inspirational figurehead. Frank will be sorely missed. We request that all friends and colleagues respect the Williams family's wishes for privacy at this time."" Obituary: 'An F1 icon and one of the greatest team owners' Williams was a wheelchair user after suffering a spinal cord injury in a car crash in France in 1986. F1 president and chief executive Stefano Domenicali paid tribute to Williams, whom he described as ""a true giant of our sport"". Domenicali added: ""He overcame the most difficult of challenges in life and battled every day to win on and off the track. We have lost a much loved and respected member of the F1 family and he will be hugely missed. ""His incredible achievements and personality will be etched on our sport forever. My thoughts are with all the Williams family and friends at this sad time."" The Williams team enjoyed their first F1 race win at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone with Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni at the wheel, and the following year Australian Alan Jones steered the team to the drivers' and constructors' titles for the first time. In 1994, Williams, along with technical director Patrick Head and chief designer Adrian Newey, was charged with manslaughter in Italy following the death of driver Ayrton Senna in a crash at Imola but he was acquitted several years later. The team have not won a title since Canadian Jacques Villeneuve's 1997 drivers' triumph, and there was an eight-year gap between Juan Pablo Montoya's victory in a Williams-BMW at the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix and the shock win for Pastor Maldonado in Spain in 2012 - the last time a Williams took the chequered flag.

Damon Hill, who won the world title with the team in 1996, said Williams had played an integral part in the history of the sport. ""Frank had a passion for cars, for racing. There was nothing else he was really interested in doing,"" Hill told Sky Sports News. ""He was just remarkable in every respect and in his dedication to the team. His record will stand for a very long time. ""The only person I could compare him to is Enzo Ferrari. He loved Formula 1 and he loved racing. Anyone who runs a team would like to aspire to his achievements and to his record. ""He was a man of few words. He could speak many languages but he didn't really engage in idle gossip. He's a huge part of the history of the sport."" Current Williams drivers George Russell and Nicholas Latifi also paid their respects to the former team principal. ""Sir Frank was such a genuinely wonderful human being and I'll always remember the laughs we shared,"" said Russell. ""He was more than a boss, he was a mentor and a friend to everybody who joined the Williams Racing family and so many others."" Canadian Latifi added: ""RIP Sir Frank Williams. Such sad news. A huge loss for our sport and our team. ""It's been an honour to represent your name on the world stage and we will continue to push hard to take the team back up the grid."" Chief F1 writer Andrew Benson Sir Frank Williams was one of the greatest Formula 1 team owners in history and a man who became an icon through his determination to compete at the highest level despite a severe disability. Williams did not so much love F1 as was consumed by it. Although his health prevented his active involvement in the team for the last few years, he literally lived in the factory. The team he set up was his life - as it always had been. Read more here.

Rising living costs 'crippling people in NI',"Energy prices are soaring due to supply and demand issues on the global wholesale market, meaning bigger bills Rising living costs are financially, emotionally and physically ""crippling"" people in Northern Ireland, according to a local community worker. The increasing cost of household bills, fuel and childcare, along with the uncertainty and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, have hit many families hard. Low-paid workers, in particular, are facing ""a very bleak winter"", said the manager of Strabane Community Project. ""We're going to see poverty at a whole different level,"" she told BBC News NI. Ursula Doherty runs a number of community projects in Mid Ulster, including a social supermarket which allows people to purchase low-cost surplus food, usually about 70% cheaper than on the high street. Strabane Community Project also facilitates a meals-on-wheels delivery service which provides hot dinners to the elderly and vulnerable, at a reduced cost. But Ms Doherty says that as general life gets more expensive, all the community sector is doing is ""putting a plaster over a massive problem"". ""What we're going to see is hunger - it's desperate,"" she said. ""Food boxes [such as those from food banks] serve no purpose in the long run - they are just sticking plasters. ""The government needs to realise we can't keep giving food boxes when we're not actually dealing with the problems that lead to people needing them. ""Social supermarkets aren't sustainable either, but they help people who need it and teach people to manage their situation a bit better."" Ursula Doherty says ""the whole system needs an overhaul"" to better support people financially and educationally Ms Doherty says there is a change in the sorts of people needing extra support. ""What we are seeing coming through more often is working people who are receiving a salary but can't afford basic items because of their low wages. ""People on multiple benefits are not in poverty. It is people on single benefits, such asuniversal credit, who have taken a cut, and people working in low-paid jobs and those needing to pay for childcare. ""If you are having to pay more for fuel for your house and then fuel for your car to get to work, it's very difficult. It's consumer poverty. ""We need a whole system overhaul. We need more money for education because it is an equaliser. ""People need new skills, they need reskilled in the areas that need more workers, low-paid people need higher wages and there needs to be more affordable childcare options if people are to get out of this."" Why are energy bills going up? One in three NI childcare providers 'plans to raise prices' Ms Doherty is urging politicians ""to wake up and see what's happening out there"". ""The dignity, respect and social justice has been stripped away from people,"" she said. ""The community sector can only do so much and we're close to burnout. Where do we go from here without the right government help? We can't keep giving out, we need to create a more sustainable environment. ""People are pushing rocks up a hill. None of what we're doing is the answer."" FareShare NI's warehouse in Newtownabbey relies on volunteers It is a similarly grim picture at the FareShare Northern Ireland warehouse in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. The Homeless Connect project, which works to alleviate food poverty across Northern Ireland, supplies more than 160 charities with weekly food deliveries, with support from the Department for Communities. It supplies food to homeless hostels, school breakfast clubs, lunch clubs for senior citizens, day centres and community cafÃ©s, and it is desperately seeking volunteers to help the growing number of people in need. ""In 2020-21, we redistributed 800 tonnes of food, the equivalent of 1.9 million meals, which was more than double the year before,"" MÃ©abh Austin, development manager at FareShare Northern Ireland, told BBC News NI. ""We have seen demand for surplus food continue at a similar level this year as the economic impact of the pandemic is felt."" Harpur's Hill Primary School in Coleraine, County Londonderry, is among those to receive support from FareShare. It is in the Cross-Glebe ward, which is in the top 15% of the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland, and 56% of its pupils receive free school meals. ""Many of the children come into school hungry and as a result we run a breakfast club and nurture room,"" said school principal David Radcliffe. ""The extra food we get from FareShare enables us to provide breakfast to those children who come into school hungry."" The school has also started supporting families in need by supplying weekly food parcels. FareShare NI supplies food to groups which work to alleviate food poverty in the local community Like Strabane Community Project volunteers, those at FareShare Northern Ireland are noticing that rising fuel and electricity costs ""have left low income families and people on benefits particularly vulnerable to food insecurity"". Food insecurity is the disruption of food intake or eating patterns due to a lack of money or resources. ""We redistribute good quality, surplus food to charities that turn it into meals,"" said Ms Austin. ""The food we receive from food retailers and producers includes fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products, bread and fresh meat, as well as frozen and tinned items."" Demand is so high that the charity's five vans are on the road Monday to Friday, distributing food across Northern Ireland. ""Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of good food is wasted by the UK food industry every year,"" she said. ""At the same time, millions of people are struggling to afford to eat. ""Our work addresses these two issues by redistributing food industry surplus, which would otherwise go to waste, to the people who need it most."" But these groups cannot continue without more support. If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, help and support can be found atBBC Action Line.

Nearly 40,000 customers were still without electricity in Scotland on Sunday, with large numbers also affected in England and Wales. Police in north east Scotland have declared a major incident and warned disruption could last several days. All schools in Aberdeenshire will remain closed on Monday and Tuesday. Storm Arwen: Thousands across England remain without power Welsh homes still without power after Storm Arwen Driver killed by falling tree in Aberdeenshire during Storm Arwen In some areas hot food and drinks are being supplied to people, many of whom have been without electricity since Friday afternoon. Utility companies said they would be offering accommodation for vulnerable customers. Diesel generators have been distributed to community hospitals and care homes in Aberdeenshire. NHS Grampian confirmed all its Aberdeenshire vaccination centres would be also closed on Monday. Water supplies have also been disrupted as falllen trees damaged equipment. Scottish Water said it had restored supplies to 6,000 properties across the country by Sunday afternoon, but 3,000 were still affected and bottled water was being distributed. Work is continuing to clear roads and railway lines but ScotRail said some services were still suspended. Network Rail said staff were working round the clock to clear fallen trees, such as this one on the Inverness to Aberdeen route A Met Officeyellow ice warning,externalis now in place for many parts of the UK until 10:00 on Monday. In its most recent update Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) - which covers the north of Scotland - said about 32,000 customers were still without supply. SP Energy Networks -  which covers central and southern Scotland - said 6,000 customers were still affected mainly in Dumfries, Fife, the Lothian and the Borders.  The company also had 5,000 customers without power in England and Wales. A picture of a damaged power line taken during a Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks helicopter patrol Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said it had been ""one of the most significant weather events we have experienced in decades"". An SP Energy Networks spokesman said: ""The time it is taking us to get our customers back on is reflective of the number of faults and severity of the damage to the network. ""Where normally we would deal with one or two faults on a line and be able to get a number of customers on we've got several faults on one line and where this is repaired we're only able to restore power to a small handful of customers."" A damaged power line on Craigash Farm, Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire Ch Supt George Macdonald of Police Scotland's north east division confirmed a major incident was declared due to the scale of the power outages and the impact it was having on people. He said: ""It is clear that, despite the best efforts of all involved, some parts of the area could take up to another 36 to 48 hours to recover and get back to normal in terms of power and water supplies, and other essential services. ""Therefore, we will be working hard to get back to normal and officers from Police Scotland are providing additional patrols in areas worst affected."" Ch Supt Macdonald reminded motorists to only travel if it was absolutely necessary and for those who must drive, to take warm clothes, food and water.

We are not as bad as some people."" Meanwhile, tree surgeon Nick Dearden arrived in Kintore from Southampton on Sunday to help with recovery work. He joked: ""We have been told that we expect to see Armageddon."" Over the next week he expects to be kept busy in Aberdeenshire, Inverness and Edinburgh. Charlie Grant told BBC Scotland he has been without power in the village of Killin, Stirling, since about 23:00 on Friday. Mr Grant said: ""We were watching TV and everything just went black dark.

A cafe in Kemnay was inviting locals to call by for a warming drink on the house In the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local cafÃ© took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home. ""The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,"" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83. ""Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us."" The cafÃ© also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a warming drink or a bite to eat. ""There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,"" he added BBC Scotland reporter Steven Duff toldThe Sunday Showproblems with mobile phone coverage have left many people isolated and unable to contact their loved ones. He added: ""There is still a lot of WiFi down, mobile phone coverage is down. Nowadays that's a big thing for people. There's been lots of social media chat of people trying to get in touch with relatives. ""I had one tweet today from someone who said they had finally managed to get in touch with their parents in Ballater this morning to tell them that a care centre had been opened there."" Aberdeenshire Council has urged people to stay at home and keep an eye on vulnerable and elderly neighbours. A spokesman said: ""Alongside our partners we are doing all we can to restore power, provide food and water, and clear debris from our roads and anything else that helps our communities through this challenging weather. ""We would urge people to not travel unless their journey is essential. If you are venturing out please check Travel Scotland, make sure you have enough fuel and your mobile phone is charged fully."" A police van was crushed by a tree in Hatton of Fintray at about 17:45 on Friday, as officers attended a fatal crash Across the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning.

Customers set for third night at snowed-in pub,"The Tan Hill Inn is known for getting cut off in heavy snowfall because of its location Dozens of customers at Britain's highest pub are set to spend a third night trapped by heavy snowfall brought by Storm Arwen. Guests got stuck at the Tan Hill Inn, in the Yorkshire Dales, on Friday after going to watch an Oasis tribute band. They are unable to leave because nearby roads are not useable partly due to fallen power cables. Manager Nicola Townsend said everyone was in good spirits and that some people did not want leave. Guests at the inn, which is 1,732ft (528m) above sea level, woke up to about 3ft (0.9m) of snow on Saturday, with it going all the way up near to the bedroom windows. Guests have been kept entertained with activties including a quiz A tunnel has since been dug out of the front door of the pub, but because of damage to power cables the roads are unusable. Ms Townsend said 61 people had so far spent two nights there, with many, including members of the band, having to set up camp in the pub's lounge. She said 40 were pre-booked guests while others had gone to the pub for a drink on Friday. The listed inn is about five miles from the village of Keld in Swaledale She added: ""It's just been a lovely and everyone is in really good spirits. ""They've formed quite a friendship, like a big family is the best way I can describe it. ""One lady actually said 'I don't want to leave'."" She said staff had put on activities to keep people entertained, including a quiz and board games and that a karaoke evening was planned for later. The manager added that mountain rescuers had made it through the snow to attend to one guest who needed medical attention for an ongoing issue. Mountain rescue have been able to get up to the inn One of the guests, Martin Overton, said the atmosphere was ""very good"" with ""plenty of beer available"". His wife Stephanie added: ""I'm quite chilled about being stranded, it's quite exciting but we're missing our son who is with his nana. I am wondering how long we will be here for though.""

Thousands facing third night without power,"A welfare facility serves hot food and drinks to residents affected by the power cuts in Kirriemuir, Angus Thousands of people have spent a third night without power after Storm Arwen left a trail of damage in its wake. Nearly 40,000 customers were still without electricity in Scotland on Sunday, with large numbers also affected in England and Wales. Police in north east Scotland have declared a major incident and warned disruption could last several days. All schools in Aberdeenshire will remain closed on Monday and Tuesday. Storm Arwen: Thousands across England remain without power Welsh homes still without power after Storm Arwen Driver killed by falling tree in Aberdeenshire during Storm Arwen In some areas hot food and drinks are being supplied to people, many of whom have been without electricity since Friday afternoon. Utility companies said they would be offering accommodation for vulnerable customers. Diesel generators have been distributed to community hospitals and care homes in Aberdeenshire. NHS Grampian confirmed all its Aberdeenshire vaccination centres would be also closed on Monday. Water supplies have also been disrupted as falllen trees damaged equipment. Scottish Water said it had restored supplies to 6,000 properties across the country by Sunday afternoon, but 3,000 were still affected and bottled water was being distributed. Work is continuing to clear roads and railway lines but ScotRail said some services were still suspended. Network Rail said staff were working round the clock to clear fallen trees, such as this one on the Inverness to Aberdeen route A Met Officeyellow ice warning,externalis now in place for many parts of the UK until 10:00 on Monday. In its most recent update Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) - which covers the north of Scotland - said about 32,000 customers were still without supply. SP Energy Networks -  which covers central and southern Scotland - said 6,000 customers were still affected mainly in Dumfries, Fife, the Lothian and the Borders.  The company also had 5,000 customers without power in England and Wales. A picture of a damaged power line taken during a Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks helicopter patrol Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said it had been ""one of the most significant weather events we have experienced in decades"". An SP Energy Networks spokesman said: ""The time it is taking us to get our customers back on is reflective of the number of faults and severity of the damage to the network. ""Where normally we would deal with one or two faults on a line and be able to get a number of customers on we've got several faults on one line and where this is repaired we're only able to restore power to a small handful of customers."" A damaged power line on Craigash Farm, Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire Ch Supt George Macdonald of Police Scotland's north east division confirmed a major incident was declared due to the scale of the power outages and the impact it was having on people. He said: ""It is clear that, despite the best efforts of all involved, some parts of the area could take up to another 36 to 48 hours to recover and get back to normal in terms of power and water supplies, and other essential services. ""Therefore, we will be working hard to get back to normal and officers from Police Scotland are providing additional patrols in areas worst affected."" Ch Supt Macdonald reminded motorists to only travel if it was absolutely necessary and for those who must drive, to take warm clothes, food and water. Angus Cameron is keeping warm by visiting a burger van in Kintore Angus Cameron has been without power since fallen trees took down power cables beside his house in Kintore, Aberdeenshire. He told BBC Scotland: ""I don't know if we will be getting power any time soon."" Asked how he is keeping warm, Mr Cameron said: ""We are coming to the burger van to get some hot food and, fortunately, we have have electric generator which we are away to switch on and get some heat. We are not as bad as some people."" Meanwhile, tree surgeon Nick Dearden arrived in Kintore from Southampton on Sunday to help with recovery work. He joked: ""We have been told that we expect to see Armageddon."" Over the next week he expects to be kept busy in Aberdeenshire, Inverness and Edinburgh. Charlie Grant told BBC Scotland he has been without power in the village of Killin, Stirling, since about 23:00 on Friday. Mr Grant said: ""We were watching TV and everything just went black dark. ""We looked out the window and the street lights were out. ""It was not just us, it was everywhere."" Mr Grant, who has relied on his barbeque for cooking, praised the community spirit since the storm hit and said everyone has been looking out for the most vulnerable. A cafe in Kemnay was inviting locals to call by for a warming drink on the house In the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local cafÃ© took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home. ""The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,"" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83. ""Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us."" The cafÃ© also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a warming drink or a bite to eat. ""There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,"" he added BBC Scotland reporter Steven Duff toldThe Sunday Showproblems with mobile phone coverage have left many people isolated and unable to contact their loved ones. He added: ""There is still a lot of WiFi down, mobile phone coverage is down. Nowadays that's a big thing for people. There's been lots of social media chat of people trying to get in touch with relatives. ""I had one tweet today from someone who said they had finally managed to get in touch with their parents in Ballater this morning to tell them that a care centre had been opened there."" Aberdeenshire Council has urged people to stay at home and keep an eye on vulnerable and elderly neighbours. A spokesman said: ""Alongside our partners we are doing all we can to restore power, provide food and water, and clear debris from our roads and anything else that helps our communities through this challenging weather. ""We would urge people to not travel unless their journey is essential. If you are venturing out please check Travel Scotland, make sure you have enough fuel and your mobile phone is charged fully."" A police van was crushed by a tree in Hatton of Fintray at about 17:45 on Friday, as officers attended a fatal crash Across the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. The 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire, while head teacher Francis Lagan diedin Antrimand another man was killed in Cumbria.

Thousands still without power after Storm Arwen,"Fallen trees and debris like this in Wrexham have affected power and roads and rail services since Saturday Thousands of people in Wales are still without electricity after Storm Arwen. SP Energy Networks, which supplies north Wales and parts of Powys, Ceredigion, and across the English border in north Shropshire, said 9,000 customers remained without power. SP Energy added the ""very severe"" damage caused to its network was the most widespread since 2015. Worst affected is along the Dee Valley, where some people have been without electricity for more than 30 hours. Transport for Wales is running a""limited train service"",externalwith lines reopened following storm disruption. More than 30,000 household were without power in Wales at one point on Saturday morning.

Andrew Thomas, from Penrhiwgoch in Carmarthenshire, has had to send his wife and baby to her parents to get food and warmth as they have been without power since 13:00 on Friday. After 36 hours without power Andrew expects he will have to throw out all of the food in his fridge and freezer ""It's a worry with a little one because we've got no electric and its been such a long time,"" said Mr Thomas. ""We can't have a shower, we've got no heating, we can't wash clothes for the little ones going to school or anything, we can't make food. ""We can't even make a cup of tea, the simple things in life have been taken away from us."" Many of the worst affected areas for electricity are in parts of rural Carmarthenshire and near the Ceredigion coast. This video can not be played One woman had a lucky escape, narrowly avoiding a falling tree In Llandovery, nearly 100 customers who have been without power since early on Saturday morning have been told that repairs may be completed by 18:00 on Sunday. Dozens of homes and businesses are still without power in Aberporth, Ceredigion, where wind gusts of 81mph (130km/h) were recorded in the early hours of Saturday. Thousands of people across Englandremain without power and transport networks continue to suffer disruption. Transport for Wales suspended the majority of its rail services on Saturday, and major roads were also blocked due to fallen trees and debris. SP Energy say damage in many different locations meant it was more difficult to restore power SP Energy said there were about 400 staff members and contractors out working on Sunday evening trying to restore power to homes. ""The damage to the network was very severe, the wind speeds were often in excess of 80mph, which has blown a lot of debris and trees onto our network,"" said Liam O'Sullivan, of SP Energy. ""The last time we saw damage of this magnitude was in 2015 - normally when there's damage to our network it's in a single location, which we can repair and restore all of the customers. ""But after this storm we've had to make multiple repairs just to restore a small amount of customers in some circumstances. ""We're looking now at having a small number of customers off until the early parts of Monday and Tuesday next week, but we're working hard to get everyone back on as soon as possible."" Earlier on Sunday, an SP Energy spokesman said it would offer ""accommodation to vulnerable customers tonight if they are likely to be off supply"". He said Storm Arwen had ""caused some of the worst damage to our network we have experienced in many years"". ""Engineers are also dealing with impacted road networks making access to some of our repairs even harder,"" he said. ""We're in in touch with our vulnerable customers throughout the day, keeping them updated with our progress, organising hot food and drinks and other welfare services for them as needed. ""We are also offering our customers reimbursement for hot food if they continue to be off supply."" SP Energy said its crews were busy until 23:30 on Saturday and work resumed at 06:00 on Sunday when 11,000 customers were without supply. Are you in an area affected by Storm Arwen?

Swiss back Covid vaccine pass as cases surgeSunday's referendum is held in a country with one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe.,"Anti-vaccination protesters have taken to the streets of Bern ahead of the vote Swiss voters have backed the government's measures to tackle Covid, according to preliminary results. More than 60% opposed moves to remove some restrictions, including the Covid vaccination pass. Sunday's referendum came after organisers said the pass was an unnecessary restriction of freedoms. With just under two-thirds of the population fully vaccinated, the Swiss have one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe. Now, Covid-19 infections are rising exponentially, with case numbers up by 40-50% each week. From the start of the pandemic the Swiss government has performed a tricky balancing act, trying to introduce measures to control the spread of Covid while still staying true to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, in which the government has little formal power and the people have the final say. Yes-campaign posters urge the Swiss not to forget to vote to back the Covid law Switzerland's lockdowns were never as strict as its neighbours'. People were allowed outside for exercise whenever they wanted and the schools only closed for a few weeks. But last summer, with cases falling dramatically, Switzerland didn't have a celebratory, UK-style ""freedom"" day either. Instead, a Covid certificate was introduced with proof of vaccination, negative test, or immunity through having had the virus. In September it became obligatory in order to enter bars, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sporting events, and face-to-face university classes. But not everyone agrees. Vaccination has long been a sensitive issue here, especially in German-speaking Switzerland. A belief that natural immunity is best led to a drop in childhood measles vaccinations that sparked a surge in measles cases across Europe. Meanwhile, in the alpine communities, a historic pride in their own independence rooted, some say, in the time when the mountain villages were cut off from the world each winter, means there is resistance to the government issuing orders. And so, when the certificate was introduced and Covid tests stopped being free, life for the unvaccinated became difficult and even going out for a beer was suddenly expensive. The government hoped the measures would encourage people to get vaccinated. Instead, many took to the streets and others gathered enough signatures to challenge the Covid certificate in Sunday's referendum. No campaigners this week urged voters to reject the Covid laws For weeks there have been demonstrations. Some have turned violent, with police using water cannons and rubber bullets against protesters trying to storm parliament. At a rally in Bern this month, thousands turned out to hear speakers, including renowned anti-vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr, who hailed Switzerland as Europe's last great hope against what he claimed were sinister powers forcing people to get vaccinated, while at the same time, via the Covid certificate, introducing a draconian mass surveillance system. Robert F Kennedy Jr has called on voters to challenge the Swiss anti-Covid measures The crowd, huddled together, all mask-less, roared their approval. Some wore the insignia of the far right, others the far left. Health minister Alain Berset was depicted, complete with red horns, as the devil. How fast is worldwide progress? Among the crowds was part-time student Manuela. She refuses to get vaccinated because, she says, she is ""a healthy young woman"" for whom getting the virus poses little risk. In fact, the World Health Organization advises that, while young people are less likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19,they are still susceptible to infection,external, and with it the risk of serious and long term health consequences. And so, for fear of increasing opposition to the Covid certificate, the health minister was loath to introduce any new restrictions ahead of Sunday's crucial vote. Alain Berset and his science taskforce are convinced Switzerland needs infection control measures during this increasingly bleak Covid winter. Abolishing the certificate, they believe, could be a huge risk, especially as booster vaccinations have scarcely begun. Instead, as cases rise, the government has advised hospitals to increase their intensive care capacity. This has brought a bitter laugh from Switzerland's nurses, who point out that extra beds won't help when there aren't enough staff to look after the patients in them. It's estimated 10% of Swiss nurses and care workers have left the profession since the start of the pandemic. ""Everywhere we have too few staff,"" says MichÃ¨le Giroud, a nurse who's also president of the Swiss Federation of Nurse Anaesthetists. ""We are constantly working without breaks, doing overtime, extra shifts. A third of us have burn-out symptoms: anxiety or insomnia."" But unlike in other European countries going through similar health sector shortages, Swiss nurses have the power to change things. They have gathered the signatures for a nationwide referendum demanding more investment and better working conditions. On Sunday, Swiss voters backed them. So now the health minister will return to the grim business of counting the rising Covid cases, and he is likely to start thinking about what new restrictions might be necessary. He may also have to count out around CHF8bn (Â£6bn) for Switzerland's nurses. But the anger, fear and social division born of the pandemic cannot be solved by a referendum or two, and the demonstrations are sure to continue, in Switzerland and across Europe.

"Formula 1 legend Sir Frank Williams diesWilliams Racing team founder and former team principal Sir Frank Williams dies, aged 79.BBC SportComments","Williams and his daughter Claire were well respected figures in the paddock Sir Frank Williams, founder and former team principal of the Williams Racing Formula 1 team, has died aged 79. He built the team named after him into one of the most successful in the sport. During his time with Williams, the team won nine constructors' championships and seven drivers' titles, and dominated much of the 1980s and 1990s. He and daughter Claire moved away from the sport in September 2020 after selling Williams to US investors. In a statement, the Williams team said: ""It is with great sadness that on behalf of the Williams family, the team can confirm the death of Sir Frank Williams CBE, founder and former team principal of Williams Racing, at the age of 79. ""After being admitted into hospital on Friday, Sir Frank passed away peacefully this morning surrounded by his family. ""Today we pay tribute to our much loved and inspirational figurehead. Frank will be sorely missed. We request that all friends and colleagues respect the Williams family's wishes for privacy at this time."" Obituary: 'An F1 icon and one of the greatest team owners' Williams was a wheelchair user after suffering a spinal cord injury in a car crash in France in 1986. F1 president and chief executive Stefano Domenicali paid tribute to Williams, whom he described as ""a true giant of our sport"". Domenicali added: ""He overcame the most difficult of challenges in life and battled every day to win on and off the track. We have lost a much loved and respected member of the F1 family and he will be hugely missed. ""His incredible achievements and personality will be etched on our sport forever. My thoughts are with all the Williams family and friends at this sad time."" The Williams team enjoyed their first F1 race win at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone with Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni at the wheel, and the following year Australian Alan Jones steered the team to the drivers' and constructors' titles for the first time. In 1994, Williams, along with technical director Patrick Head and chief designer Adrian Newey, was charged with manslaughter in Italy following the death of driver Ayrton Senna in a crash at Imola but he was acquitted several years later. The team have not won a title since Canadian Jacques Villeneuve's 1997 drivers' triumph, and there was an eight-year gap between Juan Pablo Montoya's victory in a Williams-BMW at the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix and the shock win for Pastor Maldonado in Spain in 2012 - the last time a Williams took the chequered flag.

Damon Hill, who won the world title with the team in 1996, said Williams had played an integral part in the history of the sport. ""Frank had a passion for cars, for racing. There was nothing else he was really interested in doing,"" Hill told Sky Sports News. ""He was just remarkable in every respect and in his dedication to the team. His record will stand for a very long time. ""The only person I could compare him to is Enzo Ferrari. He loved Formula 1 and he loved racing. Anyone who runs a team would like to aspire to his achievements and to his record. ""He was a man of few words. He could speak many languages but he didn't really engage in idle gossip. He's a huge part of the history of the sport."" Current Williams drivers George Russell and Nicholas Latifi also paid their respects to the former team principal. ""Sir Frank was such a genuinely wonderful human being and I'll always remember the laughs we shared,"" said Russell. ""He was more than a boss, he was a mentor and a friend to everybody who joined the Williams Racing family and so many others."" Canadian Latifi added: ""RIP Sir Frank Williams. Such sad news. A huge loss for our sport and our team. ""It's been an honour to represent your name on the world stage and we will continue to push hard to take the team back up the grid."" Chief F1 writer Andrew Benson Sir Frank Williams was one of the greatest Formula 1 team owners in history and a man who became an icon through his determination to compete at the highest level despite a severe disability. Williams did not so much love F1 as was consumed by it. Although his health prevented his active involvement in the team for the last few years, he literally lived in the factory. The team he set up was his life - as it always had been. Read more here.

Jorginho earns Chelsea draw with Man Utd,"Sancho pounced on a sloppy Jorginho touch and calmly slotted past Edouard Mendy to put United ahead Manchester United prepared for the arrival of interim manager Ralf Rangnick by earning a battling point against Premier League leaders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. United, under the caretaker charge of Michael Carrick with Rangnick's appointment expected to be confirmed imminently, kept Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench and mounted a largely rearguard action until Jadon Sancho hit Chelsea on the break five minutes after half-time. Sancho pounced on poor control from Jorginho to race clear and beat Edouard Mendy with a composed finish after the hosts had dominated possession. Chelsea were stung into action and Jorginho made amends for his error when he equalised from the spot in the 69th minute after Aaron Wan-Bissaka fouled Thiago Silva. United survived in relative comfort apart from a big late chance for Antonio Rudiger and will regard this as a welcome point in tough territory after a succession of Premier League horror shows led to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking. Reaction to Chelsea v Man United This video can not be played Chelsea 1-1 Man Utd: Carrick says Ralf Rangnick had no involvement in team's tactics Carrick went with solidity for his first Premier League team selection after United's recent maulings by Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City and - finally for Solskjaer - Watford. He bolstered midfield by utilising Fred, Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic to hold Chelsea at bay and, while David de Gea was busy in the first half, there was never a feeling of siege as United dug deep to come away with a point. The big call was keeping Ronaldo on the bench. He was introduced in the 64th minute with United leading 1-0, but had minimal impact and was straight off down the tunnel when the final whistle sounded. Asked if Rangnick had played a part in Ronaldo being on the bench, Carrick replied: ""No, that's not the case."" United at least showed the determination and resilience that had so often been glaringly absent in the dying embers of Solskjaer's reign although there was very little attacking intent or quality apart from the great composure shown by Sancho for his second successive goal. It will do him the world of good as he seeks to establish himself following his Â£73m summer move from Borussia Dortmund. As for Carrick, if this is his final game in charge before Rangnick comes to Old Trafford, he can be well satisfied with his brief stint at the helm, winning against Villarreal in the Champions League and getting a share of the spoils here against a Chelsea side who have looked increasingly formidable in recent weeks. It is a platform of sorts for Rangnick to begin his work and United will hope to continue their recovery against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Thursday. On the equalising goal, Carrick said: ""I don't think it was a penalty at all. They have had a lot of shots. David had two saves, which we knew before the game he would have to make one or two. Other than that I have felt quite comfortable in the game. ""To come away disappointed and to feel like you have left something out there is a positive."" This video can not be played Chelsea have to swallow Man Utd draw - Tuchel Rudiger summed up Chelsea's disappointment as he slumped to the turf at the final whistle knowing he could have been the match-winner. The German defender saw a thunderous shot touched on to the crossbar by De Gea in the first half, but the big opportunity came with virtually the last kick of the game. He was unmarked at the far post to meet Christian Pulisic's cross but took the instant volley and lashed his finish high over the top. Manager Thomas Tuchel was equally agonised as he will know Chelsea did not take advantage of their overwhelming domination in parts of a game where they had 24 attempts on goal compared to United's three. Chelsea's work was too hurried as they chased the winner although they were also frustrated by a United defence without suspended captain Harry Maguire. Timo Werner is still too wayward, sending a very presentable chance well wide in the second half, but at least they have Romelu Lukaku fit again and Pulisic looked a lively threat when he came on. This, in some ways, resembled many of Chelsea's performances last season when they were superior, but never made the most of that advantage. Tuchel will certainly feel his side let United off the hook. The Blues remain top but in what looks like it will be a tight title race between Tuchel's side, Manchester City and Liverpool, they will regard this as two points dropped. ""It's hard to imagine this as a match where you can lose or drop points, because we were the better team who set the rhythm and intensity. ""We're disappointed but we have no regrets, this can happen in football. I just told the team I'm happy with our performance and the way we played.""

Swiss back Covid vaccine pass as cases surge,"Anti-vaccination protesters have taken to the streets of Bern ahead of the vote Swiss voters have backed the government's measures to tackle Covid, according to preliminary results. More than 60% opposed moves to remove some restrictions, including the Covid vaccination pass. Sunday's referendum came after organisers said the pass was an unnecessary restriction of freedoms. With just under two-thirds of the population fully vaccinated, the Swiss have one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe. Now, Covid-19 infections are rising exponentially, with case numbers up by 40-50% each week. From the start of the pandemic the Swiss government has performed a tricky balancing act, trying to introduce measures to control the spread of Covid while still staying true to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, in which the government has little formal power and the people have the final say. Yes-campaign posters urge the Swiss not to forget to vote to back the Covid law Switzerland's lockdowns were never as strict as its neighbours'. People were allowed outside for exercise whenever they wanted and the schools only closed for a few weeks. But last summer, with cases falling dramatically, Switzerland didn't have a celebratory, UK-style ""freedom"" day either. Instead, a Covid certificate was introduced with proof of vaccination, negative test, or immunity through having had the virus. In September it became obligatory in order to enter bars, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sporting events, and face-to-face university classes. But not everyone agrees. Vaccination has long been a sensitive issue here, especially in German-speaking Switzerland. A belief that natural immunity is best led to a drop in childhood measles vaccinations that sparked a surge in measles cases across Europe. Meanwhile, in the alpine communities, a historic pride in their own independence rooted, some say, in the time when the mountain villages were cut off from the world each winter, means there is resistance to the government issuing orders. And so, when the certificate was introduced and Covid tests stopped being free, life for the unvaccinated became difficult and even going out for a beer was suddenly expensive. The government hoped the measures would encourage people to get vaccinated. Instead, many took to the streets and others gathered enough signatures to challenge the Covid certificate in Sunday's referendum. No campaigners this week urged voters to reject the Covid laws For weeks there have been demonstrations. Some have turned violent, with police using water cannons and rubber bullets against protesters trying to storm parliament. At a rally in Bern this month, thousands turned out to hear speakers, including renowned anti-vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr, who hailed Switzerland as Europe's last great hope against what he claimed were sinister powers forcing people to get vaccinated, while at the same time, via the Covid certificate, introducing a draconian mass surveillance system. Robert F Kennedy Jr has called on voters to challenge the Swiss anti-Covid measures The crowd, huddled together, all mask-less, roared their approval. Some wore the insignia of the far right, others the far left. Health minister Alain Berset was depicted, complete with red horns, as the devil. How fast is worldwide progress? Among the crowds was part-time student Manuela. She refuses to get vaccinated because, she says, she is ""a healthy young woman"" for whom getting the virus poses little risk. In fact, the World Health Organization advises that, while young people are less likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19,they are still susceptible to infection,external, and with it the risk of serious and long term health consequences. And so, for fear of increasing opposition to the Covid certificate, the health minister was loath to introduce any new restrictions ahead of Sunday's crucial vote. Alain Berset and his science taskforce are convinced Switzerland needs infection control measures during this increasingly bleak Covid winter. Abolishing the certificate, they believe, could be a huge risk, especially as booster vaccinations have scarcely begun. Instead, as cases rise, the government has advised hospitals to increase their intensive care capacity. This has brought a bitter laugh from Switzerland's nurses, who point out that extra beds won't help when there aren't enough staff to look after the patients in them. It's estimated 10% of Swiss nurses and care workers have left the profession since the start of the pandemic. ""Everywhere we have too few staff,"" says MichÃ¨le Giroud, a nurse who's also president of the Swiss Federation of Nurse Anaesthetists. ""We are constantly working without breaks, doing overtime, extra shifts. A third of us have burn-out symptoms: anxiety or insomnia."" But unlike in other European countries going through similar health sector shortages, Swiss nurses have the power to change things. They have gathered the signatures for a nationwide referendum demanding more investment and better working conditions. On Sunday, Swiss voters backed them. So now the health minister will return to the grim business of counting the rising Covid cases, and he is likely to start thinking about what new restrictions might be necessary. He may also have to count out around CHF8bn (Â£6bn) for Switzerland's nurses. But the anger, fear and social division born of the pandemic cannot be solved by a referendum or two, and the demonstrations are sure to continue, in Switzerland and across Europe.

Thousands remain without power after Storm Arwen,"A welfare facility serves hot food and drinks to residents affected by the power cuts in Kirriemuir, Angus Thousands of people have spent a third night without power after Storm Arwen left a trail of damage in its wake. Nearly 40,000 customers were still without electricity in Scotland on Sunday, with large numbers also affected in England and Wales. Police in north east Scotland have declared a major incident and warned disruption could last several days. All schools in Aberdeenshire will remain closed on Monday and Tuesday. Storm Arwen: Thousands across England remain without power Welsh homes still without power after Storm Arwen Driver killed by falling tree in Aberdeenshire during Storm Arwen In some areas hot food and drinks are being supplied to people, many of whom have been without electricity since Friday afternoon. Utility companies said they would be offering accommodation for vulnerable customers. Diesel generators have been distributed to community hospitals and care homes in Aberdeenshire. NHS Grampian confirmed all its Aberdeenshire vaccination centres would be also closed on Monday. Water supplies have also been disrupted as falllen trees damaged equipment. Scottish Water said it had restored supplies to 6,000 properties across the country by Sunday afternoon, but 3,000 were still affected and bottled water was being distributed. Work is continuing to clear roads and railway lines but ScotRail said some services were still suspended. Network Rail said staff were working round the clock to clear fallen trees, such as this one on the Inverness to Aberdeen route A Met Officeyellow ice warning,externalis now in place for many parts of the UK until 10:00 on Monday. In its most recent update Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) - which covers the north of Scotland - said about 32,000 customers were still without supply. SP Energy Networks -  which covers central and southern Scotland - said 6,000 customers were still affected mainly in Dumfries, Fife, the Lothian and the Borders.  The company also had 5,000 customers without power in England and Wales. A picture of a damaged power line taken during a Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks helicopter patrol Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said it had been ""one of the most significant weather events we have experienced in decades"". An SP Energy Networks spokesman said: ""The time it is taking us to get our customers back on is reflective of the number of faults and severity of the damage to the network. ""Where normally we would deal with one or two faults on a line and be able to get a number of customers on we've got several faults on one line and where this is repaired we're only able to restore power to a small handful of customers."" A damaged power line on Craigash Farm, Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire Ch Supt George Macdonald of Police Scotland's north east division confirmed a major incident was declared due to the scale of the power outages and the impact it was having on people. He said: ""It is clear that, despite the best efforts of all involved, some parts of the area could take up to another 36 to 48 hours to recover and get back to normal in terms of power and water supplies, and other essential services. ""Therefore, we will be working hard to get back to normal and officers from Police Scotland are providing additional patrols in areas worst affected."" Ch Supt Macdonald reminded motorists to only travel if it was absolutely necessary and for those who must drive, to take warm clothes, food and water. Angus Cameron is keeping warm by visiting a burger van in Kintore Angus Cameron has been without power since fallen trees took down power cables beside his house in Kintore, Aberdeenshire. He told BBC Scotland: ""I don't know if we will be getting power any time soon."" Asked how he is keeping warm, Mr Cameron said: ""We are coming to the burger van to get some hot food and, fortunately, we have have electric generator which we are away to switch on and get some heat. We are not as bad as some people."" Meanwhile, tree surgeon Nick Dearden arrived in Kintore from Southampton on Sunday to help with recovery work. He joked: ""We have been told that we expect to see Armageddon."" Over the next week he expects to be kept busy in Aberdeenshire, Inverness and Edinburgh. Charlie Grant told BBC Scotland he has been without power in the village of Killin, Stirling, since about 23:00 on Friday. Mr Grant said: ""We were watching TV and everything just went black dark. ""We looked out the window and the street lights were out. ""It was not just us, it was everywhere."" Mr Grant, who has relied on his barbeque for cooking, praised the community spirit since the storm hit and said everyone has been looking out for the most vulnerable. A cafe in Kemnay was inviting locals to call by for a warming drink on the house In the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local cafÃ© took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home. ""The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,"" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83. ""Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us."" The cafÃ© also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a warming drink or a bite to eat. ""There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,"" he added BBC Scotland reporter Steven Duff toldThe Sunday Showproblems with mobile phone coverage have left many people isolated and unable to contact their loved ones. He added: ""There is still a lot of WiFi down, mobile phone coverage is down. Nowadays that's a big thing for people. There's been lots of social media chat of people trying to get in touch with relatives. ""I had one tweet today from someone who said they had finally managed to get in touch with their parents in Ballater this morning to tell them that a care centre had been opened there."" Aberdeenshire Council has urged people to stay at home and keep an eye on vulnerable and elderly neighbours. A spokesman said: ""Alongside our partners we are doing all we can to restore power, provide food and water, and clear debris from our roads and anything else that helps our communities through this challenging weather. ""We would urge people to not travel unless their journey is essential. If you are venturing out please check Travel Scotland, make sure you have enough fuel and your mobile phone is charged fully."" A police van was crushed by a tree in Hatton of Fintray at about 17:45 on Friday, as officers attended a fatal crash Across the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. The 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire, while head teacher Francis Lagan diedin Antrimand another man was killed in Cumbria.

Customers spend second night snowed-in at pub,"The Tan Hill Inn is known for getting cut off in heavy snowfall because of its location Dozens of customers at Britain's highest pub are set to spend a third night trapped by heavy snowfall brought by Storm Arwen. Guests got stuck at the Tan Hill Inn, in the Yorkshire Dales, on Friday after going to watch an Oasis tribute band. They are unable to leave because nearby roads are not useable partly due to fallen power cables. Manager Nicola Townsend said everyone was in good spirits and that some people did not want leave. Guests at the inn, which is 1,732ft (528m) above sea level, woke up to about 3ft (0.9m) of snow on Saturday, with it going all the way up near to the bedroom windows. Guests have been kept entertained with activties including a quiz A tunnel has since been dug out of the front door of the pub, but because of damage to power cables the roads are unusable. Ms Townsend said 61 people had so far spent two nights there, with many, including members of the band, having to set up camp in the pub's lounge. She said 40 were pre-booked guests while others had gone to the pub for a drink on Friday. The listed inn is about five miles from the village of Keld in Swaledale She added: ""It's just been a lovely and everyone is in really good spirits. ""They've formed quite a friendship, like a big family is the best way I can describe it. ""One lady actually said 'I don't want to leave'."" She said staff had put on activities to keep people entertained, including a quiz and board games and that a karaoke evening was planned for later. The manager added that mountain rescuers had made it through the snow to attend to one guest who needed medical attention for an ongoing issue. Mountain rescue have been able to get up to the inn One of the guests, Martin Overton, said the atmosphere was ""very good"" with ""plenty of beer available"". His wife Stephanie added: ""I'm quite chilled about being stranded, it's quite exciting but we're missing our son who is with his nana. I am wondering how long we will be here for though."" Elsewhere in North Yorkshire, the after-effects of the severe weather have continued to cause disruption. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said they had been called to fallen power cables, in places including Hunmanby, Kilburn and High Birstwith. Severe weather warnings for snow and ice remain in place There have been dozens of power cuts leaving hundreds of residents without power and most trains between York and Scotland have been cancelled as the the East Coast Mainline is closed between Newcastle and Edinburgh. North Yorkshire County Council said staff together with emergency and utilities services continued to work together to deal with the aftermath of the storm. A spokesperson said services were carrying out checks on people who may need extra help, particularly in areas affected by power outages.

Lack of action will see more Channel deaths - Patel,"Home Secretary Priti Patel has warned that failure by European politicians to co-operate on the continent's migrant crisis will lead to ""even worse scenes"" in the English Channel this winter. France is hosting German, Belgian and Dutch ministers and European Commission officials for talks. Ms Patel was disinvited from the summit after a row between Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron. Labour accused them of ""engaging in a blame game while children drown"". On Wednesday,27 people died as they headed for the UK from France.Their boat sank in the Channel. The International Organization for Migrations said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014. Their deaths have raised questions about why so many people are attempting the journey despite the dangerous conditions, and how to tackle the problem. The home secretary vowed to ""continue to push"" for improvements to tackle the crisis. And Ms Patel said she would be holding ""urgent talks with my European counterparts"" later this week ""to prevent further tragedies in the Channel"". On Sunday, she spoke to the Dutch minister for migration, Ankie Broekers-Knol. The Home Office said the pair agreed on the need to tackle the criminal gangs organising the crossings and on the importance of agreements for returning migrants to European countries. Channel deaths: What do we know so far? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Calais activists: Migrants call us from boats asking for help On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson publicly shared a letter he had sent to the French president on how to deal with the current situation. In it he set out five steps - joint patrols of the Channel, better use of technology such as sensors and radar, maritime patrols in each other's waters, stronger co-operation by intelligence services and negotiation on a policy of returning migrants who reach the UK to France This letter angered Mr Macron and according to the French government, it demonstrated ""double talk"" from the UK. This resentment from Paris led to the home secretary's invitation being revoked. However the UK government said that even if the home secretary did not attend Sunday's meeting in Calais, British officials would be there. In light of the Franco-British tensions, Ms Patel said: ""The UK cannot tackle this issue alone, and across Europe we all need to step up, take responsibility, and work together in a time of crisis."" She added: ""We will not shy away from the challenge we face, and next week I will continue to push for greater co-operation with European partners because a failure to do so could result in even worse scenes in the freezing water during the coming winter months."" Ms Patel said the conversations she had had on Thursday with her French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, had been ""constructive"". Speaking to Sky News, Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said it was ""unconscionable"" that France and the UK government were ""engaging in a blame game while children drown off our coastline"". She said her party would work with international partners to ""open up safe and legal routes"" for refugees in order ""to pull the rug out from under the business model that these smugglers currently rely on"". For several years, people smugglers have sent migrants to the UK in lorries. Although this route is safer than small boats, there have also been tragedies, including the 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in 2019. However, the security at the Port of Calais in France - where UK border controls operate - has been tightened. This has meant that more attempts are being made to send people by boat, according to Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force. So far this year, the number of people crossing the channel in small boats has far exceeded previous years. Asylum claims to UKare at their highest since 2004,according to official estimates. However, other countries in Europe are also processing a high amount of asylum applications. Many people fleeing conflict zones already choose to make an asylum claim in the first country they arrive in - such as Greece, Turkey or Italy - and only a minority choose to travel on to the UK. Last year, Germany had the highest number of asylum applicants in the EU (122,015 applicants), while France had 93,475 applicants. In the same period, the UK received the fifth largest number of applicants (36,041) when compared with countries in the EU (around 7% of the total). This represents the 17th largest intake when measured per head of population, according to UN Refugee Agency.

Homes still without power after Storm Arwen damage,"Fallen trees and debris like this in Wrexham have affected power and roads and rail services since Saturday Thousands of people in Wales are still without electricity after Storm Arwen. SP Energy Networks, which supplies north Wales and parts of Powys, Ceredigion, and across the English border in north Shropshire, said 9,000 customers remained without power. SP Energy added the ""very severe"" damage caused to its network was the most widespread since 2015. Worst affected is along the Dee Valley, where some people have been without electricity for more than 30 hours. Transport for Wales is running a""limited train service"",externalwith lines reopened following storm disruption. More than 30,000 household were without power in Wales at one point on Saturday morning.

Andrew Thomas, from Penrhiwgoch in Carmarthenshire, has had to send his wife and baby to her parents to get food and warmth as they have been without power since 13:00 on Friday. After 36 hours without power Andrew expects he will have to throw out all of the food in his fridge and freezer ""It's a worry with a little one because we've got no electric and its been such a long time,"" said Mr Thomas. ""We can't have a shower, we've got no heating, we can't wash clothes for the little ones going to school or anything, we can't make food. ""We can't even make a cup of tea, the simple things in life have been taken away from us."" Many of the worst affected areas for electricity are in parts of rural Carmarthenshire and near the Ceredigion coast. This video can not be played One woman had a lucky escape, narrowly avoiding a falling tree In Llandovery, nearly 100 customers who have been without power since early on Saturday morning have been told that repairs may be completed by 18:00 on Sunday. Dozens of homes and businesses are still without power in Aberporth, Ceredigion, where wind gusts of 81mph (130km/h) were recorded in the early hours of Saturday. Thousands of people across Englandremain without power and transport networks continue to suffer disruption. Transport for Wales suspended the majority of its rail services on Saturday, and major roads were also blocked due to fallen trees and debris. SP Energy say damage in many different locations meant it was more difficult to restore power SP Energy said there were about 400 staff members and contractors out working on Sunday evening trying to restore power to homes. ""The damage to the network was very severe, the wind speeds were often in excess of 80mph, which has blown a lot of debris and trees onto our network,"" said Liam O'Sullivan, of SP Energy. ""The last time we saw damage of this magnitude was in 2015 - normally when there's damage to our network it's in a single location, which we can repair and restore all of the customers. ""But after this storm we've had to make multiple repairs just to restore a small amount of customers in some circumstances. ""We're looking now at having a small number of customers off until the early parts of Monday and Tuesday next week, but we're working hard to get everyone back on as soon as possible."" Earlier on Sunday, an SP Energy spokesman said it would offer ""accommodation to vulnerable customers tonight if they are likely to be off supply"". He said Storm Arwen had ""caused some of the worst damage to our network we have experienced in many years"". ""Engineers are also dealing with impacted road networks making access to some of our repairs even harder,"" he said. ""We're in in touch with our vulnerable customers throughout the day, keeping them updated with our progress, organising hot food and drinks and other welfare services for them as needed. ""We are also offering our customers reimbursement for hot food if they continue to be off supply."" SP Energy said its crews were busy until 23:30 on Saturday and work resumed at 06:00 on Sunday when 11,000 customers were without supply. Are you in an area affected by Storm Arwen?

Cardiff Airport would not be alive without bailout,"Cardiff Airport was bought by the Welsh Government in 2013 Cardiff Airport would not have stayed alive without an Â£85m bailout from the Welsh government during Covid, its boss says. Chief executive Spencer Birns said despite a slow recovery, it could ""provide the economic value back to Wales"". But the Welsh Conservatives said the Welsh government should sell it. The Welsh government said it was committed to the airport because of the benefits it brings the Welsh economy. More public money for Covid-hit Cardiff Airport Cardiff Airport passenger numbers drop to 1950s levels Mr Birns said the the bailout had ""given us the framework to stay alive"". ""They've helped us get into position that we can help re-grow the business, that can provide the economic value back to Wales,"" he said. The Welsh government wrote off Â£42.6m of airport debt in March this year and also gave it a five year recovery grant of Â£42.6m. The airport's value has also dropped by more than two thirds The airport's passenger numbers were down by 90% in August 2021, making it the second-lowest number in the UK. Its value has also dropped by more than two thirds. Mr Birns said that recovery had been slow ""primarily because people have been encouraged not to travel overseas this year"". Fifteen destinations are currently up and running, but prior to the pandemic there were 52. Next year, Wizz air will start running out of Cardiff, while TUI will increase the number of flights from the airport. The Welsh government bought the airport in 2013 for Â£52m and has since invested more than Â£130m of taxpayers' money into it. It's run at arm's length by an independent company HoldCo and before Covid it had seen significant growth in passenger numbers. Welsh Conservative MS Natasha Asghar says the Welsh government should sell the airport But the Welsh Conservatives' transport and technology spokeswoman Natasha Asghar MS said funding the airport was ""pumping"" taxpayer money into an ""empty pit"". ""I would say cut your losses and sell it, accept what's happened and spend that money on other things more important and a priority to the people of Wales right now,"" she said. Despite airport debt totalling Â£27.2m in May, Mr Birns said the business contributes to the Welsh economy through employing 2,500 people. He said that in normal times it generates more than Â£240m a year in revenue. Wizz air will start running out of Cardiff next year CBI Wales, which represents Welsh businesses, said having a Welsh airport would encourage international investment coming out of the pandemic. It would ""disadvantage"" Wales and be ""odd"" to not have one, CBI Wales' director Ian Price said. Last month, the UK government announced flight tax Air Passenger Duty would be halved for domestic journeys from April 2023 to boost the sector and develop better UK travel links. But Mr Birns questioned how helpful that would be. ""Why is the UK government waiting 18 months to do this?,"" he said. ""If they're talking about economic stimulation for connectivity to the regions, what's stopping them doing it tomorrow?"" The UK government said they have ""announced reforms and rates over 12 months in advance to provide airlines with sufficient notice and to acknowledge the length of airline booking cycles"". Meanwhile, longer-term concerns have been raised about the ownership of the airport. While the Welsh government committed to net zero by 2050, its own plans say that in future flights will be one of the biggest remaining carbon emitters. Professor Calvin Jones, an economist at Cardiff University's business school, questioned how compatible owning an airport was with tackling a climate emergency. ""They have something that probably don't know what to do with now,"" he said. ""I think that the right thing to do is just have some strategy where you wind the airport down. ""As soon as you take that on the chin and start to think about what we might do with this potentially valuable piece of land in a genuinely zero carbon way, then some good ideas might arise."" The Welsh government said it was committed to maintaining an airport in Wales ""while recognising the challenges this creates for meeting our targets on decarbonisation"".

BA suspends Hong Kong flights amid crew quarantine,"British Airways has suspended flights to Hong Kong amid reports more of its crew members have been forced to quarantine in a government centre. BA confirmed it has temporarily stopped flights ""while we review operational requirements for this route"". The South China Morning Post reported,externalthat one BA worker had tested positive for Covid, leading to most crew members being sent to the quarantine camp. It follows a similar incident the week before. In that case, a BA crew member tested positive for the virus on 20 November. The employee and other crew, classed as ""close contact"", were sent to Hong Kong's Penny's Bay quarantine centre. A spokesman for Hong Kong's Department of Health told the South China Morning Post that those crew members had since returned to the UK. It comes amid concern over the new Covid variant, Omicron - cases of which have been discovered in a number of places including the UK and Hong Kong. Which countries are on the red list? How are England's Covid rules changing? What Covid rules do holiday destinations have? Commenting on the most recent measures against its crew, BA said: ""We're supporting crew who are currently isolating in Hong Kong. ""We work within local regulations for every country we fly to, and always put the safety and wellbeing of our teams and customers at the heart of everything we do."" Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline has been forced to cancel some passenger flights in December due to staff shortages. The airline operates a ""closed loop"" system which means airline crew, working on three week shifts, must stay in their hotel rooms between flights before going into a 14-day quarantine when they return home. Hong Kong is pursuing a zero-Covid cases policy in order to open the border with mainland China. BA said: ""We apologise to our customers who have had their travel plans disrupted and will be in touch to give them options."" The Hong Kong government's quarantine centre in Penny's Bay The BA suspension of Hong Kong flights follows the temporary stoppage of air travel to six southern African counties following the discovery of the Omicron variant. Both BA and Virgin Atlantic cancelled flights between midday on Friday and 04:00 on Sunday after the government temporarily banned travel from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini. Those countries were added to the UK's travel red list at 04:00 on Sundayalong with Angola, Namibia, Mozambique and Zambia. People arriving from these countries will not be able to enter unless they are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents. Travellers will then have to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked government-approved hotel for 10 days. The government has also announced that arrivals to the UK will need to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival, and isolate until they get a negative result. The changes are expected to come into force on Tuesday. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the measure will come into force from 04:00 on Tuesday, 30 November Omicron has been called a ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization and it is not yet clear if the variant is resistant to existing vaccines or how transmissible it is. New Covid variant: Will new measures against Omicron work? A spokesperson for ABTA, the travel industry trade body, said that it ""understands that this is a rapidly evolving situation and public health must come first"". But it added: ""The decision to require all arrivals to take a PCR test and self-isolate until a negative result is returned is a huge blow for travel businesses, many of whom were only just starting to get back on their feet after 20 months of severe restrictions."" On Friday, shares in airlines such and IAG, BA's parent company, and EasyJet, as well as holiday companies Carnival and TUI, tumbled at the emergence of the new Covid strain. Stock markets across the world also fell on concerns Omicron could hamper economic recovery. By Caroline Davies, BBC business correspondent Travel companies have spent Saturday evening and Sunday fielding calls from worried customers around the world, trying to establish whether they need a PCR test when they arrive in the UK next week. Many in the industry are frustrated that the policy was announced without giving the date for when it would come in, giving them little information to pass on to their passengers. There are concerns too for bookings, with one industry official saying 'this just turns off the tap' with the public less confident to book trips abroad. It's not only the travel industry who are concerned. Hospitality is worried that the changes might affect the confidence of consumers in the all important build up to Christmas too. Holiday bookings often drop at this time of year, but January bookings for the summer are crucial. Until the government review of the measures in three weeks' time, the industry feels in limbo. ABTA said the decision to require airline passengers to take a PCR test on day two of arrival should be kept under careful review with measures lifted quickly ""if it becomes clear there is not a risk to the UK vaccination programme"". It added: ""The government must also now consider offering tailored support for travel businesses, which have been among the hardest hit during the pandemic."" Since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, airlines including Ryanair, EasyJet and BA, have cut thousands of jobs. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for planes, announced last year that it would axe 9,000 people from its workforce.

Netherlands further tightens Covid lockdown,"Cafes, museums, and cinemas across the Netherlands must now be closed between 17:00 and 05:00 local time (16:00-04:00 GMT) Tighter restrictions have come into force in the Netherlands, amid record Covid cases and concerns over the new Omicron variant. For at least the next three weeks, hospitality and cultural venues such as cafes, museums, and cinemas must close by 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT). The authorities consider the measures critical to protect the country's hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. Meanwhile, some 61 people are currently being tested for the new variant. They all have recently arrived on two KLM flights from South Africa, where Omicron was detected earlier this month. The passengers tested positive for Covid-19 and have been quarantined at a hotel near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport while they undergo further tests, Dutch officials said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said variant is ""of concern"", with early evidence suggesting a higher re-infection risk. A number of countries around the world have now banned flights to and from South Africa and several neighbouring nations. South Africans fear impact of new variant measures How worrying is the new Covid variant? Three weeks of restrictions for shops, sport and catering were announced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte earlier this month. The Netherlands has a shortage of intensive care beds, operations are being cancelled and hundreds of people are dying of Covid every week, the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague reports. More than 22,000 new daily cases were reported on Friday, and the new rules are designed to bring the record-high infection rate under control, our correspondent says. The Dutch government has published the full list of the restrictions,,externalwhich state that: Non-essential shops must be shut between 17:00 and 05:00 local time The 17:00 closure applies to cinemas, theatres, and saunas as well as ""contact professions"" Supermarkets, chemists and wholesalers must be closed between 20:00 and 05:00 Indoor and outdoor sport facilities must close at 17:00 But evening training sessions and sports matches for professional athletes may continue A maximum of four guests aged over 13 are allowed at people's homes As many people should work from home as possible During the lockdown, nurseries, schools and universities across the country will stay open. Thousands of protesters took to the streets shortly after the government made the lockdown announcement. In The Hague, police used water cannon to disperse the crowds. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Dutch catering industry told public broadcaster NOS that the government had ""crossed a line"".

Travel and mask rules tightened over new variant,"This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson set out new measures after two cases of the Omicron variant were found in the UK Face coverings will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England from next week as part of measures to target the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, the PM has said. PCR tests for everyone entering the UK will be introduced and all contacts of new variant cases will have to self-isolate, even if fully jabbed. But Boris Johnson said Christmas would be ""considerably better"" than in 2020. The measures were ""temporary and precautionary"", he added. Mr Johnson announced the restrictions at a Downing Street news conference after it was confirmed that twoOmicron cases had been detected in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham. Officials said the cases were linked and connected to travel in southern Africa. How are England's Covid rules changing because of Omicron? How are masks rules being tightened? The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it? The new variant was first reported from South Africa on Wednesday, with early evidence suggesting it has a higher reinfection risk. Mr Johnson said: ""Our scientists are learning more hour by hour, and it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly and can be spread between people who are double vaccinated."" He added: ""We need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant rather than stop it all together."" The prime minister said the new measures would be reviewed in three weeks, by which time they should have better information about the ""continuing effectiveness"" of vaccines. The prime minister said the ""tightening up"" of the mask rules will be outlined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid ""in the next day or so"". He did not indicate when PCR tests would begin and in a press release the Department of Health only said it was among the measures being ""introduced from next week"". This video can not be played Watch the BBC's Iain Watson ask the prime minister whether people can keep their Christmas plans Covid restrictions were tightened across the UK days before Christmas last year amid a surge in cases. Asked by the BBC's Iain Watson if the prime minister could say with any confidence whether or not people could keep their Christmas plans this year, Mr Johnson replied: ""We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout, and... I'm pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas."" Countries around the world are introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. Under the plans: Everyone entering the UK (other than those coming from the Common Travel Area that covers the Channel Islands and Ireland) will have to take PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate, regardless of whether or not they are fully jabbed Face coverings will be made compulsory in shops and on public transport - but hospitality settings will be exempt from the changes The health secretary is to ask advisers to consider rapidly extending boosters, including reducing the gap between the second dose of the vaccine and the booster The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a ""reasonable chance"" that vaccines could be less effective against the new variant but stressed people who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. He said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation would now need to decide whether to extend the booster vaccine down to adults age 18, and whether a second dose should be offered to children aged 12-15. Do we need new vaccines yet? How worrying is the new Covid variant? The reintroduction of masks in shops and public transportbrings England back into line with the other UK nations. Paddy Lillis from the shopworkers' union Usdaw accused ministers of ""flip-flopping on basic and sensible Covid measures"" and said the face covering rules should have been kept in place when restrictions were relaxed in July. ""Retail staff working with the public every day are deeply worried about catching Covid-19 and the arrival of the Omicron variant is a further concern,"" he said. Carol Popplestone, chairwoman of the Royal College of Nursing, said face coverings were ""something we have already called for and it should not have been a new variant that forced the prime minister to act"". This is a moment the government had wanted to avoid. We've got used to restrictions in England being lifted. But for the first time in months, they're now being re-imposed in response to the new variant. And these restrictions could have a significant impact. For example, anyone who goes on holiday will now need to pay for a PCR test and self-isolate until they get a negative result. If Omicron spreads quickly, there could be a lot of people forced to self-isolate for 10 days as close contacts. But the government hasn't gone for its full plan B. Masks won't be mandatory in hospitality settings in England like they are in Scotland and Wales. People aren't being told to work from home - and there still aren't plans for vaccine passports. But it's a sign of the uncertainty and concern in Whitehall that Boris Johnson felt he had to announce these measures. Both the UK cases of the Omicron variant and their households are self-isolating.  Additional testing is being carried out at locations where those people were likely to have been infectious. ""Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary,"" the Department of Health said. Ten countries - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia - are now on theUK's travel red listmeaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Other countries are also introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. The average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. Afurther 39,567 confirmed cases were announced on Saturday.

Customers spend second night snowed-in at pubDozens of people are still unable to leave the Tan Hill Inn due to heavy snowfall.York & North Yorkshire,"The Tan Hill Inn is known for getting cut off in heavy snowfall because of its location Dozens of customers at Britain's highest pub are set to spend a third night trapped by heavy snowfall brought by Storm Arwen. Guests got stuck at the Tan Hill Inn, in the Yorkshire Dales, on Friday after going to watch an Oasis tribute band. They are unable to leave because nearby roads are not useable partly due to fallen power cables. Manager Nicola Townsend said everyone was in good spirits and that some people did not want leave. Guests at the inn, which is 1,732ft (528m) above sea level, woke up to about 3ft (0.9m) of snow on Saturday, with it going all the way up near to the bedroom windows. Guests have been kept entertained with activties including a quiz A tunnel has since been dug out of the front door of the pub, but because of damage to power cables the roads are unusable. Ms Townsend said 61 people had so far spent two nights there, with many, including members of the band, having to set up camp in the pub's lounge. She said 40 were pre-booked guests while others had gone to the pub for a drink on Friday. The listed inn is about five miles from the village of Keld in Swaledale She added: ""It's just been a lovely and everyone is in really good spirits. ""They've formed quite a friendship, like a big family is the best way I can describe it. ""One lady actually said 'I don't want to leave'."" She said staff had put on activities to keep people entertained, including a quiz and board games and that a karaoke evening was planned for later. The manager added that mountain rescuers had made it through the snow to attend to one guest who needed medical attention for an ongoing issue. Mountain rescue have been able to get up to the inn One of the guests, Martin Overton, said the atmosphere was ""very good"" with ""plenty of beer available"".

Patel not included in Calais migrant crisis talks,"Home Secretary Priti Patel has warned that failure by European politicians to co-operate on the continent's migrant crisis will lead to ""even worse scenes"" in the English Channel this winter. France is hosting German, Belgian and Dutch ministers and European Commission officials for talks. Ms Patel was disinvited from the summit after a row between Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron. Labour accused them of ""engaging in a blame game while children drown"". On Wednesday,27 people died as they headed for the UK from France.Their boat sank in the Channel. The International Organization for Migrations said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014. Their deaths have raised questions about why so many people are attempting the journey despite the dangerous conditions, and how to tackle the problem. The home secretary vowed to ""continue to push"" for improvements to tackle the crisis. And Ms Patel said she would be holding ""urgent talks with my European counterparts"" later this week ""to prevent further tragedies in the Channel"". On Sunday, she spoke to the Dutch minister for migration, Ankie Broekers-Knol. The Home Office said the pair agreed on the need to tackle the criminal gangs organising the crossings and on the importance of agreements for returning migrants to European countries. Channel deaths: What do we know so far? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Calais activists: Migrants call us from boats asking for help On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson publicly shared a letter he had sent to the French president on how to deal with the current situation. In it he set out five steps - joint patrols of the Channel, better use of technology such as sensors and radar, maritime patrols in each other's waters, stronger co-operation by intelligence services and negotiation on a policy of returning migrants who reach the UK to France This letter angered Mr Macron and according to the French government, it demonstrated ""double talk"" from the UK. This resentment from Paris led to the home secretary's invitation being revoked. However the UK government said that even if the home secretary did not attend Sunday's meeting in Calais, British officials would be there. In light of the Franco-British tensions, Ms Patel said: ""The UK cannot tackle this issue alone, and across Europe we all need to step up, take responsibility, and work together in a time of crisis."" She added: ""We will not shy away from the challenge we face, and next week I will continue to push for greater co-operation with European partners because a failure to do so could result in even worse scenes in the freezing water during the coming winter months."" Ms Patel said the conversations she had had on Thursday with her French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, had been ""constructive"". Speaking to Sky News, Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said it was ""unconscionable"" that France and the UK government were ""engaging in a blame game while children drown off our coastline"". She said her party would work with international partners to ""open up safe and legal routes"" for refugees in order ""to pull the rug out from under the business model that these smugglers currently rely on"". For several years, people smugglers have sent migrants to the UK in lorries. Although this route is safer than small boats, there have also been tragedies, including the 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in 2019. However, the security at the Port of Calais in France - where UK border controls operate - has been tightened. This has meant that more attempts are being made to send people by boat, according to Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force. So far this year, the number of people crossing the channel in small boats has far exceeded previous years. Asylum claims to UKare at their highest since 2004,according to official estimates. However, other countries in Europe are also processing a high amount of asylum applications. Many people fleeing conflict zones already choose to make an asylum claim in the first country they arrive in - such as Greece, Turkey or Italy - and only a minority choose to travel on to the UK. Last year, Germany had the highest number of asylum applicants in the EU (122,015 applicants), while France had 93,475 applicants. In the same period, the UK received the fifth largest number of applicants (36,041) when compared with countries in the EU (around 7% of the total). This represents the 17th largest intake when measured per head of population, according to UN Refugee Agency.

An SP Energy Networks spokesman said: ""The time it is taking us to get our customers back on is reflective of the number of faults and severity of the damage to the network. ""Where normally we would deal with one or two faults on a line and be able to get a number of customers on we've got several faults on one line and where this is repaired we're only able to restore power to a small handful of customers."" A damaged power line on Craigash Farm, Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire Ch Supt George Macdonald of Police Scotland's north east division confirmed a major incident was declared due to the scale of the power outages and the impact it was having on people. He said: ""It is clear that, despite the best efforts of all involved, some parts of the area could take up to another 36 to 48 hours to recover and get back to normal in terms of power and water supplies, and other essential services. ""Therefore, we will be working hard to get back to normal and officers from Police Scotland are providing additional patrols in areas worst affected.""

We are not as bad as some people."" Meanwhile, tree surgeon Nick Dearden arrived in Kintore from Southampton on Sunday to help with recovery work. He joked: ""We have been told that we expect to see Armageddon."" Over the next week he expects to be kept busy in Aberdeenshire, Inverness and Edinburgh.

The cafÃ© also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a warming drink or a bite to eat. ""There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,"" he added BBC Scotland reporter Steven Duff toldThe Sunday Showproblems with mobile phone coverage have left many people isolated and unable to contact their loved ones. He added: ""There is still a lot of WiFi down, mobile phone coverage is down. Nowadays that's a big thing for people. There's been lots of social media chat of people trying to get in touch with relatives. ""I had one tweet today from someone who said they had finally managed to get in touch with their parents in Ballater this morning to tell them that a care centre had been opened there."" Aberdeenshire Council has urged people to stay at home and keep an eye on vulnerable and elderly neighbours. A spokesman said: ""Alongside our partners we are doing all we can to restore power, provide food and water, and clear debris from our roads and anything else that helps our communities through this challenging weather. ""We would urge people to not travel unless their journey is essential. If you are venturing out please check Travel Scotland, make sure you have enough fuel and your mobile phone is charged fully.""

New rules to be set out amid Covid variant concern,"This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson set out new measures after two cases of the Omicron variant were found in the UK Face coverings will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England from next week as part of measures to target the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, the PM has said. PCR tests for everyone entering the UK will be introduced and all contacts of new variant cases will have to self-isolate, even if fully jabbed. But Boris Johnson said Christmas would be ""considerably better"" than in 2020. The measures were ""temporary and precautionary"", he added. Mr Johnson announced the restrictions at a Downing Street news conference after it was confirmed that twoOmicron cases had been detected in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham. Officials said the cases were linked and connected to travel in southern Africa. How are England's Covid rules changing because of Omicron? How are masks rules being tightened? The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it? The new variant was first reported from South Africa on Wednesday, with early evidence suggesting it has a higher reinfection risk. Mr Johnson said: ""Our scientists are learning more hour by hour, and it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly and can be spread between people who are double vaccinated."" He added: ""We need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant rather than stop it all together."" The prime minister said the new measures would be reviewed in three weeks, by which time they should have better information about the ""continuing effectiveness"" of vaccines. The prime minister said the ""tightening up"" of the mask rules will be outlined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid ""in the next day or so"". He did not indicate when PCR tests would begin and in a press release the Department of Health only said it was among the measures being ""introduced from next week"". This video can not be played Watch the BBC's Iain Watson ask the prime minister whether people can keep their Christmas plans Covid restrictions were tightened across the UK days before Christmas last year amid a surge in cases. Asked by the BBC's Iain Watson if the prime minister could say with any confidence whether or not people could keep their Christmas plans this year, Mr Johnson replied: ""We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout, and... I'm pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas."" Countries around the world are introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. Under the plans: Everyone entering the UK (other than those coming from the Common Travel Area that covers the Channel Islands and Ireland) will have to take PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate, regardless of whether or not they are fully jabbed Face coverings will be made compulsory in shops and on public transport - but hospitality settings will be exempt from the changes The health secretary is to ask advisers to consider rapidly extending boosters, including reducing the gap between the second dose of the vaccine and the booster The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a ""reasonable chance"" that vaccines could be less effective against the new variant but stressed people who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. He said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation would now need to decide whether to extend the booster vaccine down to adults age 18, and whether a second dose should be offered to children aged 12-15. Do we need new vaccines yet? How worrying is the new Covid variant? The reintroduction of masks in shops and public transportbrings England back into line with the other UK nations. Paddy Lillis from the shopworkers' union Usdaw accused ministers of ""flip-flopping on basic and sensible Covid measures"" and said the face covering rules should have been kept in place when restrictions were relaxed in July. ""Retail staff working with the public every day are deeply worried about catching Covid-19 and the arrival of the Omicron variant is a further concern,"" he said. Carol Popplestone, chairwoman of the Royal College of Nursing, said face coverings were ""something we have already called for and it should not have been a new variant that forced the prime minister to act"". This is a moment the government had wanted to avoid. We've got used to restrictions in England being lifted. But for the first time in months, they're now being re-imposed in response to the new variant. And these restrictions could have a significant impact. For example, anyone who goes on holiday will now need to pay for a PCR test and self-isolate until they get a negative result. If Omicron spreads quickly, there could be a lot of people forced to self-isolate for 10 days as close contacts. But the government hasn't gone for its full plan B. Masks won't be mandatory in hospitality settings in England like they are in Scotland and Wales. People aren't being told to work from home - and there still aren't plans for vaccine passports. But it's a sign of the uncertainty and concern in Whitehall that Boris Johnson felt he had to announce these measures. Both the UK cases of the Omicron variant and their households are self-isolating.  Additional testing is being carried out at locations where those people were likely to have been infectious. ""Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary,"" the Department of Health said. Ten countries - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia - are now on theUK's travel red listmeaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Other countries are also introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. The average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. Afurther 39,567 confirmed cases were announced on Saturday.

Naomi Campbell's charity 'co-operating' with probe,"The charity raised money by hosting various events including shows which saw celebrities and models strut down the catwalk Naomi Campbell's fashion charity says it is fully co-operating with an investigation into concerns relating to its management and finances. The south London supermodel created Fashion for Relief (FFR) in 2005 to raise funds for children living in poverty and adversity. It says it has raised millions of pounds for good causes. The Charity Commission said FFR had previously been subjected to a compliance investigation. During that case, which opened in September 2020, the Commission identified a range of regulatory concerns relating to the governance and finances of the charity. This included the charity's consistent late filing of accounts and lack of evidence to show that conflicts of interest were being managed, it said. In March this year, the Commission issued the trustees with an action plan, aimed at improving the charity's financial management. The supermodel is one of the charity's trustees Following a review of the charity's response to the action plan, the regulator identified further concerns in the charity's financial management and governance to explore. As a result, the Commission escalated its engagement with the charity to an inquiry, which will examine: whether those in control of the charity have properly exercised their legal duties and responsibilities under charity law the financial management of the charity, including payments made to a trustee for services provided to the charity and the level of charitable expenditure the governance and management of the charity by the trustees including the failure to file statutory returns on time whether there has been misconduct and/ or mismanagement by those in control of the charity A spokesperson for FFR said it hoped to ""conclude the regulatory engagement with the Commission as swiftly as possible"" and added it had asked for an extension to the deadline as it had not been able to hold any events or undertake any fundraising activity for two years due to the pandemic. ""Any suggestion of wrongdoing or misconduct on the part of the trustees is untrue and denied,"" the statement added. It said FFR was not solely a fundraising charity, and instead held events to help encourage donations to other charities and good causes. ""Each of our events has been held for the benefit of a third party charity. At each event, all donations and pledges are made directly to the third party charity,"" it said.

"Cardiff Airport would not be alive without bailoutAirport boss Spencer Birns says the business could ""provide the economic value back to Wales"".","Cardiff Airport was bought by the Welsh Government in 2013 Cardiff Airport would not have stayed alive without an Â£85m bailout from the Welsh government during Covid, its boss says. Chief executive Spencer Birns said despite a slow recovery, it could ""provide the economic value back to Wales"". But the Welsh Conservatives said the Welsh government should sell it. The Welsh government said it was committed to the airport because of the benefits it brings the Welsh economy. More public money for Covid-hit Cardiff Airport Cardiff Airport passenger numbers drop to 1950s levels Mr Birns said the the bailout had ""given us the framework to stay alive"". ""They've helped us get into position that we can help re-grow the business, that can provide the economic value back to Wales,"" he said. The Welsh government wrote off Â£42.6m of airport debt in March this year and also gave it a five year recovery grant of Â£42.6m. The airport's value has also dropped by more than two thirds The airport's passenger numbers were down by 90% in August 2021, making it the second-lowest number in the UK. Its value has also dropped by more than two thirds. Mr Birns said that recovery had been slow ""primarily because people have been encouraged not to travel overseas this year"". Fifteen destinations are currently up and running, but prior to the pandemic there were 52. Next year, Wizz air will start running out of Cardiff, while TUI will increase the number of flights from the airport. The Welsh government bought the airport in 2013 for Â£52m and has since invested more than Â£130m of taxpayers' money into it. It's run at arm's length by an independent company HoldCo and before Covid it had seen significant growth in passenger numbers. Welsh Conservative MS Natasha Asghar says the Welsh government should sell the airport But the Welsh Conservatives' transport and technology spokeswoman Natasha Asghar MS said funding the airport was ""pumping"" taxpayer money into an ""empty pit"". ""I would say cut your losses and sell it, accept what's happened and spend that money on other things more important and a priority to the people of Wales right now,"" she said. Despite airport debt totalling Â£27.2m in May, Mr Birns said the business contributes to the Welsh economy through employing 2,500 people. He said that in normal times it generates more than Â£240m a year in revenue. Wizz air will start running out of Cardiff next year CBI Wales, which represents Welsh businesses, said having a Welsh airport would encourage international investment coming out of the pandemic. It would ""disadvantage"" Wales and be ""odd"" to not have one, CBI Wales' director Ian Price said. Last month, the UK government announced flight tax Air Passenger Duty would be halved for domestic journeys from April 2023 to boost the sector and develop better UK travel links. But Mr Birns questioned how helpful that would be. ""Why is the UK government waiting 18 months to do this?,"" he said. ""If they're talking about economic stimulation for connectivity to the regions, what's stopping them doing it tomorrow?"" The UK government said they have ""announced reforms and rates over 12 months in advance to provide airlines with sufficient notice and to acknowledge the length of airline booking cycles"". Meanwhile, longer-term concerns have been raised about the ownership of the airport. While the Welsh government committed to net zero by 2050, its own plans say that in future flights will be one of the biggest remaining carbon emitters. Professor Calvin Jones, an economist at Cardiff University's business school, questioned how compatible owning an airport was with tackling a climate emergency. ""They have something that probably don't know what to do with now,"" he said. ""I think that the right thing to do is just have some strategy where you wind the airport down. ""As soon as you take that on the chin and start to think about what we might do with this potentially valuable piece of land in a genuinely zero carbon way, then some good ideas might arise."" The Welsh government said it was committed to maintaining an airport in Wales ""while recognising the challenges this creates for meeting our targets on decarbonisation"".

Netherlands enters partial Covid lockdown,"Cafes, museums, and cinemas across the Netherlands must now be closed between 17:00 and 05:00 local time (16:00-04:00 GMT) Tighter restrictions have come into force in the Netherlands, amid record Covid cases and concerns over the new Omicron variant. For at least the next three weeks, hospitality and cultural venues such as cafes, museums, and cinemas must close by 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT). The authorities consider the measures critical to protect the country's hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. Meanwhile, some 61 people are currently being tested for the new variant. They all have recently arrived on two KLM flights from South Africa, where Omicron was detected earlier this month. The passengers tested positive for Covid-19 and have been quarantined at a hotel near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport while they undergo further tests, Dutch officials said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said variant is ""of concern"", with early evidence suggesting a higher re-infection risk. A number of countries around the world have now banned flights to and from South Africa and several neighbouring nations. South Africans fear impact of new variant measures How worrying is the new Covid variant? Three weeks of restrictions for shops, sport and catering were announced by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte earlier this month. The Netherlands has a shortage of intensive care beds, operations are being cancelled and hundreds of people are dying of Covid every week, the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague reports. More than 22,000 new daily cases were reported on Friday, and the new rules are designed to bring the record-high infection rate under control, our correspondent says. The Dutch government has published the full list of the restrictions,,externalwhich state that: Non-essential shops must be shut between 17:00 and 05:00 local time The 17:00 closure applies to cinemas, theatres, and saunas as well as ""contact professions"" Supermarkets, chemists and wholesalers must be closed between 20:00 and 05:00 Indoor and outdoor sport facilities must close at 17:00 But evening training sessions and sports matches for professional athletes may continue A maximum of four guests aged over 13 are allowed at people's homes As many people should work from home as possible During the lockdown, nurseries, schools and universities across the country will stay open.
